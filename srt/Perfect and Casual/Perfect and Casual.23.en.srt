[Episode 23]

4
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,500
I've read about the treatment
in The Lancet.

5
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,160
But it's still undergoing clinical trials.

6
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,530
Official sanction has not yet been
given by relevant drug administrations.

7
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,890
Only the leading experts

8
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:21,910
of foreign clinics

9
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,390
get the prescription right.

10
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:24,490
Dr. Zhang,

11
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,040
how is the efficacy?

12
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,220
According to

13
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,860
the current clinical trial data revealed,

14
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,460
its efficacy is evident.

15
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,110
But most of the cured

16
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,990
were stage-III or earlier-stage patients

17
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,450
so there are limited data

18
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:39,940
of stage-IV patients
like your grandfather.

19
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,350
So,

20
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:46,960
what do you think?

21
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,160
It deserves a try.

22
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,140
To say the least,

23
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,050
though he can't totally recover,

24
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,280
his life can be prolonged.

25
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,000
It's still promising.

[You want to decline it?]

27
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,310
Yun Shu,

28
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,650
even experienced illustrators

29
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,770
are eager for this chance.

30
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,010
You are really lucky to have
this opportunity as a newbie.

31
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,540
So give it careful thought.

32
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,510
Mei,

33
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,960
I've made up my mind.

34
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,750
Do you know what you are giving up?

35
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:22,090
Of course, if you don't go
to Kobayashi Studio,

36
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,510
you can still be a cartoonist in China.

37
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,170
But if you go to Kobayashi Studio,

38
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,390
you may get some unexpected gains.

39
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,230
Something that you may
never get at home.

40
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,420
But...

41
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,640
I can't leave behind

42
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:36,010
those I love and

43
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,190
those who love me.

44
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,380
Forget it.

45
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,240
It doesn't matter what I say.

46
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,610
You're going to have
your final defense, right?

47
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,670
A week later.

48
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,000
Well,

49
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:48,720
don't decline me right away.

50
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,790
We can talk after your graduation.

51
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,760
What do you think?

52
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,270
Thanks, Mei.

53
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,250
I'll get back to work.

54
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,520
Go ahead.

Yun Shu.

56
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,370
If you need my help
with your family affairs,

57
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,340
just let me know.

58
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:14,270
I got rid of Lu Yu today

59
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,380
in order to talk with you alone.

60
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:17,870
Is it about Han Rong?

61
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:20,040
Yes.

62
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,270
Lu Yu doesn't want me to
get involved.

63
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:23,690
He will figure it out.

64
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,550
I won't come today

65
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,230
if he can work it out.

66
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:28,550
Guess what?

67
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,640
Lu Yu has been sidelined by the company.

68
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,530
If the lawsuit is not settled,

69
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,430
his career will be ruined.

Lan,

71
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,970
Mr. Han is here and wants to see you.

72
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,190
Tell him

73
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,490
to come in in 10 minutes.

74
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:43,659
I will go.

75
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,740
Don't worry.

76
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:45,900
I'll figure it out.

77
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,450
I heard from Mr. Liu

78
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,940
that you're resigning
as our company's legal advisor.

79
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:20,910
Yes.

80
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,140
I think I'm not fit for it.

81
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:26,010
You need a more competent advisor, Mr. Han.

82
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:27,490
But I only trust you.

83
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,990
Trust should be mutual.

84
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,120
It can't be forced.

85
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,870
What if I insist for you to continue?

86
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,780
You must know about what happened

87
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:40,070
between Lu Yu and me.

88
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,200
If you can continue to be

89
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,310
our legal advisor,

90
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,909
maybe I can

91
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,140
cut him some slack.

92
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,200
Mr. Han,

93
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,470
are you threatening me?

94
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,000
According to Article 226

95
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,520
of the Chinese Criminal Law,

96
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,720
one can be penalized

97
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,290
for forcing others to provide services

98
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,230
or to receive services

99
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,210
by threatening.

100
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,660
It's not a threat.

101
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,660
It's a compromise.

102
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,170
This USD stick contains

103
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,590
the footage of what happened that day.

104
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,290
It clearly shows Lu Yu and his action.

105
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:15,700
It also contains
the injury assessment done by

106
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,830
a professional institution.

107
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:19,810
Lu Yu will

108
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,520
lose in this case.

109
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,390
Now you're underestimating me.

110
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,070
I never look down on women,

111
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,300
let alone you.

112
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,080
I don't know the
entertainment industry well.

113
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,630
But I know people

114
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:36,000
will gossip in this circle.

115
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:46,670
The project has gotten the green light.

116
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,250
I'll go abroad

117
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,650
very soon.

118
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,630
Congratulations.

119
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:52,550
Also,

120
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,080
have a safe trip.

121
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,340
You've made up your mind?

122
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:00,880
Will you take grandpa
to get treatment abroad?

123
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,160
Grandpa is not in a good shape.

124
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,770
So I'm not sure

125
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:06,570
whether he can bear the

126
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,970
long journey.

127
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:13,200
Are you just caring about grandpa?

128
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:17,540
What do you mean?

129
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,660
I think you can't leave Yun Shu behind

130
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,540
and you don't want to part with her.

131
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:24,250
You think too much.

132
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,830
Though we're not in love,

133
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,800
you have to admit that

134
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:37,120
we're alike.

135
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:40,010
I can understand your hesitation.

136
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,730
But this chance

137
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:44,320
is grandpa's last hope.

138
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,870
I won't give up my grandpa.

139
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,090
This is my first time reading
such a thesis.

140
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,000
Is it not good enough?

141
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,980
It must be because you didn't do well,

142
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,330
so you stapled the four corners to

143
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,560
prevent me from reading it.

144
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:33,929
I... I'll open it.

145
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,460
Yun Shu,

146
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:46,110
what's wrong?

147
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,650
Why are you uneasy?

148
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:55,400
I've been thinking about

149
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,850
grandpa recently.

150
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,540
So,

151
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,270
I can't calm down.

152
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,390
Grandpa will be okay.

153
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,900
Rest assured.

154
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,390
I still think that

155
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,410
we should send grandpa overseas.

156
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,160
Maybe it's a slim hope,

157
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,140
but we shouldn't give it up.

158
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,900
You're going to have your final defense.

159
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:35,670
So forget about that first.

160
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,560
Be ready for your final defense.

161
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,310
As for grandpa's illness,

162
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:43,170
we'll find a better solution.

163
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,170
I'll pass my defense

164
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,980
with excellence.

165
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:53,560
Just don't be late.

166
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:15,670
What are you looking at?

167
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,810
You're preoccupied.

168
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,920
Nothing special.

169
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,100
Some documents.

170
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,870
You gave up your diet?

171
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,500
Why do you eat so much junk food?

172
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:29,380
I can't be on diet every day.

173
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:30,980
What's the point of life then?

174
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:32,600
How about the law office?

175
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,050
You haven't been coming.

176
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,490
Are you giving up?

177
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:36,980
No.

178
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,180
The play I signed before

179
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,880
has some financial problem.

180
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,010
It is temporarily suspended.

181
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,030
Really?

182
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,210
What's going on?

183
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,440
Why are you so suspicious?

184
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,200
What is it?

185
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,920
[We're going to have a face-to-face
talk with Han Rong tomorrow.]

186
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:52,920
[At 2 p.m.]

187
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,180
Okay, got it.

188
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,320
[Don't worry.]

189
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:58,610
What's going on?

190
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,580
Nothing.

191
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,570
Okay, I got it.

192
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,800
Mr. Zhang.

193
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,520
I knew it.

194
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:47,910
It wouldn't be smooth sailing.

195
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,440
Why?

196
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:51,420
It's law of the nature.

197
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:55,930
Let's go.

198
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,490
♫ You're a familiar stranger ♫

199
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,720
♫ Who keeps appearing before me ♫

200
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,000
♫ You're clumsy yet kind ♫

201
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,560
♫ Ringing the bell in my heart ♫

202
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:15,420
♫ You predict and plan ♫

203
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:18,080
♫ But you can't solve the problem
called love ♫

204
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,890
♫ Let me tell you, just hold my hand ♫

205
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:27,520
♫ Looking up, I see
the most perfect you ♫

206
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:28,070
Let's go.

207
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:28,710
Let's go.

208
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:29,680
♫ Close your eyes and feel me out,
the plain girl ♫

209
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,430
Mr. Zhang!

210
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:31,980
You can do it!

211
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:32,380
You can do it!

212
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,050
You can do it!

213
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,450
Go get it, Mr. Zhang!

214
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,580
Go for it.

215
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:36,430
Mr. Zhang.

216
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:36,850
Mr. Zhang.

217
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:41,320
♫ You're here with me
as time passes us by ♫

218
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,860
Hello, teachers.

219
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:44,810
I'm sorry.

220
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,960
I got held up on the way.

221
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,090
I'm sorry.

222
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:49,860
I delayed a little time on my way.

223
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,040
I'll start my oral defense now.

224
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,400
Excuse me.

225
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:56,600
You've forfeited your defense.

226
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,460
Because you're late.

227
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,210
I shall now

228
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,400
start my oral defense.

229
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:07,010
My thesis is titled

230
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,700
the Analysis on the Restructure
of Statistics in Big Data Era.

231
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,440
To begin with, I'll discuss this

232
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:13,220
topic in 4 aspects,

233
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:15,710
from opportunities,
challenges and strategies...

234

♫ Close your eyes and feel me out,
the plain girl ♫

236
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,880
♫ Time is ticking, too much romance
is is left behind ♫

237
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,640
♫ You're here with me

238
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,730
You're late, Yun Lan.

239
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,860
Come on.

240
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,780
Sit over here.

241
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,280
Yun Lan.

242
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,690
What's going on?

243
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:49,850
Yun Lan

244
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,660
is my attorney.

245
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,810
Okay. Since we're all here,
let's get it started.

246
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,230
What on earth is going on?

247
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,330
Why are you this scum's attorney?

248
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,020
Yun Lan.

249
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,510
Add libel to his list of offence.

250
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,590
Shut up.

251
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,660
Explain it.

252
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,220
Let's get down to business.

253
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,660
We can talk later.

254
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,000
No, tell me now.

255
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,530
Yun Lan is our company's legal advisor.

256
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,080
So there's nothing wrong with her

257
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,890
being my attorney.

258
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:22,450
Hold on.

259
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,060
Don't be so impulsive.

260
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,240
I'm not impulsive.

261
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,690
I just want to ask you one question.

262
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,140
Are you sure about taking this case?

263
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:32,110
Yes.

264
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:34,640
I'm taking this case because...

265
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,670
The company?

266
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,640
For money?

267
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,170
For your career and ambition?

268
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,120
That's what you think of me?

269
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,480
We're in a relationship.

270
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,930
But you never sacrificed anything for me.

271
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,800
No even the slightest bit
of compromise.

272
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:46,700
Yun Lan.

273
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:49,430
Sometimes, I really wonder
if you care about me at all.

274
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,830
Can we stop talking about this here?

275
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,060
Am I wrong?

276
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:00,110
Do you love me?

277
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:02,560
If you love me, just tell me right now.

278
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,450
Can you stop being childish?

279
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,290
-Come on.
-I'm being childish?

280
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,520
You know that I was slandered,

281
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:09,600
but you're on his side.

282
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,290
Is that supposed to be maturity?

283
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,320
Lu Yu.

284
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:14,930
I can explain it.

285
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,920
-It's not what you think.
-Save it, Yun Lan.

286
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:18,920
We're over.

287
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,900
It's always been 
my own wishful thinking anyway.

288
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,720
So let's break up.

289
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,800
Saves you from having to say it.

290
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,210
Sorry to have troubled you.

291
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,290
Contact my lawyer

292
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:31,640
if you need anything.

293
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,520
Finally, after ups and downs,

294
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:47,790
my thesis got a pass.

295
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,470
Mr. Zhang,

296
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,390
do you want to tell me anything?

297
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,040
Congratulations

298
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,870
on your thesis defense.

299
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:00,660
That's all?

300
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,470
Well, you don't have

301
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,110
to attend my classes anymore.

302
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,510
But I need to tell you something.

303
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,630
Our contact is coming to an end.

304
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,660
Do you want to

305
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,690
renew our contract

306
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,120
to be the real Mrs. Zhang?

307
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,580
Yes, I do.

308
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,960
But,

309
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,660
I have one request.

310
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:39,120
Yes? What is it?

311
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,860
Can you wait for one year?

312
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:47,970
I want to go study

313
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:51,090
at Kobayashi Studio for a year.

314
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,190
Then you can take grandpa to go abroad

315
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,040
for treatment.

316
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,130
Are you okay with it?

317
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:02,010
Yes, that's fine.

318
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,880
Then?

319
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,369
Then?

320
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:10,890
Then, the groom

321
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,160
can kiss his bride.

322
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:28,440
And then...

323
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:31,130
what?

324
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:31,160
what?

325
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:33,540
Then...

326
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,610
♫ Oh, hopeless people lost in the woods ♫

327
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,400
♫ The compass you're holding
has been bewitched ♫

328
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,480
♫ No one will come looking for you
to take you back ♫

329
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,120
♫ Birds in the trees chirp incessantly ♫

330
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,950
What is your understanding of the world?

331
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:01,930
The world

332
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:04,170
is just one of the mathematical forms

333
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,310
among an infinite number of possibilities.

334
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:09,970
So,

335
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,330
what's your future plan?

336
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:14,700
Together with you,

337
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,110
I want to get Fields Medal

338
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:18,810
before I turn 35.

339
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:27,900
What is your life's insight?

340
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:33,960
♫ Oh, confused people trying
to find a way out of the mist ♫

341
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,270
♫ Feeling afraid in the empty night ♫

342
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,190
I love you.

343
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:37,960
Me too.

344
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,140
♫ Feeling afraid in the empty night ♫

345
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:42,160
♫ No one is willing to stay and chat ♫

346
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,370
♫ Struggling in the whirlpool
of poverty with all your might ♫

347
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:11,670
Are you still angry?

348
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,540
If you're not going
to talk about the case,

349
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:16,960
I'm leaving.

350
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,780
Sit down.

351
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,160
This is the settlement
put forward by my principle.

352
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,040
This is the settlement
put forward by my principle.

353

[Settlement Agreement]

354
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:25,920
[Settlement Agreement]
I think it's reasonable.

355
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,270
I think it's reasonable.

356
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:28,460
Give it a thought.

357
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:31,210
Wait.

358
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,420
For what?

359
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,140
Excuse me.

360
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,130
Miss Yun.

361
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:40,210
We met in a hurry last time.

362
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,280
And we didn't have time
to make a self-introduction.

363
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,430
I'm Chen Rui.

364
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:44,940
In the future,

365
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,030
I'll be in charge

366
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,790
of the settlement

367
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,250
between Mr. Lu and Mr. Han.

368
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:56,030
Alright.

369
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,450
You two know each other now.

370
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,600
Keep communicating.

371
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,380
-Will do.
-I'm off.

372
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:10,410
Miss Yun.

373
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,100
Miss Yun.

374
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:14,400
Let's get started.

375
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:15,410
Okay.

376
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,780
Here you are.

377
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:18,810
Thank you.

378
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,400
[Settlement Agreement]
The details of the settlement

[Settlement Agreement]

380
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:23,680

00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:23,770
[Settlement Agreement]

382
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:23,820
[Settlement Agreement]
Have a look.

383
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:24,650
Have a look.

384
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,260
I don't accept settlement.

385
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,500
You have not yet seen
the specific terms we've negotiated.

386
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,470
Don't bother.

387
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,370
I will not settle.

388
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:33,670
You're an entertainer,

389
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,470
a star.

390
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,510
Have you considered
the consequences of going to trial?

391
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:38,530
I don't care.

392
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,620
Listen, Lu Yu. You need to face the music.

393
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:46,460
The incident of you beating him
has gone viral.

394
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:48,020
Now, online media is advanced.

395
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,130
People will talk from nothing.

396
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,900
Plus, you're in the wrong.

397
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,500
If it goes to the court,

398
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:54,450
it will become irrefutable proof.

399
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,590
Then your career

400
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:58,690
will be ruined.

401
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,840
I'm tired of being a celebrity anyway.

402
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,610
I can have some rest.

403
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:02,650
You're tired?

404
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,660
Do you know how tired
others are because of you?

405
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,040
Lawyer Yun worked
hard for your settlement.

406
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,030
You know what?

407
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,650
Lawyer Yun

408
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:16,240
insisted on adding
a non-disclosure agreement.

409
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:18,150
When you sign the agreement,

410
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,610
the two parties are not allowed to

411
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,290
disclose the details to anyone.

412
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:25,670
Or huge compensation will be paid by
the party which discloses such details.

413
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:26,850
What did you say just now?

414
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,850
I said that Lawyer Yun worked really hard.

415
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,650
She convinced Han Rong to sign

416
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:33,010
the settlement using
her professional ability.

417
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,250
Also, she restricted Han Rong

418
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,610
through the subtle use of legal means.

419
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:38,320
Lawyer Yun really cares about you.

420
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:40,730
She knows what means a lot to you.

421
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,700
So she spared no efforts

422
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:43,780
to protect you.

423
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,060
[Sorry, the number you've dialled
cannot be connected.]

424
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:04,860
[Please try again later.]

425
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,190
Where is Yun Lan?

426
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:09,010
She is on leave.

427
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,430
Come here.

428
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:16,190
Come on, let's take a group photo.

429
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,030
Come. Take a group photo.

430
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,000
Come on!

431
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,290
Line up!

432
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:21,450
Come here, Yu'er.

433
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,700
Look this way.

434
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,950
Hurry up.

435
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:27,700
We graduated!

436
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,790
Yun Shu!

437
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:36,140
Yi Yi.

438
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,490
You're here.

439
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,660
Yun Shu, though your
graduation is one year late,

440
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,380
you still graduated.

441
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:47,430
Today is a lucky day,

442
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,680
so stop mocking me.

443
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,560
I'm extending my congratulations.

444
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,760
Yun Shu.

445
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:54,830
Lin Nuo.

446
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,660
Congratulations!

447
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,840
I thought you would never graduate.

448
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:01,500
You two are really made for each other.

449
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:08,990
Let's take a group photo.

450
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:09,960
Okay.

451
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:21,570
How about I take pictures of you two?

452
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,010
Okay. Come on, Yi Yi.

453
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:29,400
One. Two. Three.

454
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,180
One more.

455
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,620
Three, two, one.

456
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:35,970
Smile.

457
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:36,940
Yun Shu.

458
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:39,420
Happy graduation.

459
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:40,720
Mr. Zhang.

460
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,730
I'll take photos of you.

461
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,110
I'll do it for you, Mr. Zhang.

462
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,720
Here we go.

463
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:50,450
-Three...
-Hold on!

464
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:52,000
You two go ahead.

465
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:57,050
Three, two, one.

466
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,360
Smile.

467
00:23:58,820 --> 00:23:59,990
One more.

468
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,370
Mr. Zhang.

469
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,820
Mr. Zhang, I want to take
a picture with you.

470
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:12,720
Come on, hurry.

471
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:13,490
Here you are.

472
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,720
Look this way, Mr. Zhang.

473
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,320
Done!

474
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,090
This way.

475
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,730
Help us take one.

476
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:19,700
Is this okay?

477
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:21,910
Give me a few minutes.

478
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,650
-Look here.
-I'll take it.

479
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,580
-This way.
-Look here.

480
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,790
Your husband is really charming.

481
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,580
It's my turn. Come on.

482
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,180
Look at the camera.

483
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,400
Come on, look here.

484
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:38,640
Come on, look at the camera, Mr. Zhang.

485
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,140
So,

486
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,800
will Zhang Si Nian go with you?

487
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:45,530
No.

488
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:48,140
He will stay here with grandpa.

489
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:49,120
Besides,

490
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,630
I'm only going there to settle
the admission this time.

491
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,380
Actual work will begin next month.

492
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,760
You've really matured.

493
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:00,430
You can think of the big picture now.

494
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:03,150
I wanted to persuade you before.

495
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:05,780
But you figured it out yourself.

496
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:10,420
Sis, I've been married for one year.

497
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,000
I'm a grown-up.

498
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,710
You just keep

499
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,370
showing off in front of me.

500
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,560
I do not.

501
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,200
I can't send

502
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:21,750
you off that day.

503
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:23,210
I have a trip.

504
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,230
It's alright.

505
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,710
Si Nian will send me off.

506
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,930
You just concentrate on your work.

507
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,470
Work matters.

508
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:30,810
It's not for work.

509
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,020
I just want to go away to have a rest.

510
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:36,050
How about Lu Yu?

511
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:40,190
He doesn't know it.

512
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:43,050
You

513
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,700
had a fight again?

514
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,860
Leave us alone.

515
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:49,990
Just mind your own business.

516
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:53,050
Sis, Lu Yu is actually...

517
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:54,490
Let's go.

518
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:55,590
Let's go to the mall.

519
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,560
Mall?

520
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:57,890
I'll buy you something

521
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,560
and buy grandpa some supplement.

522
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,170
-Okay.
-Let's go.

523
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,510
Academician Zhang,

524
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:08,780
I've consulted many
doctors about this treatment.

525
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,960
It has a high success rate.

526
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:11,480
And it's highly feasible.

527
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,690
Save it.

528
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:13,940
I won't go.

529
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,710
How long will it work?

530
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:16,760
One year?

531
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,940
Two years?

532
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:20,000
I'm old now.

533
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,310
I have to leave the world

534
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:23,200
when my time comes.

535
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:26,280
I don't want to lie on
an unfamiliar bed overseas

536
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:29,810
and wait for my life to end.

537
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:32,570
Just let me go as I wish.

538
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:36,680
Let me maintain my dignity.

539
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,450
You need to follow my
advice this time, Grandpa.

540
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,450
Where's Yun Shu?

541
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:45,440
Yun Shu is with her sister.

542
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:47,900
She wanted to say goodbye to her.

543
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,170
Goodbye?

544
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:52,210
Yun Shu is going to go abroad.

545
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:55,030
The cartoonist she admires

546
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:56,880
gave her an offer.

547
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,870
That's good news.

548
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,950
But Yun Shu

549
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,000
is hoping that I can take you

550
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:05,420
abroad to get treatment.

551
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,280
That's why she chose
to go to Kobayashi Studio.

552
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,290
She didn't want to go

553
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,030
because you're in poor health.

554
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,690
So you should go abroad with me

555
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,040
for the treatment.

556
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,240
If she knows that you won't go abroad,

557
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,350
she won't go

558
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:23,160
to Kobayashi Studio.

559
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:23,850
No.

560
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,700
We can't hamper Yun Shu's career.

561
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,970
Don't let her know.

562
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,440
I won't lie to her

563
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:30,950
regarding this matter.

564
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:34,720
A white lie is not a lie.

565
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,500
I can't be the stumbling block

566
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,090
getting in the way of you youngsters.

567
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:45,250
Grandpa.

568
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:46,900
Yun Shu.

569
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,460
Yun Shu is here.

570
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,080
How are you feeling today?

571
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,170
Do you feel better?

572
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,560
Yes.

573
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,210
I'm just craving for something delicious.

574
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,420
I knew it.

575
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:00,600
That's why I brought
a lot of delicious food for you.

576
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:01,810
Great!

577
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,440
I brought you
your favourite dried pork slices.

578
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:07,930
Which flavour do you prefer?

579
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,370
-This one.
-Okay.

580
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,490
I'll open it for you.

581
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,720
Yun Shu.

582
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:19,510
Yun Shu is so sweet.

583
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,020
Lin Nuo.

584
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,280
Lin Nuo.

585
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,800
Lin Nuo.

586
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,430
Come on.

587
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:41,770
You're avoiding me as if I were a virus.

588
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,230
Are you really so sick of me?

589
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:45,110
Go home.

590
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:46,770
Please leave me alone.

591
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:50,010
Gu Xiao and I aren't together.

592
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,210
Have a look.

593
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:54,710
I deleted his WeChat.

594
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,680
Yi Yi.

595
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,980
It's over between us.

596
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:00,380
But we can start over.

597
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,200
We can start from being friends.

598
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,600
Lin Nuo, I've changed.

599
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:06,010
If you still can't believe me,

600
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,450
we can go to get a marriage certificate.

601
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,010
I brought my household register.

602
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:13,860
Lin Nuo,

603
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,130
I know I treated you badly.

604
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:18,190
I know you've liked me since before.

605
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,450
I thought you would never leave me.

606
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,330
So I took advantage
of your affection towards me.

607
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,400
I understand why you're sick of me now.

608
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:26,370
But,

609
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,920
I need to tell you

610
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,710
or I'll regret it.

611
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:30,700
Yi Yi.

612
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:33,080
It's too late.

613
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,050
I'm leaving for Africa next month.

614
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:36,730
Next month?

615
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:37,930
Yes.

616
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,450
You're going there for a trip?

617
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,190
-I can...
-No.

618
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:42,540
I'm going there to work.

619
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:44,080
Medical support.

620
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,160
For how long?

621
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,720
It doesn't matter.

622
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,010
I will go

623
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:51,270
with Xia Lin.

624
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,020
Yi Yi.

625
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,890
I'm not sick of you

626
00:29:58,090 --> 00:29:59,830
because I've let go of

627
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:02,090
my feelings for you.

628
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:05,030
You'll find the one

629
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:06,760
who loves you

630
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,880
sooner or later.

631
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,600
I think

632
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:12,770
you won't remember me at that time.

633
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,380
Mr. Zhang.

634
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,030
What's going on?

635
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,370
Stop here.

636
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,720
I'm afraid that I won't

637
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:16,360
go through security

638
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,440
and board the plane

639
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:20,150
because you're there.

640
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,450
Just stop here.

641
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:31,810
Okay.

642
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:34,240
Check whether everything is ready.

643
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:36,000
Remember the passport.

644
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:37,220
It's alright.

645
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,530
I have everything.

646

00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,380
Let it go.

673
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,720
We have to move on.

Lin Nuo.

I know I was wrong.

I know I treated you badly.

00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,700
I don't know why I was so mean to you.

678
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:59,530
I feel really regretful now.

679
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,480
Can you give me one more chance?

680
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,530
What do you think?

681
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,180
Someone who loved me so much before

682
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,330
can't possibly feel nothing now.

683
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,090
I didn't believe the words

684
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,170
that said

685
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,630
we can meet the right one at right time.

686
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,800
I believed love should come naturally.

687
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:20,350
It's not about the right and wrong.

688
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:22,640
But after we experienced so much,

689
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,330
I began to believe that

690
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,540
what they said is true.

691
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,020
If the timing is wrong,

692
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:29,210
even if we're in love,

693
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:31,500
we'll miss each other.

694
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:36,430
So I missed out on you.

695
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,780
No.

696
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:43,750
We can still be friends.

697
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:47,590
Best friends forever.

698
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:16,389
Take care.
