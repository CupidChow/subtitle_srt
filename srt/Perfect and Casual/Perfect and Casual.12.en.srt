4
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,510
Mr. Zhang, are we almost there?

5
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,000
Yes.

6
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,680
Today.

7
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:43,230
Thank you for taking a
detour to send me back.

8
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,160
When will you go to
work in the new company?

9
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,030
The day after tomorrow.

10
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,100
Well.

11
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:54,570
By the way,

12
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,350
I have a gift for you.

13
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,100
Yun Shu.

14
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,930
Can you move back in?

15
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:15,730
Yi Yi.

16
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,200
Do you think I should
move back in or not?

17
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,079
You know the answer.

18
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:21,779
What is that?

19
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,120
In order to fulfil the contract,

20
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:26,300
I tried my best to control

21
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,810
my feelings for Mr. Zhang.

22
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,150
I'm afraid...

23
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,480
I'm afraid I'll

24
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,820
fall in love with him if I move back in.

25
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,030
What to do then?

26
00:04:34,909 --> 00:04:36,800
I don't know what you're struggling with.

27
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:39,000
The experience of predecessors
since ancient times tells us that

28
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,230
it's better to make friends
than make enemies.

29
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,350
So Mr. Zhang and you

30
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,540
can't leave each other.

31
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,550
What an enmity.

32
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,900
Why an enmity again?

33
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:47,900
Don't you know

34
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,040
only enmity makes us live together.

35
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,620
You don't have to struggle.

36
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,470
It's impossible for Mr. Zhang and you

37
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,470
to fall apart.

38
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,880
What if my mind is messed up again

39
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,580
when I see him next time?

40
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,490
Then you just

41
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,230
recite ancient poems, formulas and words.

42
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,230
What do you mean?

43
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:07,780
The year I took the postgraduate
entrance examination,

44
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,210
in order to lay off gaming,

45
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,120
I came up with a very good method.

46
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,550
When I want to play games,

47
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,870
I recite English words.

48
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,610
From A to C.

49
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,920
Finally, I laid off gaming

50
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,280
and I got a 90 in my English exam.

51
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:20,770
So?

52
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,170
So when you're unconsciously
attracted to Mr. Zhang,

53
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,480
you can try memorising

54
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,510
things that you can't usually memorise.

55
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,430
That way, you'll be distracted.

56
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:32,760
What I usually can't memorise?

57
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:33,950
That means

58
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,930
statistics formulas and concepts.

59
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,880
That's it, you can memorise formulas.

60
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,150
Yi Yi, the day after tomorrow
is my birthday.

61
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,030
Can you come to my birthday party?

62
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,000
Gu Xiao.

63
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,250
It's Gu Xiao.

64
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,180
He invited me to his birthday party.

65
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:54,330
Text him back quickly.

66
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,040
I hope you can come.

67
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,510
OK, I'll be there on time.

68
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,510

127
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,500
Mr. Zhang,

128
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,220
you're watching

129
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:41,030
romantic dramas?

130
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,340
By force.

131
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,110
Who dares to do that?

132
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,180
He calls me everyday

133
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,240
and lets me make
comments on his performance.

134
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,230
You said yes?

135
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,230
If I didn't say yes,

136
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,840
he would give me more calls

137
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,770
and force me to make more comments

138
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,330
on his performance.

139
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,110
So what do you think of his performance?

140
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,640
His performance

141
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:15,830
perfectly depicts a middle-aged man

142
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,830
with no dreams or goals.

143
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,480
And...

144
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,030
How should I put it?

145
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,030
Greasy.

146
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,510
Greasy.

147
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:36,630
It's a great word.

148
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,630
Accurate one.

149
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,510
Mr. Zhang, you don't surf the Internet?

150
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,800
I usually go on math journal websites

151
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:44,910
to search for information.

152
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,630
Sometimes, I browse the
latest academic forums.

153
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,510
You don't

154
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:52,420
read news

155
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,750
or gossip?

156
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,730
I will read some substantive...

157
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,040
Gossip?

158
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:59,230
Why should I read them?

159
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,710
Because we want to

160
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,530
live a happy life.

161
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:05,550
I have math

162
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,850
so I'm living a happy life.

163
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,380
You like me, right?

164
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:42,900
No.

165
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:43,870
No.

166
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,180
I've seen this episode.

167
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,630
I remember that Lu Yu once told me that

168
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,530
actors easily fall
in love with each other

169
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,790
when filming those scenes.

170
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,950
Do you think

171
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,430
we'll have such wrong senses?

172
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,020
Mr. Zhang,

173
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,170
I think this kind of drama is

174
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,700
not fit for you.

175
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,780
So you shouldn't watch them.

176
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:24,630
Good night.

177
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,500
What's going on?

178
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:50,960
Why did you call me here so urgently?

179
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,900
Something is wrong.

180
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:55,260
What is it?

181
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,000
Gu Xiao has a birthday party today.

182
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,900
Why are you still here?

183
00:12:58,990 --> 00:12:59,620
I thought

184
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,550
Gu Xiao and I would
celebrate his birthday alone.

185
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,100
But I found that

186
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,760
many beauties were around him.

187
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:06,810
Look at me! I'm so casual.

188
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,030
Gao Zhi Yi.

189
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:11,730
You're always confident

190
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,270
in your appearance.

191
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,100
Oh, save it.

192
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,860
Stop kidding me.

193
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,470
You want to outshine

194
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,980
all women at present

195
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,100
in front of Gu Xiao?

196
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:24,670
Yeah

197
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,310
I'm naive indeed.

198
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,770
Alright. You can do everything.

199
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,100
Come on.

200
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,480
Figure something out.

201
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,730
I'm too embarrassed to get in there.

202
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:54,480
Do I look good?

203
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,570
It cost me three months of salary.

204
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,880
Of course it's beautiful.

205
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,080
I'll repay you.

206
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,730
Go.

207
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,420
Gu Xiao.

208
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,390
We can also get this.

209
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,070
Yi Yi.

210
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:29,680
You're late.

211
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,310
I've been waiting for you.

212
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,310
Happy birthday!

213
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,740
Thank you.

214
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:37,740
Yi Yi.

215
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,260
You look so great.

216
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,280
Gu Xiao.

217
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,230
Who's this girl?

218
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,710
My girlfriend.

219
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,400
Gorgeous.

220
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,040
Come on.

221
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:55,960
Follow me later.

222
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,630
Come on. Cheers.

223
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,580
Stop showing off.

224
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,900
How sweet.

225
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:04,330
How sweet.

226
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:05,630
Come on. Come on.

227
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:06,900
Come on. Join us.

228
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,700
Happy birthday. Happy birthday.

229
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,660
Thank you.

230
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,480
Happy birthday.

231
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:11,950
Light the candle.

232
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:12,420
Thank you.

233
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:12,610
Happy birthday to you!

234
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:15,810
- ♫ Happy Birthday to you ♫
- Happy birthday to you!

235
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:15,880
Happy birthday to you!

236
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:16,050
Happy birthday to you!

237
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:18,890
- ♫ Happy Birthday to you ♫
- Happy birthday to you!

238
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:19,030
Happy birthday to you!

239
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:21,950
Happy birthday!

240
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,620
Come on. Thanks.

241
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:24,630
Thank you all.

242
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,050
Thank you all for coming.

243
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:30,990
Come on.

244
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,150
Thanks.

245
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,030
Thank you all.

246
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,480
Thanks for coming.

247
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,110
Drink up.

248
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:48,700
Mine is expensive.

249
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:49,810
Why don't you have it?

250
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:50,940
No. No.

251
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:51,910
Just hear me out.

252
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:52,850
Attention please.

253
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,280
Listen to me.

254
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,580
Let me introduce

255
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,580
a new colleague to you.

256
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,230
Yun Shu.

257
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,780
Hello, everyone, I'm Yun Shu.

258
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,030
Nice to meet you.

259
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,420
From today on,

260
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,500
Yun Shu's going to be my new assistant.

261
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,870
You can communicate with her directly

262
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,510
about work schedules and arrangements.

263
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,620
Yun Shu.

264
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,290
This is your seat.

265
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,250
Come to me if you have any questions.

266
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,510
Thank you.

267
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:16,060
Liane,

268
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:17,870
show her around.

269
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,620
Okay.

270
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:19,350
Come with me, Yun Shu.

271
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:20,230
I'll show you around.

272
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:21,070
Okay.

273
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:21,820
I'm leaving now.

274
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:22,790
Go.

275
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:26,900
OK.

276
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,310
Back to work.

277
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,280
Lawyer Meng always works alone.

278
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,750
Why did he hire an assistant?

279
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,500
If you have a crush on a girl,

280
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,280
young and beautiful.

281
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:41,230
You will also hire her.

282
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,480
No.

283
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:43,600
I think

284
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:45,130
you're way more beautiful.

285
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:46,650
Get out!

286
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,070
Come in.

287
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,440
Lawyer Meng,

288
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:05,579
I'm really grateful

289
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,150
that you hired me.

290
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,670
Though I'm not a law major

291
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,730
and I can't help you
with professional problems,

292
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,569
I'll try my best to study it

293
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,180
and I'll try

294
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,200
to give

295
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:16,170
you professional help

296
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:17,480
in a timely manner.

297
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:18,849
What's going on? Why so serious?

298
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,560
You seem to go to the battlefield.

299
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:22,630
Take your time with your work.

300
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:24,079
You're my assistant,

301
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,430
not my helper.

302
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:29,270
What's the matter?

303
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,240
Anything else?

304
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:32,150
Lawyer Meng,

305
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,450
I really want to learn.

306
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,940
I really want to help you.

307
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,930
You really want to learn?

308
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:55,680
OK, start with those three books.

309
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,770
Reference Book of National.

310
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:00,950
Judicial Examination of 2014.

311
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,060
What's the matter?

312
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,910
It's so many of them.

313
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:06,200
Alright. Lawyer Meng.

314
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,020
I'll finish reading them.

315
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,160
Thank you.

316
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:38,640
They taste kind of spicy.

317
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:43,880
What are you looking at?

318
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:49,380
Yun Shu.

319
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,070
Yun Shu.

320
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,610
What are you looking at?

321
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,150
They're references given

322
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,710
by Lawyer Meng today.

323
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,090
Have dinner first.

324
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:02,170
I'm not hungry.

325
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,110
Lawyer Meng bought
fried chicken this afternoon.

326
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:17,680
I'm done.

327
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,650
Done?

328
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,950
I have some work to do.

329
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,680
You just place them here
when you finish your dinner.

330
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:25,250
I'll be back for them.

331
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,580
Hello, Wild Yu.

332
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,620
It's been a while!

333
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,280
How about having a drink tonight?

334
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,750
I'm busy. What's up?

335
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,730
Come on.

336
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:39,380
It's been a while since

337
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,750
you came to the bar last time.

338
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,830
And you didn't teach me

339
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,970
how to play that game.

340
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,030
Can you spare some time for it?

341
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:44,950
I'm busy.

342
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,900
I have to go.

343
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,350
Come on. Stay.

344
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:47,820
Come on.

345
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:49,940
Oh my god. For God's sake.
Just give me a break.

346
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:50,500
Nuts.

347
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,340
Listen to me.

348
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:52,480
I just...

349
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,780
Sickening.

350
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,060
Yun Shu.

351
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,370
Mr. Zhang.

352
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,940
Do you want to use pads?

353
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,380
Do you want to use the bathroom?

354
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,420
I'm here to tell you

355
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:41,270
I want to take a shower.

356
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,910
If you want to use the toilet,

357
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:43,550
then I'll be after you.

358
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,670
Never mind, Mr. Zhang.

359
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,550
Thank you.

360
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,520
Okay.

361
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,810
Mr. Zhang.

362
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:53,620
Go ahead.

363
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,030
Shut the door for me please.

364
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,540
Okay.

365
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:16,260
Why is she so hard-working now?

366
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,190
Yun Shu.

367
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:26,760
For me?

368
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,430
I want to drink milk just now.

369
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,680
So I warm one for you too.

370
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,630
Thanks, Mr. Zhang.

371
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,720
You're welcome.

372
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:41,230
Anything else?

373
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:42,790
No.

374
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,460
Mr. Zhang.

375
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,840
You're wearing the pyjamas I bought you.

376
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:55,920
Yeah.

377
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:57,430
Great.

378
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,080
It suits you well.

379
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,840
By the way,

380
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,230
can I help you with anything?

381
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,180
Well, these provisions are really hard

382
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,700
to understand.

383
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:09,700
I'm focusing hard

384
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:10,800
and reading word by word,

385
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:12,280
and I'm barely getting it.

386
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:13,470
So...

387
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:14,900
So?

388
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:16,180
So can you please turn that

389
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,470
TV down?

390
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,550
Otherwise I can't move on.

391
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,000
Of course.

392
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,610
By the way, Yun Shu.

393
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,300
You know I was a minor

394
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:34,680
in Law.

395
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:36,170
So I can help you

396
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,150
if you have any questions.

397
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:37,980
Don't bother.

398
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,850
Mr. Meng said if I have
anything I can't understand,

399
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:40,620
I can circle them.

400
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:42,910
And he'll answer my
questions in the office.

401
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:44,990
Lawyer Meng.

402
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,830
The TV.

403
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,800
The TV?

404
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,190
Okay.

405
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,180
I'll fight for it!

406
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,760
Lawyer Meng.

407
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,600
What's Yun Lan's story?

408
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:28,210
She became the director
within such a short time.

409
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,020
Maybe she and Mr. Liu...

410
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,020
It makes sense.

411
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:32,520
Her eyes betray

412
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:33,480
that she's not a restless one.

413
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,750
Her charming eyes

414
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,110
can really get men enchanted.

415
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,530
[The spring breeze]
can really get men enchanted.

416
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:41,100
[The spring breeze]

417
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,260
Why are you here?

418
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:50,670
Oh my gosh. Is this Lu Yu?

419
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,700
Come on. How could it be?

420
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:52,550
It's Lu Yu.

421
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,830
Yun Lan knows Lu Yu.

422
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:54,630
She's really unusual.

423
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,520
Awesome.

424
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:57,050
She gets the leader's support at work

425
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,650
and flowers from an idol off work.

426
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,620
Hold on.

427
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,430
Thanks for your praise.

428
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,480
I have it all.

429
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:11,560
I have a good face

430
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,050
and good ability to get promoted.

431
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:24,900
Why are you here?

432
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,330
I'm here to take my girlfriend home.

433
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,700
Who's your girlfriend?

434
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,380
You are.

435
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,430
When did I say yes?

436
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,130
I've slept at your house twice.

437
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,100
No.

438
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:35,890
Three times.

439
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,760
You're definitely my girlfriend.

440
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,630
I'd like to make it clear.

441
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,420
If you feel bored,

442
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:43,730
I'm free now.

443
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,780
So we can kill time together.

444
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,430
If you want to get closer to me,

445
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:48,590
then sorry.

446
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:49,930
I have no such plans.

447
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:55,730
Yun Lan.

448
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:58,090
Take the flowers.

449
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,700
Kill the time.

450
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,220
Sis.

451
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:10,970
Thank you.

452
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,490
You're on time today.

453
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,480
I visited grandpa today.

454
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:17,520
Is he OK?

455
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:18,680
He's OK.

456
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:25,080
I've been busy recently.

457
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,220
When grandpa feels better,

458
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,200
I'll go to visit him.

459
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:29,520
Sis,

460
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:31,180
I have good news for you.

461
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,740
What is it?

462
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:36,060
I got a new job.

463
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,600
What kind of job?

464
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,320
In a law firm.

465
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:39,500
Like you.

466
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:41,660
But I'm just an assistant.

467
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:43,430
I can't believe there is a company

468
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:45,980
willing to take you.

469
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:47,900
Sis.

470
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:54,880
Listen,

471
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:57,280
do Zhang Si Nian and you

472
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,830
take effective contraception?

473
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:01,080
Don't get pregnant.

474
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:03,350
No. We didn't do that.

475
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,270
What?

476
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,230
No.

477
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,350
You got me wrong.

478
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,320
Yes.

479
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:08,870
No, sis.

480
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,220
What are you thinking?

481
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,350
I didn't sleep with him.

482
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:14,730
That's good.

483
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,440
Listen,

484
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,900
you're in a contractual relationship.

485
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:20,630
You'll part one year later.

486
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:23,710
Maybe you can have a different story end.

487
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:24,970
But don't sleep with him

488
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,580
unless you

489
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:27,950
crazily love each other.

490
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:28,980
Got it?

491
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,900
Yes.

492
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:31,900
Yes.

493
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,140
Sis.

494
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:40,640
Did you ever crazily love someone?

495
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,940
Not even when you were abroad?

496
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,730
I was busy with work every day.

497
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:49,500
So I never cared about that.

498
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,830
You had a hard time.

499
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:57,280
You look not smart.

500
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,300
But you did well.

501
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:04,310
You have to thank me.

502
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,280
I feel your thanks.

503
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:07,970
You're welcome.

504
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:08,940
But...

505
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:10,150
She is new here,

506
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,930
yet you assigned so many tasks for her.

507
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,390
You are exploiting a worker.

508
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,430
Exploiting a worker?

509
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,490
Zhang Si Nian.

510
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:16,470
When did you start to use

511
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,180
such an inappropriate word?

512
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,710
You know what I mean.

513
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,710
You let me

514
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:25,080
give Yun Shu a job.

515
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,600
You let me help her.

516
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:28,550
This is the beginning.

517
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,690
You overprotect her.

518
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,040
What should I do then?

519
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:33,680
I mean you shouldn't

520
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:36,310
influence our normal life.

521
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,370
You're in a contractual relationship.

522
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,330
It's not normal.

523
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,870
Yun Shu, you want to see Lawyer Meng?

524
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,680
Yeah.

525
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,520
I've finished all the
tasks he's given to me.

526
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:47,310
I'll take them to his office.

527
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:49,770
No way.

528
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,550
You'd better come up with a

529
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,030
reasonable cause to explain
why you are in my office.

530
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:58,830
Five, four, three.

531
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:03,770
Yun Shu.

532
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,910
This is the task you assigned to me.

533
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,360
I've reviewed the document.

534
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:10,680
Nice job.

535
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:11,550
Thank you.

536
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,700
Is there anything else I should do?

537
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:15,080
Nothing special.

538
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:16,270
Well, I'm off now.

539
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:18,270
Yun Shu.

540
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:21,130
You're the newcomer.

541
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,470
And I want to ask you

542
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,870
if you're under too much pressure

543
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,950
because of those tasks I assigned to you.

544
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:25,940
Of course not.

545
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:27,580
A slow sparrow should make an early start.

546
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,220
I'm starting from zero,

547
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,910
so I have to try harder.

548
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:32,510
Well,

549
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:35,110
will your life be influenced?

550
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:37,700
Of course not.

551
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,620
Actually, I don't have my own life.

552
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:41,030
Work is my life now.

553
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,660
Work is not only life.

554
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:45,680
Life shouldn't only be about work.

555
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:48,770
You have to learn to release your
work-related stress.

556
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:49,830
Lawyer Meng.

557
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,930
Sorry, maybe I'm a bit slow.

558
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,450
So I didn't fully understand your words.

559
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:55,210
But I'll try harder.

560
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:00,670
You're way smarter than someone.

561
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,710
At least,

562
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,680
you know what life is.

563
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:05,330
What's the matter?

564
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:06,290
It's okay.

565
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,100
I got a cramp.

566
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:08,070
I got a cramp.

567
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,020
Go.

568
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:10,110
Well, I'm off now.

569
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,480
Yun Shu.

570
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,110
Yun Shu.

571
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,640
What's the matter?

572
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:36,990
You...

573
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,520
You don't have to read your documents?

574
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:39,450
No.

575
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,330
Lawyer Meng gave me a day off.

576
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,590
He said happiness
matters most in our life.

577
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,830
Are you unhappy at the law firm?

578
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:45,830
I'm happy.

579
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,650
Since I went to work at the law office,

580
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,620
I feel that my life has
become more meaningful.

581
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:50,600
I'm really happy.

582
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,200
That's good.

583
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:05,610
Yun Shu.

584
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:07,050
Yun Shu.

585
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,470
Your work is tiring.

586
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,700
You don't have to

587
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,400
do those chores at home.

588
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,900
Why don't I get you a cleaning lady?

589
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:19,570
Don't bother. I can handle these.

590
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,700
Also, I can feel more relaxed

591
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:23,460
when I'm doing chores.

592
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,470
Doing chores makes

593
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,390
you happy?

594
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,320
Yeah.

595
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:28,680
It's my life.

596
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,180
Okay.

597
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:31,150
Mr. Zhang,

598
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:34,680
what are some things
in your life

599
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:35,830
that make you happy?

600
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,780
Math and work.

601
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:39,560
I've told you that before.

602
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:42,100
I feel like...

603
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:43,620
Maybe you can try

604
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:45,830
doing something trivial.

605
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,030
Maybe they can make you feel far happier.

606
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,530
Alright. I'm going to

607
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,940
go to the supermarket.

608
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:57,670
Yun Shu.

609
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:59,130
Why not go together?

610
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,460
OK.

611
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,040
What are you thinking about?

612
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,620
The supermarket offers discounts today.

613
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:41,780
I'm trying to figure how

614
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,050
I can buy those goods
at the lowest price.

615
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,630
Let me calculate.

616
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:49,000
10 percent off...

617
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,180
20 percent off...

618
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,310
Let me help you.

619
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,550
OK.

620
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:08,140
[Redeem points]

621
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:12,190
[Single-item discount]

622
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:14,870
[Spend 1000 yuan and get 299 yuan]

623
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,480
OK. I'm done.

624
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,490
Chap,

625
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,700
be honest.

626
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:33,750
Tell me

627
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,750
how I can buy them economically?

628
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:37,780
Right.

629
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,550
Just give us an example.

630
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:40,540
Am I right, girl?

631
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,530
You can buy goods worth 188 yuan.

632
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,020
And then

633
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:51,570
pay them

634
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,940
by using the coupon worth 25 yuan.

635
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,750
With 1000 points in your membership card,

636
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,160
you can get 10 yuan off.

637
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:58,550
Then you can get a red pocket worth 5 yuan

638
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,820
through WeChat Pay.

639
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:01,580
Then you can use these red pockets

640
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:03,370
when you shop next time.

641
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:06,010
It's the most economical way, I guess.

642
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,440
So...

643
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:11,739
They're gone.

644
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,310
Well,

645
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:18,350
you're similar to that lady.

646
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,860
Chap.

647
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,239
It's you.

648
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,170
Chap,

649
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:37,230
your way is really helpful.

650
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:37,940
Look.

651
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,630
We bought a bunch of stuff

652
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:41,060
and we got a lot of discounts.

653
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:42,949
You're a fine-looking

654
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,100
and economically rational person.

655
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,949
Chap, what do you do?

656
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:47,710
I...

657
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,500
He's a mathematics researcher.

658
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:50,850
Yes.

659
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:52,880
You must be a math
teacher in a middle school.

660
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:56,100
No wonder he's so brilliant.

661
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:58,070
Your girlfriend is beautiful

662
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,270
and able to keep house.

663
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,670
You're really lucky.

664
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,640
That's it.

665
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,940
She's not my girlfriend.

666
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,300
We're a married couple.

667
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:11,230
A married couple!

668
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:14,180
You're meant to be together.

669
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:14,900
Good for you.

670
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:15,750
It's our turn to pay. Come on.

671
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,480
OK.

672
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,500
Thanks, chap.

673
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:18,620
Thank you.

674
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:19,660
