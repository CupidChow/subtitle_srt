No.

No.

kiss?

21

You haven't slept all night?

You usually sleep like a log.

But you didn't last night?

125

Yi Yi.

127
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,230
Do you remember that I told you before

128
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,940
that Chu Chu had a failed relationship?

129
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,130
Her first love

130
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,000

131
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:16,970
Remember it?

132
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,180
Sure.

133
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,220
You abandoned me

134
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,590
in order to comfort her.

135
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:24,320
Do you know who her first love was?

136
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:28,960
Mr. Zhang.

137
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,180
Mr. Zhang?

138
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:36,650
You and her first love

139
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:37,980
are truly enemies.

140
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,250
It's more than that.

141
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,670
Before Mr. Zhang returned,

142
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,610
Chu Chu kissed him.

143
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,510
They're both excellent

144
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,750
and perfect.

145
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,530
It's not

146
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:49,630
an interesting relationship

147
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:51,120
when the two persons are evenly matched.

148
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:53,450
It's like looking into a mirror
at themselves every morning.

149
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,100
Have you ever seen two identical puzzles

150
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:56,510
make a complete one?

151
00:09:58,910 --> 00:09:59,780
What do you mean?

152
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,000
I mean

153
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:02,060
if Mr. Zhang

154
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,630
is really interested in Lin Chu Chu,

155
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,550
he wouldn't have married you.

156
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,520
You're dumb.

157
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,010
You're right.

158
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:15,820
Yi Yi.

159
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,750
The truth really lies in

160
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,910
your hands.

161
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:20,250
Of course!

162
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,700
I'm never wrong about this.

163
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,460
Since you are worried,

164
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:28,300
why not ask Mr. Zhang directly?

165
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:31,630
When I heard about it last night,

166
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:33,670
I was stunned.

167
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,120
How do you feel now?

168
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:36,100
Are you "alive" now?

169
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:37,070
Sure.

170
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:38,380
If you are, ask him now.

171
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,450
Come on.

172
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:43,380
What about you and Lin Nuo?

173
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,800
I think you're right.

174
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:47,230
I will leave Lin Nuo alone for a few days.

175
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,390
I think he will beg me
to get back together.

176
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,880
And then I'll punish him.

177
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,840
We'll punish him.

178
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,770
Send a WeChat message.

179
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,310
What about the data?

180
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,610
Take a look, Professor Zhang.

181
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:14,570
There are still problems with the data.

182
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:15,740
You're right.

183
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,340
I think so, too.

184
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:18,580
Professor Zhang.

185
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,990
Your phone is ringing.

186
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,960
Thank you.

187
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,050
[Come back early this evening.]

188
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,490
[See you at home.]

189
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,790
[Okay]

190
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,560
It's Yun Shu, right?

191
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:34,180
I’ll have dinner with
Meng Ran in the evening.

192
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,480
Why don't you bring Yun Shu with you?

193
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,510
Meng Ran?

194
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,300
We were classmates and haven't
seen each other for a long time.

195
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,500
-Let's have dinner together.
-Let me ask Yun Shu first.

196
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,220
[Chu Chu and Meng Ran
will have dinner together.]

197
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:48,900
[She invited us to join.]

198
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,450
She dares to declare war.

199
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:51,270
[Do you want to go?]

200
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,530
Go. You must go.

201
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:54,480
No. It will be three of us.

202
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,550
I'll do it.

203
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,890
[Okay, honey.]

204
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,180
[Send me the address.]

205
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:10,650
Isn't this the shop

206
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,200
where Chu Chu bought clothes?

207
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,130
Yes.

208
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,980
Who says only Lin Chu Chu can wear this.

209
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:42,640
Do I not look good?

210
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:45,780
No.

211
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,820
You're very beautiful.

212
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,210
It suits you well.

213
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,550
Sorry, I'm late.

214
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,840
Where are the two?

215
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,360
They have already gone upstairs.

216
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,610
Let's go too.

217
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,580
Okay.

218
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,630
Yun Shu, here you are.

219
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,040
Sorry, I'm late.

220
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,070
Mr. Meng, Chu Chu.

221
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,530
What a coincidence.

222
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,270
You look pretty.

223
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,220
All right.

224
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,190
Take a seat.

225
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,310
Okay.

226
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:24,400
Waiter.

227
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,780
We're ready to order.

228
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:26,750
Okay.

229
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,960
Who would like to order, please?

230
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:34,550
Chu Chu.

231
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,390
You just returned from abroad, so
you can order whatever you want to eat.

232
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:39,380
I just came back.

233
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:41,040
I don't know what's tasty.

234
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,940
Let Yun Shu order.

235
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,300
Let Chu Chu order.

236
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,780
I'm not very good at ordering.

237
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:52,560
Let Si Nian order.

238
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,220
See what you want to eat.

239
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:00,190
Pick anything.

240
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:04,860
We want a Lily-Flavoured
Stewed Angelica Soup.

241
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:05,900
Okay.

242
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,360
Si Nian, aren't you allergic to lilies?

243
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:13,000
Then I'll change it.

244
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:13,830
That's okay.

245
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,460
Help yourself to whatever you want.

246
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:22,960
Then,

247
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:25,460
we want a Pan-Seared Green Chili Pepper.

248
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,150
Everyone can eat spicy food, right?

249
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:27,750
Sure.

250
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,720
Serve one.

251
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,240
Okay.

252
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,740
I can,

253
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,620
but Si Nian doesn't eat spicy food.

254
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,580
You didn't tell me.

255
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,530
When we prepared

256
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,640
spicy dishes back home,

257
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,050
you ate it too.

258
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:47,690
I used to not eat too much,

259
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,210
but I can now.

260
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,260
Pick whatever you like.

261
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,830
How about I order?

262
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,260
Yun Shu, let me order.

263
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,600
What's delicious here?

264
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:01,420
We have a lot.

265
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,780
We can serve every dish on the menu.

266
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,410
Tell me what you want to eat.

267
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,340
And

268
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,660
one more...

269
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:15,990
What do you want to eat?

270
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:22,020
Tell me.
Let me order it for you.

271
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:22,950
Pork Ribs.

272
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:23,920
Pork Ribs.

273
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,030
Okay.

274
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,000
Okay, Pork Ribs.

275
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:27,370
Okay.

276
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,660
Chu Chu.

277
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:30,870
What do you want to eat?

278
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,210
Squirrel-Shaped Mandarin Fish.

279
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,050
-Do you have it?
-Yes.

280
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,010
-One, please.
-Okay.

281
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:34,970
What else?

282
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,250
A portion of

283
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,050
Pork Ribs please.

284
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,020
Thank you.

285
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,380
Chu Chu likes spicy food.

286
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:44,550
One more

287
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,390
Diced Chicken with Chili Pepper.

288
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,080
We're leaving.

289
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,740
Do you also like Yun Shu?

290
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,420
I like you, too.

291
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,710
It seems to be true.

292
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,920
Stop guessing.

293
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:36,350
You were like this when at school.

294
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,220
You tell the most serious thing
with jokes.

295
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:40,280
They make a fine couple.

296
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:41,410
I wish them happiness.

297
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,870
I don't believe Si Nian
can really fall in love with Yun Shu.

298
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,880
They're so different
from each other.

299
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,390
Actions speak louder than words.

300
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,040
Time will test everything.

301
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,940
The two of them are a good match.

302
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,530
Let's not disturb them.

303
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,550
By the way.

304
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:58,850
I didn't drive today.

305
00:16:58,930 --> 00:16:59,970
I'll call a cab for you.

306
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,000
Do you know about their
contractual relationship?

307
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:14,160
[Restaurant Yun Hai]

308
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,680
Contractual relationship?

309
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:20,930
Interesting.

310
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:21,369
[Going along with your intention
is a promise I made to myself]

311
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,319
Mei.

312
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:26,380
You wanted to see me?

313
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,800
Yes.

314
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,550
I've recommended your work

315
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,880
to the editor of the publishing house.

316
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:33,310
The publishing house?

317
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:35,150
If the editor of the publishing house

318
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,400
chooses your work,

319
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,730
your comics will be serialized overseas.

320
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:40,650
Mei,

321
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:42,370
I'll definitely work hard.

322
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,510
All the best.

323
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:45,000
In the future,

324
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:46,020
you should make every issue

325
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:47,630
perfect like this.

326
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,620
Contractual relationship?

327
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,300
You chose a good topic.

328
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:52,010
It will surely attract attention.

329
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,520
Contractual relationship?

330
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,180
Look.

331
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,570
the text by Si Hua Nian
is great too.

332
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,780
Look at this line.

333
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,740
"Going along with your intention

334
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,890
is a promise I made to myself."

335
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,630
Where is she?

336
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,480
That girl.

337
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,930
I ordered a Cold Brew for you.

338
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,220
Thank you.

339
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,510
This is the comic book I received

340
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:29,840
three days ago.

341
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:29,880
three days ago.

342
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:31,100
Si Nian and you

343
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,600
have a contractual relationship?

344
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,340
Such a relationship

345
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:37,010
is just a way for us
to get acquainted.

346
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:38,900
It doesn't mean anything anymore.

347
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,360
Is it because of grandpa?

348
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:44,150
Yun Shu.

349
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,690
There’s still a long way to go.

350
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:46,970
Have you seriously considered

351
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,370
the future of the two of you?

352
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,750
A successful marriage

353
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:53,050
requires sharing the same
world view, goals

354
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:55,040
and life sentiments.

355
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:57,040
Can you answer my three questions?

356
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,430
I think

357
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,960
life is good.

358
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,980
Every single day is
worth cherishing for me.

359
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:07,030
Mr. Zhang and I have the same goal.

360
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,380
We made an agreement together

361
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:09,550
to take good care of grandpa

362
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:11,000
and live happily together.

363
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:12,680
As for life sentiment,

364
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:14,180
meeting Mr. Zhang

365
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,290
is the happiest thing in my life.

366
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,530
You have your charm.

367
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,730
But I know Si Nian's world view

368
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,430
is that infinite
possibilities in the world

369
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,020
come down to one of
the mathematical forms.

370
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,300
I also know

371
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:27,010
Si Nian's life goal

372
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,780
is to win the Fields Medal

373
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,680
before 35 years old.

374
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,210
And I have the same life sentiment
as him.

375
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,640
We both think

376
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,970
people are born lonely.

377
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:37,960
Chu Chu.

378
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,180
If it's as you said,

379
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:42,660
why didn't you fall in love
with each other?

380
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,120
I called you out this time

381
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:46,000
because I want to tell you something.

382
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,660
I can take the initiative
to let the agency

383
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,730
cancel the contract.

384
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:49,690
You don't have to.

385
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:51,490
I thought you'd mind.

386
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,090
After all, you’re still young.

387
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:54,300
I'm afraid you

388
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:55,980
can't make clear the boundary
between life

389
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,470
and feelings.

390
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,190
Thank you for worrying about me.

391
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,600
Chu Chu.

392
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:05,990
Indeed, you’re older than me

393
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,500
and have richer experience than me,

394
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:09,400
but I hope you can know.

395
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,950
I’m Zhang Si Nian's wife.

396
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,840
I'm already a married woman.

397
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:14,070
Of course, I'm very clear

398
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,330
about the boundary between life and work.

399
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,200
Happy cooperation.

400
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,440
Happy cooperation.

401
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:42,760
[Inpatient]

402
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:57,850
Nurse.

403
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:58,950
You tried so many times.

404
00:20:59,040 --> 00:20:59,650
Sorry.

405
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,970
Your mother has thin blood vessels.

406
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,030
I'll try again.

407
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:02,950
Try?

408
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,530
So you're practising with my mum's hand?

409
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:05,820
-Sorry.
-Don't inject if you can't.

410
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:07,780
-Sorry.
-My mum's hand is swollen.

411
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,730
-Lin Nuo.
-Alright. It's okay.

412
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:10,750
Sorry.

413
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,950
Xia Lin, change the needle.

414
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,790
Granny, let me inject for you, okay?

415
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,760
Okay.

416
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,090
Granny.

417
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,690
At the first glance, I know

418
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,340
you enjoy the happiness of being
accompanied by sons and daughters.

419
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,810
Thank you.

420
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,310
Okay.

421
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:27,810
[Sorry. The subscriber you dialled is]

422

[Sorry. The subscriber you dialled]

423
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:27,930

424
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:29,130
[Dormitory]
[is unavailable right now.]

425
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:29,450
[is unavailable right now.]

426
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,310
[Please try again later.]

427
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,630
Why hasn't that stupid Lin Nuo
contacted me?

428
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,310
Or I'll do it myself.

429
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:38,270
Let me do this.

430
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,350
It's alright.

431
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,680
It’s a small cut.

432
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,300
It was all my fault.

433
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,630
It's not your fault. I was careless.

434
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,470
I don't know what was wrong with me.

435
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,380
What are you doing?

436
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:00,680
Yi Yi.

437
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,100
Lin Nuo.

438
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,510
So this is the reason
why you broke up with me?

439
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,770
No, what are you saying?

440
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,780
This woman.

441
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,500
You wanted to break up with me
because of her, right?

442
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:10,060
You're overthinking.

443
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,230
I was wondering why you didn't
come looking for me.

444
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,250
It turns out you've got new girlfriend.

445
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:15,570
Lin Nuo.

446
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:16,840
I'll go first.

447
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:18,490
Why are you leaving?

448
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:20,110
Let's make it clear together.

449
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,150
Gao Zhi Yi.

450
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:21,950
What are you doing?

451
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,430
This is a hospital.
Can you keep your voice down?

452
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,210
You know you're in a hospital?

453
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,900
What did you do just now?

454
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,120
We did nothing at all.

455
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:29,220
Let me explain.

456
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:31,150
I saw you. Why are you trying to deny it?

457
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,100
Lin Nuo, be a man and admit it.

458
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,960
Gao Zhi Yi, you’re always like this.

459
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,370
You always blame others for the mistakes.

460
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,630
Are you really faultless?

461
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,690
Can't you reflect on yourself for once?

462
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:44,350
Okay.

463
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,220
You want to break up with me, right?

464
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,450
Fine with me.

465
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,180
Mr. Zhang.

466
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,810
How do you view the world?

467
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:12,310
Why did you suddenly ask me that?

468
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,230
I just suddenly want to know.

469
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,650
The world is just one of the
mathematical forms

470
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,680
among an infinite number of posibilities.

471
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:24,530
That means

472
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,730
there're infinite
possibilities for mathematics.

473
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:27,970
Stop.

474
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:30,580
Don't explain.

475
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:32,470
I can't understand even if
you explain more.

476
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:35,110
-Then I'll ask you another question.
-Okay.

477
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:37,400
What are your plans for the future?

478
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:38,860
Win the Fields Medal

479
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,360
before 35 years old.

480
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,420
Then,

481
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,810
what's your life’s insight?

482
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:54,910
It’s my greatest luck

483
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:56,940
to have met you.

484
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:09,750
Answer it for me.

485
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,300
It's Shen Lan.

486
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,060
Answer it.

487
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,420
[Hello, Professor Zhang.]

488
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:19,710
Miss Shen.

489
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:20,770
I just heard that

490
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,280
you want to quit that project?

491
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:27,740
Miss Shen.

492
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,700
I’ve reported it to the

493
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:31,160
dean this afternoon

494
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,250
I'll quit

495
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:33,400
this project.

496
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:35,030
Why so sudden?

497
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,900
If you quit now,

498
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:38,020
all your efforts

499
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,480
will be wasted.

500
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:41,300
[How about you]

501
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:42,850
[think it over again?]

502
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,590
[Is it because of Yun Shu?]

503
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,980
[Are you worried]

504
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,900
[that working with Miss Lin]

505
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,760
[will make Yun Shu uncomfortable?]

506
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:50,860
Miss Shen,

507
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,930
I have something else to do.

508
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:53,940
I'm hanging up.

509
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,430
Did something happen?

510
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,000
Nothing.

511
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,340
We can continue cooking.

512
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,010
Is it because of me?

513
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,630
Don't overthink.

514
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,180
It has nothing to do with you.

515
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,310
I'll continue to wash the vegetables.

516
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:12,270
Okay.

517
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:46,780
Why are you

518
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:48,370
packing up my luggage now?

519
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,080
Just now

520
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:51,230
I just called Miss Shen Lan.

521
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:54,140
You rejected this project

522
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,580
for fear that

523
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:57,370
going to the retreat
with Chu Chu

524
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,850
would make me upset,

525
00:25:58,930 --> 00:25:59,810
right?

526
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,740
I'm just too tired recently.

527
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,650
And I want spend more time

528
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,030
with Grandpa.

529
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:12,220
Si Nian,

530
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,810
I'm not that childish.

531
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:15,760
I want to be the better half of you,

532
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,400
not your stumbling block.

533
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:19,500
Although

534
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,650
I don't quite understand your world view,

535
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:22,780
at least

536
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,390
I can try my best

537
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,750
for your life plan.

538
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,580
It's so late.

539
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:47,200
You have an appointment?

540
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:48,330
No.

541
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,770
Don't cry.

542
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,310
Yun Shu.

543
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,050
Yi Yi.

544
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:07,860
This time, I really

545
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:09,570
broke up with Lin Nuo.

546
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:11,290
Come on.

547
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,600
What's going on with you two?

548
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:15,460
Lin Nuo is a jerk.

549
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,810
He actually cheated on me.

550
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,960
He cheated on you?

551
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,430
I don't think

552
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,310
that's the right description.

553
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:29,470
He indeed cheated on me.

554
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,220
He and Xia Lin...

555
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,980
They two...

556
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,740
Oh, Yi Yi, you poor thing.

557
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,740
There's more.

558
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:45,180
Would you like some water?

559
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:49,110
Mr. Zhang.

560
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,540
I'm a little thirsty.

561
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,420
Can you get me a glass of water?

562
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:57,010
Let me get it.

563
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:59,180
Let me go.

564
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:00,480
Stay with her.

565
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:01,500
Thank you.

566
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:06,910
Yi Yi.

567
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,230
Is there any misunderstanding

568
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:10,300
between you?

569
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:11,820
Not at all.

570
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,210
I saw him

571
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:15,000
was holding the girl's hand.

572
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:17,530
They held hands?

573
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,060
You have no idea

574
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,230
how hard he scolded me.

575
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,440
Lin Nuo did?

576
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,400
I can't imagine it.

577
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:31,080
You're still defending him.

578
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,660
Not at all.

579
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,820
Lin Nuo is just a playboy.

580
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:36,540
He's a love rat.

581
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,750
Yeah. Love rat!

582
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,000
I'll scold him later.

583
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,030
Your eyes are swollen.

584
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:48,230
Yun Shu.

585
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,240
Can I sleep here

586
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,480
tonight?

587
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:54,990
I don't want to go back
to the dormitory.

588
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,310
I might die

589
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:58,510
if I'm by myself.

590
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:03,920
Miss Gao.

591
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,880
Have a glass of water.

592
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:11,800
Can I sleep here, Mr. Zhang?

593
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,660
Yi Yi, I'll sleep with you tonight.

594
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:23,830
Don't cry.

595
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:25,970
We'll share the bad, okay?

596
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,510
Drink the water.

597
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:30,500
Your voice is hoarse.

598
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:49,600
Yun Shu.

599
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:52,500
How long do you think
they've been together?

600
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,760
But I still think

601
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:59,390
Lin Nuo

602
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,510
wouldn't have done that.

603
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,030
But that's what he did.

604
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,360
He's gone too far, right?

605
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:16,560
Yun Shu, will you sleep with me?

606
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:24,190
Dear, I'll go back when
Yi Yi falls asleep.

607
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:25,810
Faking sleep?

608
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,680
Am I disturbing you?

609
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:37,970
No.

610
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:39,530
Don't say that.

611
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:42,080
It's... It's about my work.

612
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,200
Let me finish replying.

613
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,120
Are you tired?

614
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:53,090
How about

615
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:54,430
we just go to sleep?

616
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,710
Where are you going?

617
00:31:57,530 --> 00:31:59,790
I think if it's a little crowded.

618
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:01,630
So I want to

619
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,100
move to this side a little bit.

620
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,860
It's not crowded.

621
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,070
Okay then.

622
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:11,200
Let's sleep.

623
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:40,850
[Yun Shu.]

624
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:48,310
[Okay. A moment please.]

625
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:27,670
Yun Shu.

626
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,290
There's plenty of space.

627
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,700
My right arm is a little numb.

628
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:35,120
So I sat up

629
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,130
to stretch a little.

630
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,440
Come here.

631
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:43,970
Okay.

632
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:41,929
Lan.

633
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:43,239
Someone is here to see you.

634
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,239
Who is it?

635
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:49,900
Hello.

636
00:34:49,989 --> 00:34:51,250
I'm Lu Yu's agent.

637
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:52,100
You can call me Xi Xi.

638
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:54,159
Hello, I'm Yun Lan.

639
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:56,159
Yun Lan.

640
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:57,920
I know about

641
00:34:58,010 --> 00:34:59,150
what happened to you and Lu Yu.

642
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,640
Since you're family,

643
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,280
I'll cut to the chase.

644

[Lawyer's Letter]

649
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,640
I believe you should know

650
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:25,580
the name, Han Rong, right?

651
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,970
Han Rong sued Lu Yu

652
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,460
for intentional injury?

653
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:30,460
What's going on?
