[Mr. Zhang,
I have to work overtime tonight.]

00:02:24,579 --> 00:02:25,750
[I'll return home late.]

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,310
[Okay.]

7
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,579
Professor Wu.

8
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:30,000
-Have you seen the news alert?
-No.

9
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,590
It says there will be a
massive drop in temperature tonight.

10
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,640
Really?

11
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:35,290
No wonder it's so cold.

12
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,170
I will go off work now.

13
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,300
Put on more clothes.

14
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,350
I'm off.

15
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,320
See you tomorrow.

16
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:47,690
Hey.

17
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,230
Please don't trouble me any more.

18
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,829
That's the warden's job.

19
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,120
You should cherish the chance.

20
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:54,210
In future, my dear Gu
will handle these things.

21
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,579
I really can't figure it out.

22
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,670
Why you girls

23
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,840
cover the flush with so much effort

24
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,260
then draw it on your face?

25
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:02,360
Well.

26
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,270
Pluck your eyebrows, then draw them.

27
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,400
Why?

28
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,290
You don't need to know it.

29
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:07,320
As long as my dear Gu knows it.

30
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:08,760
Dear Gu!

31
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,760
By the way.

32
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:11,930
That barrel water.

33
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,180
Change it for me, OK?

34
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:14,330
Thanks.

35
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,690
Gao Zhi Yi, I tell you

36
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,980
I will charge you if you
ask me to do it any more.

37
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,320
Be satisfied.

38
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:20,490
Next time?

39
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,990
You won't have another chance.

40
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:22,720
Such matters will all be done

41
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,160
by dear Gu.

42
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:26,500
I mean, be careful tonight.

43
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,940
Gu Xiao doesn't look like

44
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:28,800
a gentleman.

45
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:31,270
You are just jealous of me.

46
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,540
I am serious about it.

47
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:34,120
Do you still remember the day of birthday?

48
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,350
Girls who went there are really charming.

49
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,970
Nothing happens for no reason.

50
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,820
So, Gu Xiao cannot be a gentleman.

51
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:42,480
Are you

52
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,579
jealous?

53
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,120
I am just worried about you.

54
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,570
Shall I go with you tonight?

55
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,240
Nope! Urgh.

56
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:49,880
No one would take her ex to date.

57
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,520
I am for your good!

58
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,730
If you feel happy.

59
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:54,180
You may lose your money and dignity!

60
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,910
I cherish my dignity, OK?

61
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,220
You!

62
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,990
Fine, Gao Zhi Yi.

63
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,800
How dare you to do this to your ex!

64
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,230
I mean, if I am a little slower,

65
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,830
I would be disfigured.

69

A comic book.

70
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:18,839
What's the matter?

71
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:19,870
Cartoons.

72
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,519
What's it about?

73
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,200
-He does not have any friends-

74
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,600
The author of this cartoon

75
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:26,060
is Jun Sakura.

76
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,150
He has been drawing this

77
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:29,390
- for seven years.
- For seven years.

78
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,300
Good for you, Yun Shu.

79
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,070
It's not so popular in China.

80
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:35,820
I never imagined that you are

81
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:37,140
- also a fan like me.
- Also a fan like me.

82
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,870
I don't care whether
he has friends or not.

83
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,750
But today, I have a new friend.

84
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,720
Me too.

85
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,080
I finally have a friend

86
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:45,750
who also loves this cartoon.

87
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,020
I don't quite agree.

88
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,550
I didn't say that.

89
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,480
He is so cold

90
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,159
and impersonal.

91
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,270
Maybe he's good in a cartoon.

92
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,520
But he's too mean in reality.

93
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,580
But in real life, I have

94
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:02,810
a friend just like him.

95
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,500
Me too!

96
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:05,720
Really?

97
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:06,910
Such a coincidence！

98
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,180
Tell me.

99
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,790
How do you know

100
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,220
him?

101
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,510
Well.

102
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,510
That's a long story.

103
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,270
The subscriber you dialed is power off.

104
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,290
So.

105
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,510
Thanks to him

106
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:49,200
I didn't lose too much

107
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,150
because of my cousin.

108
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,620
Also because of him

109
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,520
I can make it so far.

110
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,659
And doing quite well.

111
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,520
Then what's the relationship

112
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,190
between you two？

113
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,710
Relationship?

114
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,800
Friends, maybe.

115
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,340
Just friends?

116
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,830
Didn't you go further?

117
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:12,760
No.

118
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,510
I think you have fallen in love

119
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,970
with him.

120
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,280
No！

121
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,710
Don't you know

122
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,710
about his character.

123
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,160
How dare I!

Lawyer Meng.

126
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,950
How did you get to know Mr. Zhang?

127
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,650
So, it's not a coincidence for
you to come to the supermarket.

128
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,470
It's Mr. Zhang who told you.

129
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,730
It's Zhang Si Nian who
recommended you to me.

130
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,490
Then I went to the
supermarket and got to know you.

131
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,200
Finally you came to the law office.

132
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,390
But I want to tell you, Yun Shu.

133
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:06,510
After you had this job,

134
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,840
you really surprise me

135
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,400
with your performance and efforts.

136
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,720
For me, it's a huge surprise.

137

You have come up to this job

139

We

140
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,310
all want to help you.

141
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,820
So please don't mind about

142
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,900
how you get this job.

143
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:25,350
Don't worry.

144
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,870
No matter how I get this job,

145
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,940
I will do my best to complete it.

146
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,440
Hello, sir.

147
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:47,409
May I ask...

148
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,030
Sorry.

149
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,680
I am looking for someone.

150
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:50,750
OK, excuse me.

151
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,720
Thanks.

152
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,620
Why are you drinking here?

153
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:58,060
Gao Zhi Yi, please be mature.

154
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:35,080
Gu Xiao is not a

155
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:36,700
gentleman at all.

[Gu Xiao]

157
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,880
Hello.

158
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,070
Lin Nuo.

159
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:04,150
Why are you here?

160
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,230
Well.

161
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:06,640
I...

162
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,950
Why am I here?

163
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:10,510
Yiyi has drunk too much.

164
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,270
It's too late now.

165
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,800
She cannot go back to her dormitory.

166
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,030
So I booked a room, and let her rest here.

167
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:17,310
I call you

168
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,880
to ask you to come
here and look after her.

169
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:21,980
After all, it isn't suitable
for me to be here.

170
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,720
Then, please take care of her.

171
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:25,690
I gotta go.

172
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:28,260
Play basketball together some time.

173
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:43,980
Yiyi.

174
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:45,080
Are you OK?

175
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:49,680
Lin Nuo.

176
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:50,620
What's the matter?

177
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:52,070
Come on, you are not drunk at all.

178
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,460
Of course I am not.

179
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,440
Don't you know about how much I can drink?

180
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:57,110
I have seen you downstairs.

181
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,150
Why are you here?

182
00:09:58,650 --> 00:09:58,960
I...  

183
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,630
I am worried about you

184
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,660
I saw Gu Xiao making
you drink all the time.

185
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:04,800
I had a hard time

186
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,480
to find a pleasing boyfriend.

187
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,080
May you please stop
the surveillance on me?

188
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:09,570
It's not surveillance.

189
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,270
I am

190
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,420
afraid that he doesn't
show respect to you.

191
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,270
Please.  

192
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,390
I am voluntary, OK?!

193
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,230
You have seen it.

194
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,440
He is a gentleman.

195
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:18,150
Why are you thinking him so bad?

196
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,360
No,

197
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,910
I am not!

198
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,160
I...

199
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:24,810
I mean.

200
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,420
Do you still like me?

201
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,800
Not at all!

202
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,350
Well.

203
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,310
You are my ex, not my dad.

204
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,300
I am an adult now.

205
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,090
Even if I was cheated and tricked by him,

206
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,610
I am willing to.

207
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,580
OK.

208
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:40,770
Whatever.

209
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:48,960
I didn't expect that we both like it.

210
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,240
So you have only read

211
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:51,350
it for a time.

212
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,390
And I got you?

213
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,360
Yeah.

214
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:58,570
Yun Shu.

215
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,550
Put my clothes on.

216
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:00,520
It's alright.

217
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,320
I am not cold.

218
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,730
You will catch a cold.

219
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,720
No, thanks.

220
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:04,640
I am not cold.

221
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:05,610
No need.

222
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:08,700
Why are you here?

223
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,220
Come here.

224
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,270
You came to pick me up？

225
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:30,850
Yeah.

226
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,180
Mr. Zhang is so considerate.

227
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,040
I have to keep my own things well.

228
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,830
Let's go home.

229
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,590
Hold on, Mr. Zhang.

230
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,520
Tonight

231
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,520
I was going to have dinner

232
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:58,780
with Yun Shu.

233
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,560
Do you want to come together?

234
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,120
Really?

235
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:05,490
Yes.

236
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,080
OK.

237
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,620
Just order what you like.

238
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,150
So delicious!

239
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,520
What do you want?

240
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,840
What's the smell?

241
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:25,760
Is it not so clean?

242
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:27,170
Shall we change a restaurant?

243
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,430
Smell?

244
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,330
Mr. Zhang.

245
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:33,260
I bet you haven't tasted Luosifen.

246
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,280
I am ordering.

247
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,830
A bowl of Luosifen with pig's intestines.

248
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,530
A quail egg.

249
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:41,200
Sour bamboo shoot, meat of snail

250
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,520
and Fried Toufu.

251
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:43,880
Good for you, Yun Shu.

252
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:44,930
Good taste.

253
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:46,630
You know Super Luosifen.

254
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,580
This is not the super one.

255
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,520
For it lacks...

256
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,150
- Fried Beancurd Sticks.
- Fried Beancurd Sticks.

257
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,040
Stop showing off.

258
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:00,010
Come on.

259
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,230
I want the same one with Yun Shu's.

260
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:05,970
Don't you order, Mr. Zhang?

261
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,870
I can share with Yun Shu.

262
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,080
OK?

263
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:12,010
It's not sanitary to share a bowl.

264
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:14,190
Let's separate the food. 

265
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,350
I'll go to order.

266
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,430
She already knows it.

267
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,570
When you called me,

268
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,260
she was just aside.

269
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,230
She saw everything.

270
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:25,760
Then...

271
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,180
She said that she doesn't care

272
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,450
how she got this job

273
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:32,160
and that she will treasure it.

274
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,450
Zhang Si Nian.

275
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,960
You have a good taste.

276
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,160
Yun Shu is a good girl.

277
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,590
That's none of your business.

278
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,190
Yun Shu is my wife.

279
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,030
Contracted wife!

280
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,210
To be specific,

281
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,240
according to the contract,

282
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,370
you are at most

283
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,350
roommates.

284
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,040
What's your position?

285
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,420
What are you talking about?

286
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:57,380
Something happy?

287
00:13:58,770 --> 00:13:59,750
Yes.

288
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:02,950
That's right.

289
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:15,550
Mr. Zhang.

290
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:16,950
Thank you.

291
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,600
Just deliver you clothes.

292
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,130
Never mind.

293
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:23,640
No.

294
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:24,910
I mean the job.

295
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,190
Thanks for recommending me.

296
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,260
This job...

297
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:33,830
I just said it casually.

298
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:35,370
It's your own efforts to work

299
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,360
in the law office.

300
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:37,990
I will try hard

301
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,630
and learn from Lawyer Meng.

302
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,290
I will

303
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,840
live up to your expectation.

304
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:44,370
Mr. Zhang.

305
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,340
Are you OK?

306
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:46,880
Aren't you having a cold?

307
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:47,890
Of course not.

308
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,550
This kind of temperature

309
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,750
doesn't pose a threat to me.

310
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,260
Please come in.

311
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,090
Mr. Zhang.

312
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,110
I think you have a little cold.

313
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,580
No, I don't have a cold.

314
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,090
It's the best if you are fine. 

315
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,640
I have cooked ginger decoction for you.

316
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:38,680
It's good for both curing and prevention.

317
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:39,810
You can have a try.

318
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,760
I'm OK.

319
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,720
Thank you.

320
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,240
And I doubt

321
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:44,360
it will prevent or

322
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:45,410
cure colds

323
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,610
deeply.

324
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,190
Such folk prescription

325
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,150
is not reliable

326
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,830
in terms of the evidence gathering

327
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,000
and resulting.

328
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:52,570
OK.

329
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,800
If you don't want, I will take it away.

330
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:54,770
Wait.

331
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,980
Don't you refuse to drink?

332
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,100
I will prove it unreliable

333
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,230
myself.

334
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,320
Hot.

335
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,460
Why are you in such a hurry?

336
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:15,390
Let me cool it off.

337
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,690
Now better.

338
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:26,260
Is it?

339
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:30,960
Quite delicious?

340
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,640
OK.

341
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:46,990
Let's go.

342
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:50,050
Yu.

343
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,630
What are you busy for these days?

344
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,900
You haven't been out
with us for a long time.

345
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,000
Tonight we have a party.

346
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:56,010
Full of beauties.

347
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,720
Will you hang out with us tonight?

348
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:58,400
No, thanks.

349
00:16:58,490 --> 00:16:59,810
I have something to do tonight.

350
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,710
What is more important than drinking?

351
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,680
Bingbing.

352
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,300
Do you have a dream?

353
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:06,310
Don't you think we should
practice out acting skills

354
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,250
for the future of China's movie industry?

355
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:09,810
Yu.

356
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,250
I found that

357
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:11,859
I cannot keep up with you.

358
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,130
Please go on your practice. 

359
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:14,940
I will go drinking.

360
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,569
It's such a long way.

361
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:21,230
It seems only Yun Lan
can accompany with me.

362
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,000
I think our friendship comes to an end

363
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:26,970
tonight.

364
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,460
Then we should think about our love.

365
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:39,310
Knock it off!

366
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,740
There must be something wrong
with my opening.

367
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:43,360
What?

368
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:45,720
The TV drama that Zhao wants you to act.

369
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:46,690
It has forty episodes.

370
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:47,950
Forty?

371
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,320
That's too long.

372
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:50,730
Alright.

373
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,060
I also think the law
topic isn't suitable for you.

374
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:54,770
Hold on.

375
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,460
Law?

376
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,280
Yeah.

377
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,080
Law.

378
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:01,270
You will act a lawyer.

379
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,580
Lawyer?

380
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:04,960
Law!

381
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,090
Mr. Zhang.

382
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,560
If you are not feeling
well, just get more sleep.

383
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,100
Today I will go to work by metro.

384
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,670
The ginger decoction really works.

385
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,860
Yun Shu.

386
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,390
Lawyer Meng.

387
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,360
You're looking for me?

388
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:44,610
Liane.

389
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,610
I'm going to sign you up for a class.

390
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,360
The company will pay for it.

391
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,190
OK.

392
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,320
What is it about?

393
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:50,750
Economics or Criminal Law?

394
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,940
Emotion Management.

395
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,520
Emotion Management?

396
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,430
I mean, you are skilled
at divorce lawsuits.

397
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,400
There's no doubt on your professionalism.

398
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:57,350
Why did you show your

399
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,560
personal emotions

400
00:18:58,650 --> 00:18:59,430
to the client?

401
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,870
It's Gao Mei's lawsuit.

402
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,450
You know how many lawsuits do we have 

403
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,560
with Gao Mei.

404
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,660
For this time, Gao Mei has done too much.

405
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:09,160
It's her who should go to
learn emotion management.

406
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,440
There is only one person allowed.

407
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:11,630
Either you go

408
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,160
or you persuade her to go.

409
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,000
I see.

410
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:18,300
After this, I will just tolerate everything she does
even if it's swearing or beating.

411
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,600
I will make her satisfied.

412
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:21,870
Gao Mei will be here after a while.

413
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,460
Do I need to buy you an insurance?

414
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,420
No, thanks.

415
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,250
Are you my lawyer, or his?

416
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:34,520
He has an affair with other
woman, and transferred his property.

417
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:36,020
He wants me to afford half of his debts.

418
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,550
Why are you telling
me to make up with him?

419
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,480
Miss Gao.

420
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:40,260
Please calm down.

421
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,100
Calm?

422
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:41,970
How can I be calm?

423
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,510
Why should I be calm?

424
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:46,390
How can you solve the
problem without being calm?

425
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,480
Mei.

426
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,080
I made this coffee for you myself.

427
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,040
Have a taste.

428
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:57,320
Liane.

429
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:58,710
What's going on?

430
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:03,610
Yun Shu.

431
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:04,460
Miss Gao

432
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:07,030
wants a divorce in three months.

433
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,560
But our evidence now

434
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,160
isn't enough to prove her
ex-husband transferred property.

435
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,420
So the plan provided is

436
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,100
propose an out-of-court settlement.

437
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,210
Do I have to pay so much to you

438
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:21,390
if I want an out-of-court settlement?

439
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:22,880
Did you make any deal

440
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,930
with the lawyers of my

441
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,000
ex-husband?

442
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,360
That's why you want this?

443
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:27,690
Miss Gao.

444
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,720
You can question my ability.

445
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:30,290
But please don't

446
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,160
insult me on my professional ethics.

447
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,520
Mei.

448
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:34,490
Well.

449
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:37,030
Liane just made reasonable plans

450
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:37,650
according to the present evidence

451
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,610
to satisfy your needs as much as we can.

452
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,630
Well.

453
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,600
Don't worry.

454
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,510
If you are unsatisfied,

455
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,020
we can make further adjustments.

456
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:46,560
How can I calm down.

457
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:48,560
Every day, I am harassed by

458
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:49,960
banks and guarantee companies.

459
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:51,150
The account of my own company

460
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,630
faces the risk to be frozen any time.

461
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,840
How can I calm down?

462
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:55,190
It nearly drives me mad!

463
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,710
What's the use of worrying?

464
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,970
It's all because of

465
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,390
your incompetence.

466
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:01,240
Mei.

467
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:02,390
Don't get angry.

468
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:05,450
Yun Shu.

469
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,030
Are you OK, Yun Shu?

470
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,090
Sorry!

471
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,270
I don't mean it.

472
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,730
Let's take her to the hospital.

473
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:12,440
No, I am fine.

474
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:13,270
In fact...

475
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:14,230
Mei.

476
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,990
As a lawyer, I suggest you.

477
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,400
No one can plan your life

478
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:18,690
as you wish.

479
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,560
As a man,

480
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:20,760
I suggest you

481
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,240
there is no man in this world

482
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:23,470
who loves women of bad temper.

483
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,720
If you have vigor.

484
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:25,690
Go to collect the evidence

485
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:26,720
of your husband's affairs.

486
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:30,120
Or you can accept our suggestion of
settlement out of court as soon as possible.

487
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:31,040
Yun Shu.

488
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:31,830
Endure it.

489
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,150
I will take you to hospital.

490
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:45,410
[Emergency]

491
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:45,850
[Emergency]
I'm sorry. 

492
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:46,490
I'm sorry. 

493
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:47,790
I was so angry just now.

494
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,590
I didn't expect it to be so bad.

495
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:50,480
Lawyer Meng.

496
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:51,080
Sorry.

497
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:52,470
It's not me who injured.

498
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,510
It's alright.

499
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,610
The doctor has said

500
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,000
it's just a scald.

501
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:57,160
It will be better after a few days.

502
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,120
Yun Shu.

503
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,590
Being kind is not advantages.

504
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:00,730
Lawyer Meng.

505
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,260
Mei doesn't really mean it.

506
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,090
This accident happened in the company.

507
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:06,040
I have the obligation
to deal with it for you.

508
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,230
You have to believe me

509
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:08,990
I can deal with it myself.

510
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,750
Yun Shu.

511
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,310
I will agree to 

512
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,470
any compensation scheme you proposed.

513
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:16,030
I don't know what's going on.

514
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,000
I cannot control myself at all.

515
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:19,780
I get angry easily.

516
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,780
You are just under too much burden these days.

517
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,710
The divorce

518
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:27,030
really messes me up.

519
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:28,640
I can neither do well in my company

520
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,840
nor get along with my child.

521
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:33,630
Maybe I am really

522
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,270
an unqualified woman.

523
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:35,960
Mei.

524
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:37,500
Don't say that.

525
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:38,580
I don't think so.

526
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:41,550
We all prefer to deal with
problems with our emotions.

527
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,410
But if so, it will only be worse.

528
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,070
Sometimes, we need to change an approach.

529
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,380
The answer will come out itself.

530
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:52,530
Yun Shu.

531
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:53,630
Thank you.

532
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,460
This is the most sincere

533
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,400
advise that I have heard for half a year.

534
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:58,720
May I ask who will

535
00:22:58,810 --> 00:22:59,960
pay the bill?

536
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:00,930
The bill came out.

537
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:01,920
I will go.

538
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:02,990
Just have a rest.

539
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:04,800
Come here.

540
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:05,780
Follow me.

541
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:08,170
You just shouldn't

542
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:11,270
forgive her so easily.

543
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,230
People only grow in education.

544
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:17,300
I don't want to punish a mother

545
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:19,110
because of

546
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,820
these matters.

547
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:22,140
That's not what I want.

548
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:26,780
You impress me indeed.

549
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:28,840
Are you hungry?

550
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:30,120
You haven't eaten for such a long time.

551
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:31,360
I will buy you something good to eat.

552
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,720
Thanks.

553
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:33,690
By the way.

554
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:35,470
You just said that

555
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,360
dealing with emotions

556
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:38,610
doesn't help it

557
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:39,880
at all.

558
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:42,480
That sounds quite familiar.

559
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:43,820
It's said by Mr. Zhang.

560
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:54,570
Why are you here?

561
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,070
How did Yun Shu injure?

562
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:58,410
Empyrosis

563
00:23:58,490 --> 00:23:59,910
made by a client accidentally.

564
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:01,400
What did the doctor say?

565
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:03,480
Nothing serious.

566
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,280
Don't touch water.

567
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:06,690
Have a good rest.

568
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:07,630
Where were you then?

569
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,600
Just there.

570
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:10,820
Thanks so much.

571
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:13,610
Yun Shu.

572
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:14,280
Lawyer Meng.

573
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:15,250
Where is Mei?

574
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:16,750
She just left.

575
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:18,180
Mr. Zhang.

576
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:21,850
Does it hurt?

577
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:22,680
No, it's OK.

578
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:24,240
Doctor says it's not serious.

579
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,400
It will be better after a few days.

580
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:26,830
I have told you before.

581
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,350
The company is complicated and dangerous.

582
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,940
Do be more careful.

583
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,500
Why are you so careless?

584
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:34,030
Complicated and dangerous?

585
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:35,520
This is a law office.

586
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:36,670
Not the wolf den.

587
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,940
Nothing dangerous, OK?!

588
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,000
Then please explain

589
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,270
why Yun Shu got bodily injury?

590
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:44,330
Mr. Zhang, you are
using wrong words again.

591
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,210
Bodily injury

592
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,160
means damaging the
completeness of human body

593
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,510
or destroying the main
functions of human organs.

594
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,240
Yun Shu got a scald.

595
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,520
Then you think.

596
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:55,310
Yun Shu didn't get harm heavily enough?

597
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,400
Please don't mistake my meaning.

598
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,330
I am just correcting your misuse of words.

599
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:02,830
Yun Shu.

600
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,690
Newly fried.

601
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,660
Have a taste.

602
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,780
Wait.

603
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:09,390
Oil fried food is not
good for the healing.

604
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:10,440
Yun Shu.

605
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:11,450
I will take you home.

606
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,270
That's okay.

607
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:12,920
You haven't eaten for a day.

608
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:14,140
Have some.

609
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:15,470
Don't take it.

610
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,440
Let me feed you.

611
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:21,340
Did you wash your hands?

612
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,460
Of course yes.

613
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,820
You... I...

614
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,840
No...

615
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,820
Stop it! Both of you.

616
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,350
I will not eat.

617
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,000
Come on, Yun Shu.

618
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:48,810
OK. I will do it myself.

619
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:49,780
Thanks. Lawyer Meng.

620
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,760
Who is the relative of Yun Shu?

621
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:55,070
Take the wheelchair here.

622
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:56,290
I...

623
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:58,500
I am her boss.

624
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:01,460
I am her husband.

625
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:22,300
Yun Lan.  

626
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:24,150
I want to introduce a friend to you.

627
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,030
Lawyer Yun.

628
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:32,420
You seem quite different in saying hello.

629
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,450
So.

630
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:34,580
You know each other?

631
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:43,550
Be my assistant? 

632
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:45,000
Mr. Lu

633
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,260
is going to act in a law TV series.

634
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:49,260
We have the honor to cooperate with him.

635
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:50,230
What do you mean?

636
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:51,280
In the future three months,

637
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,200
he will experience the life here

638
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:54,280
being your assistant.

639
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:55,480
Why me?

640
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:56,500
Of course it's you.

641
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,430
You are the trump card.

642
00:26:58,510 --> 00:26:59,260
Trump card?!

643
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,700
Mr. Liu, you know.

644
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:02,870
I have the cooperation with Xinda.

645
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:04,370
How can I spare time to train

646
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:06,120
newcomers?

647
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,080
See.

648
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:10,000
Don't shrink from difficulties.

649
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,020
Mr. Lu is so famous now.

650
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:13,680
This will achieve

651
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:15,170
better promotion effect.

652
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,870
Don't refuse.

653
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,240
Lawyer Yun.

654
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,840
I would appreciate your advice.

655
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:30,880
Since I am a trainee,

656
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,090
I think

657
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:34,350
I should start from the very basic...

658
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:36,710
Send all papers of enterprise cooperation

659
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:37,990
in the two previous years

660
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,190
to my office.

661
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,360
So firstly,

662
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:42,650
I want to invite you

663
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:44,040
to my home to make a good teaching

664
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:45,640
of what's about law.

665
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:47,440
Please come in.

666
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:47,910
Lan.

667
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,110
This is the materials you need.

668
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,080
Put them there.

669
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:53,450
Thanks.

670
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:55,120
Lawyer Yun.

671
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:56,720
Please have some rest while working hard.

672
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:57,600
So much work.

673
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:58,630
When can you finish it?

674
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,830
Not mine.

675
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:01,450
Yours.

676
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:04,350
Don't you say you want to start from zero.

677
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:07,150
Read all cases in a weak

678
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,040
make two conclusions of each case,

679
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:09,440
and hand them in to me.

680
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:10,460
On Monday?

681
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:13,880
Today is already Friday, sis!

682
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:15,080
You have seven days a week.

683
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:16,840
Don't you have holiday in law office?

684
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,040
I don't know others.

685
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,230
I never have one.

686
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,600
Mr. Lu, if you think this is too hard

687
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:24,400
and you cannot handle.

688
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:26,280
You can tell Director Liu
to change someone for you.

689
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:27,400
Lawyer Gao Nan over there.

690
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:27,930
She...

691
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:28,900
Don't...

692
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:29,970
I just love this kind of

693
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:31,920
busy and full life.

694
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:32,940
Monday is OK.

695
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:52,830
Read them out of the room.

696
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:55,610
Something needs to be changed

697
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:57,200
in your schedule.

698
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:57,990
When I arrive home,

699
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,600
I will send you after finishing it.

700
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:01,030
And the Annual Meeting...

701
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:01,840
Yun Shu.

702
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:03,280
Don't worry about your work any more.

703
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:04,240
Have a good rest at home.

704
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:05,870
Read more comics.

705
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,920
There are new updates?

706
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,300
I will read them the moment I arrive home.

707
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:13,380
You said you will work just now!

708
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:16,490
Well, Mr. Meng.

709
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:17,950
I have a request.

710
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:18,800
Go ahead.

711
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:20,250
Can you continue 

712
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:22,040
Gao Mei's cases on your own?

713
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,670
She is living hard recently.

714
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:25,780
So...

715
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,430
I will say yes to any of your request.

716
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:29,510
Be careful of your hands.

717
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:48,530
Liane.

718
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,460
Make Yun Shu a full-time worker.

719
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:52,020
Add her an accident injury insurance.

720
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:52,880
In addition.

721
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:54,720
Update companies' security system.

722
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:56,710
Add a camera in every meeting room.

723
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:12,850
Who is Gao Mei? 

724
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:16,430
The client who scalded me.

725
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,000
So I guess I was right.

726
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,610
Did I do something wrong?

727
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:28,290
No.

728
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:29,980
You are yourself.

729
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:31,790
As long as you're happy.

730
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:47,150
By the way.

731
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,460
What's the name of uploaded comics?

732
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:55,660
-He does not have any friends-

733
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,540
The one said by Lawyer Meng?

734
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,110
You are finally awake.

735
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:27,090
What time is it?

736
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,820
Mr. Lu, you slept like a log.

737
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:31,640
From 3:00 p.m.

738
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:32,630
to 9:30 p.m.

739
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,110
You didn't wake up one time.

740
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:35,170
For many times

741
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,850
I nearly tested your breath.

742
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:39,070
Where are you going?

743
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,480
Go home.

744
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:42,210
I will send you back.

745
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,330
Don't bother.

746
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,430
I can go back myself.

747
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:45,910
What's your problem?

748
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:47,550
Why did your attitude change? 

749
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,740
Mr. Lu.

750
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:50,670
Maybe you get the wrong feelings.

751
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:54,150
My feet are numb. 

752
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,840
Scissors.

753
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:31,720
What are you laughing about?

754
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:32,910
I'm not laughing.

755
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,220
Maybe don't take a shower.

756
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:46,270
Do it after you take off the bandage.

757
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,830
If I don't have a shower for five days,

758
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,720
Mr. Zhang, 

759
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:50,700
will you throw me out?

760
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:53,630
It sounds reasonable.

761
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,400
But I think you shouldn't
have a shower tonight.

762
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:10,760
After all, your wound hasn't recovered.

763
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,900
It's alright.

764
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:13,760
I can do it.

765
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:14,730
Don't be worried.

766
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:16,400
Ok, I am taking a shower.

767
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:17,370
Go out.

768
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,940
I will go for you after shower.

769
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:23,100
I didn't want an answer from you.

770
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:27,840
To be frank,

771
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:29,990
I do feel much better now

772
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,580
than before.

773
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,290
But even in this case.

774
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,950
I cannot cheat myself

775
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:40,430
or you anymore.

776
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,570
Yun Shu.

777
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:46,200
What's the matter?

778
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:46,910
I am fine.

779
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,400
Just slipped.

780
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,000
Is it serious?

781
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:50,960
It's OK.

782
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:52,020
I can get up myself.

783
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:54,150
Be careful.

784
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:58,970
May I come in?

785
00:33:59,060 --> 00:33:59,670
No.

786
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,830
Don't! Mr. Zhang!

787
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:02,470
I am just wearing a batherobe.

788
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,070
Nothing inside.

789
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:05,410
♫ Turning off the lights
in search of its trace ♫

790
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:06,670
Can you get up?

791
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:08,270
Be careful.

792
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:10,659
♫ Turning off the lights
in search of its trace ♫

793
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,810
♫ I walk steadily
on the path beneath my feet ♫

794
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:14,600
Yun Shu.

795
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:15,590
I am coming in.

796
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:17,080
♫ I walk steadily
on the path beneath my feet ♫

797
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,440
♫ I hear someone asking,
are you still here? ♫

798
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,320
Where are you?

799
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,080
♫ I hear someone asking,
are you still here? ♫

800
00:34:23,489 --> 00:34:29,280
♫ The kind person replies,
I've always been here ♫

801
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:32,440
♫ This love cuts through the crowd
in search of me ♫

802
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:32,960
♫ It isn't easy ♫

803
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,540
I...

804
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,730
Just in front of you.

805
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:35,020
Just in front of you.

806
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:36,699
Don't move.

807
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:37,840
I am walking toward you.

808
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,600
♫ I only wish to cherish it with you ♫

809
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,110
♫ Each and every moment ♫

810
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:40,800
Grab on my hand.

811
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,179
Grab on my hand.

812
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:47,000
♫ If I missed out, I will meet you again
in another lifetime ♫

813
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:48,170
♫ I recognise your eyes,
a secret that belongs to me ♫

814
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:48,860
Where is your wound?

815
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:51,120
Arm and leg.

816
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:52,090
Did it bleed?

817
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:53,460
No.

818
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:54,350
I will take you out now.

819
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:54,909
I will take you out now.

820
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:59,550
Hold me on my neck.

821
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,160
Another hand.

822
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,400
Grab it tight.

823
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,950
Are you ready?

824
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,480
I am opening my eyes now.

825
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:17,510
I am opening my eyes now.

826
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:22,600
♫ The night will pass,
I am the dawn ♫

827
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:28,640
♫ Protecting this innocence,
evident in your eyes ♫

828
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,940
♫ I hear someone asking,
do dreams come to an end? ♫
