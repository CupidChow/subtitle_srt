Mr. Zhang.

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,100
What's going on?

6
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,860
Stop here.

7
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,840
I'm afraid that I won't

8
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,430
go through security

9
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,430
and go on board later

because of you.

11

OK.

13
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,230
Check whether everything is ready.

14
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,190
Remember the passport.

15
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,350
It's alright.

16
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,760
They're all in it.

17
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,370
Alright.

Go or you will miss the plane.

Yun Shu, I'm really sorry

28
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,570
because I can't go with you.

29
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,970
I hope what I prepared

30
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,220

31
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,040

36
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,170
First,

37
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,040
go and get a local bank card

38
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,390
and a transportation card.

39
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,720
I've written

40
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,920
down the specific address.

41
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,630
To get to the studio, take the subway

42
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,790
to the Hanzomon Jimbocho station.

43
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,550
You can get there

44

straight from Exit No. 8.

45
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,060
With my friend's help,

46
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:45,010
I rented an apartment for you

47
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,890
very close to your comic studio.

48
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,260
It's a five-minute

49
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:49,970
walk away.

50
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,310
In the vicinity of your apartment,

51
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,630
there are 144 restaurants

52
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,159
within five km.

53
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,740
There is a Chinese Restaurant

54
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,340
200 meters away from your apartment.

55
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:02,190
The food there is authentic.

56
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,020
In the vicinity of your apartment,

57
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,440
there are also 5 convenience stores.

58
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,810
You can pay by mobile phone.

59

be safe

61
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,210
because you live alone.

62

Put a pair of male shoes on the porch.

63

65

66

mine into

67

your suitcase.

68
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,040
Yun Shu, why...

69
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,840
You're really eager to let me go abroad.

70
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,320
So,

71
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,610
how could you know I'm here?

72
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,310
In the past,

73
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,560
when I was in a bad mood,

74
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,940
I would go to the cinema alone

75
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,570
to watch a comedy.

76
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,360
It's the best way for me

77
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,970
to get relieved.

78
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,190
You're taking revenge on me?

79
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,900
You know I don't want you

80
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,860
to lose the chance.

81
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:11,960
I know.

82
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,350
I didn't go.

83
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,640
This may seem childish

84
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,040
and impulsive,

85
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:22,190
but it's definitely not
a random decision.

86
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:27,170
I know it means a lot to me.

87
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,040
But I believe I'll have

88
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,740
the same chance again.

89
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,409
You gave up what you like

90
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,270
and what you're good at.

91
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,040
Mr. Zhang.

92
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,420
You and grandpa are my family.

93

You're irreplaceable for me.

94
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:06,160
And

95
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:09,360
I didn't say I would give up
making comics.

96
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,540
I will keep doing it.

97
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,370
But I want to keep doing it

98
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,470
with the one I love.

99
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:25,170
Thanks, Yun Shu.

100
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,640
You can always throw light on me

101
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:30,670
at critical times.

102
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,490
Let's move back to grandpa's house.

103
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:42,049
OK.

104
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,600
By the way,

105
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,420
I dropped my

106
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,560
suitcase at the airport.

107
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,240
We can get it back

108
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,840
after the movie.

109
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,010
Mei, I'm really sorry.

110
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,180
I was too capricious.

111
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:41,660
I'm willing to draw pictures for the
company without pay

112
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,970
for three years to repay your kindness.

113
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,630
Alright.

114
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,810
Just kidding.

115
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,000
I thought you're really mad.

116
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,440
I'm not mad at you.

117
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,550
I can understand your choice.

118
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,950
When I was young,

119
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,770
I put love above everything.

120
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,360
So, Mei,

121
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:05,110
do you still believe in love?

122
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:08,360
If I didn't believe in love,

123
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,360
I wouldn't publish Perfect

124
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:12,020
and Casual.

125
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:14,210
I

126
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:17,360
still believe in love.

127
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:18,840
Mei.

128
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:20,470
You're so handsome.

129
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,360
Come on, save it.

130
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:24,490
Give me a break.

131
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,350
I'll give you one week off

132
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,210
to spend time with your grandpa-in-law.

133
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,860
So,

134
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,600
about Mr. Kobayashi's studio...

135
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:35,600
Don't worry.

136
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,040
I'll take care of it for you.

137
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:39,910
Go.

138
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,460
Get out of my eyes.

139
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,010
Go.

140
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:01,530
Yun Lan.

141
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,760
Well,

142
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,610
I've signed the settlement.

143
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,160
I know.

144
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,800
Can I have a talk with you alone?

145
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,960
Lan, I'm leaving now.

146
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,250
Sorry.

147
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,260
I realised

148
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,280
although you're Han Rong's lawyer,

149
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:28,550
you've been protecting

150
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,200
and defending me.

151
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,400
I'm an idiot.

152
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:31,280
And I know nothing at all.

153
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:32,390
It's okay.

154
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,900
I knew this would happen

155
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:35,990
before I did that.

156
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,310
You couldn't understand my intention

157
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,810
with your IQ.

158
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:40,830
I know,

159
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,150
I was so mad before because

160
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,970
I starred in so many dramas.

161
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,600
There is no such dramatic

162
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:48,580
plot in those TV series.

163
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:50,200
I couldn't accept that.

164
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:51,790
So can you accept it now?

165
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,360
Yes.

166
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:54,330
Yun Lan.

167
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,010
Thank you.

168
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,380
Don't bother.

169
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,310
Go back and fulfil your
settlement agreement.

170
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,610
This is the best outcome

171
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,690
I could get for you.

172
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,950
I only said I wanted to break up

173
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,360
because I was mad.

174
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,440
Don't take it seriously.

175
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,680
We're still in a relationship.

176
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,690
The die

00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:16,710
is cast.

178
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,060
After you said you wanted to break up,

179
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,640
I considered our problems carefully.

180
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:24,760
Maybe we're not for each other.

181
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,100
Breaking up

182
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:28,490
is the best choice for us.

183
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,480
I know, I'm an idiot.

184
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:30,960
I'm

185
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,600
childish

186
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:32,960
and I'm impulsive.

187
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,310
I've never felt so ashamed

188
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,640
in my whole life.

189
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:36,650
Yun Lan,

190
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,010
please forgive me.

191
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:41,980
Lu Yu,

192
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,040
I admit that we had a happy time before.

193
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:48,030
But we're so different

194
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,530
from our way

195
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,390
of thinking

196
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,770
and minds.

197
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,560
If we continue this relationship,

198
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,310
we'll break up sooner or later.

199
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,310
No.

200
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,960
No.

201
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,140
Love can change everything.

202
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,170
Lu Yu.

203
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,660
I'm really tired.

204
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,360
Lan,

205
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,020
it's almost 2 o'clock.
You'll have a meeting.

206
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:35,360
Lan,

207
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,670
you've been staying up late recently?

208
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,140
Yesterday,

209
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:41,490
you fell asleep all of sudden.

210
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,200
Maybe I'm so tired

211
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,170
from lack of rest.

212
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:46,340
Apply for annual leave for me afterwards.

213
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,600
Lan,

214
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:50,360
you need to have a good rest.

215
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,560
Then I'll go out first.

216
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:52,670
OK.

217
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,390
Grandpa is going to be
discharged from hospital.

218
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,400
But I'll go

219
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:57,690
for Lu Yu.

220
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,070
OK.

221
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:01,640
Xia Lin?

222
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:07,370
Mrs. Zhang.

223
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:08,760
Professor Zhang.

224
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,150
I heard that Academician Zhang
is getting discharged.

225
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,010
Yes.

226
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,760
We're here for the discharge procedure.

227
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,040
Didn't you go to Africa?

228
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,120
Africa?

229
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:18,960
No.

230
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,560
But Lin Nuo said he

231
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,640
went to Africa with you.

232
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,350
Only one in our office

233
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,560
went to Africa.

234
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,460
I have to go.

235
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,960
What's going on, Yun Shu?

236
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,230
What's wrong?

237
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,080
I have to call Yi Yi.

238
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:14,750
Hello.

239
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,980
Hello, Yi Yi.

240
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:19,150
I saw Xia Lin when I went to the hospital

241
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,590
with Mr. Zhang today.

242
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,720
She said she wouldn't go to Africa.

243
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:24,960
Only Lin Nuo went there.

244
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,410
So,

245
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,090
he lied to me.

246
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:30,950
Oh, Yi Yi.

247
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,890
Don't assume the worst.

248
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,900
I think

249
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:35,210
Lin Nuo...

250
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:36,840
He may...

251
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,770
He never told lies before.

252
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,870
This time, in order to avoid me

253
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,740
he tried so hard.

254
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,230
Oh, Yi Yi.

255
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,370
I'm OK.

256
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:52,040
You don't have to console me.

257
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:53,470
Bye.

258
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:40,850
Lan, Lan.

259
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,310
Hello.

260
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,760
I'll come in.

261
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:48,960
Lan, I'm here.

262
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,610
What's wrong? Why are you so anxious?

263
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:52,740
Order something first.

264
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,370
Orange Juice, please.

265
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:00,160
What's going on?

266
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,060
I'm pregnant.

267
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:09,020
You're pregnant?

268
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,609
Lu Yu is the father?

269
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,130
Lan, congratulations.

270
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,760
I'll be the auntie.

271
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:20,099
When will you marry Lu Yu?

272
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,490
I don't plan to get married.

273
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:24,760
So,

274
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:26,280
well, did Lu Yu know that?

275
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,819
No, I didn't tell him.

276
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:31,410
Thank you.

277
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,210
Don't drink coffee, you're pregnant now.

278
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,540
Drink this.

279
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,830
Lan.

280
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,790
What will you do then?

281
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,160
I have no idea.

282
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,210
None of this is part of my plan.

283
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:58,280
I'll become a partner next year.

284
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,690
I'm busy with two big cases now.

285
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,140
Yun Shu,

286
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,080
I made an appointment with the doctor.

287
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,690
Accompany me to the hospital next month.

288
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,680
Lan.

289
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:09,970
Don't try to persuade me.

290
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,990
Lan,

291
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:19,090
since childhood,

292
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:21,080
I've always stood by your decision.

293
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,480
But I think you should

294
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,890
have told Lu Yu.

295
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:39,160
No one answers the door.

296
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,620
Nian Nian.

297
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,660
I lost my girlfriend.

298
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,440
Don't move.

299
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,150
I'm miserable now.

300
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,690
I'm heart-broken.

301
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,690
I need your warm consolation.

302
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,060
Yun Shu is here.

303
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,260
Hello.

304
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:11,740
Pregnant?

305
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:14,680
My sis knew that just now.

306
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:15,650
But she said she didn't want to

307
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:17,500
tell you that.

308
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,840
But I think you should.

309
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,900
But I think it's about you two.

310
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:21,880
So.

311
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,290
So you have the right to know.

312
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,690
Just extend your thanks by words.

313
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:31,710
Thank you, sis-in-law.

314
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:32,880
You're my saviour.

315
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:34,550
I've never seen my sis

316
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,740
act this way since my childhood.

317
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,020
So.

318
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:44,740
So where is he now?

319
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,830
He must go to change his clothes

320
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,440
then he'll rush to your sis.

321
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:52,700
From now on, we're a family.

322
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:53,910
I'm going to find Yun Lan.

323
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:55,900
Nian Nian.

324
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,510
Take good care of my sis-in-law.

325
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,220
Or I'll get you punished.

326
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,340
Silly boy!

327
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,090
So.

328
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:13,730
I'm the younger sis-in-law or

329
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,090
elder sis-in-law?

330
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,490
You're the elder sis-in-law of course.

331
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:21,270
Great.

332
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,110
Lan.

333
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,310
Come to the doorway.

334
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:48,410
Lu Yu is waiting for you.

335
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:49,740
All the people are watching.

336
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,280
What's the matter?

337
00:20:58,370 --> 00:20:59,960
Can you think it over
before you do something?

338
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,340
It's Lu Yun. The real Lu Yu.

339
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,040
Yun Shu told me everything.

340
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,480
I don't know what you're talking about.

341
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:06,710
He's so handsome.

342
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,020
It's him.

343
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:27,560
Marry me.

344
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,560
Come on, give me a break.

345
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:34,030
I love you. I want to marry you.

346
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,840
You think I'm making a scene?

347
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:40,910
Let's go somewhere else.

348
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,180
Yun Lan, I love you.

349
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,990
I imagined our future life,
living together

350
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,580
many times.

351
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,030
I just have no guts
to tell you my feelings.

352
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,430
I was afraid that you would reject me.

353
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,540
I was afraid that you'd run away

354
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:54,970
if I proposed to you.

355
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:57,840
When I knew you were pregnant,

356
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,080
I just want to marry you.

357
00:21:59,170 --> 00:21:59,900
It's the only idea in my mind.

358
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:01,560
I want to marry you.

359
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,880
Even if it means getting rejected
by you

360
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:05,240
or scaring you away,

361
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,830
I will keep proposing

362
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,310
till you say yes.

363
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,600
Stand up first.

364
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:19,620
Say Yes first.

365
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,480
What's wrong with you?

366
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:29,960
I...

367
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,350
I feel unwell.

368
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,030
Oh, no.

369
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,310
What?

370
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:34,690
My tummy hurts.

371
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:35,820
Tummy hurts?

372
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:38,160
Are you OK?

373
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,540
I will take you to the hospital.

374
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,240
Slow down.

375
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:42,880
They are well matched.

376
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:43,910
Yes.

377
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:46,170
So sweet.

378
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,040
Are you feeling unwell?

379
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,390
I'm OK.

380
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,510
I was only fooling you.

381
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:00,440
Come on.

382
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:02,770
How could you kid this thing?

383
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:05,440
You made me angry.

384
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:07,640
Everybody's watching.

385
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,090
I feel so embarrassed.

386
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,910
Come on.

387
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,640
They envied us.

388
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:17,010
Can you be low profile in the future?

389
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:19,230
I don't want people to
talk about me every day.

390
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,990
Yes, Mummy.

391
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,700
Do you want to eat anything?

392
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:27,410
I heard that pregnant
women have no appetite,

393
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,410
so I prepared plum and crataegus for you.

394
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,840
I don't want to eat anything sour.

395
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,570
So you want to eat something spicy?

396
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,440
Maybe we'll have a sweet daughter.

397
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,150
Great.

398
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:35,630
I like daughters.

399
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,810
Can you shut up?

400
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:43,110
Let me finish my words.

401
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:47,560
You accepted my proposal, did you?

402
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:48,540
No.

403
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,290
You have a three-month probation.

404
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:58,570
It depends.

405
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:01,480
Okay.

406
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,510
Alright, how about I

407
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,960
propose to you every day?

408
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:07,040
Slow down.

409
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,860
Are you a fool?

410
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:11,640
Slow down.

411
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:30,010
[Volunteer recruitment]

412
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,490
I'll go for you in Africa.

413
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:46,910
Wait and see.

414
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:03,950
Can you change

415
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,630
your short temper?

416
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:10,740
No, I can't. So what?

417
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,170
What can I do?

418
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:14,790
I can only go to pick you up.

419
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:52,990
Slow down, grandpa.

420
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,570
Are you two ready?

421
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,340
Wait a second. We'll be right here.

422
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:09,960
How is it?

423
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:11,310
Are you ready?

424
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,190
Of course.

425
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:15,110
Look.

426
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,290
What are they talking about?

427
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,230
Come on.

428
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,760
He's talking with Lu Yu.

429
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:23,510
Yun Lan.

430
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:25,840
Lu Yu and Si Nian

431
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,990
seem to be

432
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,130
totally different types of people

433
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,290
but they're alike deep down inside.

434
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:36,440
Lu Yu seems to be cynical.

435
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:37,600
Si Nian seems to be

436
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:39,090
aloof,

437
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:40,760
but they are both

438
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,630
kind

439
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,880
and reliable.

440
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:52,340
I mean,

441
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:54,090
are you ready to be a dad?

442
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:57,020
Of course.

443
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,680
The crib, the stroller,

444
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:01,310
the diapers, the pacifier,

445
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:02,270
the urinal and the nanny are all ready.

446
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:04,240
The baby's name remains unknown.

447
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,040
Save it.

448
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:08,530
You know what I mean.

449
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:13,160
To be honest,

450
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:14,670
I am not yet ready.

451
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:17,760
I don't know what I should do.

452
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,670
I just know

453
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,410
I love Yun Lan.

454
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:27,920
She's a woman with
little sense of security.

455
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,990
I want to give her a family.

456
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:37,760
Good for you.

457
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,880
Your words show that you're ready now.

458
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,480
Come on.

459
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:44,700
Call me bro-in-law, come on.

460
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,910
Come on, for God's sake.

461
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,510
Did Yun Lan say Yes?

462
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:49,410
What are you ducking?

463
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:51,230
Come on. Hurry up.

464
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,090
We'll be right here.

465
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:56,220
Lan.

466
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,590
What's your test for Lu Yu?

467
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:04,920
I didn't mean to test him.

468
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:07,360
I just have no confidence in myself.

469
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,420
I'm not sure whether

470
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:12,210
I can be a good wife and

471
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,540
a good mother.

472
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,940
I believe she'll make

473
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:17,060
a good mother

474
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,810
and a good wife.

475
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,510
Let's get it started.

476
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:28,070
Brother-in-law.

477
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:33,510
Kids,

478
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:35,350
remember my words.

479
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,040
In family,

480
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,030
love

481
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,510
reigns.

482
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,520
Go.

483
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,720
♫ You're a familiar stranger ♫

484
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,290
♫ Who keeps appearing before me ♫

485
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:04,820
Look.

486
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:05,170
Look.

487
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:07,200
♫ You're clumsy yet kind ♫

488

♫ Ringing the bell in my heart ♫

489
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:14,330
♫ You predict and plan, but you can't
solve the problem called love ♫

490
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:18,520
♫ Let me tell you, just hold my hand ♫

491
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:23,720
♫ Looking up, I see

♫ Close your eyes and feel me out,
the plain girl ♫

493
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,680
It's cold.

494
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:45,240
Cover your knees.

495
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:45,830
OK.

496
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,480
Grandpa, it's windy here.

497
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:50,560
Keep yourself warm.

498
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:51,530
Yun Shu,

499
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,410
I'd like to thank you.

500
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,690
You made Si Nian warm-hearted.

501
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:03,480
Sit down.

502
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,460
Actually, I had long known

503
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:14,010
your contract.

504
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,890
Grandpa, don't think too much.

505
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:22,360
Si Nian and I...

506
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:23,150
No need to explain.

507
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,830
I know you did that

508
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,550
for me.

509
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,680
Grandpa,

510
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,090
that's not true.

511
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:33,400
Yun Shu and I

512
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:35,240
are meant to be.

513
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:38,520
So, when did you
start to love each other?

514
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:43,140
When I first met him,

515
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:44,630
I thought I wouldn't see

516
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,810
him any more.

517
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:48,840
Make a Latte for me

518
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,970
according to what I wrote.

519
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:51,710
Black coffee is classic.

520
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:52,880
Fastidious.

521
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:54,980
Dear students,

522
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:55,910
I'm Zhang Si Nian.

523
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,680
Starting today, I'll be in charge

524
00:30:57,770 --> 00:30:59,760
of the Mathematical Statistics course.

525
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:01,210
The whole picture is
nothing but stupid errors.

526
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,550
In the future,

527
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,830
you can't avoid him.

528
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,510
Impossible!

529
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,480
Mr. Zhang.

530
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,230
You've forfeited your chance

531
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,150
at your thesis defence.

532
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,000
Because you're late.

533
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,290
Because you're late.

534
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:11,960
You're really the most fastidious teacher

535
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,640
I've ever seen.

536
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,280
I don't care whether
you have time or not.

537
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:15,910
I don't care whether
you have time or not.

538
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:16,330
If you don't go with me today,

539
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:17,430
If you don't go with me today,

540
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,360
I won't let you get in your car.

541
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:19,600
I think I have figured it out.

542
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:20,690
You may have been fooled.

543
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,230
He's my cousin.

544
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:22,630
He's my cousin.

545
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:23,990
How could he fool me?

546
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:26,390
♫ I hear someone asking,
are you still here? ♫

547
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:27,480
Can you do me a favour?

548
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:27,860
Sure.

549
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:28,200
Sure.

550
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:28,520
Be my girlfriend.

551
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,170
Be my girlfriend.

552
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,420
You can hold my hands.

553
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,230
One month.

554
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:33,760
Marriage?

555
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,200
Marriage?

556
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:34,360
Marriage?

557
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:36,620
I think I got tricked by you.

558
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:37,450
At the beginning,

559
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:37,510
At the beginning,

560
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:37,940
you let me pretend to be your girlfriend.

561
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,030
you let me pretend to be your girlfriend.

562
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:39,520
And then you let me live in your house.

563
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:39,920
And then you let me live in your house.

564
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,010
And then you let me live in your house.

565
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,460
Now you ask me to marry you.

566
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,350
Mr. Zhang,

567
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:43,430
Mr. Zhang,

568
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:43,970
you've long set the trap?

569
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:45,150
you've long set the trap?

570
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:45,290
It is not a marriage
in the traditional sense,

571
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:46,560
It is not a marriage
in the traditional sense,

572
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:46,890
It is not a marriage
in the traditional sense,

573
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,000
while it's a kind of

574
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:48,960
contractual relationship.

575
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:50,610
The marriage you mean is more like

576
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,670
a sort of cooperation.

577
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:52,150
a sort of cooperation.

578
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:52,400
a sort of cooperation.

579
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:53,810
You're having a hard time.

580
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:54,500
No.

581
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:55,450
I'm not.

582
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:55,470
[Mathematics as I Know It]
I'm not.

583
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:56,570
[Mathematics as I Know It]
Yun Shu,

584
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:57,400
[Mathematics as I Know It]

585
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:57,650
I remember I told you the
morning before yesterday.

586
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:58,660
I remember I told you the
morning before yesterday.

587
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:58,890
I remember I told you the
morning before yesterday.

588
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,740
Don't go to school.

589
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,710
Don't let more people

590
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,960
know about our relationship.

591
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,710
Do you look down on me?

592
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,350
You think I'm

593
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,840
a useless person?

594
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:12,200
Who are you?

595
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:13,160
I'm Zhang Si Nian.

596
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,280
I'm her husband.

597
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:15,260
We're married.

598
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,640
From today on,

599
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,290
Yun Shu,

600
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:19,760
will be my wife.

601
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:20,730
First,

602
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:22,030
our education background
has nothing to do

603
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:22,540
our education background
has nothing to do

604
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:24,010
with our relationship.

605
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:25,980
I can vouch for it with my character.

606
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:27,280
I won't force Yun Shu

607
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:28,100
to do anything she doesn't want to do.

608
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,140
to do anything she doesn't want to do.

609
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,700
I'll respect her,

610
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:31,700
love her

611
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:32,680
and protect her.

612
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:33,380
In the next one year,

613
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,340
In the next one year,

614
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:34,470
In the next one year,

615
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,040
I'll help her

616
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:37,200
and tutor her

617
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:39,220
to make sure that she can
successfully finish her final defence.

618
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:39,980
And I also ensure that

619
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,500
And I also ensure that

620
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:40,990
And I also ensure that

621
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:43,310
nobody will call her a fool.

622
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,030
I carefully selected this

623
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:45,780
elementary exercise for you.

624
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,310

626
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:48,770
You have to finish them 
in one hour and a half.
