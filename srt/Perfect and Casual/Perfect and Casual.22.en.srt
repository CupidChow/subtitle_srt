[Episode 22]

4
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,160
And then I said to Mr. Zhang

5
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,350
that I love him.

6
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,090
And then?

7
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,670
Then Mr. Zhang

8
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,460
said he loved me too.

9
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,110
And?

10
00:02:17,329 --> 00:02:18,120
And...

11
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:18,890
And...

12
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,200
And we went to sleep.

13
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,829
Mr. Zhang is really quiet inside.

14
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,240
I think

15
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:31,750
he doesn't bother to think about these.

16
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:38,920
There’re still errors in the calculation

17
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,150
in the mathematical samples.

18
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:42,920
This is really urgent.

19
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,320
Okay, okay, I got it.

20
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,220
I see.

21
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,380
Take a break.

22
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,870
Everybody, take a break

23
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,480
and drink coffee.

24
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,650
Thanks, Miss. Lin.

25
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,730
You're welcome.

26
00:02:58,980 --> 00:02:59,940
Take a break

27
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:00,910
and have a cup of coffee.

28
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,070
Okay, thank you.

29
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,950
Why is Professor Zhang's coffee

30
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,730
different from ours?

31
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,050
Professor Zhang is picky

32
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:09,940
and has many requirements.

33
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,700
You know about his habit.

34
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,050
His coffee must be made specially.

35
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,500
Come on, enjoy coffee.

36
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,340
Thank you.

37
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,310
Okay.

38
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,730
It's hot.

39
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,140
All right.

40
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,770
Let's call it a day.

41
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,390
You should sort out all the files later

42
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,250
and send me.

43
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:34,520
Okay.

44
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:35,490
Thanks for your hard work.

45
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,660
Okay. It's okay!

46
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,860
Remember to give it to me again

47
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:39,540
when finish calculating.

48
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:40,510
Okay.

49
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:41,329
Okay.

50
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:41,600
Thank .

51
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,770
I'll go first.

52
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,079
Okay.

53
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,050
We're leaving first.

54
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:50,050
You should be tired, too.

55
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:50,640
Take a rest.

56
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,610
I'm leaving.

57
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,270
Si Nian.

58
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,580
I want to talk to you.

59
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:08,910
Grandpa.

60
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,450
Grandpa.

61
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,430
Yun Shu.

62
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,600
It's alright.

63
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,490
When one gets old,

64
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:21,130
he'd always encounter many accidents.

65
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,210
Don't worry about it.

66
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,610
Dr. Zhang,

67
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:27,660
what's wrong with grandpa?

68
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,970
Is it serious?

69
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:35,560
No big deal.

70
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,090
Spend more time with him.

71
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,920
Okay, thanks for your hard work.

72
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:46,920
Grandpa.

73
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,540
Have a good rest.

74
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,340
I'll always be with you.

75
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,400
Where's Si Nian?

76
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:58,100
Si Nian went to retreat because of work.

77
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,510
Chu Chu.

78
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,170
I'm married now

79
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,890
and I have my wife.

80
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,800
So your questions

81
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,320
for Yun Shu

82
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,930
were quite offensive.

83
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,770
But you’re in a contractual relationship.

84
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,820
And you did this for grandpa...

85
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,820
But

86
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,430
we changed contractual relationship

87
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,890
to a real marriage.

88
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,250
And I really love her.

89
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,160
You used to

90
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,570
focus on data only.

91
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,600
You only believed data

92
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,600
and the future inferred by the data.

93
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:38,050
Then can you tell me

94
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,159
if you're sure enough

95
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,680
to always be happy with Yun Shu?

96
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,110
From what I know about you,

97
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,540
the gap between you two

98
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,710
will lead to a long running-in period

99
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,480
for your love and marriage.

100
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,510
You're aware of this, aren’t you?

101
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:52,590
But these factors

102
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,430
aren't what both of us

103
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,220
to prove.

104
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,350
Grandpa, wait a minute.

105
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,700
It's Si Nian.

106
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:17,130
Yun Shu, did you just call me?

107
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:18,750
Yes.

108
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,970
What's the matter?

109
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,210
Nothing important.

110
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,680
I was in the studio just now.

111
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:25,980
I'm a little busy.

112
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,880
I'm hanging up.

113
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:34,820
Grandpa.

114
00:06:35,409 --> 00:06:37,970
Why don't you let me tell Si Nian?

115
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,130
No big deal.

116
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,840
Don't disturb Si Nian.

117
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:46,840
He needs to work.

118
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,350
And

119
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:52,000
it's enough for

120
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:53,950
you are here with grandpa.

121
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,950
Is it really okay?

122
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,460
Graduate defence season

123
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,370
is coming soon.

124
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:04,980
Why did he suddenly go to retreat?

125
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,760
Actually, I don't know either.

126
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,410
Si Nian said

127
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,180
the investigation time report of

128
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,370
Lin Chu Chu's company was advanced.

129
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,800
So

130
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:15,330
maybe they're

131
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,360
making every endeavour during retreat.

132
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,590
They just work.

133
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,610
Si Nian and Lin Chu Chu

134
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,490
are working together.

135
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,790
You're worried about that, right?

136
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,610
I believe him.

137
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,770
And

138
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:32,080
what is likely to happen between them

139
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,950
should have happened a long time ago.

140
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:38,330
Yun Shu, you're smart and generous.

141
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,220
In fact, you don't have to worry.

142
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:46,320
Because they're so much alike.

143
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:49,940
They're like two parallel lines

144
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:53,170
and never intersect with each other.

145
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:56,210
They're elites

146
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:58,030
with common interests

147
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,440
and they've known
each other for a long time,

148
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:03,320
but if they're together,

149
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,550
they can only

150
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:09,490
become like-minded friends.

151
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,010
Grandpa.

152
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,160
You’re really good at judging people.

153
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,870
Of course!

154
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:19,240
The first time I saw you,

155
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,780
I knew

156
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,780
Si Nian and you

157
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,320
were a perfect match.

158
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,020
Really?

159
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,850
When did Grandpa ever lie to you?

160
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,750
Yun Shu.

161
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:45,210
Lin Nuo.

162
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,120
You're off work?

163
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,700
Gao Zhi Yi told you to here?

164
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:50,830
Didn't she tell you

165
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,130
to come to complain?

166
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:53,480
You're overthinking.

167
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,650
I came to see grandpa today.

168
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,170
Grandpa, he is in hospital again?

169
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,280
Is he alright?

170
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,680
I hope so.

171
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:05,910
Lin Nuo.

172
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:07,780
You forgot your mobile phone.

173
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,550
I'm so dumb.

174
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,520
Thank you.

175
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:10,980
Bye.

176
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:11,950
Bye.

177
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,120
Lin Nuo,

178
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,310
is there anything

179
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,100
or anybody

180
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,810
that distracted you?

181
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:22,590
Alright!

182
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,890
Yi Yi told you

183
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:24,890
I have a new love, didn't she?

184
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:25,850
Isn't it true?

185
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,220
Of course not.

186
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:28,320
My breakup with Yi Yi

187
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:29,800
is totally our own problem.

188
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:31,680
If you two are doing it because
of Gu Xiao,

189
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,030
you're overthinking.

190
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:33,980
Our breakup

191
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:34,840
has nothing to do with

192
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:36,220
anybody. You know that?

193
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,580
You know me.

194
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,580
I never thought of

195
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,440
breaking up with Yi Yi.

196
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:41,200
Then why do you two become like this?

197
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,180
I think,

198
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,740
in our relationship,

199
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,200
I was too meek.

200
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,490
She and I have never been reciprocal.

201
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,680
Reciprocal?

202
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,650
Lin Nuo, you know.

203
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,340
Yi Yi didn't mean that.

204
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:56,590
But Yun Shu, we've also known
each other for a long time.

205
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,140
You know

206
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,660
I wasn't like this before.

207
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,380
But since I met Gao Zhi Yi,

208
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,590
I'm completely different from myself.

209
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,960
You know?

210
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:04,930
When a boy and a girl are together,

211
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:07,130
they should change for each other,

212
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,090
right?

213
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,640
No, I don't think so.

214
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,600
I think a good romantic relationship

215
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,080
shouldn't be like this.

216
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,270
Even if you like somebody
and change for him,

217
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,270
it should be a happy and relaxing process.

218
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,060
But I'm not happy at all now.

219
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:20,310
All right,

220
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,440
I think there's

221
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,450
no use going like this for you two.

222
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,600
You should find a chance

223
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:25,940
to meet with her

224
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:27,090
and talk with her.

225
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,450
That won't be necessary.

226
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,610
We fight

227
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,740
as we see each other.

228
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,010
Lin Nuo,

229
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,490
can you drive?

230
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:42,740
I can.

231
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:53,980
Yun Shu,

232
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,170
didn't you ask me to come and help?

233
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,480
Why did you call him?

234
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,060
I don't know either.

235
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:01,670
I didn't know you'd come.

236
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,700
Yun Shu, did you do it on purpose?

237
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:04,670
Come on,

238
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,480
I really have something urgent today

239
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:07,980
and I need your help.

240
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,380
If they're together...

241
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,680
I don't talk to jerks.

242
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,230
This is weird.

243
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:17,410
Don't you only love jerks?

244
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,230
Yeah, I used to have "eye problems".

245
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:23,340
That's terrible. You need a cure then

246
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:25,840
or you'll be blind.

247
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:29,630
Okay! Would you please
find a handsome doctor

248
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,800
in your hospital for me

249
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:34,340
to cure my perennial illness?

250
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:35,310
No.

251
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:36,710
The doctors in our hospital

252
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,590
have noble medical ethics

253
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,750
and aren't qualified for you.

254
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,720
Stop.

255
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,040
Stop fighting!

256
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,320
Yun Shu, let me tell you something.

257
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,150
Someone

258
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,470
just likes to covet other
people's boyfriends.

259
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,260
This time

260
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,710
we must return home in triumph.

261
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,560
We must not let people like Lin Chu Chu

262
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:58,090
get any chance to
interrupt your relationship.

263
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,030
It's not that serious, is it?

264
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,740
Of course it is.

265
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,790
You can ask Lin Nuo.

266
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,210
He has the most say.

267
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:07,750
Darn.

268
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,040
Nuts.

269
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,000
What?

270
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:11,800
Yun Shu.

271
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,730
Is this the right way?

272
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,160
Check the navigation.
I've never been there either.

273
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:22,570
I'm so sorry.

274
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,620
We can't reveal the
privacy of our guests.

275
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,510
How can it be privacy?

276
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,540
I told you he's my husband.

277
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:29,700
I come here for my husband.

278
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,330
What's wrong with it?

279
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,060
You can call him

280
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,580
and let him pick you up.

281
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:45,500
If he answers my phone,

282
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,240
why do I bother to ask you for a favour?

283
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:48,770
I'm really sorry.

284
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:50,780
I have a photo with him.

285
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:51,640
Let me show you.

286
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,090
I'm really sorry.

287
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,920
Why are you like this?

288
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,560
I got married after
graduating from college.

289
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,860
I can do nothing but housework.

290
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,840
If my husband is taken away,

291
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:19,000
what can I live on?

292
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:22,190
I have to raise two children.

293
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,090
Yi Yi, let's forget about it.

294
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:28,010
Men nowadays are unreliable.

295
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:30,710
They hanker after women

296
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,610
or are chased by women.

297
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:36,910
They don't take the initiative
and don't take responsibility either.

298
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,790
My life is so miserable.

299
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,480
I can't tell them the room number.

300
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,810
They don't take the initiative
and don't take responsibility either.

301
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,350
Personally, I am very sympathetic
to what happened to you.

302
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,060
But the hotel has rules,

303
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,850
so there's nothing we can do.

304
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,630
Yun Shu, what should I do?

305
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,680
My husband is going to be taken away.

306
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:57,750
When we leave,

307
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,730
you can go to the first
floor of the East Building.

308
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,490
Thank you. That's very kind of you.

309
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,300
Coming.

310
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,460
Let it go.

311
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,670
If you're here to argue with me,

312
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,090
I don't think it's necessary.

313
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,720
Actually,

314
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:39,150
there're other things I want to ask you.

315
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,150
Yun Shu.

316
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,770
How about you call him again?

317
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:59,170
Is that Mr. Zhang?

318
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,620
Go! Go! Go!

319
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:11,520
Si Nian.

320
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,740
I really can't figure out

321
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,160
why you like Yun Shu.

322
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:22,750
Yun Shu.

323
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:23,820
Come here.

324
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,230
Come back.

325
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,000
Come here. Come here.

326
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,090
Come over here!

327
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:42,340
After I came back, I also counted

328
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,260
the times we get along with each other

329
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,150
since I met Yun Shu for the first time

330
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,810
to the building of our
contractual relationship

331
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,240
and to this business trip.

332
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,600
The number of times we get along
with each other during this period

333
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,780
is 821 times.

334
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:58,030
In the process of contact,

335
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,110
the percentage she showed happiness to me

336
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,520
is 83.33 percent.

337
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,200
12 percent of which

338
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:05,900
wasn't caused by me.

339
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:08,290
When she's with me,

340
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,560
she's generally

341
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,650
happy.

342
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,060
I also calculated

343
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:16,730
my feelings about Yun Shu.

344
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,160
Happiness and joy

345
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:18,920
account for

346
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,230
73.33 percent.

347
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:24,430
So the data of the two of
us get along with each other

348
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,330
is quite big

349
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:27,880
among general couples.

350
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:30,610
Sorry!

351
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,710
I used

352
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,560
the relevant data in the laboratory

353
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:35,570
without your permission.

354
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,340
Why are you suddenly so serious

355
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,450
about this kind of thing?

356
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,380
Didn't you tell me this afternoon

357
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,510
that my answer didn't seem to be

358
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,460
out of rigorous professor of mathematics?

359
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,560
I'm...

360
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,550
I'm really hard to imagine

361
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,190
why would you be with a girl

362
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,280
whose personality is
entirely different from you.

363
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:56,570
As you know,

364
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,090
the reason why I came back this time

365
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:00,040
was to cure my grandpa.

366
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,650
Grandpa's illness made me

367
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,060
feel so lost.

368
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,530
I've always

369
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:07,690
hoped everything

370
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,300
can be under control and planned well.

371
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,589
I don't want anything

372
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,329
to go out of control.

373
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,579
Until that day,

374
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:17,500
a person who had
diametrically opposite character

375
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,010
with me came into my life.

376
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,130
She reconciled

377
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,800
herself to her situation.

378
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,250
She was totally an "almost girl".

379
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,460
She changed me.

380
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:38,610
At the very beginning,

381
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,850
I didn't admit it.

382
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:43,900
Until recently I started studying

383
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:46,770
my relationship with her and I found

384
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,380
she gave me company.

385
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:58,000
Why did

386
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,730
you help me?

387
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,450
We were all alone at that time.

388
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:14,260
But I noticed that

389
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,780
you were very much like me.

390
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,640
We had the same life experience

391
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:21,020
and same character.

392
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:22,610
Even

393
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,140
the similar future life planning.

394
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:29,330
So Chu Chu.

395
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,410
I’ve always regarded
you as my best friend.

396
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,770
Am I not excellent or

397
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,670
good enough?

398
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:43,670
No.

399
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:45,590
Two people who are too similar

400
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,280
are just like two parallel lines.

401
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:49,030
It's hard to intersect.

402
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,810
So Chu Chu,

403
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,800
I really hope you can find a man

404
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:54,800
who complements you

405
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:56,490
with intersections.

406
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,340
Just like Yun Shu and I do.

407
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,570
Although we have
different starting points

408
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,090
and direction of life,

409
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,860
it's like climbing a mountain.

410
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:07,320
I’m willing to wait for her
halfway up the mountain.

411
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,260
Take her hand

412
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,080
and to be with her.

413
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,380
I’ve also learned a truth recently.

414
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,240
Enjoying scenery alone

415
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:20,450
is worse than doing the same
thing with someone you like.

416
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,920
So you never

417
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:27,070
liked me?

418
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,800
Maybe I didn't

419
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:36,920
know myself then.

420
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,830
It may be just like that

421
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:41,860
when I met Yun Shu.

422
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:52,050
Don't lie if you can't.

423
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:54,870
Alright,

424
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,960
I get it.

425
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:01,090
Can I

426
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,410
hug you?

427
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,680
Think of it as the last farewell.

428
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,670
I already have someone I want to hug.

429
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:39,690
Yun Shu.

430
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:49,390
Mr. Zhang.

431
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:52,780
We came with Yun Shu.

432
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,950
Mr. Zhang,

433
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:06,360
I didn't mean to eavesdrop on you two.

434
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:10,480
Actually, I was going to...

435
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:36,580
What else did you want to say just now?

436
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,860
I was just about to say

437
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,880
I went to the hospital this morning

438
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,490
to see grandpa.

439
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:46,160
What's wrong with grandpa?

440
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:50,050
Grandpa is in a good state.

441
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,130
That's good.

442
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,560
It's so late. How can we get back?

443
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:13,610
I...

444
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,920
I hailed a cab.

445
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:21,620
Don't you have anything to tell me?

446
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:23,620
Does it work if I say?

447
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:26,990
Lin Nuo.

448
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,800
You're strange.

449
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,440
It's not like you before.

450
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:31,320
Maybe

451
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:32,760
this is the real me.

452
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,130
What do you mean?

453
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,730
Here comes the cab.

454
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:49,810
Won't you go?

455
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,050
I go alone.

456
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:52,250
Mister driver,

457
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:54,530
please drive her to Zheng Ben University.

458
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:55,470
Okay, no problem.

459
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,230
Thank you.

460
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,200
It's okay.

461
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,940
Surprise!

462
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,290
I flew over when I finished working.

463
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:34,090
Hold on.

464
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,080
Hold on.

465
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,660
What's the matter?

466
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:44,970
Tell me about it.

467
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,790
What's going on?

468
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,530
Xi Xi came to see you?

469
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,090
I told her many times

470
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,060
not to tell you.

471
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:52,260
I can't believe

472
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,160
she didn't listen to me at all.

473
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:54,970
I'll go to her.

474
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:55,930
You can't escape.

475
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:59,130
You have to make it clear to me.

476
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:00,410
Honey.

477
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:02,730
Listen.

478
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,040
Don't be angry.

479
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:39,390
It's you!

480
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,480
What a coincidence!

481
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,390
What? What?

482
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,530
I’m warning you.

483
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:48,010
Stay away from Yun Lan in the future.

484
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,240
I won't let you go

485
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,600
if you scheme to harm her again.

486
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:55,750
Hear that?

487
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:56,560
Yes!

488
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:57,070
Hear that?

489
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,040
Don't punch me.

490
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:59,510
Yes!

491
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:07,640
[Replay]

492
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,690
[Replay]
I didn't really hit him.

493
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:08,980
I didn't really hit him.

494
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,200
I just scared him.

495
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:11,500
You are a celebrity.

496
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,850
If it gets worse,

497
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,610
the impact on your career is fatal.

498
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,810
So now you're blaming me.

499
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:20,620
I'm not blaming you.

500
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,050
I'm worried about you.

501
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,270
It's not worthwhile

502
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,810
for your career to be affected

503
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,070
for such a man.

504
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:35,970
I

505
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,530
am willing do everything for you

506
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,340
I'll find Han Rong.

507
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:39,310
Stop!

508
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,000
You can't go to the scum.

509
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:43,700
Can you stop being wilful?

510
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:44,700
Yun Lan.

511
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,930
I'll handle this matter myself.

512
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,120
You just stay out of it.

513
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:29,290
Mr. Zhang.

514
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,980
Grandpa gets better today.

515
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:33,980
How about you go back first?

516
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,430
I can take care of

517
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,380
grandpa by myself.

518
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,890
Don't worry.

519
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,090
Mr. Kobayashi.

520
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,150
Is it really the Mr. Kobayashi?

521
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,330
Yeah.

522
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:58,910
He said your painting
style is unique and novel

523
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,580
and different from others.

524
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,310
I have a feeling that

525
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,240
my heart is going to jump out.

526
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:05,920
And now I think

527
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:08,220
my life is so glorious.

528
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,670
I never thought

529
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,510
my work would be

530
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,200
evaluated by my idol one day.

531
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,290
Don't get carried away.

532
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:17,290
I haven't finished speaking yet.

533
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,430
Could it be...

534
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,950
But...

535
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:25,160
Don't be nervous.

536
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:26,640
In fact,

537
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,480
Mr. Kobayashi's studio

538
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:29,720
is recruiting new assistants.

539
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:31,080
He sent you an invitation

540
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:32,400
by the publishing house.

541
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:34,370
He wants you to be his new assistant.

542
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:35,680
Me?

543
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,580
His new assistant?

544
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:38,790
I’m not free to joke with you.

545
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,900
I'm busy.

546
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:41,530
I don't want you to go yet.

547
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,500
Then

548
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,380
how long will it take?

549
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:46,080
A three-year contract period.

550
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,070
That's great.

551
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,730
What's there to hesitate about?

552
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,630
I have to give you a
celebration ceremony.

553
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:56,300
You have to

554
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:58,250
send me the serial of next week.

555
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,140
No problem.

556
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:17,650
Hello, Editor Gao.

557
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,380
Are you free next week?

558
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,140
What's up?

559
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:22,000
Yun Shu's work

560
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,110
has caught the attention of
the overseas god of cartoonists,

561
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,560
Mr. Kobayashi.

562
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:26,890
It's also our company's honour.

563
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:27,650
So

564
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,880
I'm going to hold a celebration for her.

565
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:30,840
Her work was once

566
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:33,650
blessed and supported by your talents.

567
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,500
So you must join us.

568
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,860
Okay, I'll definitely go.

569
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,700
May I ask

570
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,090
how long does it take Yun Shu
to go abroad this time?

571
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,160
Three years.

572
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,730
OK, then I'll see you next week.

573
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,980
Okay, thank you.

574
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,100
Lan,

575
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:05,180
do you think I should go or not?

576
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,670
The reason why you want to go is...

577
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,690
Mr. Kobayashi.

578
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,150
He’s my idol since I was a child.

579
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,470
If I can become his assistant,

580
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,350
I can realize my dream.

581
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,170
The reason why you don't want to go is...

582
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,370
The contract period is three years.

583
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:22,420
I can't bear to be separated
from Mr. Zhang for so long.

584
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:24,250
Dream

585
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,550
and love.

586
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,070
They form the most
difficult thing to decide

587
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,020
in life.

588
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,050
You have to figure it out for yourself.

589
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,860
Lan,

590
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,920
if it were you,

591
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,820
how would you choose?

592
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:40,490
Yun Shu.

593
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,520
My opinion

594
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,310
has no reference value

595
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:45,010
for you.

596
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,780
Hello, Dr. Zhang.

597
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:57,570
Academician Zhang's
treatment plan has come out.

598
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,890
Come over if you have time.

599
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:06,590
Dr. Zhang,

600
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,010
please just tell me the truth.

601
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,640
The cancer cells

602
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,590
have spread to the bones.

603
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:16,740
Your grandpa has also known about it.

604
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,750
I was going to tell you.

605
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:19,970
But he didn't agree.

606
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:25,830
He wants to be with you two.

607
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,460
Aren't there really

608
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:28,490
any other treatments?

609
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,190
With the current treatment method...

610
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,420
How long can

611
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,210
my grandpa live?

612
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,290
Two months.

613
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:47,530
Two months.

614
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,140
Si Nian.

615
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,690
I'm here to see grandpa.

616
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,230
Thank you.

617
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:37,930
I contacted

618
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,520
Dr. Smith from overseas before.

619
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,670
He’s an authority in
the field of lymphoma.

620
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,760
Today, the overseas
clinic finally gave a reply.

621
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:46,220
Here's the information. Read it.

622
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,060
Chu Chu,

623
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,350
I would like to thank you

624
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,320
on behalf of grandpa.

625
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,500
It's alright.

626
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:14,520
But grandpa

627
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:16,330
needs to go overseas.

628
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,620
Can you do that?

629
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:19,250
Go... Go overseas?

630
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,340
Of course.

631
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,560
Why don't you discuss it?

632
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,240
I'll come back to see
grandpa in a couple of days.

633
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,040
Okay.

634
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,370
Then I'll go first.

635
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,400
Thank you.

636
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,440
Yun Shu,

637
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:39,920
I forgot to congratulate you.

638
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:40,840
I heard

639
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:42,180
you received

640
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:43,130
an invitation from Mr. Kobayashi's studio

641
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,570
to be his assistant.

642
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,850
You're going to Kobayashi's studio?
