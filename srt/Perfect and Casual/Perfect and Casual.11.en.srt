Are you here for an interview?

5
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,329
I'm from Huimin Supermarket
to deliver beer for you.

6
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,079
Deliver beer?

7
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,840
Do you want to interview
at our company?

8
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:30,920
Mr. Meng.

9
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:33,630
Mr. Meng?

10
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:34,760
You're the person

11
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,180
who bought beer in the supermarket, right?

12
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,530
You're the company's...

13
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,740
Yes, want to have a try?

14
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,540
Hello, Yun Shu.

15
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,210
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

16
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:54,610
Are you busy now?

17
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,260
No, what is it?

18
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,329
I have good news.

19
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,140
I got a new job,

20
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,740
being an assistant at a law office.

21
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,630
I just passed the
interview this afternoon.

22
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,920
Congratulations!

23

Actually,

24
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,360
I just want to tell you

25
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,740
that I'll go to visit grandpa.

26
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,610
In case you didn't know,

27
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,690
I decided to inform you beforehand.

28
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,200
Grandpa will be happy for you.

29
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,010

Did you fall in love recently?

34
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:39,050
Yes.

35
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,440
Interesting.

36
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,230
The grandpa seems to
be in a good mood lately.

37
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,310
This is fun.

38
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,590
What's the matter?

39
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,250
Something on your mind?

40
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,690
No.

41
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,380
Grandpa,

42
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,010
you said my strength

43
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,260
is being heartless.

44
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:07,340
So nothing is on my mind.

45
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,940
Don't forget that rich experiences
make a person have a penetrating insight.

46
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,810

48
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,360
No, no.

49
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:20,870
No.

50
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,100
I do have something on my mind.

51
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:27,060
Well, I have found a job

52
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,740
of being an assistant at a law firm.

53
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:29,940
But

54
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,159
I actually have no confidence in myself

55
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,409
and don't know if I can do it well.

56
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:37,200
Is that all?

57
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,690
There's no false statement.

58
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,110
That year when I just went abroad,

59
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,730
there were Americans and Europeans

60
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,740
around my supervisor.

61
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,280
They didn't believe the Chinese

62
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,300
could do mathematical research.

63
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,140
In the face of these doubts,

64
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,610
I began to doubt myself, too.

65
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,600
I even thought of

66
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:58,300
changing majors

67
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,670
or dropping out.

68
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,320
Later,

69
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,880
my supervisor read the air.

70
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,490
One day he called me to his office.

71
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:11,490
He pointed to a pile of
papers on the table, saying,

72
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,620
"Zhang, look,

73
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,370
these are all applications
from those PhD candidates.

74
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,940
But I only chose you

75
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,910
from the pile of applications.

76
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,870
So please believe your excellence

77
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,500
and my insight."

Yun Shu,

79
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,570
you should believe that

80
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,060
there's always a reason

81
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,820
for one person to choose another person.

82
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,740
Maybe it's just

83
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,659
that the person in question
can't figure it out.

84
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:42,700

85
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,570

since you're usually busy,

00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,560
I came in through the
back door facing the beach.

174
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,630
I didn't like to walk through
this door when I was a kid

175
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,650
and I liked to go in
from the door you said.

176
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,950
Then we have the same habit.

177
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:36,370
Let me drive you home.

178
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,490
Actually,

179
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:40,710
I'm thinking to take a stroll

180
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,310
on the beach for a while.

181
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,160
Okay.

182
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,310
I'll accompany you.

183
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,160
Sorry.

184
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,020
Hello, Miss Shen.

185
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,190
Urgent meeting?

186
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,720
Okay. I'll get back as soon as possible.

187
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,580
It's alright.

188
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,920
Go on with your work.

189
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,670
I can go by myself.

190
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,070
Okay.

191
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:08,530
Let me know when you get home.

192
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,060
Be safe.

193
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,390
[Are you still at the seaside?]

194
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,670
[The low tide coastline
is really beautiful.]

195
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,610
[Go home early.]

196
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,200
[I'll take you to enjoy next time.]

197
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:32,480
[Okay.]

198
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,790
Be careful.

199
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,720
Slow down. Be careful.

200
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,370
Do you feel happy?

201
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,280
[On Sunday morning,]

202
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:09,850
[I'll get Grandpa from
the hospital with you.]

203
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:14,300
[We said before to make a
unified "oral confession".]

204
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,200
[But I forgot.]

205
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,170
Professor Zhang.

206
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:19,260
I think you are different from before.

207
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:21,180
Different?

208
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:23,360
What's different?

209
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:26,440
I feel you're happier

210
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,460
than when I first met you.

211
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,430
Happier?

212
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:30,690
Because of Yun Shu, right?

213
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,190
Miss Shen,

214
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,780
I think you may have misunderstood.

215
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,160
My relationship with Yun Shu

216
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,020
isn't the kind you think.

217
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,410
The two of us signed a
contractual agreement

218
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,490
for some particular reasons.

219
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,030
Contractual agreement?

220
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:43,640
Yes.

221
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,820
Our relationship will be dissolved

222
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,620
when the agreement expires one year later.

223
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:48,940
So please

224
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,630
help me keep it a secret.

225
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,200
So that day

226
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:55,490
you asked about the effects
of divorce on women.

227
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:57,150
It was because of Yun Shu, right?

228
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,170
Yes.

229
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:01,080
And thank you for reminding me.

230
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,170
Yun Shu and I have made it very clear.

231
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,810
In front of outsiders,

232
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,930
we'd try to keep distance

233
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,030
and pretend to be strangers.

234
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,300
Professor Zhang.

235
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,310
I know you are always
thinking for others.

236
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,840
But you can't treat girls

237
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,200
like that.

238
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,440
What do you mean "like that"?

239
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,940
[Girls]

240
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,170
[judge by feeling.]

241
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:24,330
[You need to tell the whole story clearly]

242
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,490
[or they'll misunderstand.]

243
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:34,940
Sir, I have something to report.

244
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:41,130
So you mean,

245
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:44,290
I need to explain my motives
clearly to Yun Shu?

246
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,260
Sure.

247
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:48,270
Girls always overthink.

248
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,720
Thank you.

249
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,090
You're welcome.

250
00:16:58,630 --> 00:16:59,660
What?

251
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,830
You quit your job?

252
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,320
Where do you live now?

253
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,240
I made a deal with the supervisor.

254
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:06,770
I'm working until the weekend.

255
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,420
And I'll check in the
law firm next Monday.

256
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,520
There are dormitories.

257
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:10,869
I can live there.

258
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:15,670
Update me on what's been going on
with you and Mr. Zhang.

259
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:18,250
Mr. Zhang and me?

260
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,500
I feel a little...

261
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,220
Yun Shu.

262
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:28,860
I think

263
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,720
you've won.

264
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:32,050
I won?

265
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,870
Mr. Zhang is regretting it.

266
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,580
Mr. Zhang must be very reluctant

267
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,110
since you ran away from home.

268
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,040
But he's also reluctant
to welcome you back.

269
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,550
So, he took every opportunity

270
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:45,850
to show up in front of you.

271
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:50,780
That can't be true.

272
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,080
It has to be.

273
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:55,110
Okay, stop.

274
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,140
Tell me

275
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,700
what's happening between you and Gu Xiao.

276
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,720
We...

277
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,790
are in an ambiguous phase.

278
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,040
Ambiguous phase?

279
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,210
What stage is that?

280
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,980
It's the same thing
as you and Mr. Zhang.

281
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,910
How can you ask so many detailed things?

282
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:17,930
Now I'm embarrassed.

283
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,770
I can't understand without details.

284
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:20,750
Well...

285
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,560
Imagine it yourself.

286
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:23,950
Ambiguous phase?

287
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,650
Have you gone through
the customer details?

288
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,750
Yes.

289
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,860
Everyone, listen to Miss Lan.

290
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,010
Has the customer arrived yet?

291
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,030
Yes.

292
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:33,920
It seems that someone is filming.

293
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,890
It's Lu Yu.

294
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,180
It's really Lu Yu!

295
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,110
Xiao Li, let me explain.

296
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:42,300
Cut.

297
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:44,260
Come on. What's wrong with you?

298
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:46,080
Can you make it more real?

299
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:46,760
Hit for real!

300
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,010
Okay, one more.

301
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:48,980
One more...

302
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,800
One more time.

303
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,490
Alright. Get ready.

304
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,300
You've gone too far.

305
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:56,690
Xiao Li, let me explain.

306
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:59,370
How could you betray me?

307
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,580
Cut.

308
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,270
It's okay if there's no technical problem.

309
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,300
Work on this immediately.

310
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:05,010
Director, one more take.

311
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,640
I wasn't in a good state.

312
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,020
Once more? Can you take it?

313
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,100
I'm young, I'm fine.

314
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,130
One more take.

315
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,300
Fine.

316
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,410
Thank you, senior.

317
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,820
I'll definitely try my best.

318
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,970
All right, all departments get ready.

319
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,240
Xiao Li, let me explain.

320
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:20,580
How could you betray me?

321
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:21,420
Cut.

322
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,170
Okay.

323
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:22,920
Next scene.

324
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,880
Good.

325
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:27,300
Let's go to the meeting.

326
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:42,560
Before

327
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:44,820
I thought I'd never come back.

328
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,990
It's like a lifetime ago

329
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,000
as I walk in.

330
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:50,960
Academician Zhang.

331
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:52,520
You can't joke about this.

332
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:54,040
Why is it a joke?

333
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,420
Sincere words.

334
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,720
-Grandpa.
-Sit down.

335
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,570
Grandpa, look.

336
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:00,790
Is the home particularly clean?

337
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,180
And are you in a better mood now?

338
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,570
Of course.

339
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,080
I got you two here,

340
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,760
so I feel good.

341
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,430
Grandpa, are you hungry?

342
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,630
I'll cook for you.

343
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,160
-Okay.
-Please wait here.

344
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,640
There will be a lot of
delicious food tonight.

345
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,330
It's more comfortable to be at home.

346
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:31,990
Mr. Zhang.

347
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,520
Where's grandpa?

348
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,770
Grandpa said he wanted to read some books.

349
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,670
Let me help you.

350
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,190
Then help me cut

351
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,330
the vegetables I washed.

352
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,300
Okay.

353
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,450
Let me help you.

354
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,790
It's fine. I can do it myself.

355
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,610
It's okay. Let me do it.

356
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:08,050
Thank you.

357
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,030
I heard from Miss Shen

358
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,340
that sudden marriages

359
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,800
and divorces

360
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,490
have a particularly bad impact on girls.

361
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,800
I don't want you

362
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,450
to suffer any harm from the outside world.

363
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,240
Okay, I got it.

364
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,720
Before,

365
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:45,330
I overthought.

366
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:46,710
No.

367
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,230
Before,

368
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,860
I was thoughtless.

369
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,980
Grandpa, the meal is not ready yet.

370
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,870
I want to ask you two

371
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:59,520
to sleep over with me.

372
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,910
Go back tomorrow, okay?

373
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,180
-Okay.
-No.

374
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:10,260
Okay. Grandpa, no problem.

375
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:33,760
Yun Shu.

376
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,430
What's on your mind?

377
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,930
Grandpa.

378
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:40,300
It's late.

379
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:41,600
Why haven't you slept yet?

380
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,560
Old people habits.

381
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,440
They're hungry, afraid of death

382
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,590
and don't want to sleep.

383
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:48,370
There is still rice.

384
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,610
-I'll heat it for you.
-No.

385
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,270
I'll just eat two pieces of this.

386
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,390
Grandpa,

387
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,640
I have a question to ask you.

388
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:57,650
Go ahead.

389
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:59,110
Does Mr. Zhang

390
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:02,260
not like Andersen's Fairy Tales?

391
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,340
Why did you suddenly ask this?

392
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,790
When I was cleaning up in the
guest room on the second floor,

393
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,850
I accidentally saw
an Andersen's Fairy Tales book.

394
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,510
Several pages were scribbled on.

395
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,940
I think that was intentional.

396
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:18,200
So...

397
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:22,890
The Daughter of the Sea.

398
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,960
That's Si Nian's

399
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,570
favourite fairy tale

400
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:32,850
and the biggest pain in his heart.

401
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,770
[When Si Nian was four years old,]

402
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:39,650
[his parents went abroad
to participate in an academic research.]

403
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,880
[They planned to come back
during summer vacation at first.]

404
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:45,940
[Si Nian had hoped his mother
would come back early every day.]

405
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:48,780
[But in the end...]

406
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:53,090
[When I saw Si Nian,]

407
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,460
I really didn't have the
courage to tell him the truth.

408
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:00,360
[So I used his favourite
bedtime fairy tale]

409
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,860
[to coax him.]

410
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:03,770
[I told him]

411
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,360
[his mum didn't leave us.]

412
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:09,250
[Actually, his mum is a mermaid.]

413
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,690
[Now she is back in the sea.]

414
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:13,890
[When he grows up,]

415
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,790
she will come back to see him.

416
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,750
But lies

417
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,330
can't last forever.

418
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,740
Grandpa.

419
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,880
Don't say that.

420
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:31,880
It's not the case that he
doesn't believe in fairy tales.

421
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,480
He

422
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:35,440
just hasn't had time yet

423
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,340
to say goodbye to the one he used to be.

424
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,320
Yun Shu.

425
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,560
Do you know the reason

426
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,020
why

427
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:46,420
I asked you and Si Nian to get married?

428
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:51,190
Because I know

429
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:55,580
you're a kind and warm-hearted girl.

430
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,640
I believe you will have
an influence on Si Nian,

431
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:00,440
helping him to warm up to others.

432
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,580
Grandpa,

433
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:06,250
I promise you.

434
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,920
Does it fit?

435
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,420
Yes. Except that it's loose at the waist.

436
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:20,650
It's okay.

437
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,810
Make do for the night.

438
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,190
Today,

439
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,000
thank you for staying.

440
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:52,170
Grandpa is very happy.

441
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:53,860
No worries.

442
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:56,870
I happen to be off for a few days.

443
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,420
It's late.

444
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,440
Go to bed earlier.

445
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,840
We will go back

446
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,050
first thing tomorrow.

447
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,190
Mr. Zhang,

448
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,540
are you asleep?

449
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,290
Not yet.

450
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:31,930
That day,

451
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,050
I didn't mean to enter your room
and rummage through your things.

452
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:37,670
You're not mad at me, are you?

453
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:38,730
No.

454
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,920
That day,

455
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:43,770
I overacted a little bit.

456
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,530
Grandpa told me everything.

457
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,430
What did he say to you?

458
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,160
The mermaid story.

459
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,420
It's already the past.

460
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:55,910
Fairy tales

461
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,620
are for coaxing kids.

462
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,230
In the real society,

463
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,150
they don't exist.

464
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:04,750
Mr. Zhang,

465
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:09,420
can I say what I think?

466
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:11,540
Nevertheless,

467
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,350
all the emotions in it

468
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:14,820
are real.

469
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,220
So,

470
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,120
don't invalidate it.

471
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:28,650
Mr. Zhang?

472
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,260
Yun Shu.

473
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:38,660
Actually, in private,

474
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:42,360
we don't have to deliberately
keep our distance.

475
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:51,160
What do you mean?

476
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,040
I mean

477
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:01,800
since you don't mind,

478
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,160
I don't mind

479
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,870
making our relationship known.

480
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,360
Go to sleep.

481
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,030
-Goodnight.
-Goodnight.

482
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,340
Why are you here again?

483
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:51,010
It's too windy outside.

484
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,240
Just let me in.

485
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,430
What are you doing here?

486
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,260
I have a cold.

487
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,590
What a cold day!

488
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,030
What happened to your face?

489
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,180
Well, I'm allergic.

490
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,440
I can't eat seafood.

491
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,700
My friend insisted that
I eat seafood porridge.

492
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,000
That's the reason.

493
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,480
Here.

494
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,500
Ice bag.

495
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,420
Apply it yourself.

496
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:49,760
You have a fever?

497
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,370
No.

498
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,260
What are you doing?

499
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:32,890
I thought you didn't
watch the TV series I starred in.

500
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,700
Here. Ginger tea.

501
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:51,250
Don't push it.

502
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:52,900
Umm...

503
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:56,020
Can I sleep here tonight?

504
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:59,190
I'm not feeling well. Take pity on me.

505
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,370
I'm all alone.

506
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:02,410
It's still so windy outside

507
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,860
and I still have a fever.

508
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,100
Please allow me to stay here.

509
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,170
I'll sleep on the sofa.

510
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,860
If you dare enter the room,

511
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,400
I'll kick you out.

512
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:10,650
Kick me to death.

513
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,500
I left a note next to the breakfast
on the table.

514
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:20,070
Let grandpa sleep a little longer.

515
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:21,270
Let's go first.

516
