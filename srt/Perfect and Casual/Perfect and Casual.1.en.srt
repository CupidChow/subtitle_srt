Come on.

00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,910
How could you fight
over the garbage sorting?

25
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,850
I think it's not about
the garbage sorting.

26
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,030

00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:10,620
Wow.

He's so perfect.

35
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:19,420
Be careful.

36
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,180
You have a cup of coffee in your hand.

37
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,160
Thanks.

38
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:38,920
5 minutes 23 seconds have passed

39
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,570
since you began to order the coffee.

40
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,990
May I ask if you're done?

41
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:42,910

Please.

Thank you.

46

Hello.

47
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:53,590
Make a Latte for me

48
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,690
according to what I wrote.

49
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:55,660
Thank you.

50
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:58,110
Sir, it's so meticulous.

51
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,760
If you see it a trouble,

52
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:00,970
I can do it myself.

53
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,960
The water temperature should
be controlled within precise 90℃,

54
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,920
so that the aroma of
coffee can be stimulated

55
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,740
without excessive tannin

56
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,500
that can cause a bitter taste.

57
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,790
Steam pressure should
be controlled properly

58
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,820
so that dense and fine
foam can be generated.

59
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:17,560
When mixing,

60
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:20,640
the coffee cup should
lean at a 35 degree angle.

61
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,210
The milk flow rate should be

62
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,340
2.5 cubic centimeters per second,

63
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,350
spinning squarely.

64
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,770
And then a perfect pine
needle pattern is made.

65
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,430
Is it whole milk?

66
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,400
Yeah.

67
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,450
You want to have skim milk?

68
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,000
I want to have lactose-free milk.

69
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,409
I'm with lactose intolerance.

70
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,330
Sorry,

71
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,290
I can't have this coffee.

72
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,260
Alright.

73
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,630
It's on me

74
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,159
I'll make another one for you.

75
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,250
Don't bother.

76
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,000
I like to do it myself.

77
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:52,860
Senior.

78
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,720
Give it to me.

79
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,010
Sir.

80
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,440
It's on me now.

81
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:01,440
How about that?

82
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,210
Don't bother.

83
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,660
I can pay for it myself.

84
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,290
It's just a cup of coffee.

85
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,050
Since you want to drink Latte,

86
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,890
why did you nitpick the milk?

87
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,640
The black coffee is classic.
You're really fastidious.

88
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,850
Fastidious?

From today on,

93
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,240
I'm responsible for two classes,
which are Statistics

94
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:47,320
and Complex Variables Functions.

95
00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:48,870
I hope all of you will be punctual

96
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,350
for my class

97
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,280
and stay until the end.

98
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,740
Anyone who wants to call in sick should

99
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,770
get the formal approval letter

100
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,690
from a grade A tertiary hospital.

101
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:57,790
If any of you want to know

102
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,230
my research,

103
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:00,440
you can spend your spare time

104
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:02,270
browsing my information online.

105
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,870
Time of the class is really valuable.

106
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,150
So I won't introduce myself in detail.

107
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,630
Today, we're going to learn

108
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,890
the feature of complex variables functions.

109
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,080
Mr. Zhang is

110
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,360
so amazing.

111
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:12,110
Really?

112
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,150
He won the International
Mathematical Olympiad Gold Award

113
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:15,040
when he was 14.

114
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:16,390
And he was recommended for
admission to the university at 16.

115
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,490
He was admitted to MTI at 18

116
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,090
and gained his doctoral degree

117
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:20,870
within 4 years and 3 months.

118
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,260
He became the associate professor

119
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,050
when he was 28 years old.

120
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,470
Look, he's really awesome.

121
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,570
But why did he choose to
be a teacher in our university

122
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,600
rather than staying abroad?

123
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:29,470
So, he may contribute to his Alma Mater

124
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,000
after finishing his school abroad.

125
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:34,440
Fair enough.

126
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:36,990
The Complex Variables Functions
can date back to as early as 18th century.

127
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,350
It was found by Euler and d'Alembert,

128
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,880
two mathematicians.

129
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,820
The features of the
Complex Variables Functions

130
00:06:40,909 --> 00:06:42,890
I wrote on the blackboard

131
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,040
can be classified into three groups.

132
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:44,790
[Yun Shu.]

133
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,790
[The new teacher of your department]

134
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,040
[is really handsome, isn't he?]

135
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,710
[He's not handsome. The photo you saw is fake]
[Get me a profile photo]

136
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,420
[I'll sketch him]
[and let me appreciate it.]

137
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,850
The reason why I chose the
Complex Variables Functions

138
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,370
as the first class

139
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,140
is that I want to make it clear that

140
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,159
everyone is required to be accurate

141
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,630
without any errors.

142
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,240
It's the indispensable faith that

143
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,310
we as those learning
math should keep in mind.

144
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:20,300
What are you doing?

145
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,530
[More accurate]

146
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,970
I have two buttons on my coat,

147
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,150
but you drew three.

148
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,590
I have a watch on my left hand,

149
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,790
but you drew it on my right hand.

150
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:36,770
Above all,

151
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,750
you drew a pair of glasses

152
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,909
with totally different
texture and design from mine.

153
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,210
Even if you want to sketch
or be absent-minded in class,

154
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,760
I hope you can make it accurate.

155
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:45,990
Not like this.

156
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,020
A whole picture is
nothing but stupid errors.

157
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:01,120
He's amazing.

158
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,050
He's gone viral on my WeChat Moment.

159
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,970
Have you ever met such weird guy?

160
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,150
He wasn't angry

161
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,360
but said that I didn't
paint it in the way he looks.

162
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,540
Yun Shu.

163
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,410
When will you attend his class again?

164
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,700
Take me with you.

165
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:15,570
I want to learn something from him.

166
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,240
Learn something?

167
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:19,600
Oh come on, Gao Zhi Yi.

168
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,490
That's enough.

169
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,820
What?

170
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:23,610
Listen, you can

171
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,220
fangirl anyone

172
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,320
except him.

173
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:29,090
I was humiliated greatly in front of

174
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,340
my junior fellow students

175
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,750
because of him.

176
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,500
OK, I won't fangirl him.

177
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:40,600
But, he's your teacher

178
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,940
and you'll feel the pinch

179
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,620
in the future.

180
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:46,520
Impossible!

181
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,880
I'll have my graduation
thesis defense in one week

182
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,640
and then I'll

183
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:52,280
secure a stable job

184
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,390
and have a cozy house.

185

All walls in the house
will be my drawing board

Or are you proficient
in a second language?

It's the seventh company
I've interviewed at.

It's really hard to get a job.

I have an important
business talk later.

00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:35,820
Have a look.

342
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,140
It's in a high-end community

343
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,050
with excellent greening

344
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,250
and fully-equipped supporting facilities.

345
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,000
Twenty-four-hour door-to-door
on-site property service is guaranteed.

346
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:44,760
Have a look at the floor plan.

347
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,460
Two bedrooms and a
living room with a balcony.

348
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,090
Wow.

349
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,570
It has good lighting and good ventilation.

350
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:54,240
Above all, the owner is going to
immigrate so the house is on sale,

351
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,290
20% off.

352
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,930
Also, the price can be even lower.

353
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:58,280
Well, how much is it?

354
00:14:58,370 --> 00:14:59,590
6.5 million yuan.

355
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,040
It's too expensive.

356
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:04,360
Nowadays, nobody will pay
the entire bill to buy a house.

357
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:05,620
You can have a mortgage.

358
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,810
You're going to graduate.

359
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,780
And from a famous university.

360
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,470
You're going to secure a good job.

361
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,890
Plus,

362
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:12,940
your sister is an international lawyer.

363
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,440
You two can easily have a mortgage

364
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:16,530
to pay 50% or 60% of the bill.

365
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,210
You know that

366
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,510
the money is the accident fund

367
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,670
left by my dad.

368
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,570
I should take it more seriously.

369
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,540
So...

370
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:31,080
Yun Shu, think about it.

371
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,920
Uncle left the money to you
and your sister.

372
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:36,130
He also wants you two to

373
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:40,470
have a house.

374
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,070
Can you recall your past life

375
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,290
in your childhood?

376
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,990
You've owed me 3-month rent

377
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,310
-I didn't shoo you away.
-I'm really sorry.

378
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,610
How could you doodle on my walls?

379
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,840
You really see it as your own home?

380
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,060
Cut the crap.

381
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:50,910
Sorry.

382
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,840
-The deadline is 7 p.m. tonight.
-I promise.

383
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,110
If you can't give me the
rent, then you can move out.

384
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,170
Take it easy.

385
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,570
Dad, I won't draw anything on the walls.

386
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,780
Sorry.

387
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,430
It's OK, Yun Shu.

388
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,450
You didn't do anything wrong.

389
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:04,600
Believe me.

390
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:05,640
In the future,

391
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:09,170
we'll have a big house

392
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,900
with wooden floor and French windows.

393
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:14,330
We can draw pictures together

394
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,790
every afternoon.

395
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,760
Okay.

396
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:22,540
Yun Shu.

397
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:24,170
Think about it.

398
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,290
Buying a real estate is the
most prudent investment.

399
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,770
You and your sister have your own house,

400
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,300
and then you'll have a shelter.

401
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,310
That's the best way
to live up to your father.

402
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,150
Yun Shu.

403
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:46,510
Yi Yi.

404
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,460
Yun Shu.

405
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:49,320
I have a new idea.

406
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:50,470
What?

407
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:53,240
I got the first-class scholarship.

408
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,190
Wow, you're awesome, Yi Yi.

409
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,410
First-class scholarship!

410
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,260
Yi Yi, you really have it all.

411
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:58,990
Bling Bling.

412
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,260
I also have it all.

413
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:01,760
[Nurse Practitioner Certificate ]
Look, I became a regular worker.

414
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:04,190
Wow, Lin Nuo. It's been five years

415
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,190
and you finally made it.

416
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,280
Applause.

417
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:10,290
I have a good news.

418
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,329
I got a job.

419
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,510
Well, it's not the point.

420
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:18,020
The point is I bought a house.

421
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,869
What? You're going to buy a house?

422
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,160
When?

423
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,569
It's out of the blue.

424
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,010
It's by accident.

425
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:26,819
My cousin

426
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,510
found a really proper house for me.

427
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,220
It's cheap and the location is good.

428
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,120
Also I can afford the down payment.

429
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:33,240
My parents left me some money.

430
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:35,840
Well, it can just pay the down payment.

431
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:36,340
Wow.

432
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,030
Look, it is the floor plan.

433
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:41,330
Wow! Its area is over 100 square
meters and it's in the downtown.

434
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,870
Oh my god, Yun Shu.

435
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:46,080
You really have it all.

436
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:48,190
Let me hug you.

437
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:48,990
Come on.

438
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,520
I also want a hug.

439
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,240
What are you doing? Behave yourself.

440
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:55,790
Don't touch me.

441
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,910
What now?

442
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,560
You always spoon with me.

443
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:00,290
You still have a crush on me.

444
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,760
I didn't mean to flirt with you.

445
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:03,520
I just want to
beat you violently.

446
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:04,390
You couldn't see that?

447
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,550
Alright! Stop.

448
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,020
Stop fighting.

449
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,090
How about

450
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,440
you two get together again?

451
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,310
Don't make trouble for others.

452
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,260
Urgh!

453
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,020
I must have been blind

454
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:14,910
to fall in love with him.

455
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:15,550
Come on.

456
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:16,740
You are the one who

457
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,020
took me as a study object.

458
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,090
And the message of all my
families and even my ancestors

459
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:19,950
have been uploaded to CNKI.

460
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,320
Stop!

461
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:25,040
I'm the leading character today.

462
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:26,690
Let's go for a celebration.

463
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,970
Alright, my treat.

464
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:29,880
Hang on.

465
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:30,460
Not today.

466
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:31,170
You have your final defense tomorrow.

467
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,770
Come on, I've long finished my thesis.

468
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,440
I should just attend the defense.

469
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:37,590
I'll sing songs for you two tonight

470
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,040
till our death.

471
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:40,840
You can't stay up late

472
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,040
or you'll be late tomorrow.

473
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:43,010
Never mind.

474
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,440
I'll set over 20 alarm clocks.

475
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:46,300
I don't believe I can't get up even so.

476
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:48,790
Then.

477
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:49,890
Well, let's go.

478
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,570
Go, go!

479
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,720
Hello, I'm Zhang Si Nian.

480
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:13,790
I've ever contacted with your hospital.

481
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:17,350
I want to know if you find a new treatment

482
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,180
for the Lymphoma case
I've mentioned before.

483
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,720
[It's hopeful.]

484
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:27,820
OK, thanks.

485
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:49,920
Come on.

486
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,920
I got to stick to it.

487
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:55,870
Today I have the thesis
defense. It's my final war.

488
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:02,550
But I still have enough time.

489
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,150
So I can get some more sleep.

490
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:18,870
Hello, cousin.

491
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,370
[Where are you now, Yun Shu?]

492
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,240
[Come and sign the
house purchasing contract quickly]

493
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:22,810
[or you can't buy the house.]

494
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,970
[Lots of people have come
to see the house recently.]

495
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:25,830
House?

496
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:26,620
[Yeah.]

497
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,550
[Listen to me, Yun Shu.]

498
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:29,210
I have to sign the contract today?

499
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,790
[I've been pleading with the owner]

500
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:31,720
[to keep the house for you.]

501
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:33,700
But I have my thesis defense today.

502
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,590
[If you don't sign the
contract and pay the bill]

503
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,140
[and the house is so
saleable, others may...]

504
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:39,520
Well, wait for me, I'll rush to you.

505
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:57,990
Sorry, I'm late.

506
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,770
Never mind, I know that
you have the thesis defense.

507
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,790
OK, let's get it started.

508
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,460
Okay.

509
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,460
That's all, thank you.

510
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:06,560
Alright, your defense

511
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,510
[The Original University]

512
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:09,940
gets a pass. Congratulations!

513
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,440
Thanks.

514
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:31,610
[Dr. Zhang]
Next.

515
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,090
Next one, Yun Shu.

516
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:40,950
Sorry, Sir.

517
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,070
I got to answer a call outside.

518
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,040
Okay.

519
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,050
Is Yun Shu here?

520
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,980
Well, next one.

521
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:55,010
Sorry.

522
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,490
So how much more time
do you think I have left?

523
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,180
Oh, sorry.

524
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,800
Yes, go ahead.

525
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:06,550
Yun Shu.

526
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,660
Hello.

527
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:11,070
-You're Yun Shu, right?
-Yeah.

528
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:12,710
Come on, let's begin.

529
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,790
OK.

530
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,540
Sorry.

531
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:25,620
I delayed a little time on my way.

532
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:30,550
Sorry, Sir.

533
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,160
The title of my thesis is

534
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,880
Simple Analysis of Statistics
in the Big Data Age.

535
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:38,100
Excuse me, student.

536
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:40,720
Mr. Zhang.

537
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:43,130
You've forfeited your defense.

538
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,360
Why?

539
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,690
Because you're late.

540
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,930
But I'm just 5 minutes late.

541
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,270
According to rules,

542
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,150
I'm not late within 5 minutes.

543
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,540
You're 5 minutes 57 seconds late.

544
00:22:57,110 --> 00:23:00,680
57 seconds? You're
fussing about the 57 seconds.

545
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:02,000
Is 5 minutes 57 seconds

546
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,580
over 5 minutes?

547
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:05,500
Yes.

548
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,900
So according to the school rules,

549
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,250
you're over 5 minutes late,

550
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,400
so your thesis defense is a fail.

551
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:11,150
Mr. Zhang.

552
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:11,950
Mr. Zhang.

553
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,820
I rushed here.

554
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:15,200
I tried my best.

555
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:17,470
So could you please
give me a chance

556
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,120
for the sake of my four-year

557
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:20,150
studying at college?

558
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,500
I didn't mean it.

559
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:23,380
Are you a Statistics major?

560
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:23,980
Yes.

561
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,980
What's the definition of Statistics?

562
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:28,260
The Statistics is a
comprehensive discipline

563
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:30,770
that we can analyze and
organize data accurately

564
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,300
to infer the essence of things

565
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:34,970
and even predict the future.

566
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,050
You're right.

567
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,270
To analyze and organize
the data accurately.

568
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,800
You're not allowed to be over

569
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:40,950
5 minutes late according to school rules.

570
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,280
Take it as the cardinal number,

571
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:43,680
you're 19% late

572
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,830
than the set time.

573
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,980
As a Statistics major,

574
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:47,930
please answer me.

575
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,820
Do you think an error rate up to 19%

576
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:52,660
can be accepted in Statistics?

577
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:56,360
Yun Shu, your defense is over.

578
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,340
Miss Shen, next one.

579
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:02,570
Next one.

580
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,990
You're really the meanest teacher

581
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,910
I've ever seen.

582
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,960
Hold on.

583
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:12,420
The meanest teacher?

584
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,740
Before you get this proposition,

585
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:14,850
you have to have seen

586
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,030
all teachers in the world.

587
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:19,240
Then, you have the right
to say I'm the meanest teacher.

588
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,450
Well, have you ever met

589
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:23,790
all teachers in the world?

590
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,410
I hope you can

591
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,980
gather enough basic data

592
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,670
before you put forward similar ideas

593
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,430
and then you can come to a conclusion.

594
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:34,050
You can go.

595
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,100
Next.

596
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:41,250
One minute. Just one minute.

597
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,330
Just one minute.

598
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:43,900
He didn't give me the
graduation certificate.

599
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,170
What a jerk!

600
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,730
He's really mean.

601
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:48,330
Yun Shu, don't worry.

602
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,830
Let's ask him for an explanation.

603
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,770
Come on.

604
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:52,910
Don't make things worse.

605
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:57,060
How about we go to

606
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:58,900
appeal against him?

607
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,940
It can't work. He failed me
by using the school rules.

608
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,420
I was indeed late.

609
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:05,050
But it was just one minute.

610
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,530
It doesn't matter.

611
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:09,190
You've already found a job.

612
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:11,360
You'll get your graduation
certificate next year.

613
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:12,350
Job.

614
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,850
Yeah, your job.

615
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,130
What's wrong with my job?

616
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:16,420
You don't have the graduation certificate.

617
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:17,790
Can you secure your job?

618
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:20,260
Oh, I forgot that.

619
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:23,270
No!

620
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,760
That will be a no.

621
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:27,030
How could you fail to get
your graduation certificate?

622
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,700
I'm really sorry.

623
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:30,000
Can you make an exception for me?

624
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:31,740
I can get my graduation
certificate next year.

625
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,180
It's not about an exception.

626
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:35,100
It's about the personnel
system of our company.

627
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:37,080
Everyone should obey that.

628
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:40,720
Well, can Director Liu help me?

629
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:42,270
It's no use crying over spilt milk.

630
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,350
Your practice can't be

631
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,740
approved by the legal
department of our company.

632
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:53,310
Come on.

633
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:57,060
I didn't get my graduation certificate.

634
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,980
Now I've lost my job.

635
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,920
I'm really devastated.

636
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,260
Stop shouting.

637
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,340
Be more considerate
of other people's feelings.

638
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,810
Forget it!

639
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:13,180
Oh, come on. It's OK, Yun Shu.

640
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:14,760
You still have your house.

641
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,110
You can lick your wounds

642
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,490
in your new house.

643
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,750
When you pass your
thesis defense next year,

644
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:21,170
you'll be much more successful.

645
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:22,050
Yeah.

646
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,420
By then, many companies will

647
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:24,960
compete for you.

648
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,990
And all men will fall for you.

649
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:30,540
Indeed, I have it.

650
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,530
My treasure.

651
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,720
I'll go to see my house tomorrow.

652
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:34,150
Will you come with me?

653
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:35,560
My supervisor want
to talk with me tomorrow.

654
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,660
I'll visit your house when I'm free.

655
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:39,310
I'll go with Yi Yi.

656
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,580
-Okay.
-Okay.

657
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:43,090
Come on, drink up this cup of lucky water.

658
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,060
Tomorrow will be better.

659
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:44,860
Good luck.

660
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:45,930
We can do it!

661
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,750
I called him but he
didn't answer my phones.

662
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,980
What should I do?

663
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:55,900
Yeah.

664
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:57,430
Your calls weren't answered.

665
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,990
When they answer your
phone, you'll be allowed to get in.
