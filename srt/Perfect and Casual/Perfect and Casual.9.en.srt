I'll eat them right now.

Mr. Zhang,

108
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,680
I think my brain has long

109
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,660
ceased to develop.

110
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,060
Not really.

111
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,300

112

119
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,910
I mean the rice.

120
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:10,440
I mean that the rice

121
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,060
was on your face.

122
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,780
You mean Mr. Zhang
took you to attend his class

123
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,610
and he took off the rice on your face.

125
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:44,310

126
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,370
What?

127
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:50,260
I had a shower before
I went out this morning.

128
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,980
Is it the sweat smell?

129
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,790
I ran in school today.

130
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,690
Mr. Zhang must smell it.

131
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:03,150
It's a smell of

132
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,520
falling in love.

133
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,080
You freaked me out.

134
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:10,270
Yi Yi.

135
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,040
And I feel like

136
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14,830
that I really fell in love with Mr. Zhang.

137
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:20,080
Great.

138
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:22,810
Whatever, if you like a man,
you should take the initiative.

139
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,790
But we're contractual relationship.

140
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:26,900
Maybe he doesn't

141
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:28,970
like me.

142
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:33,210
Look at you, little fool.

143
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:35,580
Mr. Zhang married you.

144
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,910
He gave you a house.

145
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,010
Also, he took you to his
class and fed you publicly.

146
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,800
He definitely loves you.

147
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:41,780
What more do you want?

148
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,690
Well, what if he just

149
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:45,010
fulfills his performance?

150
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:46,380
Who cares?

151
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,680
If you try,

152
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:50,810
the contractual relationship
can turn to be a real love.

153
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,740
What should I do then?

154
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:57,990
First,

155
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,580
you should give him a hint that

156
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,980
you're in a relationship now.

157
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,610
And then you can give
him some love signals.

158
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,380
Giving him the eye.

159
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,430
And finally,

160
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,080
you can take action.

161
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:09,580
Just show your feelings
to Mr. Zhang directly.

162
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:10,380
So.

163
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:12,640
He'll know your mind.

164
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,010
OK, I got it.

165
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,230
You...

166
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,590
You've known that?

167
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,780
You paid attention

168
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,510
to my lecture yesterday,

169
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,430
so the accuracy of this testing paper

170
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:35,190
rose by 30 percent.

171
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,770
Why have you been

172
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,160
staring at me recently?

173
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,790
I... I... I haven't.

174
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,850
Do you wanna

175
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,180
ask me any questions?

176
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:58,090
Well, Mr. Zhang, I have something for you.

177
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,760
Wait a second, I'm going to get it.

178
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,770
Pyjamas.

179
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,200
Coloured?

180
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,230
I show the wrong one.

181
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,760
It's not yours.

182
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,120
This one is yours.

183
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,830
They both look the same.

184
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,840
Because they're sweetheart outfits.

185
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,650
The sweetheart outfits of
the store are on sale today.

186
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,340
So I bought them.

187
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,130
Egyptian Cotton.

188
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:29,680
It feels nice.

189
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:31,530
I'll take this gift.

190
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,560
Anyway.

191
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:33,580
The income of financing

192
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,650
is your cost of daily living.

193
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,610
In the future,

194
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,810
you can spend more money on yourself.

195
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,020
OK, I got it.

196
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,340
It's late today.

197
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:43,430
Go to the bed and have a rest.

198
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,400
Good night.

199
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,400
Good night.

200
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,460
Many shop assistants can judge

201
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,630
what kind of person the customer is.

202
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:03,310
So an excellent shop
assistant should be equipped

203
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,360
with this important working technique.

204
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:06,730
If we can digitalize our

205
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:08,810
intuitive judgment,

206
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:10,790
we can get our desired answer

207
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,360
by computing.

208
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:13,210
First step,

209
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:14,680
we can set

210
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:15,280
the prior probability

211
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:16,640
through our experience.

212
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:26,830
Mr. Zhang is really handsome.

213
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,860
He doesn't only look good,

214
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:30,640
but also is knowledgeable.

215
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,960
Really?

216
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:33,330
Oh, give me a break.

217
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,570
Don't be his fangirls.

218
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,950
Nonsense.

219
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,780
It's useless for him to be knowledgeable.

220
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,320
He's just teaching math.

221
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:42,530
So what?

222
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:45,360
Math is the cornerstone
of human development.

223
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:46,110
Do you know that?

224
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:47,210
Cornerstone?

225
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:48,660
It's just a stepping-stone.

226
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,600
You know nothing.

227
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:51,430
Shallow people like you

228
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,310
will have a gloomy future.

229
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,270
I have a gloomy future?

230
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:57,300
Do you know how much money I
can earn through playing games?

231
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:58,490
I'm not interested in it.

232
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,760
It's time for class now.

233
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,160
If you have any question,

234
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,000
you can raise the question

235
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:07,540
so that we can have a discussion.

236
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:10,930
Since Mr. Zhang lets us to discuss it.

237
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,280
I'd like to ask you something.

238
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:13,010
Mr. Zhang,

239
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:15,900
those subjects we have to learn such as
mathematical analysis,

240
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:16,880
complex function,

241
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,609
reliability mathematics and et cetera

242
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,260
won't be useful in life

243
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:21,930
once we graduate.

244
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,109
What's the point?

245
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,079
Can we get a job with it?

246
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,349
How much will we earn?

247
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,829
If I team with my
classmates to play games,

248
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,369
we can earn much more money.

249
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,920
It seems that you're a curious student.

250
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,280
You raised three questions just now.

251
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:34,560
Well, what is Math?

252
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,920
Math lays the rational
foundation for people

253
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:37,990
to know the world.

254
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:40,140
Though many irrational
behaviours abound

255
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,730
in the world,

256
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,360
people always hope they can

257
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:45,890
picture these phenomena in a rational way.

258
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:46,900
For example,

259
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,370
in terms of statistics,

260
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,460
we have some mental effects

261
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,480
like the Matthew Effect,

262
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:54,580
Break Pane Law,
Marshmallow Effect and so on.

263
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:55,480
Besides,

264
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,050
in anthropology,

265
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,580
there are also

266
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:00,630
the Crowd Theory

267
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,100
and the Wisdom of Crowds.

268
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,490
Hold on, Mr. Zhang.

269
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,090
I can't understand what you said just now.

270
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,440
Can you put it plainly?

271
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,100
You play games, right?

272
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,680
Computer games?

273
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,660
Yeah.

274
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,680
In the middle of last century,

275
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,430
Turing and von Neumann

276
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,200
by virtue of their solid
mathematical knowledge,

277
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:28,730
created the structural pattern
of modern computer,

278
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,760
leading people

279
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,420
into the Information Age.

280
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,090
No offence.

281
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,170
If there is no math,

282
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,520
you and your team members

283
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:38,120
can only play games
using an abacus.

284
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,530
I don't play games,

285
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,650
but I know

286
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,610
in the professional e-sports scene,

287
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,040
the key to win the game

288
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:51,360
is still math.

289
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:52,360
Am I right?

290
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,340
I always believe that

291
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,100
we didn't choose math

292
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:02,790
but math chose us.

293
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,780
Oh, my god. He's amazing.

294
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:10,910
Follow up!

295
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:13,160
He convinced others with his
high IQ. He's really excellent.

296
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,670
Can you be more reserved, Gao Zhi Yi?

297
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,310
Mr. Zhang is Yun Shu's husband now.

298
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,750
I'm just reflecting Yun Shu's
inner feelings.

299
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,860
Right, Yun Shu?

300
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,410
Come on.

301
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:29,760
Are you really angry?

302
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,860
Of course not. Why would I be?

303
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:34,260
I'm just thinking.

304
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,200
The gap between Mr. Zhang and I

305
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:38,240
is so big.

306
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,440
Kind of.

307
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,880
But it's not a big deal.

308
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,660
You just need to be braver.

309
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,100
I've told you that you
need to show your feelings.

310
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,680
Give him some signals. Did you do that?

311
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:55,650
Yes.

312
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,040
You did?

313
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,340
What did you do?

314
00:19:58,450 --> 00:19:59,850
I bought him a new lounge wear

315
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,230
using the interest from my investment.

316
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,380
And they're his-and-hers.

317
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:04,660
Did he take it?

318
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,450
Yes.

319
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,560
Did he say anything?

320
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,240
He said...

321
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,050
"Not bad."

322
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,430
That's it.

323
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,640
What?

324
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,520
You and Mr. Zhang are doing it for real.

325
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:20,360
We have to take further action.

326
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:21,400
Be more initiative.

327
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:22,980
You have to make Mr.
Zhang feel your presence.

328
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,180
You have to overwhelm him
with your great love.

329
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:28,590
Who is it? Who hit me?

330
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:29,780
Do you know how to play basketball?

331
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,260
You didn't see people here?

332
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,630
Sorry. My bad.

333
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:34,910
Are you OK?

334
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,800
Oh, come on. What department are you in?

335
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,820
Don't be so rude to him.

336
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:41,960
I'm fine.

337
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,790
Thanks.

338
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,340
Are you really okay?

339
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,830
Let's go to have a check at the hospital.

340
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,710
Oh, come on. You can have a try.

341
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:52,830
Let me hit you.

342
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,800
You...

343
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,090
I'm really OK. No biggie.

344
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,100
What department are you in?

345
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,630
I've never seen you before.

346
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,100
I've long graduated.

347
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:06,300
I just came here to run an errand

348
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,830
and just dropped by to play basketball.

349
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,600
I'm Gu Xiao.

350
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:09,810
I'm Gao Zhi Yi.

351
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,980
Can I have your WeChat?

352
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:12,950
OK.

353
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:18,040
WeChat me if you have any problem.

354
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,430
Alright, I'll treat you
to dinner some day.

355
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:27,060
Let's continue.

356
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,400
I'll pick your eyes up from the ground

357
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,560
and put them back,

358
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:34,260
in case you became blind.

359
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:38,630
Look. Just as I said.

360
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,780
It's really easy for a
woman to chase after a man.

361
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,310
Yi Yi, wipe your mouth.

362
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,320
I can see your drool.

363
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:46,490
Oh, come on.

364
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:49,690
You have to make it clear to me.

365
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:51,060
What's going on with your divorce?

366
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:51,830
Mum!

367
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,180
This is my workplace.

368
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,940
I'll tell you everything at home, OK?

369
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,350
No way.

370
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,530
Don't call me mum.

371
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,000
Shame on you.

372
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:00,180
If you're divorced,

373
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,680
what will you do in the future?

374
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,750
Once you get divorced,

375
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,440
it's not easy for you to
remarry someone else.

376
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:09,080
If you really dare to get divorced,

377
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:10,860
I'll cut ties with you.

378
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:11,630
Mum!

379
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,880
Don't talk nonsense.

380
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:13,850
Miss Shen.

381
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,400
I need you to help me

382
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:18,650
to adjust the working
schedule for next week.

383
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:19,990
OK, Professor Zhang.

384
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:20,730
Hello,

385
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,940
you're Lan Lan's superior, right?

386
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:25,890
Hello.

387
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,130
Alright, listen.

388
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,600
Can you be the judge?

389
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:29,250
Shen Lan...

390
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,360
Mum.

391
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:31,890
Just stop.

392
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,460
Miss Shen is an outstanding person.

393
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:39,070
She's great at logical thinking

394
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,760
or emotional control.

395
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:45,620
Come on, Mum, let's leave.

396
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:49,050
Look at you.

397
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,280
Do you know that gossip is dreadful?

398
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:53,660
You've really let me down.

399
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,940
Alright, I'll go.

400
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:04,290
Professor Zhang,

401
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:05,560
can I sit here?

402
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:06,940
Be my guest.

403
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,620
I want to thank you for
what you did for me today.

404
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,440
No worries.

405
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,710
I just told her what I saw.

406
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:25,860
By the way, Miss Shen,

407
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,830
does a divorce really affect

408
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:28,960
the modern women vastly?

409
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:30,920
Hard to say.

410
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:32,750
But it will exert some
impact more or less.

411
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,650
People won't care too much

412
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,720
about what happened between a couple.

413
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,840
I won't be like Xiang Lin's wife,

414
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,280
so I won't explain everything to everyone.

415
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:41,650
Therefore,

416
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:44,530
people will guess

417
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,560
what happened,

418
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:46,810
and over time,

419
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,160
what the truth is

420
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,330
no longer matters.

421
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,890
Maybe it's just as your mum said just now.

422
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:54,380
Rumour is dreadful.

423
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,620
Yes.

424
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:13,800
[Yun Shu.]

425
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:15,280
[You don't have to prepare dinner for me.]

426
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,740
[I'm staying late for work.]

427
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:21,300
[Gender Relations in
China's Current Social Formation ]

428
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:29,890
What are you doing?

429
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:31,470
Mr. Zhang.

430
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,070
I just finished doing laundry.

431
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,330
I folded your clothes

432
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,850
and put them into your wardrobe.

433
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:37,680
Mr. Zhang,

434
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,790
you still read fairy tales?

435
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:44,090
That's very kind of you.

436
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,190
You should just take care
of yourself in the future

437
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:48,050
I can take care of my own affairs.

438
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,020
Okay.

439
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,560
I'll leave you then.

440
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,800
I'm done.

441
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:17,030
Mr. Zhang,

442
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,230
the noodles I cooked
today doesn't taste good?

443
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:20,530
No.

444
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,680
Hold on, Mr. Zhang.

445
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,840
After I finish my breakfast,
I'll be right with you.

446
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:30,790
Yun Shu.

447
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,590
From today on,

448
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:35,650
you don't have to attend my class.

449
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,410
You can study at home.

450
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,340
I'll answer your questions

451
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:41,240
when I'm home.

452
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,560
Mr. Zhang,

453
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,460
did I do something wrong at school

454
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:48,310
and affected your teaching?

455
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,720
I was just thoughtless.

456
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,610
Our relationship

457
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:58,340
is likely to have some negative effects.

458
00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:59,440
I indeed neglected

459
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,680
this aspect.

460
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,110
From today on,

461
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,590
we should avoid
showing up together in public,

462
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,650
especially in our shared
social environments

463
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:09,700
like the school.

464
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,720
Mr. Zhang, I…

465
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,850
I'm going to be late.

466
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:16,510
I have to go.

467
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,000
Hello, is this express delivery?

468
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,100
Yeah.

469
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:30,040
Please tell me the express code.

00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:33,600
OK.

472
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:38,460
I love you all my life.

473
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,570
Don't go.

474
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:45,660
How did you know my phone number?

475
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:48,420
There's nothing I can't do.

476
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,280
Childish!

477
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,580
Do you know the difference
between you and a monkey?

478
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:53,920
One lives in caves.

479
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,100
And another one

480
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,460
lives in my heart.

481
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,560
Listen, you have to go to see a doctor.

482
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:03,930
What the hell do you want from me?

483
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,830
I want to you to be my girlfriend.
You really have a poor memory.

484
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,580
You should go to see a doctor with me.

485
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:09,520
You can't arouse my hormone.

486
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:11,060
How could it be?

487
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:13,060
I'm the prince charming
of 0.5 billion girls.

488
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,100
I'm not a girl.

489
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:15,290
I also don't dream.

490
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,020
No woman can refuse me

491
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:19,280
in this world.

492
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:30,680
Listen, you must think
you're living in a drama.

493
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:32,000
An idol, chick flick

494
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:34,070
where you are the successful alpha male.

495
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,960
Do you dare to bet with me?

496
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,590
Give me one month.

497
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,400
And I will step into your heart.

498
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:43,110
I can give you two months

499
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,290
and you won't even step
a foot inside my house.

500
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,260
Deal.

501
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:47,840
What?

502
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:50,220
I'll get in your house within two months.

503
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:52,690
Hold on.

504
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:53,770
Don't leave.

505
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,090
This is for you.

506
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,620
You have to take it.

507
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,880
It's a deal, Miss Yun.

508
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,120
Perfect.

509
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:41,540

00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:02,700
It's a bit heavy. Are you OK with it?

520
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:03,450
Never mind.

521
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,330
Take it easy.

522
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,890
-OK, thanks.
-Bye.

523
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:13,460
And then?

524
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,650
Then...

525
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:16,880
Nothing else.

526
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:17,920
What?

527
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,260
Nothing else?

528
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,930
It's so strange.

529
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,340
You were so good the day before.

530
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,290
You ate together and you gave him a gift.

531
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,910
Analyse the situation
from a Martian's perspective.

532
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,110
What Martian?

533
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,700
Women are from Venus
and men are from Mars.

534
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:36,960
Don't you know?

535
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:38,190
You really know nothing.

536
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:39,920
Oh, come on.

537
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:41,390
Listen to me.

538
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,540
You were good the day before.

539
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,510
How did things suddenly change
the next day?

540
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,650
I got it.

541
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,160
I…

542
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,590
Let me change my way of thinking.

543
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:52,100
I thought in a wrong way just now.

544
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:53,080
I really got it this time.

545
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:55,330
Last night, did Mr. Zhang say
he'd be working late?

546
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:56,010
Yes.

547
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,500
So he came home late

548
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:59,120
and seemed exhausted?

549
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:00,750
Yeah.

550
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:02,220
That's it.

551
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:04,280
Men will feel down

552
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:05,900
or something like that

553
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:07,400
when they are tired from work.

554
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,900
So I guess Mr. Zhang is just

555
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:10,840
too tired from work recently.

556
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:15,300
Little Lin,

557
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:17,400
it's the first time
you're giving sound opinion.

558
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:18,770
You deserve a praise.

559
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:22,910
What's this?

560
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:24,290
Hey, don't.

561
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,790
Wedding pictures.

562
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:30,090
Wow, they're so great.

563
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:31,190
I think Mr. Zhang

564
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:34,680
is just not that into me.

565
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:41,180
Open your eyes.

566
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:42,900
Look at the way he looks at you.

567
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:44,080
Look.

568
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:45,080
What is it if not love?

569
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:46,160
What else can it be?

570
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,270
Is it love?

571
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,810
Be his sweetheart and cheer him up.

572
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:01,560
Make him forget his worries.

573
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,360
How do I do that?

574
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,180
You can be considerate towards him,

575
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,290
take care of him

576
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:09,790
or just show up in front of him suddenly

577
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:11,160
and give him a surprise.

578
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,230
A surprise?

579
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,380
Is that OK?

580
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:15,360
Of course.

581
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:16,540
Why don't you trust me?

582
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:18,330
Oh, I have to go to my class.

583
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,500
OK, study hard.

584
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,540
Bye.

585
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,890
There is something wrong.

586
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,790
Mr. Zhang?

587
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:40,590
Thanks, Sir.

588
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:44,380
Miss Shen.

589
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:45,470
Yun Shu.

590
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:46,610
Sorry.

591
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,600
Why are you in a hurry?

592
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:48,590
What are you doing?

593
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,250
Yun Shu.

594
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:00,290
Mr. Zhang.

595
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:08,390
What are you doing?

596
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:12,030
Hello, Professor Wu.

597
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,560
I was looking for you.

598
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,170
The academic affairs office

599
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:16,490
issued a new class table.

600
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:18,640
I want to discuss with you.

601
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,770
Mr. Zhang.

602
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:47,140
Are you angry?

603
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,600
Yun Shu.

604
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,410
This morning I told you

605
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:53,880
not to go to school

606
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,180
and let more people know
about our relationship.

607
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:58,530
This will cause a lot
trouble for the future.

608
00:33:58,670 --> 00:33:59,850
Mr. Zhang,

609
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,510
why don't you want others

610
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,300
to know about us?

611
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:05,530
You look down on me?

612
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:09,699
How can you have this logic?

613
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:12,530
Mr. Zhang,

614
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,560
you're better than me in all aspects.

615
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:17,929
I'm not good enough for you

616
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,239
though I signed a contract with you.

617
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,650
How did you come to this conclusion?

618
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,679
I didn't mean that.

619
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,500
So why are you afraid of the exposure

620
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:30,040
of our relationship?

621
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:30,790
Afraid?

622
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,679
First,

623
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:34,179
I'm not afraid to let others
know of our relationship.

624
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:35,210
Second,

625
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:37,280
I just don't want more people

626
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,850
know our relationship,

627
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,300
because once our deal is over

628
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:42,110
and more people know about us,

629
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,830
it is likely that your future

630
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,840
relationships and
marriage will be affected.

631
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,550
My future?

632
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:48,710
My relationships

633
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,630
and marriage?

634
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:53,370
Yun Shu.

635
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:56,960
This contract may influence your

636
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:58,180
reputation to some extent.

637
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:00,090
I was thoughtless.

638
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:01,730
But don't worry.

639
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,730
I'll draft a supplemental agreement.

640
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:07,710
So if your future boyfriend
and husband misunderstands,

641
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:10,760
I'll explain everything to them.

642
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:14,800
Mr. Zhang.

643
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:17,790
So all along,

644
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,920
you just thought of me
as your Party B, right?

645
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,350
In this contract,

646
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:30,230
we are indeed Party A and Party B.

647
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:37,690
OK, I got it.

648
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:12,930
[Easter Egg Time]

649
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:23,670
Thanks.

650
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,360
Here, here. Come on

651
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:27,350
I'm here.

652
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,290
We're going to have a fancy lunch.

653
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,890
-Those dishes...
-Hey.

654
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:35,180
What's wrong?

655
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:36,540
You two jumped the queue.

656
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:37,800
What?

657
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:39,130
I said you jumped the queue

658
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:41,030
so you should go to the end of the line.

659
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:43,810
Miss, what's the big deal?
Don't make a fuss.

660
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:44,810
Just shut it.

661
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:45,790
Yeah.

662
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,260
Yes, shut it.

663
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:50,240
Mr. Zhang.

664
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:53,480
It's peak lunch hour.

665
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:55,930
They are 12 people queuing up.

666
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,980
If each one takes
two and a half minutes to order,

667
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,700
and you passed 11 people,

668
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:03,260
that means
you saved 27 and a half minutes.

669
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:06,340
You two occupied
the time of the other 11 students,

670
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,930
five minutes per person.

671
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,780
Do you still think it's not a big deal?

672
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:12,170
Sorry, Mr. Zhang.

673
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:16,730
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

674
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:23,060
I want that one.

675
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:26,820
Come with me.
