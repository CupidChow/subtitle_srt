4
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,140
Are you hurt?

5
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,060
No.

6
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,030
Does it hurt now?

7
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,390
No.

8
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:49,940
Then I am going back.

9
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:50,840
If you need anything,

10
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:51,810
let me know immediately.

11
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,150
One more thing.

12
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,570
No showers from now on.

13
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:00,420
Take care of yourself.

14
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,580
Mr. Zhang.

15
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:05,250
What's the matter?

16
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:09,160
Did you forget something here?

17
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,090
Your slippers here.

18
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,900
Are you here to visit me

19
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,910
or fight a cold war?

20
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,230
Of course to take care of you.

21
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,210
But he

22
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,180
just follows me.

23
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,720
I am not so bored.

24
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:53,300
I am also here for Yun Shu.

25
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:54,250
Really?

26
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,320
But why didn't you come by

27
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:56,110
when Yun Shu was in the hospital?

28
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:56,680
I told you

29
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:57,950
I was on leave yesterday.

30
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,620
All right. All right.

31
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,960
What's going on with you two?

32
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,830
My date with Gu Xiao was going well.

33
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,350
Then he started stalking me.

34
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,120
No, it's not like that.

35
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,920
I was afraid Gu Xiao might
have an ulterior motive

36
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:06,760
and take advantage of Gao Zhi Yi.

37
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:07,680
So, I came here.

38
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:08,870
Me? Taken advantage of?

39
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,610
I think you're the one taking
advantage of me.

40
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,450
Gao Zhi Yi.

41
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,410
All I did was ruin your wish

42
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,340
of sleeping with him.

43
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,510
Sleeping with him?

44
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:15,670
Yi Yi.

45
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,240
You're a girl, after all.

46
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:19,180
You ought to be chaste.

47
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,329
Lin Nuo.

48
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:22,860
You, buzz off.

49
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:23,900
I'll get out.

50
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,380
Well, Yi Yi.

51
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:27,920
Just go back.

52
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,170
Why?

53
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,040
I have much work to do.

54
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,150
Or I can't finish.

55
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,490
Wow, you'll work with injuries!

56
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,770
When did you become so working-hard?

57
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,090
Mr. Zhang

58
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,390
recommended me.

59
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,380
I need to be serious about it,

60
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:40,900
so that I won't disgrace him.

61
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:42,740
Alright.

62
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,280
The power of love is great.

63
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:45,560
It can transform a person.

64
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,030
Alright.

65
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,740
Lin Nuo, you can also
accompany Yi Yi to the outside.

66
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,800
No, thanks.

67
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:50,920
Bye.

68
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:51,900
Look!

69
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,870
Go!

70
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,620
What?

71
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:17,540
Why don't you go first?

72
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:19,370
Why don't I give you a ride?

73
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,550
No, thanks.

74
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,430
I have nothing to say to you.

75
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:23,590
Yi Yi.

76
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,210
I...

77
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,090
Last time I followed you
on your date with Gu Xiao.

78
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,340
It's my fault.

79
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,290
But I'm really worried about you.

80
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:34,330
Lin Nuo,

81
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:36,260
I know you did it for my sake.

82
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:37,940
But do you know?

83
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,320
I feel burdened

84
00:05:39,409 --> 00:05:40,490
when you're too nice to me.

85
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,250
But I just want you to live a good life.

86
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,130
Because I know you too well.

87
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,210
When you fall in love with someone,

88
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:46,650
you will

89
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,360
do so much for him.

90
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:49,330
I know you've treated me well.

91
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:51,880
But Gu Xiao is really good to me.

92
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,370
Do you remember?

93
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,940
Three years ago,

94
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,780
I said I wanted to go to Jay's concert.

95
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,090
But you said,

96
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,720
what's so interesting about that?

97
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,140
It's total chaos.

98
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,790
Noisy, crowded and stuffy.

99
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,220
It's good to be home watching TV.

100
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,410
But two days earlier,

101
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,110
I casually mentioned it to Gu Xiao.

102
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,490
For my sake,

103
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:16,260
he went to stand in line
overnight and got a VIP ticket.

104
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,350
Lin Nuo.

105
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,030
You don't know Gu Xiao.

106
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,240
You shouldn't judge

107
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,450
our relationship.

108
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,310
Sorry, Yi Yi.

109
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,770
I won't dwell on it anymore.

110
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:28,570
Lin Nuo.

111
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,770
Are you...

112
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:33,580
No.

113
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:34,790
No... No...

114
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:37,210
I just want you to be
happy for no purpose.

115
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,750
Just like I also hope

116
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,280
Yun Shu would be happy as well.

117
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:48,409
Thanks.

118
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:28,840
Are you all right?

119
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,400
It's alright.

120
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,020
I told you not to move.

121
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,790
I forgot to take a file.

122
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,970
Where's the file?

123
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,500
This?

124
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:44,820
Yep.

125
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:45,780
Thanks.

126
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,220
What are you looking at?

127
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,010
Lawyer Meng has agreed
to take Gao Mei's case.

128
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,430
Now we need to review
the background of the case

129
00:07:58,590 --> 00:07:59,740
and recheck these

130
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,030
documents.

131
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:02,620
Lawyer Meng.

132
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,670
Doesn't he have any other assistant?

133
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,790
Well.

134
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,850
He agreed to handle this case

135
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,360
because of me.

136
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,680
So I can't just relax.

137
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,210
I need to help him.

138
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:21,090
You're putting the cart before the horse.

139
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:22,860
You were injured in the company.

140
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,270
So you should rest at home.

141
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,760
This is for you.

142
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,630
By the way,

143
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:28,470
I have to tell you,

144
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,290
I've already got this full-time job.

145
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,620
Every formal employee in our company

146
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:32,600
will be able to get

147
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:33,970
an accident insurance security.

148
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:35,169
The accident insurance policy.

149
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,169
Do you know

150
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,179
what it means?

151
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,929
That means good company benefits.

152
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,950
Of course not.

153
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,520
That means this kind of accident happens

154
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:44,860
a lot in your company.

155
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,070
Lift the leg.

156
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,800
This is for you.

157
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:12,450
By the way,

158
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,520
speaking of compensation,

159
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,480
I have to tell you,

160
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,230
I've already got this full-time job.

161
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,610
Every formal employee in our company

162
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,590
will be able to get

163
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,850
an accident insurance security.

164
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,000
Mr. Zhang.

165
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,540
What's up?

166
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,500
Lawyer Meng.

167
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,190
I heard that Yun Shu said

168
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,890
you bought her an
accident insurance policy.

169
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,150
Yeah.

170
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:39,830
What's the matter?

171
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,290
Every employee has one.

172
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,410
Or just only for Yun Shu.

173
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:45,540
Every employee!

174
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,500
OK.

175
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,630
Sorry.

176
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:51,860
But because Yun Shu needs it,

177
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,620
I bought it for everyone.

178
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:55,010
Bye bye.

179
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:55,980
Got it.

180
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,220
Liane.

181
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:12,550
To summarize.

182
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,840
Get accident insurance for everyone.

183
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,230
Something happened.

184
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,490
That's why it's so pasting.

185
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:41,290
It's alright.

186
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,090
It's more cooked.

187
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:44,970
Better for digestion.

188
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,380
I'll give you my half.

189
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:03,690
What's the matter?

190
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,890
This one doesn't taste good either?

191
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:06,690
No.

192
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,290
I'm thinking about work.

193
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,120
Eat first.

194
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,460
I'll help you after that.

195
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:28,010
All the files you need are here.

196
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,430
It's all here.

197
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,350
Are there any other clues?

198
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:32,840
No.

199
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:34,110
Lawyer Meng also said.

200
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,540
Gao Mei's chances of winning
a property distribution claim

201
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:37,920
are really low.

202
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,420
There's not enough evidence right now

203
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,550
to prove her husband's
concealment of assets.

204
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:43,140
I got Mr. Meng into trouble.

205
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,810
He's never lost.

206
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:47,430
Now I'm asking him to take the case

207
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,150
and letting him experience failure
for the first time in his life.

I have revised the contract.

I have revised the contract.

213
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:58,460
I'll send it to you.

214
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:04,070
What are you doing?

215
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,560
You even look good in your ID photo.

216
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:08,710
Even my ID photo

217
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,880
is very ugly.

218
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,110
Why did you touch my picture?

219
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,250
I didn't touch it.

220
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,140
Mei asked me to give it to you.

221

By the way,

do you still have your ID?

Can I have two copies, please?

How do you feel?

230
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,760
Did you do all this by yourself?

231
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:38,780
You told me to.

232
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,520
How can I hand it to anyone?

233
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:41,490
Not bad.

234
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:42,950
Keep trying.

235
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,910
"Not bad?"

236

of someone beautiful,

238
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,050
these words are more satisfying
than getting 100 points.

239
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,070
Don't be smooth-talking.

240
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,510
I've been trying so hard.

241
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:59,120
Can you promise me

242
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,350
one little thing?

243
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,530
Go ahead, if it's official.

244
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:03,230
No more personal matters.

245
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:07,140
It's the key moment to experience life.

246
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,020
Come on.

247
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,890
Are you sure you don't
want to see it again?

248
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,380
Your writers have no experience.

249
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,130
It's a waste of time.

250
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,100
Go ahead.

251
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:19,670
OK.

252
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,630
Witness.

253
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,530
I'm asking you a question now.

254
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,900
You said you were home
at the time of the murder.

255
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,170
And you know nothing at all.

256
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:28,070
Right?

257
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,040
Yes.

258
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,890
I was watching TV.

259
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,490
Actually, I didn't hear
anything next door.

260
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,550
Think carefully.

261
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,950
Everything you say right now

262
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,220
has legal implications.

263
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,390
I know.

264
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,820
Everything I said is true.

265
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,260
Then I'll ask you.

266
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,160
What's the program on TV

267
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,820
at that time?

268
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:50,590
A French movie.

269
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,030
-Meet in Paris-

270
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,910
According to the network
company's report on that day.

271
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,370
There's a wiring problem
in your community.

272
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,930
The whole community was offline.

273
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,090
Under such circumstances,

274
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,620
how did you watch TV?

275
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:06,160
I was watching a DVD.

276
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,560
Let me remind you again.

277
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,590
Falsification of evidence is also a crime.

278
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,280
No.

279
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,400
OK.

280
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,770
Then I'll ask you again.

281
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,780
At the time of the crime,

282
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,730
what was the plot of the movie about?

283
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:23,440
Evan was saying goodbye to Judy.

284
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,560
You can stop your show now.

285
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:30,840
At first, you said

286
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:33,150
you didn't know anything because
you were watching TV at home.

287
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:34,910
But when I told you about
the condition of off-line.

288
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,080
You told me you were watching a DVD again.

289
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,320
And when I asked

290
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,160
contents of the film at
the time of the murder.

291
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:41,580
You can speak out

292
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,770
the plot in the movie clearly.

293
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:45,010
But you missed one point.

294
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,860
From the beginning until the end,

295
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:48,670
I didn't say when it happened.

296
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,640
You don't know the time of the murder.

297
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:51,840
How is it possible for you
to say it clearly

298
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:53,200
about the plot in the movie?

299
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:54,380
Because...

300
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,140
Because you were at the crime scene

301
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,190
from the beginning.

302
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,450
"Meeting in Paris"

303
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,700
was shown at the scene of the crime.

304
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:08,110
That's right.

305
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,850
At the moment Evan was
saying goodbye to Judy.

306
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,720
You are amazing.

307
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:18,870
Okay.

308
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,110
I have to work.

309
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,060
Baby, you look so cool when you do that.

310
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,920
Let me down.

311
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:26,630
Ms. Lan.

312
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,830
This is the material that
Mr. Han asked me to give you...

313
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,090
I'll... I'll come back later.

314
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,140
I'll come here later.

315
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,320
Let go.

316
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,620
If you go nuts again,

317
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:37,730
then get out of the job.

318
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:38,800
Honey.

319
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:40,380
Before I get your heart,

320
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,130
I'll never leave my job.

321
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,760
Come on!

322
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:46,710
Look.

323
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,510
On September 15,

324
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,020
Tesla started a new round of price cuts

325
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:52,390
in China.

326
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,730
On October 21, 2019,

327
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,090
he purchased a car with a
full payment of 1.16 million yuan.

328
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,890
But

329
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:01,670
not the reduced price.

330
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,440
And it's a one-time payment for the car.

331
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,630
Could it be that he didn't know about it?

332
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,600
That's impossible.

333
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,020
Tesla's flagship store

334
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,160
has a relevant
description of the practices.

335
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,130
Besides,

336
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:16,000
interest-free instalment
was also available at the time.

337
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,530
Interest-free instalment?

338
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:19,850
Think about it.

339
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,840
According to the records we
looked into his purchases at the time.

340
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,900
The number of annual instalments.

341
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,590
Up to 118 times.

342
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,350
That's equal to

343
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,420
monthly instalments of...

344
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,090
Ten times.

345
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,060
That's right.

346
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:34,070
A man used to paying in instalments,

347
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,330
even when he's buying a rice cooker

348
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,820
worth 200 yuan,

349
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:38,600
then...

350
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:39,840
How could he possibly have paid

351
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,890
for a 100-million-yuan in one go?

352
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:44,050
So I think it's a breakthrough.

353
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,310
You can go talk to her ex-husband.

354
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,940
That according to what you say.

355
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:50,600
His invoice for the

356
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,360
car is probably false?

357
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,060
It's against the law.

358
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:55,260
You could say that.

359
00:16:58,830 --> 00:16:59,970
I'll call right now.

360
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:01,560
I'll tell Mr. Meng the news.

361
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,140
OK.

362
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:18,170
Sister.

363
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:19,369
What are you doing here?

364
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,339
What's wrong with your leg?

365
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:21,520
Where’s Zhang Si Nian?

366
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,740
Why is it you who's getting the door?

367
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,280
Mr. Zhang went out for school.

368
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:27,640
Sister.

369
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:29,150
What do you want to see him about?

370
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,790
Why didn't you tell me that you are hurt?

371
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:31,990
You kept it from me!

372
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,050
Zhang Si Nian didn't tell me either.

373
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,670
It was Gao Zhi Yi who told me that.

374
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,560
Nothing serious.

375
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:37,570
It's alright.

376
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:38,740
Sis.

377
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,700
Have a seat.

378
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:44,790
Sister,

379
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,200
I'm fine.

380
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,470
Don't get angry.

381
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,310
I've told him the day you got married

382
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:51,510
that I can't let you suffer.

383
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,370
I am not suffering.

384
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,490
This really has nothing to do

385
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,690
with Mr. Zhang.

386
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,370
You're his wife.

387
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,220
Now, you are living here.

388
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,740
Why does it have nothing to do with him?

389
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:00,490
Sister.

390
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:01,480
Don't worry.

391
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,040
Mr. Zhang is very good to me.

392
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:04,860
Ever since the day I hurt my leg,

393
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,430
he does the housework and the dishes.

394
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:07,940
And,

395
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,220
the time I took a shower...

396
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:10,960
Shower?

397
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,090
Anyway, Mr. Zhang

398
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,830
is very good to me.

399
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,800
Don't worry.

400
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:19,070
What's the situation between you two
right now?

401
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,660
What?

402
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,320
No more talking!

403
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:25,740
Does Zhang Si Nian like you now?

404
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,800
I think he likes me.

405
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,600
But sometimes I think not.

406
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,680
And do you like him?

407
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:39,570
Sure I do.

408
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:41,060
I made a promise to Dad

409
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:42,970
to protect you.

410
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,090
That's why you're

411
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,340
always a kid in my eyes.

412
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,330
But now I find out...

413
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,550
Actually,

414
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,560
you're quite braver than me sometimes.

415
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,630
Sister.

416
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:01,690
Get out of the way.

417
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:04,400
I wonder why you eat

418
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:06,000
these junk food without any nutrition.

419
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,410
What do you have in the fridge?

420
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:10,010
I'll get you something to eat.

421
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,180
Meat.

422
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,180
Meat?

423
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,740
You'll get fat.

424
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,100
I'm injured.

425
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,210
Mr. Liu.

426
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,380
You've read all the papers.

427
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:26,600
I think you will agree with

428
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:28,290
the property division scheme

429
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,650
we proposed.

430
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:31,440
This is impossible!

431
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,580
I'll see you in court.

432
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,290
If that's your attitude,

433
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,230
that will cause you

434
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,720
to lose your Vankely house.

435
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,530
Don't talk nonsense.

436
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:41,460
I will handle it.

437
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:43,500
For real estate, the properties
at Nanshan Fuli Town,

438
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,520
Overseas Chinese Town,

439
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:47,070
and Vankely should belong to our party.

440
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,120
As for the bank account,
we split 50-50.

441
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:51,240
The child should be
brought up by the two parties.

442
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:52,330
For marital debt.

443
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,070
We will manage 70 percent.

444
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,460
You 30 percent.

445
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,120
That would be impossible.

446
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:58,350
For real estate, the house
at Vankely will go to you.

447
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,090
Marital debt borne by you.

448
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,040
All the cash in the bank
account belongs to our party.

449
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,250
As for the child,

450
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:04,700
the mother should get custody.

451
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:05,790
Lawyer Meng.

452
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,740
That is not the right
attitude to negotiate.

453
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,750
Let me tell you what
the right attitude is.

454
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,500
Assets transfer within marriage.

455
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,390
Fabrication of false evidence.

456
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,040
Purchase of fake VAT invoices.

457
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:15,950
You are a lawyer.

458
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,500
If I submit these pieces of evidence
to the judge,

459
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:20,180
what would he think?

460
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:25,480
Lawyer Meng.

461
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:27,000
Then I'll go on with work.

462
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,060
OK.

463
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,740
Lawyer Meng.

464
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,840
Thank you so much.

465
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,910
I cannot take the credit, Miss Mei.

466
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,720
That's Yun Shu

467
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,640
who helped a lot.

468
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:41,700
She found the evidence
of asset concealment.

469
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:42,690
So.

470
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,740
You should thank her, really.

471
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,150
Certainly.

472
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:55,410
It is a kind of self-respect to
experience the torment of love.

473
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:04,550
Hello.

474
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:05,650
Really?

475
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,780
Congratulations, Miss Mei.

476
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:13,250
Welcome.

477
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,310
My pleasure.

478
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:17,740
Then, see you next time.

479
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,620
Hello, Yun Shu.

480
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,060
Hello, Lawyer Meng.

481
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,070
Tell you a piece of good news.

482
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,150
The case of Gao Mei was settled.

483
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:33,770
I know.

484
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,540
She told me just now.

485
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,640
Lawyer Meng.

486
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,970
You are awesome!

487
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,790
You deserve the most credit.

488
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:41,970
How do you feel?

489
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,900
It's the first to win a lawsuit.

490
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:45,040
Feel good?

491
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,520
A little proud

492
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:49,780
and pleased.

493
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:51,840
So

494
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,080
maybe we can celebrate it.

495
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:55,940
Celebrate?

496
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,150
Today?

497
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,580
When our company wins a case,

498
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:01,970
we will celebrate it

499
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,440
to enhance the team work.

500
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,070
Will you come?

501
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,040
Well, I will.

502
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:07,260
Then I will send you the
address and time later.

503
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:09,110
See you later.

504
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,080
Bye.

505
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:15,070
Everybody.

506
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,180
One thing here.

507
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:18,510
The case of Gao Mei has
been settled successfully.

508
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:19,490
OK.

509
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:22,400
And today is the weekend.

510
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:23,690
So, after work,

511
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:24,920
let's have a gathering

512
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,270
and celebrate.

513
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,480
Thank you, Mr. Meng.

514
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,050
But it's the first time to
have a Celebration Party

515
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,690
for winning a lawsuit!

516
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,540
It is OK to dine together.

517
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:36,740
Who cares?

518
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:42,470
Mr. Zhang.

519
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:44,070
I just think

520
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:47,970
it's not good for you to
accompany me there.

521
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,280
Is there any problem?

522
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:56,770
Er, if you go with me

523
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:59,440
how do I introduce you to others

524
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,860
about our relationship.

525
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,630
Cousin.

526
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,050
Yeah.

527
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:10,870
He is my cousin.

528
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,610
Because I got injured recently

529
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,230
and can't get around easily,

530
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,910
I asked my cousin to join me.

531
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:22,010
I am Yun Shu's cousin.

532
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:24,190
Liane,

533
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,460
take care of her cousin.

534
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,400
Sit down, please, cousin.

535
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:27,370
I will get this done.

536
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:34,660
Yun Shu.

537
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:37,900
You just have such a handsome cousin.

538
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,010
Is he single?

539
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:42,560
We're also

540
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:44,430
curious.

541
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,400
Tell us.

542
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,220
I'm married.

543
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,310
Everybody is here.

544
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,160
Let's order.

545
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,120
Alright.

546
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:57,110
Yun Shu.

547
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,080
What do you want to eat?

548
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,790
Shall I order a bird's nest for you?

549
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:00,550
High in protein.

550
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:02,070
Good for wound healing.

551
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,600
Never mind, Lawyer Meng.

552
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,830
It's too generous of you.

553
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:09,760
Never mind.

554
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:11,400
You bring good luck to the company.

555
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:13,930
Lawyer Meng.

556
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:16,110
Yun Shu got injured

557
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,140
as soon as she joined your company.

558
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:19,170
How can she be the
lucky star of your company?

559
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,240
Yun Shu was the biggest contributor

560
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:23,550
in this case.

561
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,080
Of course she's our lucky star.

562
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:25,960
Right, everyone?

563
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:26,540
We're also.

564
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:27,600
Yes, yes, yes.

565
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:28,450
Come on.

566
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,210
Yes.

567
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:29,930
Come here.

568
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:30,820
Let us drink for the lucky star.

569
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,990
Come on, cheers!

570
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:34,990
Come here.

571
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:35,950
Yun Shu.

572
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,360
She cannot drink.

573
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,220
She has not recovered yet.

574
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:49,080
She can just drink water.

575
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:52,810
Yun Shu.

576
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:53,900
You drink water.

577
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,130
We drink wine.

578
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,430
Come here.

579
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,630
Let us drink for the lucky star.

580
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:57,950
Come here.

581
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,030
Cheers!

582
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,550
Let us play a game together.

583
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:10,550
Okay, okay.

584
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,460
Alright.

585
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:13,240
Let me show you the game rules.

586
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:15,540
First, we should write
down a subject or behaviour

587
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:16,950
on a paper slip.

588
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:18,350
And then, we have a random draw

589
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:19,900
before placing the slip on the forehead.

590
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,160
But one cannot

591
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:22,970
peek at the content of the slip.

592
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:25,280
And then we can propose
questions toward each other.

593
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,020
Chatting.

594
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,200
And if anybody talks
of the content on the slip

595
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:29,080
by accident,

596
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,400
that person should be
deemed losing the game.

597
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,440
Are you ready?

598
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:31,890
Get it ready.

599
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:33,240
Let us begin.

600
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,920
Who will take the lead?

601
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:36,300
I'll go first.

602
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:37,780
Lawyer Meng,

603
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,080
what do you think of Yun Shu?

604
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:40,540
[Meng Ran]
what do you think of Yun Shu?

605
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,450
[Meng Ran]

606
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:43,980
I think she's great.

607
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:44,770
Yun Shu.

608
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,330
If you could choose Lawyer Meng as your boyfriend,

609
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:47,500
[Yun Shu]
If you could choose Lawyer Meng as your boyfriend,

610
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:47,580
[Yun Shu]

611
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:47,650
[Yun Shu]
would you?

612
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:48,590
would you?

613
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:49,950
Quit kidding.

614
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,530
There's someone beside you.

615
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,850
Liane, you lose.

616
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:00,160
Out.

617
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:00,660
Out.

618
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:01,550
You're making fun of us?

619
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,520
You.

620
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,470
Out.

621
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,010
What a fool.

622
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:06,560
You three, with this level of IQ only,

623
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:08,460
I will re-consider the year-end
allowance and dividends.

624
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:09,140
No.

625
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:10,690
Cousin is playing a dirty trick.

626
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:11,540
Yes he is.

627
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:12,900
The cousin beat the three of us

628
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:14,840
by himself with just one word.

629
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:15,380
Yun Shu,

630
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:17,610
what's Lawyer Meng's full name?

631
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,820
Meng Ran.

632
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,120
Yes.

633
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:29,720
It is my turn now.

634
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:31,660
Cousin,

635
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:33,620
can I stay at your house tonight?

636
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,050
You wish.

637
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,010
Will you accept keeping a pet?

638
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:41,110
What is the score?

639
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,130
I just ask one question.

640
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,610
Among your many assistants,

641
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:48,200
who is the best one?

642
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:49,550
Of course

643
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,320
Yun Shu.

644
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,130
Good job!

645
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,320
The game can end now.

646
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,360
Come here.

647
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:01,840
Everybody, bottoms up.

648
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:02,750
Cheers!

649
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,580
Cheers!

650
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,570
Come on, cheers, cheers.

651
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:07,130
Come here.

652
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,130
Yun Shu.

653
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:10,270
Yun Shu.

654
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,100
Go home.

655
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,310
Nobody can be the leading role forever.

656
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:37,710
Ugly ducklings will become
white swans, one day.

657
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:39,990
See.

658
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:42,510
Yun Shu becomes more
and more like the Heroine.

659
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,810
You shouldn't leave her alone.

660
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:51,020
Your colleagues have got loaded.

661
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,190
Zhang Si Nian.

662
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:55,220
Let us compete fairly.

663
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:57,240
What do you want to compete on?

664
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,730
From our schooling,

665
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,430
you've been the first
and I've been the second.

666
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:01,750
And I accepted my second place readily.

667
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:03,510
I did not want to
compete with you.

668
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:04,660
But this time,

669
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,150
I want to go into a
competition against you.

670
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,660
Yun Shu is not an object.

671
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:13,640
She shouldn't be the trophy

672
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,340
of our competition.

673
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,720
I want to compete against you

674
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,530
not because I want to beat you

675
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,790
but because I really like Yun Shu.

676
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,200
What do you like about her?

677
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:24,700
Before meeting Yun Shu, I often thought,

678
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,390
what kind of woman

679
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:29,520
could make the proud Mr. Zhang

680
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:32,030
do something as crazy as getting into a
contractual relationship?

681
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:32,910
Then I discovered

682
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:34,390
the lovely character of Yun Shu.

683
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,210
She is clumsy but hardworking,

684
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:37,770
kind and optimistic.

685
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,130
The words of Lawyer Meng

686
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,190
must be said to a
number of girls, I think.

687
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,570
Yes.

688
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:46,590
Although those characteristics
are common and general

689
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:48,600
they stand out

690
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,610
in Yun Shu.

691
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,570
Especially when she got injured,

692
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,650
I'm even more certain

693
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:56,400
why you chose her.

694
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,760
Tell me about it!

695
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,010
Because she is addictive.

696
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,040
She is worthy of our love.

697
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,090
She will make us find
it too hard to leave her.

698
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:04,730
I hope

699
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,380
you can pay attention to your wording.

700
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:09,280
Yun Shu is my legitimate wife.

701
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,900
To be exact,

702
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:13,950
she is your legitimate contractual wife.

703
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,320
Zhang Si Nian,

704
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,580
from today onwards,

705
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,760
I will seriously pursue Yun Shu.

706
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,660
Mr. Zhang.

707
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,850
What are you two doing here?

708
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,970
Go on.

709
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,300
I have to go.

710
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:54,480
Thanks.

711
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,130
Mr. Zhang,

712
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,110
do you feel that you and him in the Comic...

713
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,090
I'm not like him.

714
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,010
I mean,

715
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:05,730
don't you think

716
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:08,170
his friends are all very cute and lovely?

717
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,650
-He does not have any friends-

718
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,180
Then you are perfectly different from him.

719
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:13,120
You have so many awesome friends.

720
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,040
Lu Yu and Meng Ran.

721
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:16,010
Stop.

722
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:17,470
Meng Ran is not my friend.

723
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,490
He is just my classmate.

724
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,170
But he said he and you

725
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:22,290
are close friends.

726
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:25,450
That is just his foolish sentiment.

727
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,680
You said Lawyer Meng
is foolishly sentimental.

728
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:33,140
Does he have special feelings toward you?

729
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:34,210
Do not think so.

730
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:36,190
Mr. Zhang.

731
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,260
Are you OK?

732
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,300
No.

733
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:43,910
According to my theoretical analysis,

734
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,020
when a man,

735
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:49,070
a perfect man,

736
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,780
a steady perfect man,

737
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,810
could have become flawed,

738
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,560
that means...

739
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:57,010
What?

740
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:59,200
If anything abnormal goes on,
there must be a reason.

741
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,640
Yi Yi.

742
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:02,770
I didn't ask you out

743
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:04,430
so you could tell me things
that I already know.

744
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:05,700
I mean,

745
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:06,810
Yun Shu.

746
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,970
He likes you.

747
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:20,840
No, I think that is impossible.

748
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,310
Hey, do not spread this kind of news.

749
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,790
Unfounded words, OK?

750
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:25,450
You must believe me in my judgment.

751
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:27,350
The day after tomorrow
is your birthday, right?

752
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,520
If he really likes you,

753
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,170
he will show something.

754
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,220
Wait and see.

755
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:46,930
So you're going to celebrate
Yun Shu's birthday?

756
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:47,760
That's right.

757
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:49,360
You never celebrated your own birthdays.

758
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:50,770
And now you will
celebrate a girl's birthday.

759
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:53,880
I won't.

760
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:55,100
But you will.

761
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,250
You are clever.

762
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:58,820
I am good at it, to tell you the truth.

763
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:00,050
I'll say it.

764
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,020
You'll write it.

765
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,750
First, you must find an excuse

766
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,560
to lure Yun Shu out of the office.

767
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,640
And when she's anxious to get back,

768
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,760
you keep up the act

769
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,450
and let her anxiety mount

770
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,970
until she's at her breaking point.

771
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,460
At this time, you can take
out your birthday present to her.

772
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:23,610
Then, she will forget
all the previous anxiety

773
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,150
and accept your love in a
great joy.

774
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:27,960
Got it?

775
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:29,620
Breakdown!

776
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:30,290
Deception!

777
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:30,760
Fear!

778
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:31,760
Anxiety!

779
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:33,630
This doesn't sound like

780
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,200
a happy birthday party.

781
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,160
What?

782
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,090
No.

783
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:38,050
Just surprising.

784
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:39,110
Forget it.

785
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:40,880
Then, you will not

786
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:42,110
understand my next-level ruse.

787
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,210
That is too hard for you.

788
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:44,030
Forget it.

789
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,810
I have overestimated you.

790
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,530
Your surprise, in fact, is too shallow.

791
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:53,040
Shallow?

792
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,510
Then you can give me a better one.

793
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,390
Here is my plan.

794
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:04,460
At 3:00 p.m.,

795
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,140
take her to the University of Melbourne

796
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,710
to attend the special
lecture of Professor Stephen.

797
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,770
It is rich in content and unique in ideas.

798
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:12,180
It can improve Yun Shu's way of thinking.

799
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,080
After the lecture,

800
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,220
go with her to have supper at 6:00 p.m.

801
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:18,680
The supper time should not exceed 30 min.

802
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,610
After supper,

803
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,020
we can have a rest at home.

804
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:23,450
And from 8 to 10 p.m.,

805
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,830
we shall have a pop quiz about the content

806
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:26,050
of the afternoon's lecture

807
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:27,480
to solidify our learnings.

808
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,810
Then at 10:30,

809
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,250
we shall eat one eighth of the cake

810
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,590
with the energy of not
surpassing two hundred calories.

811
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:35,030
At 10:00 on the dot,

812
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:37,140
the birthday song will be played.

813
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:39,690
After some celebrations,

814
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,880
calm down a bit.

815
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:41,920
And at 11: 00,

816
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:44,270
that will be the best time to go to sleep.

817
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,590
It'll ensure

818
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,180
a wonderful birthday experience

819
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,550
and a healthy body.

820
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,790
It doesn't sound like a birthday party,

821
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,870
more like a punishment.

822
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,500
Your wisdom is not
enough to understand this.

823
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:02,070
On this birthday,

824
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,720
I will make it unforgettable for Yun Shu.

825
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:09,810
Continue.

826
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,480
Pretty sure she will never forget it.

827
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:38,909
Mr. Zhang.

828
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,630
What's your arrangement
the day after tomorrow?

829
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,420
Now at the examination preparation stage,

830
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:50,469
concentrate a bit.

831
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:52,909
The answer can be made
after the test is turned in.

832
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,070
Yun Shu,

833
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:19,940
concentrate.

834
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:48,950
Time's almost up.

835
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:49,920
How are you getting on?

836
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:51,630
Here it is.

837
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,310
Mr. Zhang,

838
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,520
I think in the last question,

839
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:08,490
there is some problem with my formula.

840
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:10,020
Please have a look.

841
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,160
The last question?

842
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,710
There is no problem with the formula.

843
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,730
But there is a simpler solution to it.

844
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:24,000
Is there any other problem?

845
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:27,250
Problem?

846
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:38,400
Yes, there is.

847
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,190
You must pay attention
to the clean and neat sheet.

848
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:44,320
All right.

849
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,770
It's late today.

850
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,460
Go to bed early.

851
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:57,270
Yun Shu.

852
00:36:58,310 --> 00:36:59,710
The day after tomorrow is your birthday.

853
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,400
I will come back early.

854
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:48,160
Mr. Zhang.

855
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:49,870
Mr. Zhang.

856
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,050
You are still here.

857
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,710
I will go after listening to this news.

858
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,490
I will be late, I must go now.

859
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:57,950
Wait, just wait.

860
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:01,820
What's the matter?

861
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:06,260
Get in the car.

862
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:07,360
I will drive you there.

863
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,400
Won't you be late for class?

864
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,620
If you get in the car now,

865
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:14,170
we won't be late.

866
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,800
♫ You're a familiar stranger ♫

867
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:23,240
♫ Who keeps appearing before me ♫

868
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,480
♫ You're clumsy yet kind ♫

869
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:28,000
♫ Ringing the bell in my heart ♫

870
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,840
♫ You predict and plan, but you can't
solve the problem called love ♫
