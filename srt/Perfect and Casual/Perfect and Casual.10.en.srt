Come on.

177
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,120
Come on.

178
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,090
Cheers.

179
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:16,440
She made a mistake.

180
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:17,710
Don't take it personal.

181
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,030
Listen.

182
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,150
She'll get out and make an apology,

183
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,510
begging me to get back.

184
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,450
No way.

185
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,790
Listen, I won't.

186
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,380
Or she'll go too far.

187
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,310
Enough yet?

188
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,420
You go back first.

189
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,270
I'll have some drinks with them.

190
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,760
Bro.

191
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:43,040
Honey

192
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:44,230
I'm sorry.

193
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,180
My bad.

194
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,580
Don't be mad.

195
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:49,260
Don't be mad.

196
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,360
Sister-in-law.

197
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,540
Look... Don't get mad.

198
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,360
Tell you what,

199
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:56,880
I'll let them deliver your take-out

200
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,150
to your doorway.

201
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:58,620
Yes, sister-in-law.

202
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:59,710
Open the door.

203
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,560
Open the door.

204
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:01,960
Come on, forgive him.

205
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:04,090
You...

206
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:05,690
Thanks.

207
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:07,890
Bro, get in.

208
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:21,370
You're beautiful.

209
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,890
You have poor sleep.

210
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,280
I have to introduce a doctor to you.

211
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:40,900
Get out or shut up.

212
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,190
Hello, Senior.

213
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,310
I'm done working.

214
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:24,950
OK, see you later.

215
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,120
Look.

216
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,470
I made it.

217
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:18,190
It's good to drink Lemonade in the morning.

218
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,550
You had a good sleep last night?

219
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:22,310
Looks like my TV series

220
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,940
isn't completely useless.

221
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,660
Time to eat.

222
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:57,460
We can only sleep in on weekends.

223
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,420
Why did you get up so early?

224
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:05,300
It's the weekend.

225
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:11,790
Mei, go ahead.

226
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,940
I have to go.

227
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,590
You're really hilarious, Mr. Zhang.

228
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,740
Show me the thermometer.

229
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,430
Mr. Zhang is here.

230
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:37,870
Mr. Zhang is in a good shape now.

231
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,100
You can talk with him.

232
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,540
Okay, thank you.

233
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,710
It's good to see that the
temperature went down.

234
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,220
Where is Yun Shu?

235
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,820
Did you fight?

236
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,700
Today, Yun Shu...

237
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:55,090
Grandpa.

238
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,350
Grandpa, I'm here.

239
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:03,780
She'll be a bit late.

240
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:08,310
Yes, I was held up by something.

241
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:08,950
However,

242
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,120
nothing is more important

243
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,820
than grandpa.

244
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,350
Yun Shu, you're really honey-lipped.

245
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,350
Look.

246
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,110
The blood pressure goes down immediately.

247
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,520
Grandpa, have a guess.

248
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:23,420
What have I got for you today?

249
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:24,510
What?

250
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,790
Durian.

251
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,350
Grandpa.

252
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,710
Ever since you told me that

253
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:31,670
you want to eat durian,

254
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,260
I bought the freshest one for you.

255
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,270
You're so sweet, Yun Shu.

256
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:38,960
Grandpa,

257
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,120
I'll cut one up for you to try.

258
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:40,610
Okay.

259
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:41,570
Alright.

260
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,990
The durian...

261
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,700
Si Nian, she's a girl.

262
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:47,120
It's hard for her to deal with the durian.

263
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:48,350
Go help her.

264
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,080
Let me do it.

265
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:20,010
Yun Shu.

266
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,869
Thank you for coming
here to visit grandpa.

267
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,359
Don't mention it. It's my duty.

268
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,310
I told you that I'll

269
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,620
follow the contract.

270
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,100
After all, grandpa gave it to you...

271
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,980
Never mind, I got a job.

272
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:43,740
I can support myself.

273
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:45,170
What kind of job?

274
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,950
A sale at a supermarket.

275
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,590
Huimin Supermarket,
not far away from home.

276
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:51,680
A sale at the supermarket?

277
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,020
Sale of beers.

278
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,620
I have a day off on Thursday.

279
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:57,830
Meals and accommodation included.

280
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,300
I have a basic salary
and commission from sales.

281
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:06,060
I think I understand now.

282
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,030
Understand what?

283
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,000
You're doing this to make yourself

284
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,500
more independent, aren't you?

285
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,860
I respect your choice.

286
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,550
But it's a hard way.

287
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,920
But since you've chosen it,

288
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:23,340
just stick to it. I believe you.

289
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:28,410
Go ahead.

290
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,190
Hello, director.

Hello, hello.

293
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,150
Have a look at the beer promotions.

294
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,670
Buy a dozen and get a dozen free.

295
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,270
Girl, does the beer taste good?

296
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,910
Yes, have a try.

297
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,180
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

298
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,390
What are you doing?

299
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,910
Mr. Zhang, why are you here?

300
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,710
I come to give you the exercises.

301
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:40,890
What's going on?

302
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,510
My sister is here.

303
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,420
I can't let her know
that I'm working here.

304
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,180
Don't look at her.

305
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,550
What to do then?

306
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,110
She's coming here.

307
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:01,340
What are you doing here?

308
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,430
Sis, why are you here?

309
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,940
To shop, of course.

310
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:08,950
Si Nian and I also want to buy something.

311
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,240
Si Nian said he wants to drink beer,

312
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:11,470
so I came here with him.

313
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,840
The beer was made from selected
wheat, imported with original packaging.

314
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,870
It's super rich.

315
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,340
Shall we buy a dozen?

316
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,140
I say, why do you dress so...

317
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,100
Here you are. They are for Yun Shu.

318
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,360
Thanks.

319
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,080
Sis.

00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:50,860
Yun Shu, come with me.

321
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,990
What's going on, sis?

322
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,500
Zhang Si Nian is a nice guy.

323
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:08,230
Your sis...

324
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,310
She's gone. She didn't see the cracks.

325
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:12,110
Mr. Zhang, thank you.

326
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,150
Don't mention it.

327
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:16,390
Because Article 5 in the contract

328
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,150
points out...

329
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,350
Yun Shu, the director is looking for you.

330
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,120
Go.

331
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:21,090
Mr. Zhang,

332
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,230
thank you.

333
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,280
I can take care of myself.

334
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,230
Rest assured.

335
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:24,870
I have to go.

336
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,160
Come on! Come on!

00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,130

[Pocket file]

339
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,700
You begged to give you an opportunity.

340
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,290
And you promised me that you can do well.

341
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,280
So?

342
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:42,300
What did you do?

343
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,990
You offended our customer.

344
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,470
And you just ran away
after stepping on his feet.

345
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,640
Then you left for a while.

346
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:48,380
You didn't sell anything.

347
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:51,510
Sorry, director.

348
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,230
Please let me explain.

349
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,590
It really was an accident.

350
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,590
An accident?

351
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,860
You're my accident.

352
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,420
Listen, Yun Shu.

353
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,630
What do you want?

354
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,950
You're an undergraduate.

355
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,190
You work at our supermarket

356
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,110
for more experience of life?

357
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:05,850
No, director.

358
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:06,470
Listen to me,

359
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,440
I didn't mean that.

360
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:09,790
Go to the finance department
and get your salary settled.

361
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,600
This place

362
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:11,980
isn't big enough for you.

363
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,390
I'll get it done in 6 hours.

364
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,990
Please give me one more chance.

365
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,880
Though she's a casual labourer,

366
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,260
she shall be noticed in advance.

367
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:23,280
Or you'll disobey the
regulations of Labour Law.

368
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:24,420
Who are you?

369
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,700
It's none of your business.

370
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,310
He's my teacher.

371
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:28,500
I'm her husband.

372
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,830
I'm begging you.

373
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,680
Please give me another chance.

374
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:41,240
I must finish the task.

375
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:42,190
The last chance.

376
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:42,900
It's definitely my last chance.

377
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:44,040
OK.

378
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,910
Thanks, sir.

379
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,070
Thanks, sir.

380
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:05,680
I'm here.

381
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:06,510
Okay.

382
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,670
Go, go, go.

383
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:09,680
How about having some midnight snacks?

384
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,920
Not today.

385
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:11,800
I have to go home.

386
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,280
Why not finish our meals first?

387
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:14,970
It's OK. How about tomorrow?

388
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:15,720
Bye.

389
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,200
Bye. See you tomorrow.

390
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,220
I've changed the password.

391
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,180
What are you doing here?

392
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:01,870
I was off from work.

393
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,580
I drop by to check whether
you're still alive or not.

394
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,700
Come on. Are you ill?

395
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:15,740
Is there something wrong
between you and Yun Shu?

396
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:22,310
Yun Shu moved out.

397
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,830
Yun Shu ran away from you?

398
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,630
Watch your words.

399
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,940
She didn't "run away."

400
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,590
She just moved out.

401
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,310
What? Why?

402
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,870
I think we should keep some distance.

403
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,300
It's good for both of us.

404
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:42,530
Come on!

405
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,860
Did you do anything strange to her?

406
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:49,400
I just told her that we
should keep our distance

407
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:50,710
in front of other people.

408
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,800
It may be good for everyone.

409
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:54,380
She offered to move out

410
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,590
without my permission.

411
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,640
Yes.

412
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:01,160
So you get to keep your distance

413
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,340
from her like you wished.

414
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,320
Are you happy now?

415
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,420
How are you feeling now?

416
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:10,820
Not happy.

417
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:12,760
I...

418
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,510
You miss her.

419
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,630
Nian Nian, you're falling in love.

420
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,830
Nonsense.

421
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:32,720
Come on!

422
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:33,550
Yun Shu,

423
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:34,900
I just don't get it.

424
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:37,200
You are almost OK with everything.

425
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:39,190
But you're so stubborn

426
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,540
in the moving-out thing, why?

427
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,230
Because I think I don't want to

428
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,260
make do with my affection.

429
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,430
Mr. Zhang doesn't love me,

430
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:48,150
so I can't stay at his home

431
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,260
and make trouble for him.

432
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,260
If not, I'm also making trouble for myself.

433
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,110
Why are you staring at me?

434
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:58,180
You've changed.

435
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,870
You do seem kind of different.

436
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:02,190
All right,

437
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,630
forget those unhappy things.

438
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,020
I got my bonus.

439
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,870
How about having dinner together?

440
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,430
I have to go to work at the supermarket.

441
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:10,020
Have fun. I have to go.

442
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:10,870
Alright.

443
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,800
Bye.

444
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:12,780
I'll hang out with you when I'm free.

445
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,400
Let's have dinner together.

446
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:16,590
No. I'll wait for Gu Xiao.

447
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,740
Gu Xiao?

448
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:19,990
You've met just once

449
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,320
within one minute.

450
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:22,470
And you have a crush on him.

451
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,680
Do you know him?

452
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:25,320
He may be a fraud,

453
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:26,370
a playboy,

454
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:27,550
or an outlaw.

455
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,840
Shut up.

456
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:30,040
I have made inquiries.

457
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:32,570
Gu Xiao is a perfect man.

458
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,480
Perfect?

459
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:34,240
How?

460
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:35,640
After he graduated from our college,

461
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:36,780
he furthered his studies abroad.

462
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:39,310
He founded his own technology
company last year at home.

463
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,470
He's low-profile and gentle

464
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,930
with great ambition and lofty goals.

465
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,180
I don't buy the hearsay.

466
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:47,640
Seeing is believing.

467
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,260
Yi Yi.

468
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:57,360
Seeing is better than hearing.

469
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:11,620
Are you missing me?

470
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,800
OK!

471
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,240
OK.

472
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,300
It's of course useful.

473
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:48,260
Yun Shu.

474
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:49,620
We have to rehearse before we go

475
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:51,500
to visit grandpa in the future

476
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:53,230
otherwise grandpa may see the cracks.

477
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,590
Alright?

478
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,960
Got it, Mr. Zhang.

479
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:03,830
I'll tell you what I say to
grandpa through WeChat

480
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,720
in the future.

481
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,190
It's more than that.

482
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,460
If you have any trouble,

483
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,660
feel free to contact me at WeChat.

484
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:26,230
I'm always here.

485
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:29,630
OK.

486
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,080
OK.

487
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:55,500
Hello, Sir.

488
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:57,290
Do you want to get to know our beer?

489
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,040
They are our new arrivals.

490
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:01,240
Can you drink beer?

491
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:04,150
Not really.

492
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:05,160
But our beers

493
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:06,330
taste good.

494
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:10,640
Girl who can drink beer
has stories deep inside.

495
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:14,190
But I have no stories.

496
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,120
I'm not asking you
to tell your stories.

497
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,740
I'll pour you a sample. Have a try.

498
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,670
They are fresh

499
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,780
and they taste good.

500
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,810
The aroma of wheat makes me feel warm.

501
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,240
If you feel warm,

502
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,910
how about taking some
bottles of beer home?

503
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,470
I should drink warm beer

504
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:37,990
with a warm girl like you.

505
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,620
That's the drinking culture.

506
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:43,600
But I'm ill-educated.

507
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,220
Listen.

508
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,280
The drinking culture of China

509
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:54,110
originated from the Yangshao Culture
6,000 years ago.

510
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:55,070
Do you know that?

511
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:56,270
Yangshao...

512
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,750
The Law on the Protection of Women's
Rights and Interests

513
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,120
was revised in 2005.

514
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:01,440
It is clearly presented the
concept of sexual harassment.

515
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:01,990
Who are you?

516
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,050
Are you insane?

517
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,460
It's doesn't matter who I am.

518
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:06,070
The point is I know

519
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,410
according to Article 42, Paragraph 5

520
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,470
of the Law of PRC

521
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,110
on Public Security Administration...

522
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,380
Are you insane?

523
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:16,410
Yes. So watch out.

524
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,540
Thank you.

525
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,930
You can call the police

526
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:23,040
or ask for help

527
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,430
if you bump into this kind of situation.

528
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,010
I got it. Thank you very much.

529
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:28,180
Don't thank me.

530
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:30,610
Are you going to just take it
next time you run into such a situation?

531
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,560
I know people like him.

532
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,080
Most of the time, they
just want to harass you.

533
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:38,060
But if you ignore them, they'll walk away.

534
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:39,770
If you confront them head-on,

535
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:41,900
it'll affect your work.

536
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:43,580
After all,

537
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:45,770
those cans of beer should be to blame.

538
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:49,860
Sir,

539
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,970
thank you very much.

540
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:52,710
I'm going to

541
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,180
work for the beer.

542
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:57,100
How about you looking around?

543
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:12,600
Director.

544
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:13,360
You're looking for me?

545
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:14,900
Yes, Yun Shu.

546
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:17,060
One customer ordered 20 boxes of beer.

547
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,240
Go with the delivery man later.

548
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:20,220
This is the address.

549
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:22,920
I...

550
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:24,510
The customer assigned you

551
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,530
to deliver these 20 boxes.

552
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:26,520
Just get out there

553
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,500
and you should meet your quota
for this month.

554
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,830
I think I've been to this place.

555
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:31,670
Really?

556
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,790
That's even better.

557
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:36,480
I'll let Wang of the logistics department

558
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:37,130
go with you.

559
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,220
Don't worry.

560
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:40,080
Thank you, director.

561
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,470
Yun Shu.

562
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,310
You made great progress recently.

563
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,410
Keep working hard.

564
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:46,790
Then I'm off now.

565
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,760
Okay.

566
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,640
Hello.

567
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,280
Hello, may I help you?

568
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:01,080
Hello, I'm from Huimin Supermarket.

569
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:01,680
I'm here to deliver...

570
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:02,740
Beer.

571
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:03,210
Yes.

572
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,600
Hold on. Let me make a phone call.

573
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,560
Okay.

574
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:08,510
Mr. Meng. The one you
made appointments with is here.

575
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,680
OK.

576
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,290
In the office at the corner.

577
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:14,620
Get in directly.

578
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,530
My beer is downstairs.

579
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,050
I'm here to deliver...

580
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:17,750
Never mind

581
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,040
I'll do it myself.

582
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,350
Just go in.

583
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,320
Okay.

584
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:39,190
Are you here for the interview?

585
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,480
I'm from Huimin Supermarket
to deliver beer for you.

586
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:43,510
Beer delivery?

587
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:46,000
Would you like to have a shot
at an interview with us?

588
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,220
Mr. Meng.

589
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:49,760
Mr. Meng.

590
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:52,180
You're the guy in the supermarket.

591
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:53,890
You're the company's...

592
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:55,930
Yes, want to have a try?

593
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:07,610
Hello, Yun Shu.

594
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,429
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

595
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,830
Are you busy now?

596
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,420
Say it.

597
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:14,570
I have good news.

598
00:34:14,739 --> 00:34:16,380
I got a new job

599
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:18,000
as an assistant at a law office.

600
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:19,969
I just passed the
interview this afternoon.

601
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:21,070
Congratulations!

602
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:26,650
Actually, I just want to tell you

603
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:28,870
that I'll be visiting grandpa
this afternoon.

604
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:30,909
I was afraid you might not know,

605
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,690
so I thought I'd notify you in advance.

606
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,110
Grandpa will be happy for you.

607
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:37,190
Come on.

608
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,310
Well, goodbye, Mr. Zhang.

609
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,219
OK, bye.

610
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:49,980
You want to help her

611
00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:51,250
but why do you hide it from her?

612
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,900
For Yun Shu,

613
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:55,449
me not helping her is the
greatest help.

614
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,320
I didn't expect that so many
years after graduation,

615
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:58,420
you'd come to see me

616
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:01,390
about your marriage contract.

617
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,620
You really trust me.

618
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:06,640
All the time, I trust your ability.

619
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,430
Yun Shu is so common.

620
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,460
She looks average

621
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,500
and not very smart.

622
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:14,980
Your type is special.

623
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,960
So in the future,

624
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:20,090
I hope you can help her at work.

625
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:23,590
Though we were competing for

626
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,800
the first place at school,

627
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:26,530
I always think we are in the same group.

628
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:27,940
So we can understand each other.

629
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,220
But after I saw Yun Shu,

630
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:31,450
I realized that maybe

631
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:33,590
I never saw through you.

632
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,440
It doesn't matter.

633
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,680
Have you eaten yet?

634
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:41,850
Let me buy you a meal

635
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,310
as a thank-you.

636
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:46,920
OK.

637
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:49,460
I want to eat fried chicken.

638
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:50,980
The dining hall, then.

639
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,210
[Easter Egg Time]

640
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,510
Hello,

641
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,850
want to buy beer?

642
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:42,850
Mr. Zhang,

643
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,810
why are you back?

644
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,180
Why are you taking them?

645
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,420
I want to help you sell beer.

646
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:01,230
Beer and diapers?

647
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:03,610
Why?

648
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,400
Come with me.

649
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:14,180
Walmart, the world's biggest retailer

650
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:16,160
once presented an interesting case.

651
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:17,560
That is, put beer and diapers together

652
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,990
and they are for sale together.

653
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:22,090
And sales volume showed that

654
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:23,580
the sales of beer were better

655
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,770
because it was with diapers.

656
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,310
Later, after their
analysis, they found that

657
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,910
many young dads

658
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,990
would shop at the
supermarket for their wives.

659
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,130
After they bought living goods

660
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,120
and diapers,

661
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,600
they would drop by to buy some beer.

662
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:38,210
Like this.

663
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,430
So according to the
analysis of statistics,

664
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,850
the proper adjustment
of goods distribution

665
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:44,770
can effectively change

666
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,540
the sales volume.

667
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,330
Awesome.

668
