Miss Yun Shu.

00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,180
Do you take Zhang Si Nian

00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,750
as your lawful wedded husband?

7
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:32,480
I do.

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:32,740

11
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:50,240
Marriage contract?

Marriage contract?

13

Marriage contract?

14
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,990
If he doesn't release relationship
with you one year later,

15
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,050
there will be nothing you can do.

16
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,450
So he's not lying but I am?

17
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,130
I'm your sister. Who is he?

I'm your sister. Who is he?

I'm your sister. Who is he?

20
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,730
He is using this house as bait

21
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,780
to make you sign the contract.

You have to tell Zhang Si Nian

25
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:02,070

Hi, you are back.

00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,340
In case you forget the
wedding process and road map,

34
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,090
-I copied it for you...
-Mr. Zhang.

35
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,860
I have something to tell you.

Go ahead.

37
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:36,870
My sister knows

38
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,890
about our contractual relationship.

39
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:42,560
She disagrees to it.

40
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,660
So what are you going to do?

41
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,320
I don't know.

42
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,910
-In the case of breach of contract...
-In the case of a breach of contract,

43
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:54,910
I know

44
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,790
that if I default unilaterally,

45
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,490
I’ll compensate you for the relevant loss.

46
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,660
That's not what I meant.

47
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,760
Yun Shu,

48
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,750
I won't force you to do anything.

49
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,520
If you can't fulfill the contract,

50
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,640
I’m supposed to think about
how to explain to grandpa.

51
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:20,310
Can grandpa still bear
this result?

52
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,900
I need to make another judgment

53
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,420
by considering his illness

54
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,040
and his current physical condition.

55
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,020
Mr. Zhang.

56
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:30,570
I'm sorry.

57
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,170
Have you made up your mind?

58
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,230
Can you let me think this through?

59
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,700
How about this?

60
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,710
Tell me your decision

61
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,260
on the day before the wedding,

62
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,510
and I can explain it to Grandpa.

63
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,170
Until then, think about it carefully.

You're not going to get married?

-You insist on marrying him?
-I…

00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,000
OK! From now on, I’m
not your sister anymore.

78
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,140
-Get out!
-Come on, Sis.

79
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,140
-Get out!
-Sis, let me explain.

80
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,500
-Get out.
-Let me explain.

81
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,340
Get out!

82
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,300
Sis, open the door.

Negotiate?

90
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:32,140
It was Mr. Zhang who helped me

91
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,750
when I was desperate and helpless.

92
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,620
And he solved so many troubles for me.

93
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:38,020
I should give him a hand

94
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,190
when he’s in need of help.

95
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,140
It's repaying his kindness.

96
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,350
If you have to thank him,

97
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,980
there are many other ways.

98
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,470
Why do you have to marry him?

99
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,600
Sis, as you know,

100
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,020
this is a contractual
relationship between us,

101
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,350
not a real marriage.

102
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,360
Moreover,

103
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,500
you also know grandpa's situation.

104
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,500
He can only live for one year.

105
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,720
His greatest wish

106
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,990
is to see us get married.

107
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,390
So if I go back on my word now,

108
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,290
grandpa will definitely be upset.

109
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,970
I also sympathize with
his grandfather's situation.

110
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,890
But both legally and morally,

111
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,740
it’s not the excuse
for you to get married.

112
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:13,600
Sis, why don't we discuss it again?

113
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:16,590
Nothing to discuss. You
should go to his house right now,

114
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,870
pack up and move in with me.

115
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,270
If Zhang Si Nian says no,

116
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:20,480
tell him

117
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,320
I’ll definitely meet him in court.

118
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,020
I'll see to it that he's destroyed.

119
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,870
But if you have to get married,

120
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,030
you can do so.

121
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,000
But from then on, we will
no longer be sisters.

122
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:31,450
We won't see each other again.

about the thing you said.

127
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:20,910
Can we talk about it later?

128
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,870
That's not what I'm trying to say.

129
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,300
Are you hungry?

130
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,180

Hello, grandpa.

Yun Shu.

138
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,550
Please help me out with this.

139
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,710
I have two sets of suits here.

140
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,110
One is navy blue and the other is black.

141
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,350
[Which suit do you think
is better for me?]

142
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,830
Grandpa, you want to choose suits?

143
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,620
I have to dress up to attend

144
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,030
the wedding between you and Si Nian.

145
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,420
I think navy blue.

146
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,550
It can make your complexion
more luminous.

147
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,500
I think a black suit
is a little too heavy.

148
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,420
Navy blue.

149
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:16,030
Okay, I'll do as you say.

150
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,020
Hello, grandpa.

151
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,070
I have an incoming call.

152
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,180
Please wait a moment
and I'll call you later,

153
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,390
alright?

00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,660

named Huo Qi.

171
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,480
He’s my cousin.

172
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,600
I don't really want to call the police.

173
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,540
It’s mainly because I don't want
to escalate it into criminal case.

174
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,170
There's no need to put him in jail.

175
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,010
Why are you here?

176
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,130
Sorry to bother you.

177
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,390
May I ask if Yun Shu is here?

178
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,800
You don't have to look for her.

179
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:13,800
I'm in charge now

180
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,670
about her breach of
the agreement with you.

181
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,140
Tell me directly if you
have anything to say.

182
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:19,630
Yun Lan, is Yun Shu here or not?

183
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:20,730
No.

184
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,070
What's the matter?

185
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,360
She left my house.

186
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:24,910
And now I can't contact her.

187
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,160
The key is...

188
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,340
She's taken Wuqian away.

189
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:35,720
Sorry to keep you waiting.

190
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:37,170
Where do you want to go today?

191
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,030
I can go anywhere with you.

192
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,850
Excuse me, a moment please.

193
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:45,800
Hello, Yun Lan.

194
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:46,820
Is Yun Shu with you?

195
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:47,800
Yun Shu?

196
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,340
I haven't seen her for two days.

197
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,530
Is something wrong?

198
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,400
[I can't contact Yun Shu.]

199
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,390
She is missing?

200
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,470
Don't worry.

201
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,620
I will look for her.

202
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,910
Lin Nuo.

203
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,180
Yun Shu is missing.

204
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,470
I can't contact her either.

205
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,420
Go to the hospital quickly

206
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,700
and see if she's gone to find
Zhang Si Nian's grandfather.

207
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,240
Hello, Yi Yi.

208
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,780
Yun Shu isn't here in the ward.

209
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,200
She's neither in the hospital

210
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,730
nor at school.

211
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,270
You can't find her either?

212
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,420
Okay, I got it.

213
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,350
You must let me know when you find her.

214
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,950
She is getting bolder and bolder.

215
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,670
Now she dares to run away from home!

216
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,190
She is always causing trouble for me.

217
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:44,840
Always!

218
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,220
No problem can be solved

219
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:47,650
by blaming her right now.

220
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,620
Then who should I blame?

221
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:50,810
You?

222
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:52,380
If you have any doubts or worries,

223
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:54,150
you can confront me.

224
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,900
Don't put her on the spot.

225
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,200
I'm protecting her

226
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:01,170
and pull her out of the
contract signed with you.

227
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,540
Yun Lan, please watch your mouth.

228
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:04,700
What I signed with Yun Shu is

229
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,200
a fair and just contract.

230
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,570
Sorry.

231
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,440
I shouldn't have said so much.

232
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,970
Let's calm down first.

233
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,410
Where would she go?

234
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,110
Let’s go back to my home first

235
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:24,870
to check if there’s any clue

236
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,280
in the things she left behind.

237
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,680
We'll figure out where she could be.

238
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,090
Here is the business
card of a real estate agent.

239
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,470
Did she rent a house outside?

240
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,070
I've already called the number.

241
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,100
She didn't go there.
She has turned it down.

242
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:54,940
She didn't bring anything with her.

243
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,510
Where can she go?

244
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:00,950
What are these?

245
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,030
The offer at the wedding and the plan.

246
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,150
Forget it's a fake marriage.

247
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,310
[Quotation list]
Forget it's a fake marriage.

248
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,000
[Quotation list]

249
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,040
But how could you prepare such
a frugal wedding celebration?
[Quotation list]

250
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,840
But how could you prepare such
a frugal wedding celebration?

251
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:15,720
How can I trust my sister to you?

252
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,030
This place looks so familiar.

253
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,150
How did it become like this?

254
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,080
What did you just say?

255
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,660
This church was the place

256
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,460
where Dad took us to the sea.

257
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,090
See if it's here.

258
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,200
That's right.

259
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:43,660
Where is this place?

260
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:13,010
Yun Lan.

261
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,930
Yun Shu is over there.

262
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,000
Go.

263
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,670
Yun Shu.

264
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,130
Yun Shu!

265
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,260
Sis.

266
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:33,780
Mr. Zhang.

267
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,620
You two didn't think I'm going
to escape marriage, did you?

268
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,220
Weren't you going to?

269
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:44,910
No, I was not.

270
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,480
I was going to call you.

271
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,290
As a result, I forgot to charge the phone

272
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:50,460
and it shut down.

273
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,730
Actually, I'm here

274
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:56,460
to solely think about something by myself.

275
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,950
There's nothing to think
about. Come home with me.

276
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,120
But, Sis...

277
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:02,330
Yun Shu.

278
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:05,320
I'll cancel the wedding.

279
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,050
I know.

280
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,650
You don't want to tear
up the contract with me

281
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,510
because you're worried about Grandpa.

282
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,030
And you've been

283
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,290
thinking for me.

284
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,350
Even when it came to
the wedding itinerary,

285
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,780
you were being considerate of me.

286
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,590
But I never took your
feelings into account.

287
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,310
I was too selfish.

288
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:30,130
You don't have to
worry about the contract.

289
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,800
Your sister and I will deal with
the termination of the contract.

290
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,160
Don’t worry.

291
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,350
Then grandpa, he…

292
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,830
You don't have to worry
about Grandpa, either.

293
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:39,060
I'll explain it to him
first thing tomorrow.

294
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,620
In his present physical condition,

295
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:42,950
and bearing capacity,

296
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,760
it’ll be easy for him to handle it.

297
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,350
Are you going to let go?

298
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,090
I won't force Yun Shu

299
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,030
to do anything she doesn't want to do.

300
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,570
From the beginning,

301
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,870
Yun Shu has the right to choose.

302
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:59,880
I'll wait for you in the front.

303
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,650
I'll drive you back later.

304
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,089
I take back my evaluation of

305
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,560
Zhang Si Nian last night.

306
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:20,790
He's not as bad as I thought.

307
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,670
Sis, have you changed your mind?

308
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,730
I didn't say I agreed
to your relationship.

309
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:28,990
That's a different matter.

310
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,050
What's the matter?

311
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,900
Can't bear to leave him?

312
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:39,840
No, of course not.

313
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,150
Yun Shu,

314
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,220
you need to know that

315
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,340
everything I've done is to

316
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,920
protect you.

317
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,670
Sis, do you remember when we were small

318
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,880
we came the beach with Dad?

319
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:53,600
It's over there.

320
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:56,290
You said you'd protect
me for the rest of my life.

321
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,620
I don't want to get married.

322
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:59,420
Why?

323
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,660
I want to protect Yun Shu all my life

324
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,910
from being bullied.

325
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:13,050
It happened many years
ago. I don’t remember.

326
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,720
You really said that.

327
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,400
All right, let's go back.

328
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,220
Let me drive you home.

329
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,190
No, thanks.

330
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,510
We can go back by ourselves.

331
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,120
All right.

332
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,570
Then I'll deliver all of Yun Shu's stuff

333
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,140
to your house tomorrow.

334
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,110
Thank you.

335
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,770
Mr. Zhang...

336
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:43,350
It's fine.

337
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:45,050
Goodbye.

338
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:46,490
Let's go.

339
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,150
Sis, what

340
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,470
exactly is marriage?

341
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,250
In marriage,

342
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,630
first of all, this man
can't give you trouble.

343
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,060
Secondly,

344
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,970
he has to make you admire him.

345
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,320
At least you have to
learn something from him.

346
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,300
Then,

347
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:38,980
he’s at least financially
qualified to support you.

348
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:46,140
When I was with Mr. Zhang,

349
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:48,220
I've been giving him trouble all along.

350
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,830
Every time I did something wrong,

351
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,630
he dealt with it for me.

352
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,820
He has a lot of qualities which are

353
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,620
worth learning.

354
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:59,630
His income can also be
an economic security for me.

355
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:02,100
So if feelings

356
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,410
don’t take the priority,

357
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,860
then why can't he be my husband?

358
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,700
So you learned this from him?

359
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,510
And set a trap for me?

360
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,670
No.

361
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,070
Although I still

362
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,000
don't know much about marriage,

363
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,030
I think

364
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:20,880
marriage should be

365
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,480
a multiple-choice question,

366
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,380
not a true or false question.

367
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,560
You've fallen for him, haven't you?

368
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:27,840
No!

369
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:29,330
I didn't fall in love with him.

370
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,850
That still doesn't make sense.

371
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,990
If we really can get the money back,

372
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,290
we'll pay for it.

373
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,210
You can't make this decision

374
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,450
because of a house.

375
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,390
If none of the above reasons hold water,

376
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,820
what on earth is the reason?

377
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:43,060
Actually,

378
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,400
I don't know why.

379
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,630
But I just think

380
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:49,170
you’ve made many choices for me

381
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,260
since I was a child.

382
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,820
I want to give my own answer

383
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,500
to this question.

384
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:57,420
Please let me go back to him.

385
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,980
I've said everything,

386
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,570
which I should and shouldn’t say.

387
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:05,890
If you still insist on going back,

388
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:08,330
I don't really have to tie you here.

389
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,320
So, the wedding...

390
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:15,490
I won't attend.

391
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:18,770
Whether as your sister or your lawyer,

392
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,940
I do not agree with this agreement.

393
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,520
Just go to bed.

394
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:39,900
[Sis.]

395
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,540
[I'm sorry.]

396
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,870
[I want to go on my own to the end]

397
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,250
[whether I’ll regret it or not.]

398
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:16,390
Academician Zhang.

399
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,140
Professor Zhang is here.

400
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,800
I'm watching the TV series
played by Lu Yu.

401
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:23,130
I forget its name.

402
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:24,830
Oh! It’s Royal Marriage.

403
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:26,130
It's funny.

404
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,840
Grandpa,

405
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:43,780
it's time to take the medicine.

406
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,160
I've taken some. Don't worry.

407
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,750
Professor Zhang, I’m ordering you

408
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,950
that tomorrow's wedding
between you and Yun Shu

409
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,990
must be more lively than those on TV.

410
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:54,960
Do you hear me?

411
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,230
Grandpa,

412
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:04,750
there is one thing

413
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,310
I have to explain to you.

414
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,280
What is it?

415
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:08,940
It's about the wedding tomorrow.

416
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,430
What is it? What's happened?

417
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:17,500
Tomorrow's wedding may not...

418
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:18,830
Grandpa.

419
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,490
Yun Shu, come here.

420
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,530
Sit down.

421
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:31,350
Si Nian was saying there might be
a change in tomorrow's wedding?

422
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:32,790
Grandpa,

423
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,650
there's no change

424
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,950
in the wedding tomorrow.

425
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,600
It will be held as scheduled.

426
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,580
You almost scared me to death.

427
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:42,170
I thought something was wrong.

428
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,040
Come on.

429
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:46,890
Watch Royal Marriage with me.

430
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,370
-Okay.
-Come on.

431
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:08,020
Mr. Zhang.

432
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:11,100
This isn’t the way to the wedding venue.

433
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:14,200
We’re on the right way and
you'll find out in a moment.

434
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,820
Did you change the wedding venue?

435
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,960
I know this is what you have always wanted

436
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:22,160
and I want to help you realize it.

437
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,100
Yun Shu!

438
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,020
Yun Shu.

439
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,150
You are here.

440
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,990
What a dreamlike development!

441
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,420
It's just like a TV series.

442
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,700
Firstly, you ran away from home

443
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,420
and you’re marrying Mr. Zhang again.

444
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:47,820
Such ups and downs of the plot.

445
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:49,230
Why didn't you tell us?

446
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,900
This is a long story.

447
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:52,650
Let me ask you something.

448
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:55,280
Is it an agreement or real this time?

449
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,190
This time, I…

450
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,280
Yun Shu.

451
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,150
All the guests have arrived.

452
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,420
Go and change your clothes.

453
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:14,880
Okay, I'll be there in a bit.

454
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,140
Let me formally introduce you.

455
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:17,690
These two are my best friends.

456
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,480
Yi Yi and Lin Nuo.

457
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,470
Hello.

458
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:21,880
I think we've met.

459
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,760
Brother-in-law, we
finally meet each other.

460
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:31,480
Brother-in-law, take care
of me when I’m in school.

461
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,630
Brother-in-law?

462
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:35,880
Yes, Yun Shu is one
year younger than Yi Yi.

463
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:38,140
You’re our brother-in-law
in the family hierarchy.

464
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,300
If you need to see a doctor in the
future, come to the hospital directly.

465
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,750
You'll be given a 20% discount.

466
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:42,980
Okay.

467
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:46,110
You go down first. I'll be right there.

468
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:47,070
Alright.

469
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:54,340
You're not married yet

470
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:56,650
but you already start to protect him.

471
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,450
Hold on.

472
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,080
The bridesmaid won't come.

473
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,080
Why won't she come?

474
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:09,690
Did you not tell her
the best man is Lu Yu?

475
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,870
If she knew that I was here,

476
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,230
she would be desparate to come.

477
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,120
Can you stop?

478
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,420
Go to the guest room

479
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,080
to check if there’s anything to do.

480
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,060
Go.

481
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,630
How cold-blooded!

482
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:56,810
Mr. Zhang.

483
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:03,610
Is there any problem?

484
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,190
Quite good.

485
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:23,060
If my sister was here,

486
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,310
she could make it better.

487
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:34,330
Sis.

488
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:40,050
I thought you weren't coming.

489
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:44,630
I didn't want to come.

490
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,110
But I promised Dad

491
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,080
to marry you off.

492
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:57,470
Sis.

493
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,530
Don't cry

494
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:00,910
or you have to fix your makeup.

495
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:03,950
Come on.

496
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,630
I have a present for you.

497
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:16,170
Sis, thank you.

498
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:18,880
It looks so pretty.

499
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:27,100
Hold on.

500
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,880
I have something to say to you.

501
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:39,300
Professor Zhang. I'm talking to you

502
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,850
as the lifelong legal representative
of Yun Shu.

503
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,620
If you want to marry my sister,

504
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:45,030
you have to convince me first.

505
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:45,990
Okay.

506
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,130
First of all, about the house,

507
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,380
I admit that it’s not

508
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,400
realistic to find my
cousin in the short term.

509
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,970
So there's a good chance that

510
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,330
I can’t get the money back.

511
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,200
Secondly,

512
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:59,420
this morning, I called
a total of seven friends

513
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:00,870
from the law firm at home and abroad.

514
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:03,580
I asked them to do a comprehensive
background check on you separately.

515
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:06,820
The survey results were not bad.

516
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:08,030
So I agree to

517
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:10,270
your agreement with my
sister for the time being.

518
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,110
But if

519
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:13,910
you dare to make

520
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,570
Yun Shu sad,

521
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,760
upset

522
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:18,290
or unhappy in this one year,

523
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,960
I promise you'll never marry a wife again.

524
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,210
Believe me, I can do it.

525
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:25,260
Yun Lan,

526
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,390
I can vouch for it with my name.

527
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,960
In the next year,

528
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,220
I won't force Yun Shu

529
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:32,390
to do anything she doesn't want to .

530
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,680
I will respect her,
cherish her and protect her

531
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,270
and treat her like family.

532
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:38,970
Although it’s just

533
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,060
a contractual relationship
between the two of us,

534
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:42,810
from today on,

535
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:46,220
Yun Shu is my wife.

536
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,360
So you don’t have to worry about it.

537
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,130
Hi, Yun Lan.

538
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,170
It's been a while!

539
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:05,570
Will you leave after returning this time?

540
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,570
I won’t. I work in a domestic company now

541
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,370
I'm staying here for development.

542

Lu Yu.

543
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,810
This is fate!

544
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,190
You know each other?

545
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,350
Yes. We ran into old
friends at a distant land.

546
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:22,060
We bumped into each other abroad.

547
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:25,880
Hello, grandpa.

548
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:30,700
Lu Yu.

549
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:32,270
It's Lu Yu. Why is he here?

550
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:35,140
Lu Yu and Si Nian grew up together.

551
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:36,220
Really?

552
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,820
-They are childhood friends?
-Yes.

553
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,780
My God!

Let’s forget about
Mr. Zhang’s handsome face.

Lin Nuo.

557
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:47,570
I think there's something
between Lu Yu and Yun Lan.

558
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:48,630
Exactly.

559

561
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,320
I'm not worried. What are you afraid of?

562
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,500
There’re many vacant seats here.

563

Please sit somewhere else. Thank you.

Please stay away from me at once. Now!

565

I don't want to make things awkward.

My name is Lu Yu.

I'm not interested in you.

We don't need to know each other.

You are the bride's sister.

last time when we parted.

I'm puzzled about.

What is it?

00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:11,900
Why do you always seem so
annoyed by me?
