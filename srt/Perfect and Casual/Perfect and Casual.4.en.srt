4
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,169
Get married?

5
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:09,639
That's right. Getting married!

6
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:12,740
Mr. Zhang, are you kidding me?

7
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,140
It was an emergency just now.

8
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,130
I… I didn't hear you clearly at all

9
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,160
about what you told grandpa.

10
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,880
I just wanted to calm grandpa

11
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,270
to say that.

12
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,250
It doesn't make any sense anymore

13
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,740
for you to say that now.

14
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,430
Tell me what you think
about getting married.

15
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,610
What can I think?

16
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:29,710
I think I'm trapped by you.

17
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:30,800
From the very beginning, you made me

18
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:31,970
your fake girlfriend.

19
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:34,060
And then you let me live in your house.

20
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,410
And I'll marry you now.

21
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,380
Mr. Zhang,

22
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,270
did you scheme to do this to me?

23
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,630
How do you jump to this conclusion?

24
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,940
Did statistics tell you that?

25
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,740
It's a pity that you
aren’t a screenwriter.

26
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:48,710
Then what do you think we should do now?

27
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,260
I'll figure it out. Don't worry about it.

28
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,820
Anyway, this

29
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,380
will be very troublesome in future.

30
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,250
I hope you can be prepared mentally.

31
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:59,010
Of course,

32
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,330
I don't expect you

33
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,630
can solve this for me either.

34
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,440
Grandpa.

35
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,620
I'm here to see you.

36
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,690
Yun Shu.

37
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,550
Have a seat.

38
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,140
Grandpa, how do you feel today?

39
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,470
Do you feel better?

40
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,000
I feel quite good.

41
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,620
I can do 50 static push-ups.

42
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,000
You can count it for me later!

43
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,400
Grandpa.

44
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,530
Who are those people outside?

45
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,550
They

46
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,060
only come to me for money.

47
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,300
A bunch of ungrateful people.
I don't want to talk to them.

48
00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:38,290
Grandpa,

49
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,580
I didn't know

50
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:42,030
you were a rich old man.

51
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,980
There are many things about me
that can surprise you.

52
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:50,730
Yun Shu.

53
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,690
Why are you here alone today?

54
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:54,980
Where’s Si Nian?

55
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:56,990
He...

56
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,510
Actually, I'm coming alone today.

57
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,640
There's something I
want to tell you alone.

58
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:05,960
What?

59
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,540
Actually, it is

60
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,020
about my relationship with Mr. Zhang.

61
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,100
Actually, the two of us are...

62
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,070
A moment please.

63
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,120
Hello, everyone.

64
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,260
This is the fiancee of Si Nian.

65
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,390
Yun Shu.

66
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,840
They’re going to get married soon.

67
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,300
This is really a big happy event.

68
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,960
Why didn't Si Nian

69
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:29,850
tell his aunt about

70
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,840
such breaking news?

71
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,780
How beautiful Yun Shu is!

72
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:34,350
Yeah.

73
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,140
What a perfect match

74
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,659
they are.

75
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,780
Tell me, when are you
going to have a baby?

76
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,760
I know the director of obstetrics
and gynaecology in this hospital.

77
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,210
By the way, Yun Shu.

78
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,720
What were you going to tell me just now?

79
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,400
Nothing, grandpa.

80
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:51,240
Alright. It doesn't matter.

81
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,500
If you have something to say,
just say it. We are all family.

82
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:54,820
Yeah! There are no outsiders

83
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:55,480
but families.

84
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:56,520
Families! Families!

85
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,620
It's really okay.

86
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,720
It's really okay.

87
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,680
It's alright.

88
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,950
Shu, Shu.

89
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,430
You just listen to me

90
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,660
and have a baby as soon as possible.

91
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:24,720
You're still young, but Si Nian isn't.

92
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:26,820
Besides, you’re young now.

93
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,910
You can recover
quickly after giving birth.

94
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,970
Be sure to listen to what I said.

95
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,790
Keep that in mind. I'll go back.

96
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:35,950
Bye, aunt.

97
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,600
Keep that in mind.

98
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,140
Is it good?

99
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,480
Yeah.

100
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:52,460
One more!

101
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,450
Wait a minute, I'll take a call.

102
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,540
Get to the point. I'm busy.

103
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,230
What? Yun Shu is going to have a baby!

104
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:10,470
Tell me.

105
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,220
What on earth is going on?

106
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,370
That's impossible.

107
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,320
Lin Nuo, take her pulse

108
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:15,710
to see if she’s pregnant.

109
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,950
It definitely couldn't happen
between Mr. Zhang and me.

110
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:17,910
Go away.

111
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,860
What's impossible?

112
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,240
In just a few weeks,

113
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:23,470
the two of you changed from
being incompatible as fire and water

114
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,360
to be in a fake relationship
and living together.

115
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:26,700
It's not my fault.

116
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,080
Then it's on Mr. Zhang.

117
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:29,860
Did he have a crush on you long ago?

118
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,250
And he's implementing
his plan step by step.

119
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,140
Sure enough, experience counts!

120
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,350
Don't talk nonsense.

121
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,330
This was suddenly brought up by grandpa.

122
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,600
He doesn't know either.

123
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,280
So you just tell me.

124
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,870
What am I going to do?

125
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,100
Yun Shu.

126
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,580
Do you think you hate Mr. Zhang so much?

127
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:45,550
Yeah.

128
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,880
I hated him before.

129
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,980
But now,

130
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,620
I feel he's good.

131
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,770
In that case,

132
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,830
why don't you just

133
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,270
marry him?

134
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,540
Gao Zhi Yi.

135
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,040
How can you compromise so quickly?

136
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,550
This is about marriage.
This is a big deal.

137
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,600
Marriage without love

138
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:08,690
is that... How to say?

139
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:09,740
Behaving like a hoodlum.

140
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:10,390
Yeah.

141
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,830
That's behaving like a hoodlum.

142
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,050
Forget about that

143
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,050
and his family condition,

144
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,650
I can't even marry him.

145
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,120
He's my teacher.

146
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,480
He’s your former teacher.

147
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:21,830
You've graduated for so long.

148
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,540
You have bad values.

149
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,450
This is definitely egoism.

150
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,040
Egoism?

151
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:28,660
Come on, Lin Nuo.

152
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,610
Recite the explanation of

153
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,800
the egoism for me.

154
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,799
Alright! Forget about the marriage thing.

155
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:33,539
Yun Shu.

156
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,809
Does your sister know about

157
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:35,590
you being diddled out of money
for the house?

158
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,190
She certainly doesn't know.

159
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,000
I'm using a crisis now

160
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,860
to cover up another crisis.

161
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:43,080
Can I dare to tell her?

162
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:44,340
Who is calling me?

163
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:49,050
Her sister.

164
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,370
You jinx.

165
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:53,970
Hello, sis.

166
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:54,680
Yun Shu.

167
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,800
The company has set up a
new controlled company in China.

168
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:57,850
So I’ll return to China.

169
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,080
I'll come back to you soon.

170
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,870
You’re going back to China?

171
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,960
It seems that

172
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,610
you don't want me to come back?

173
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,470
Of course not.

174
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:07,770
That's good!

175
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,400
You tidy up the new house

176
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,740
to make a separate room for me.

177
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,840
You’re coming back to live with me.

178
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:13,410
Of course!

179
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,970
Don't worry! I won't live for nothing.

180
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,400
I'm going to help you pay back
the monthly payment together.

181
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:17,820
Okay, that's it.

182
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:18,980
No! No! No! Sister! Sister! Sister!

183
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,110
Wait! Hello? Hello?

184
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:22,830
What did she say?

185
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:23,300
It's over. It's over!

186
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,690
Both new and old hatred come along to you!

187
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,960
You really know nothing about idioms.

188
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,590
It's called a double whammy.

189
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,730
Stop! Stop! Stop!

190
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,970
Stop talking

191
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:31,870
if you two don't know how to say.

192
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,640
Stop stimulating me!

193
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:33,830
Would you please stop giving

194
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,320
such bad advice?

195
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,370
By the way, have you
heard from your cousin?

196
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,660
We can't find him yet.

197
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,690
How about

198
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,970
you just get a lawyer?

199
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:42,330
I'll ask my friend

200
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,470
if there's anyone in this line of work.

201
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,000
Speaking of lawyers,

202
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:45,880
Mr. Zhang

203
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,370
recommended one to me before.

204
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,620
How about...

205
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,110
I'll go and ask him.

206
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:51,730
That works.

207
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:06,210
Hello.

208
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:07,740
Who are you looking for?

209
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,140
Hello.

210
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,480
I was recommended by someone I know.

211
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:12,830
He knows the partners here.

212
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,990
I want to ask him for help with something.

213
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,140
Partner?

214
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,110
Yeah.

215
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:19,790
You’re looking for lawyer Meng, right?

216
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,370
Yeah.

217
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,330
He's on a business trip.

218
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,310
Maybe he'll come back
in more than one month.

219
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,210
More than one month?

220
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,490
It's lunch break now.

221
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,520
What can I do for you?

222
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,660
Tell me about it.

223
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,170
I also work here.

224
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,060
You can just give it to me.

225
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,390
Okay. Thank you.

226
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,310
I have a basic

227
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,010
understanding of this case.

228
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,140
I've met too many similar cases.

229
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,190
I can help you.

230
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:44,980
Really?

231
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:46,940
Thank you very much.

232
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,490
Well,

233
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,580
about the cost,

234
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,470
you have to pay me
30000 yuan in advance first.

235
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,110
Thus,

236
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,080
I can help you find the person

237
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:53,970
with my interpersonal relationships.

238
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:54,940
Thirty thousand yuan?

239
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,140
I really don't have so much.

240
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,050
How about let me think it over?

241
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,790
I think it's destined for
us to know each other.

242
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:04,730
Well,

243
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:05,900
I'll give you a discount.

244
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:06,870
Twenty five thousand yuan.

245
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,240
Actually,

246
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,360
I don't have this much.

247
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:14,810
What can I say?

248
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,630
This

249
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,160
is the lowest price in the sector.

250
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:19,210
I can't help it if you
still think it's expensive.

251
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,140
I have a lot of cases to deal with now.

252
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,210
Lawyer Lyu.

253
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,810
Sorry for bothering you today.

254
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:26,600
I'm really sorry.

255
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,100
Missy.

256
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:29,790
Hold on.

257
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,720
I'll think of other ways.

258
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:32,600
Professor Zhang,

259
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,010
all of our relatives

260
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,090
have seen Yun Shu.

261
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,130
I think

262
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,400
you can get ready to
get married this month.

263
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:44,260
Academician Zhang, I made
a statement with you before.

264
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,620
Yun Shu and I

265
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,450
are indeed in a relationship.

266
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:51,310
But the two of us are
not suitable for marriage.

267
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,960
Marriage takes time to
manage and maintain.

268
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:55,790
And now I put all my energy

269
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,040
into scientific research.

270
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,710
I really don't have much time

271
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,980
to deal with it.

272
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,440
Deal with it?

273
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,410
From my part,

274
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,130
you don't have to deal with Yun Shu.

275
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,940
She also can save you more time

276
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,520
for scientific research.

277
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,640
I don't agree with what you say.

278
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:13,380
Since it is so,

279
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:16,400
please make an argument and reasoning

280
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:17,860
to prove that you're right.

281
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:18,830
OK.

282
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,750
Argumentation is where I shine.

283
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,710
Give me the result in three days.

284
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,530
Academician Zhang, three days.

285
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:26,820
Deal.

286
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:28,950
I'm going to bed.

287
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,280
Come on. Grandpa.

288
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:46,210
Please come in.

289
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,780
Mr. Zhang.

290
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:51,840
Are you busy now?

291
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:54,760
There's something I want
to talk to you about.

292
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,630
You're just in time.

293
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,470
I have a few questions to ask you.

294
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,440
Come here.

295
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:00,460
How tall are you?

296
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,420
About 170cm.

297
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,030
You aren't that tall.

298
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,080
Please be more accurate.

299
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,230
168cm.

300
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,820
I am 183cm.

301
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:18,000
The distance from the tip of my nose
to the top of your head is less than 17cm,

302
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:19,180
so you are

303
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,560
at most 166cm tall.

304
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,860
Isn't it rounding off more than 170cm?

305
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:26,820
What is the weight?

306
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,280
Can the thumb be everted?

307
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,440
Can the tongue roll?

308
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,220
Weight is 85. The fat content isn't low.

309
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,900
You can't roll your tongue.

310
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,820
Almost no earlobes.

311
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,220
Mr. Zhang.

312
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:04,400
What exactly do you want to do?

313
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:05,520
I'm examining

314
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:07,410
the dominant expression
of your genes.

315
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,730
And then do a matching survey with me

316
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:10,150
to evaluate if there
will be genetic defects

317
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,430
in our offspring.

318
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:13,580
Offspring?

319
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:15,500
You don't have to be nervous.

320
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,240
I'm not really talking
about breeding with you

321
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,740
but to prove, with the statistics
gained from Genetics to Psychology

322
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:22,150
to Statistics,

323
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,220
to Academician Zhang that

324
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:24,600
we are the worst match

325
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:25,780
and the least suitable for marriage.

326
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,080
But must you do so?

327
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:27,870
Everyone knows the two of us

328
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,610
aren't a good match at all.

329
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:31,690
Please put it back in place.

330
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,620
But Academician Zhang
didn't think the same way.

331
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,460
That's why I use these methods

332
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,440
to prove

333
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:42,840
this obvious conclusion.

334
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:44,270
Can it work

335
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,630
by proving like this?

336
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,750
Don't worry.

337
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,870
Academician Zhang and I are
both engaged in mathematics.

338
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,940
Nothing but statistics can

339
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,310
persuade him.

340
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,810
Will you cooperate with me?

341
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,460
Alright.

342
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:56,890
Good!

343
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,760
I have an international IQ
test, a version of 60 questions.

344
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:01,400
And

345
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,550
the introductory IQ
assessment test questions

346
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,990
of Mensa.

347
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,070
But from my recent observation of you,

348
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,600
this one is more suitable for you.

349
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,450
So please

350
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,340
finish answering all the questions

351
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:12,810
within an hour.

352
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,080
Start answering the question.

353
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,280
Please.

354
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:21,530
The lawyer fee has been
reduced from 30,000 to 10,000 yuan.

355
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:22,520
I can't imagine a discount like this.

356
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,200
Lawyer Lyu said

357
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,420
he's only helping me out of sympathy.

358
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:27,860
Yun Shu.

359
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:29,910
Is the lawyer you found reliable?

360
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,920
Absolutely.

361
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,770
This is the law firm
recommended by Mr. Zhang.

362
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:34,940
It's only been two days
since you lived together.

363
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:35,880
But you've changed your tone.

364
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:36,580
What's going on?

365
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:37,850
What?

366
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:38,990
Yi Yi.

367
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,960
I just...

368
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:44,350
Alright?

369
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,600
I'm being practical and realistic.

370
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,730
Mr. Zhang is a nuisance,

371
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,930
but he's quite reliable in doing things.

372
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:54,070
Yun Shu,

373
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,480
are you sure you don't need my help

374
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:56,680
finding another lawyer?

375
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:58,490
I still believe in Mr. Zhang's judgment.

376
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,320
Alright.

377
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,560
Don't worry about money.

378
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:06,490
Lin Nuo.

379
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,220
Let's share it with percentages
of 60 percent and 40 percent respectively.

380
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:08,190
OK.

381
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:10,340
But who owns 60 percent or 40 percent?

382
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:11,310
Tell me about it.

383
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:13,470
I got it.

384
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,520
I just got the scholarship.

385
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,300
Do pay it back!

386
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:22,290
Definitely! Yi Yi.

387
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,260
Don't worry!

388
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,100
Thank you.

389
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,010
Come on. Let's take a group photo.

390
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,190
Mr. Zhang, the meal is ready.

391
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,100
I studied this one all night

392
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:43,280
step by step according to what you said.

393
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,020
It absolutely meets your
perfect standards.

394
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,170
It tastes good.

395
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,440
Mr. Zhang, I really should thank you.

396
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:03,820
Thank me?

397
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,800
Why?

398
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,339
The Qin He Law Firm you recommended

399
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:08,640
is particularly good.

400
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:10,619
I found a reliable lawyer.

401
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,119
He promised to help me find my cousin

402
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:14,260
and the results would come out
within two days.

403
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:15,599
That's good.

404
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:17,450
Which lawyer was assigned for you?

405
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:19,369
His last name is Lyu.

406
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:20,619
Lawyer Lyu.

407
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,520
He's very nice.

408
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:23,810
After I gave him a deposit,

409
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,510
he immediately set off to find my cousin.

410
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,470
You gave him money?

411
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:29,110
How much did you give?

412
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,700
I gave him ten thousand yuan.

413
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:35,550
Did he sign an entrustment
contract with you?

414
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:36,820
No!

415
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,270
Maybe he didn't have time.

416
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:43,590
Yun Shu.

417
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,660
Where did you talk to that Lawyer Lyu?

418
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:49,640
In the coffee shop
downstairs of the law firm.

419
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,050
Well, you

420
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:55,820
go to Qin He Law Firm with me

421
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,810
tomorrow morning.

422
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:09,320
Are all the staff here?

423
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,980
Did a lawyer surnamed Lyu leave

424
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,190
within the last half month?

425
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:14,330
No.

426
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,040
Thanks.

427
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,440
You're welcome.

428
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:25,930
What were you talking to her about?

429
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,810
Come with me first.

430
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,480
Take a look at these photos

431
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:37,580
and see if you can find Lawyer Lyu.

432
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,720
No.

433
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:51,030
Then where did you

434
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:53,200
meet with Lawyer Lyu?

435
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,070
At the gate.

436
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,370
Mr. Zhang.

437
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,690
What on earth do you need me to do?

438
00:18:58,780 --> 00:18:59,530
I still have something

439
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:00,950
to talk to them about.

440
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,250
You go home first.

441
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,000
Hold on.

442
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,190
Please give out this photo

443
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,760
to your friends from other law firms

444
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,170
to see if they know this man.

445
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:23,230
OK.

446
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,270
I'm going to do that.

447
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,540
Thanks.

448
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,160
Yun Shu.

449
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:38,370
Don't do it.

450
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,590
I'm not Zhang Si Nian.

451
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,940
It doesn't need to be so clean.

452
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,560
You and Lin Nuo lent me so much money.

453
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,590
I'll feel bad

454
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:48,030
if I don't help you two.

455
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,650
Come on.

456
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,910
You're already a trouble for me

457
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,490
by staying around solely.

458
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,230
Sit quietly for a while.

459
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:02,580
Why don't I draw pictures for you?

460
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:04,300
With my talent of caricature,

461
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,360
I can definitely make

462
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:07,300
perfect slides for you.

463
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,330
It's just a subject assignment.

464
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,710
Why do I need that outlandish product?

465
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:12,940
Then I can cheer you up.

466
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,950
All right, Yun Shu.

467
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,680
Can you do something serious?

468
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,860
Did the lawyer you contacted

469
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,370
find your cousin?

470
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,230
Not yet.

471
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:28,300
It shouldn't be that fast to find a man.

472
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,830
Call him.

473
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:33,020
I called last time.

474
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,820
But he didn't answer.

475
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:36,010
I think he was busy.

476
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,830
But he should reply to the message.

477
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:38,660
Call him again.

478
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,630
Let me ask him for you.

479
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,290
Sorry! The number you dialled does
not exist, please check it and dial later.

Does... Does not exist?

It wasn't the case a few days ago.

You were wrong from the very beginning.

00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:53,740
Academician Zhang.

514
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,620
You taught me when I was little

515
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:57,830
that mathematics can solve
all the problems in the world.

516
00:21:58,210 --> 00:21:59,480
But I also taught you

517
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:02,080
mathematics is absolutely rational.

518
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,190
While what life needs

519
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,160
is sensibility.

520
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:08,660
Yun Shu happens to be
a very emotional woman.

521
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:10,930
Academician Zhang, the
sensibility you said about Yun Shu

522
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:13,540
is, in fact, the biggest
weakness in her character.

523
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,570
The best proof is that she was cheated.

524
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:16,710
No.

525
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,880
These so-called defects of Yun Shu

526
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,220
are her greatest strengths

527
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,440
and the qualities you lack the most.

528
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,030
Do you know what it is?

529
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:27,450
Please.

530
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:28,410
Warmth.

531
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,580
Warmth.

532
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,680
Warmth.

533
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,970
Si Nian, I know you.

534
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:38,130
Life isn't about fun

535
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:39,530
or worth enjoying either.

536
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,040
Let alone happiness.

537
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:42,650
So you are excellent.

538
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:44,870
But you lack warmth.

539
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:46,470
While Yun Shu,

540
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,700
though a little dumb

541
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,010
and unreliable

542
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:52,220
and even being easily deceived

543
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,650
as you said,

544
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,350
the warmth in her

545
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:57,950
is enough to infect you

546
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:01,600
to make you believe
in and love life again.

547
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:03,760
As I said before,

548
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,990
one of you is spinning forward
while the other is spinning backward.

549
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,340
Quantum entanglement.

550
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,730
Academician Zhang,
you are twisting facts.

551
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,850
No, don't forget.

552
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,560
The purpose of science is to make life

553
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:17,580
become better and more real.

554
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:20,240
Only those who love life

555
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,850
can make achievements in science.

556
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:23,960
And this

557
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:27,560
is precisely what Yun Shu can give you.

558
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:36,950
So I think, based on

559
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,870
the variant of lasso method

560
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,310
in high-dimensional data statistics

561
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:41,220
explained by Dr. Boorman,

562
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,680
I'll make a detailed introduction

563
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:44,560
at the next meeting.

564
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,120
Okay.

565
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,070
If Professor Zhang has finished speaking,

566
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,950
let me explain my direction

567
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:50,650
[Mr. Song]
let me explain my direction

568
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:51,970
and the view of mine.

569
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:52,230
Sorry.

570
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:52,990
Director.

571
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:53,970
I need answer this.

572
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:57,490
Hello.

573
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,000
Okay, thank you.

574
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,650
Okay, here it is.

575
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,290
My direction is...

576
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,260
Director.

577
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:09,100
Something just came up

578
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:10,070
and I have to leave first.

579
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,570
If there’re any specific problems,

580
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,150
we can discuss directly in the group.

581
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:16,800
Professor Zhang,

582
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,370
I'm not finished yet.

583
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,730
Sorry.

584
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:21,850
You can send me the paper directly.

585
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,600
Bye. Bye.

586
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:03,860
Lawyer Lyu, right?

587
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,250
Yes. Who is it?

588
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:07,060
Do you still remember Yun Shu?

589
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:17,610
[Renhe Hospital, Outpatient]

590
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:20,000
That's all about the specific situation.

591
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:21,940
The patient's biopsy report shows

592
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:24,200
a quite bad result.

593
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,600
Dr. Zhang,

594
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,210
please tell me.

595
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:32,420
The patient can only live about one year.

596
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,190
It is recommended that family
members be prepared in advance

597
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,510
and spend more time with him.

598
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:39,650
Thanks.

599
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:48,920
Mr. Zhang,

600
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:53,250
I'm here.

601
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:54,570
What are you doing here?

602
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,780
Grandpa asked me to come over today.

603
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,180
Then let’s go.

604
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,150
Okay.

605
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,830
Here you are.

606
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,880
Come on.

607
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:14,760
Grandpa.

608
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:16,620
In such a hurry,

609
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:17,880
is there anything you want to say?

610
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:20,510
There are some things I want you

611
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:21,840
to buy for me.

612
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,470
Just buy these on the list.

613
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:29,680
You asked us to come here to buy these?

614
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:34,080
You go with her.

615
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:36,270
Grandpa, I can buy these things

616
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,920
by myself.

617
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:39,300
That's not okay.

618
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,800
You can't take so many things.

619
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:44,770
Grandpa, would you like some water?

620
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,530
I'll get you some water.

621
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,510
No! No! Don't bother.

622
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,510
Okay, grandpa, I get it.

623
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,890
I'll do as you say

624
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:50,390
and go with her.

625
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:51,140
Okay.

626
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:52,320
You take good care of yourself.

627
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,060
We'll be back as soon as we finish buying.

628
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:55,620
Okay.

629
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:56,590
Let's go.

630
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,670
Okay.

631
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:02,050
Si Nian.

632
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:06,510
A moment please.

633
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,480
Okay.

634
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:10,110
Please.

635
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,280
Professor Zhang,

636
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:17,370
you should use your perfect eyes

637
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,960
to observe imperfect people.

638
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:45,380
Do I need to tell

639
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,590
the thing about the
Lawyer Lyu to Mr. Zhang?

640
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:55,480
I'll figure it out myself.

641
00:27:58,950 --> 00:27:59,870
Mr. Zhang,

642
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:01,330
what's the matter?

643
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,730
There are two kinds of
laundry detergents here.

644
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:04,480
One contains biological enzymes

645
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,880
while the other contains bamboo
charcoal golden carbon.

646
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:07,830
Bamboo charcoal golden carbon
has a strong environmental protection rate

647
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,470
and bactericidal power.

648
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,410
But biological enzymes

649
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,010
can effectively remove stains.

650
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,310
You can choose both.

651
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:14,060
But there’s not enough
storage space in the hospital

652
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,240
and they'll go to waste.

653
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:17,470
Stop. Let me choose.

654
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,730
Let's choose this one.

655
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,420
Why?

656
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,450
This smells good.

657
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,710
Grandpa will definitely like it.

658
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:37,900
Smells good?

659
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,040
Buy this.

660
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,840
Isn't this a bit hasty?

661
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:01,710
I’ve already wasted

662
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:02,710
eight minutes.

663
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,240
Believe me.

664
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,350
Buy this and it will enable grandpa
to feel more comfortable when he uses it.

665
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:11,290
Comfortable?

666
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:21,340
This pair. They look good.

667
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,200
And

668
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:23,770
the sole is also particularly slip proof.

669
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,650
Twenty minutes.

670
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:39,080
What twenty minutes?

671
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,600
Usually it takes one and a half hours

672
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:42,550
when I come to the supermarket alone.

673
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,950
You're such a time-saver.

674
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:44,940
92.60 yuan in total.

675
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,290
I forgot my wallet.

676
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,510
You can pay with your phone.

677
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,130
I forgot my mobile phone too.

678
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,090
Missy.

679
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,760
Can you lend me one hundred yuan?

680
00:29:57,850 --> 00:29:59,390
I... I forgot my wallet.

681
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:01,770
I live nearby.

682
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:02,810
You wait for me here.

683
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,260
I can pay you back in ten minutes.

684
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,900
Okay, wait for a while.

685
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,220
One hundred yuan, right?

686
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:11,370
I don't have enough
money. Please wait for me.

687
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:14,210
Mr. Zhang, can you lend
me one hundred yuan?

688
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,990
She won't give it back to you.

689
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,280
I promise.

690
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:25,250
I’ll definitely give it back.

691
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:27,900
See? She said she'd pay it back.

692
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:30,410
Here you are.

693
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:30,960
Thank you. Thank you.

694
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:31,830
You're welcome.

695
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,580
Just wait for me there for a while.

696
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:34,860
I'll pay you back when I get the money.

697
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:35,920
No problem.

698
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,670
She will pay it back.

699
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:49,540

00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:55,810
Let's go. We won't wait.

701
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:56,910
Just wait a little longer.

702
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:58,450
It's been 23 minutes.

703
00:30:58,820 --> 00:30:59,990
She won't come.

704
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,850
Yun Shu, you trust others too easily.

705
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,240
A lot of people will
take advantage of you.

706
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,400
You should always be on your guard.

707
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:08,850
Mr. Zhang,

708
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,330
you took me to the law firm this morning.

709
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,420
Was it because I was cheated again?

710
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,690
This world isn’t so simple at all

711
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,900
as you see.

712
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,100
No one would tell you "I'm lying to you"

713
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:20,840
when he's really doing so.

714
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,330
If all people in this world

715
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:23,220
are always on your guard

716
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:25,200
against others,

717
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,090
how boring the world should be?

718
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,510
But you can't refuse to learn a lesson.

719
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:31,610
Missy.

720
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,630
Sorry.

721
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,600
I looked for you everywhere
just now. But I failed.

722
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:37,920
Here's the money I owe you.
And keep this packet of sugar, too.

723
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:39,740
Thank both of you so much.

724
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,050
Well, I’m leaving.

725
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:42,950
Thank you. Bye.

726
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:43,920
Bye.

727
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,390
You see? Mr. Zhang.

728
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:52,600
There’s warmth in this world.

729
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,850
Okay, let's go back.

730
00:31:59,010 --> 00:31:59,890
Hold on.

731
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,600
This is for you.

732
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,320
This? What's this?

733
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:17,830
I met Lawyer Lyu this morning.

734
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:21,610
He's been very busy recently
and won't be able to take your case.

735
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,350
So he told me to give it to you.

736
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:26,910
There’s ten thousand yuan inside.

737
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,060
You scared me.

738
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,910
I thought I was cheated.

739
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:37,120
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

740
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,070
Let me carry it.

741
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:43,040
Let's go.

742
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:02,780
Mr. Zhang, look.

743
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:05,610
There’s warmth in this world.

744
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:12,710
You should use your perfect eyes

745
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,260
to observe imperfect people.

746
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,280
Yun Shu.

747
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:19,280
I thought it over.

748
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,410
Let's get married.

749
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:31,860
Let's get married.
