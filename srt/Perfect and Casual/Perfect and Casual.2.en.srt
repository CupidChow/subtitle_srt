00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,560

00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,090
Yeah.

35
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,560
My cousin mentioned that

What's your cousin's occupation?

39
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,940
My cousin is a property consultant.

40
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,579
I think that I have figured it out.

41
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,110
You've probably been fooled.

42
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:47,710
He is my cousin! How
possibly could he fool me?

43
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,950

open the door of the house.

Why can't it be opened now?

Good, now listen!

54
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,310
The key which your cousin gave
you was the key for renovation.

55
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,930
After renovation,

56
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,720
I used the password to unlock all along.

57
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:41,180
So the official key has
not yet been used before.

58
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:41,850
This is the reason why

59
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,050
your key just now

60
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,060
could unlock the door.

61
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,360
But when the official key

62
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,510
has been used once,

63
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,500
your key would stop working.

64
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:50,270
No way.

Huo Qi is your cousin, right?

00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:57,190
He is a property consultant.

68
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,810
There's nothing strange for
him to get the renovation key.

69
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,720
And he can get

70
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,330
the related information and
certificate of the house easily.

71
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,520
But there is no way that
he got the original one.

72
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,380
So in order to reassure you

73
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,930
and avoid your doubt against him,

74
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,170
he intentionally created this crisis.

75
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,210
If I remember it correctly,

76
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,090
the contract was signed on May 28.

77
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,080
It was your thesis oral defence day right?

78
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,250
Yeah.

79
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,960
And he had definitely told you that

80
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,690
the house was splendid.

81
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,110
If you don't buy that today.

82
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,010
Someone would buy it the next day.

83
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,520
Till then, under the pressure of timing,

84
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,250
you chose to believe him.

85
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:38,110
This is how he tricked
you out of your money.

86
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:42,470
So.

87
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,900
Mr. Zhang, what should I do?

88
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,090
Go and find your cousin first.

89
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,650
It cannot be, could you please recheck?

90
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,780
The company written on
his card is here for sure.

91
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:01,750
Miss.

92
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,720
You have already gone
through the photo wall of our staff.

93
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,410
There's no such person for certain.

94
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,810
Could you please think back?

95
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,500
He did say he was working here.

96
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:10,490
Take a look at his name card.

97
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,230
It costs ten yuan to
print a box of name cards.

98
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,740
You can even print Space Commander on it.

99
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,000
Take it away.

100
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,750
Thank you.

101
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:56,760
Hi, Yun Shu, how was
the house inspection going?

102
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:57,960
It's a big deal.

103
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,159
It seems that somebody owes Lin Nuo and me

104
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,550
a big meal.

105
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,100
Where are you guys?

106
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,860
Really?

107
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,740
You mentioned that
your cousin treats you well.

108
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,370
Why did he trick you?

109
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,430
I don't know.

110
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,860
But what Mr. Zhang said to me makes sense.

111
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,350
I have no reason to doubt him.

112
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,290
If so,

113
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,630
it's because he knows you too well.

114
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,030
Wait, you are just like

115
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,800
the blonde of the idol drama

116
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:41,030
who was tricked out of
property in the very first episode.

117
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:44,430
Well what am I going to do?

118
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,350
Hey, this is the girls' dormitory.

119
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,780
How come you can be here anytime you want?

120
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,720
Yun Shu, what's going on?

121
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:52,870
Tell me where he lives.

122
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,740
I will take you to wait at the door.

123
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:57,420
I've already been to his house.
He moved away.

124
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,500
Moved away already?

125
00:07:58,590 --> 00:07:59,470
Yes.

126
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,910
Then where is your uncle's?

127
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,850
Let's go and find his parents.

128
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,240
Yi Yi, his parents are not
in good health already.

129
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:08,050
We cannot go simply because of this.

130
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,440
Don't be silly.

131
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,470
Why are you yelling at me?

132
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:20,220
Well, there's only one way.
Call the police.

133
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:23,250
Call the police.

134
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,930
That's not necessary.

135
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,790
Think about the situation
you are going through.

136
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,690
Which is more important,
the money your parents left you or

137
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,510
your cousin's reputation?

138
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,360
You feel not comfortable
confronting your aunt.

139
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,350
It's okay, leave the job to the police.

140
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:37,039
By the way,

141
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,880
you cannot go to the police alone.

142
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:40,409
Ask Mr. Zhang to go with you.

143
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,990
He kicked me out of the house.

144
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:45,280
And this matter has
nothing to do with him.

145
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:46,900
Why?

146
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,130
At least he is related to this house.

147
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,140
Yeah.

148
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,960
You have spent all
your money on this house.

149
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,270
I just transferred 2000 yuan
to you, don't starve yourself.

150
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,130
Just in case of any emergency.

151
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:22,290
Take it.

152
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:27,660
Yi Yi, Lin Nuo, you two are so nice to me.

153
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,030
Get out of here.

154
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:33,020
I'm warning you.

155
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:35,890
If you keep acting so carelessly
and make do with everything,

156
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,450
I will cut off our friendship.

157
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,620
Mr. Zhang, I have a favour to ask.

158
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:51,390
Could you...

159
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,950
No, I have no time today.

160
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,710
But I haven't told you
the whole matter yet.

161
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,680
I have told you just now,

162
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:56,980
I'm fully occupied today.

163
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:57,830
Please, I'm begging you.

164
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,620
You just need to go to the
police and make a record with me.

165
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,740
My cousin has been
missing for over ten hours.

166
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:02,830
If I keep postponing this matter,

167
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,690
we'll have less of
a chance to find him.

168
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,720
I'm quite clear about the
matter you just mentioned

169
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,100
and it is the right
thing to go to the police.

170
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,790
But you being tricked by your cousin

171
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,290
has nothing to do with me.

172
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:12,320
And you should know.

173
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:13,120
Among the fraud cases,

174
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,640
the chance to get your property back

175
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:15,590
is less than ten percent.

176
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:16,060
Besides...

177
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,890
Okay, I get it, stop!

178
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,220
Professor Zhang.

179
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:21,740
Professor Zhang.

180
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,760
What's it about Miss Shen?

181
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:23,680
The hospital cannot reach you,

182
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:24,820
so they called the office telephone.

183
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,900
They asked you to go to the
hospital as soon as possible.

184
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:26,480
Well.

185
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,000
Could you please help me to
change the class into problem-solving?

186
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,770
There's a problem-solving book on my desk.

187
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:31,540
And...

188
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,850
About the teleconference
with Modern Chinese University,

189
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,190
I will finish it on my
way to the hospital.

190
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,490
When the homework amendment is done,

191
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:38,110
I will send them to their emails.

192
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,420
Any other questions please?

193
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,240
None, you have a very good memory.

194
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:42,290
Okay, thank you so much.

195
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,260
Alright.

196
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,860
Sir, may I ask you something?

197
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,170
Where is the car of
Professor Zhang of Statistics?

198
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,960
There are so many professors
named Zhang in the school

199
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,760
I don't know which
one you are looking for.

200
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,890
The one who is very serious,

201
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,570
picky and annoying.

202
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,030
Over there.

203
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:02,530
Thanks.

204
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,220
Shall we end the teleconference now?

205
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,640
I only reserved 15 minutes for speaking.

206
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:10,730
I never knew

207
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,020
Mr. Zhang has a cold appearance,

208
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,810
but remains a Princess in his heart.

209
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,710
What are you doing here?

210
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,800
Mr. Zhang, it's still about that matter.

211
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:30,270
You must go to the police with me today.

212
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,780
It seems that I haven't
made it clear enough.

213
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,540
I'm fully occupied today.

214
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,050
I don't care if you have time or not.

215
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,400
If you don't go with me today,

216
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:37,570
I won't allow you to drive the car.

217
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:38,480
Please stand back.

218
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:39,470
No!

219
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,330
Put your leg down.

220
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,010
No way!

221
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,820
Mr. Zhang, if it was not you

222
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:43,870
who stopped me from
buying financial products

223
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,880
and told me to buy real estate,

224
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:45,840
I would have done better

225
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:46,960
than this.

226
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:49,830
You should bear indirect
liability for me being tricked.

227
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,400
I don't mean to blame you.

228
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,470
I just want you to

229
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,870
go to the police with me.

230
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:55,590
It's not too much to ask I suppose.

231
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,840
Miss, there's something wrong

232
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:57,640
with your logic just now.

233
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:58,990
My suggestion for you to invest in
real estate has nothing to do with

234
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,820
you being tricked.

235
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,110
I don't care about logic.

236
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,790
You must go to the police with me today.

237
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,680
Fine, I will go with you.

238
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:06,830
But before leaving

239
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,170
I need to go to the hospital first.

240
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,360
Finally you agree to go with me.

241
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,880
Let's go then.

242
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,260
I thought this was your car.

243
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,230
Get in the car.

244
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:18,200

245

Hi, Si Nian.

247

Dr. Zhang.

248
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:44,140
Speaking, right, I will be right there.

[Inpatient]

250
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,770
The cancerous cells have
further spread to other places.

251
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,060
You see?

252
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,380
If we do surgery,

253
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,770
it may prolong the patient's life.

254
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,220
If not,

255
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,360
maybe three months left.

256
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,160
But the problem is that
even if we do the surgery,

257
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,440
we cannot guarantee
that the cancerous cells

258
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:06,960
would stop further spreading.

259
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,360
Then is there any detailed
probability calculation

260
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:10,050
between the two solutions?

261
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,560
Professor Zhang, medical
science is not like mathematics.

262
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:14,740
There's a lot of variations
and unknown matters.

Nothing.

Hop in, I will take you
to the police station.

268

I just found some medical tape.

269
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,560
So I just took it

270
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,420
and did a quick fix.

271
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,570
See if it works.

272
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:14,040
Yes, now hurry up and
fasten your safety belt.

273
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,000

Can I help you?

277
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:35,180

00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:36,950
Fraud.

Liu, someone is reporting a fraud case.

281
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,100
What is the case value?

282
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:43,550
Two, two hundred.

283
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,170
There's no need to report
fraud for just two hundred yuan.

284

I'm sorry, it's two million.

May I ask

286
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:52,600
how long is the prison sentence
for a two-million-yuan fraud?

287

Liu, what's the sentence for two million?

Mr. Zhang, I'm sorry.

296
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,910
I decided not to report to the police.

297
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:24,480
Why?

298
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,100
Since I was a child, he has
been the closest person to me

I still don't believe that
he turned his back on me.

He tricked you and your
sister out of your money.

He also failed your trust.

Of course not.

But if it is a white lie,

00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,430
There's no good or bad about it.

337
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:53,400
Of course not.

338
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:55,440
If your initiative is for
the good of that person

339
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:58,240
and your lie can

340
00:16:58,330 --> 00:16:59,490
make the situation better,

341
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,010
it is a white lie,

342
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,090
a good lie.

343
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:05,130
But isn't a white lie still a lie?

344
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,810
Mr. Zhang, I was wondering.

345
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,130
Have you ever lied?

346
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,800
Should we tell the patient
the truth about his illness?

347
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:16,119
Doesn't the patient have
the right to know the truth?

348
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:16,839
But for some patients,

349
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:18,450
they will become very excited

350
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,339
emotionally when they
get to know their condition.

351
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:23,020
Few patients have strong
mental fortitude.

352
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,760
Normally, family members of the patients

353
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:27,290
would choose to keep their
condition from the patients.

354
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:28,990
Never.

355
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,950
That's probably because you
haven't been caught in a situation

356
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,660
where you must lie.

357
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:44,020
Cheers on our graduation!

358
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,570
Three, two, one. Cheers!

359
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:54,650
Yun Shu.

360
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:56,910
Yi Yi.

361
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,760
The dormitory of the
undergraduate is to be renovated.

362
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,380
Today all students have to move.

363
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,660
Do you know?

364
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:07,880
Yi Yi, there's nowhere else I can go.

365
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,560
What to do?

366
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,460
Let's go, come to my dormitory.

367
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,690
I'm so sorry for causing you trouble.

368
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:25,310
Come on, I won't let
you stray on the street.

369
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,050
Make do with several days here.

370
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:32,800
Come on.

371
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:34,680
Things will be resolved.

372
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,400
Thank you, Yi Yi.

373
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,160
Don't worry, I can make it for sure.

374
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,050
I really admire you.

375
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,890
You are always so positive.

376
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:53,030
Wu Qian, we will make it, right?

377
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,020
That's right.

378
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,350
Little rabbit, you poor thing.

379
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:00,430
Why do you have to help this person out

380
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,110
all the time?

381
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:04,850
It's Wu Qian.

382
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:07,260
Why can't you remember its name?

383
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,100
Of course it will help me out.

384
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,580
It keeps me safe on
the behalf of my father.

385
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:17,950
Look, Yun Shu, what's this?

386
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,480
I'm going to surprise you this evening

387
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:22,000
for your birthday.

388
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:23,930
Now let it be with you, OK?

389
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:25,520
What do we call it?

390
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:27,390
Yun Shu, you can give it a name.

391
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,110
I'll call it Wu Qian.

392
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,170
Wu Qian? So why?

393
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,340
Because I hope dad

394
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,750
can make a lot of money in a month.

395
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,930
At least five thousand yuan.

396
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,320
My sweety.

397
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,090
Believe me.

398
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,520
Whether I’m around or not,

399
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:52,750
Wu Qian will be with you.

400
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:57,190
Then you can sleep well every night.

401
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:00,790
Go and get some sleep.

402
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:03,290
Well, come home early, dad.

403
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,920
Let's hit the sack.

404
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:12,890
Okay.

405
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,800
Hey.

406
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,470
What department are you in?

407
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,930
I've never seen you.

408
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:31,740
Hi, madam.

409
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,400
I'm from the Department of Statistics.

410
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:36,680
I just graduated this year.

411
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,410
Do you know this is
the graduate dormitory?

412
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:40,180
You're not allowed to stay overnight.

413
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:41,910
Yes.

414
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,060
Well, she’s a good friend of mine.

415
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,380
She’s been in trouble these days.

416
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:48,330
Just for two days.

417
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:49,680
We won't cause you any trouble.

418
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,800
It's a rule that you can't put her up.

419
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:53,210
If anyone comes to live,

420
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,210
how can we manage it?

421
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,170
That's too much!

422
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,450
What do you mean?

423
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:58,960
Look at them.

424
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,910
Someone's boyfriend
or fellows all stay here.

425
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,890
Why are you aiming at us?

426
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,890
This is what happens when you graduate.

427
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,100
Where are you from?
If you don't cooperate,

428
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,010
I'll report to the superior

429
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:09,200
to criticize you.

430
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:11,070
Well, Yi Yi, it's okay. It's fine.

431
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,320
Sorry, madam, I'm the one to blame.

432
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:16,320
Don't blame her. I'll move now.

433
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:17,760
Right now.

434
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,240
Come on.

435
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,270
Thank you and goodbye.

436
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:25,710
Yun Shu, leave her alone.

437
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,810
You just go out and hide.

438
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:27,790
After half an hour,

439
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,980
you can come back when she’s done.

440
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,040
It's okay, Yi Yi.

441
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:32,240
I can’t give you any more trouble.

442
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,070
Don't worry.

443
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,240
I’m sure

444
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:35,390
I can find a place to stay.

445
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,840
Believe me. I'm going to pack up.

446
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:50,620
Hi, Lin Nuo, I got something for you.

447
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:54,150
[Inpatient]

448
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,440
Hey, Yun Shu.

449
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,030
Yun Shu, I'm telling you.

450
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,810
You should have come to me.

451
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,820
You can’t count on Gao Zhi Yi.

452
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:13,430
And you? Why didn't you help me before?

453
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,090
When I told you about the house,

454
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,050
you should think of a way.

455
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,080
I did do that.

456
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,260
I told you to fight with her cousin.

457
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,250
But you didn't let me go.

458
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,380
Where are you going to find her cousin?

459
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:22,640
But you can't even find him.

460
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:24,420
Well, well, stop yelling.

461
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:27,170
I’m causing you trouble again.

462
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:27,850
No.

463
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,170
In our hospital,

464
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,140
there’re plenty of empty beds.

465
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:30,970
After a while,

466
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:31,980
I'll find you a place.

467
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,750
Don't worry, it's my turf.

468
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,230
No one can kick you out.

469
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,540
I hope so. You should be more reliable.

470
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,600
Hello, Qi Qi.

471
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,620
Will you pick me up later?

472
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:51,140
I'll text you the address.

473
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,590
I'll wait for you. Love you.

474
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,080
Who?

475
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:58,760
I'm going on a date.

476
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,080
There’s a blockbuster tonight.

477
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,170
My boyfriend is coming to pick me up.

478
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,900
Boyfriend? Who?

479
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:11,680
Hi, I'm Feng Qi.

480
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:13,090
I'm a graduate student
in the Sociology Department.

481
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:13,940
I am senior to Yi Yi.

482
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:16,040
I've heard a lot about you before.

483
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,640
Hi, senior.

484
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,970
When did you two fall in love?

485
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:20,230
I didn’t even know that.

486
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,760
Just last week.

487
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:25,130
During social practice,

488
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:26,710
you were busy then.

489
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,170
I haven't had a chance to tell you.

490
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,590
Last week.

491
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,980
It's less than a week.

492
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:33,240
You go to the movies and he picks you up.

493
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,490
Senior, you are progressing
a little too fast.

494
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:40,200
Love just comes so fast.

495
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,420
Yes, love is like a tornado.

496
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:44,770
Easy come, easy go.

497
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,340
Yi Yi.

498
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:47,740
Aren't you going to the movies?

499
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:49,070
How much time is left?

500
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,770
More than an hour.

501
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:52,680
Come on. Don’t be late.

502
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,050
Well, let's go.

503
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:55,610
Bye.

504
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:56,900
Here, Lin Nuo.

505
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:58,730
I'll leave Yun Shu to you.

506
00:23:58,820 --> 00:23:59,700
Don't forget it.

507
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,680
They’ve been in love for less than a week.

508
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:05,880
One must be off nut,

509
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:07,390
another must be blind.

510
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:09,740
Hey, you've been apart for three years.

511
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:12,350
Can’t you just give them your blessing?

512
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,750
Come on, I'll find you a berth.

513
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:20,300
Yun Shu.

514
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:21,530
You can go around here.

515
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,030
I'll arrange it for you.

516
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,150
Our hospital has a nice garden.

517
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,540
Lin Nuo, thank you.

518
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,450
My pleasure. Yi Yi, you and I,

519
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,790
we are family.

520
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:30,930
Okay, family.

521
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:31,600
I'm off.

522
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,940
Okay, bye.

523
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,820
Give me a hand.

524
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:53,010
Grandpa, what are you doing here?

525
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,820
Get me out of here first.

526
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:06,760
One, two, three.

527
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:17,310
Grandpa, what are you doing here?

528
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,640
Don't mention it.

529
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:20,690
I hid a box of cigarettes in the back.

530
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,250
I didn't expect it was too deep.

531
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,160
So I got stuck.

532
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:26,760
There's usually a lot of people here.

533
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:28,330
But it's so quiet today.

534
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,840
Thanks, that's kind of you.

535
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:31,980
You're welcome.

536
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:34,630
Grandpa, you just scared me.

537
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:37,150
But what's wrong with you?

538
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,870
My grandson didn't tell me.

539
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,060
I’m not even going to ask.

540
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:42,690
I think it's incurable.

541
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:46,340
If so, you need to stop smoking.

542
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:47,450
At my age,

543
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,260
it doesn't matter.

544
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:50,300
Carpe diem.

545
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:51,820
You can't say that.

546
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:53,530
Your grandson didn't tell you.

547
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:55,070
There must be a reason for that.

548
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,890
And your grandson
should be very filial to you.

549
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:01,860
We two share our life together.

550
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:03,160
So we’re good.

551
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,450
My grandson

552
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:09,590
is a good anxiety to me.

553
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:10,670
Good anxiety?

554
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,410
My last wish

555
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:16,750
is to see him married.

556
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,790
Miss.

557
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,710
What’s your name? Do you have a boyfriend?

558
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:25,350
Grandpa, I'm Yun Shu.

559
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,700
I don't have a boyfriend.

560
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,810
But why did you ask me that?

561
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,690
I think he's perfect for you.

562
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:36,710
How about introducing him to you?

563
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,560
No, no, no, grandpa.

564
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:40,670
Why did you ask me suddenly?

565
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:43,790
Love is a matter of fate.

566
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,960
The fate...

567
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:48,110
The fate...

568
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,070
Grandpa.

569
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,020
Why did you get out here?

570
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,220
Did you smoke secretly?

571
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:57,400
No, absolutely not.

572
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,500
Well, let's get back to the ward.

573
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:00,920
Okay, okay!

574
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,930
Let me help you.

575
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:02,950
Look out.

576
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,780
Miss.

577
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:06,240
Thank you, Yun Shu.

578
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:07,910
Welcome, grandpa.

579
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:11,070
Trust me. If you receive treatment

580
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,550
and stop smoking,

581
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,020
your grandson will

582
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:16,460
visit you with his girlfriend.

583
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:19,050
With your blessing, I hope so.

584
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,020
He will.

585
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,900
Bye.

586
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:22,470
Let's go.

587
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,870
Take it easy.

588
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:28,300
Be careful.

589
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,490
Yun Shu.

590
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,620
Come on, I find you a good place.

591
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,830
Sorry to make you wait.

592
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:35,010
I'll take the case.

593
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,560
Here you are.

594
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:47,580
What are you doing? I gave up smoking
long before.

595
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:51,660
Gave up smoking long before?

596
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:09,990
Academician Zhang.

597
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:12,830
Maybe I left it before.

598
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,350
If you left it before,

599
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,700
you can throw it away now.

600
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,420
Okay, okay.

601
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:19,580
Fine, fine.

602
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,040
To be honest,

603
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,710
I did want to smoke.

604
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,830
But I’ve decided to stop smoking.

605
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,630
Never again. I promise you.

606
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:41,220
Really?

607
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:43,730
Yes. A real man never
goes back on his words.

608
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,510
I won't smoke anymore.

609
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:51,480
But I want you to save
this cigarette for me.

610
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:55,050
Okay.

611
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:02,020
I usually rest here.

612
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,070
My buddies are also on vacation.

613
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,540
You can stay here for the next two days.

614
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:09,190
Well, thank you.

615
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,890
No need to thank me.

616
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,210
Let me help you.

617
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:13,420
It's okay. I'll do it myself.

618
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,630
Go on with what you're doing.

619
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:16,500
I can fix it. Don't worry.

620
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,840
See you then.

621
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:20,450
Bye.

622
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:21,410
Bye.

623
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:28,310
Professor Zhang.

624
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:30,330
About the plan we discussed before,

625
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,370
how’s it going with you?

626
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,200
Now it's time for surgery.

627
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:38,900
Dr. Zhang, I did some research

628
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,310
and consulted with
many medical institutions.

629
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,600
I know the success rate of this operation

630
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:44,990
may be only 50 percent.

631
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,680
But I still want a

632
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:49,120
relatively accurate answer.

633
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:52,690
Will my grandpa make it or not?

634
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:54,870
Professor Zhang, you study mathematics.

635
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,100
You should know better than me.

636
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:58,780
There are numerators and
denominators in the percentages.

637
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:01,170
If grandpa is the
denominator, he'd be fine.

638
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:03,090
But if he's the numerator...

639
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,190
It will be not good.

640
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,730
You know this.

641
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:08,230
And there's another problem.

642
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,680
He refuses to

643
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:10,470
have the operation.

644
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,330
He's a man of full capacity.

645
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,350
We can't force him.

646
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,580
So you can think about it.

647
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,750
How can we persuade him?

648
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:34,700
[Operation consent form]

649
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,690
What's the time?

650
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,350
Almost six.

651
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:44,970
You want to talk to me?

652
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:47,200
I just talked to Dr. Zhang.

653
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:49,560
He said you're in a good condition.

654
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,910
And the risk is low.

655
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,010
So if you have the operation,

656
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,420
you'll get better.

657
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,580
Good condition? Low risk?

658
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:00,490
What ambiguous words!

659
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:03,500
How can you say that?

660
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:07,230
You've always been
after absolute precision.

661
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:15,520
In fact, I know my condition very well.

662
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:19,460
When you quit your job,

663
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,470
returned home and bought a house,

664
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:28,440
I knew that I can't get well.

665
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,420
Do you know why

666
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:37,200
I’ve been putting off the surgery?

667
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:40,350
I fear neither death nor pain.

668
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:45,830
I'm afraid I may die too early

669
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,110
to wait for that day.

670
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,870
Which day?

671
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:55,500
My great regret in life is that

672
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,230
when you were young,

673
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,130
I didn't give you a happy childhood,

674
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:01,580
or a warm home.

675
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:04,550
That's why you have such a personality.

676
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,720
It made you who you are today
but it also harmed you.

677
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:12,950
I hope that there'll be
a person who loves you

678
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,830
and you love. You can build

679
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:20,420
a happy and warm home.

680
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:24,190
That's the day I've been waiting for,

681
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:29,100
as well as my last wish.

682
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,700
Come on, I’ll sign it.

683
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:47,670
Grandpa, are you convinced?

684
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:48,780
Yes.

685
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:52,340
I want to take the risk.

686
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,730
If I make it,

687
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:57,580
I'll live a little longer.

688
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,460
Maybe I’ll see

689
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:02,350
my wish come true.

690
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:15,850
Well, it's done.

691
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:18,100
I did you a favour.

692
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:21,130
You should do the same.

693
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,010
Answer me a question.

694
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,030
What's that? Go on.

695
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:30,210
Do you have a girlfriend?

696
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,500
If you're really for the
good of this person,

697
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:39,130
and your lie can

698
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:39,990
make the situation better,

699
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,710
then it is a white lie.

700
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,720
Mr. Zhang,

701
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:45,590
haven't you told a lie before?

702
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:50,660
That may be because
you haven't come across

703
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:53,070
a situation where you must lie.

704
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,720
I have a girlfriend.

705
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:58,360
You're lying.

706
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,680
No.

707
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:05,650
Before your operation,

708
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,300
I'll bring her to see you.

709
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:10,219
Okay, that's good.

710
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:12,940
Here.

711
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:22,320
Professor Zhang, I'm looking for you.

712
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:24,100
My grandpa has agreed to the operation.

713
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:26,290
What timely news!

714
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:26,699
Why?

715
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:28,520
In the morning,

716
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:30,179
your grandpa's test result was out.

717
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:31,810
All indicators are red.

718
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:34,239
Very dangerous. Now that he's
decided to have the operation.

719
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:36,969
He’d better do it right away.

720
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,540
Okay, fine.

721
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,920
Is there anything I can do?

722
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:42,020
In my view,

723
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,900
before a major surgery,

724
00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:45,460
the patient’s desire to live

725
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:46,690
plays a key role

726
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,120
in the success of the operation.

727
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:50,300
If he wants anything

728
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:51,170
or has any wish,

729
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,920
you'd better promise him first.

730
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:55,389
Okay.

731
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,680
He seems to be in a good mood today.

732

Who are you?

734
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:45,050
Are you the girl who has a crush on me?

735
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,560
Mr. Zhang.

736
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,210
Hi, I need to ask you a favour.

737
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,310
Sure, go ahead.

738
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,630
Be my girlfriend.

739
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,590
That’s kind of sudden.

740
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,450
I can pay you.

741
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:19,100
I know that your

742
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:19,760
salary is

743
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:21,110
8460 yuan a month.

744
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,210
That’s 260 yuan a day.

745
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,930
I can pay you three days' salary.

746
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,810
But it only takes you half an hour.

747
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:27,740
You don’t have to do anything.

748
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:31,730
Just stand next to me and smile, okay?

749
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,480
You're crazy.

750
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,530
Yun Shu.

751
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,640
I'd like you to do me a favour.
