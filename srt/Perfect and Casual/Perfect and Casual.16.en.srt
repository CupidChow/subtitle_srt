4
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:21,260
Mr. Zhang.

5
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,829
Why did you go to work so early today?

6
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:26,590
I'll get changed.

7
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,210
I'll go with you after that.

8
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:30,940
And

9
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,170
last night.

10
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:32,790
Sorry.

11
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,760
Sorry!

12
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,720
I have something else to handle today.

13
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,070
I can't drive you to work.

14
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:47,790
Yun Shu.

15
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,050
Happy birthday!

16
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:57,600
Thanks.

17
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,020
Morning.

18
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:07,600
Morning.

19
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,070
Morning, Yun Shu.

20
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,040
Good morning.

21
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:09,870
Morning.

22
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,520
Morning, Mr. Guan!

23
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:11,490
Morning.

24
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,000
Morning, everyone!

25
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,010
Morning, Manager Meng!

26
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:18,990
Today, I'll tell you

27
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:20,210
some good news.

28
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,520
The bakery near our
house is offering big discounts.

29
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:25,150
I've bought you breakfast.

30
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,670
-Liane,
-Thank you, Mr. Meng.

31
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,570
take it and share with them.

32
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,400
My pleasure.

33
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,550
Everyone, come here.

34
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,630
Yun Shu.

35
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,130
Take your breakfast.

36
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,060
Lawyer Meng?

37
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,590
Don't go to so much
trouble in the future.

38
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,220
Didn't we make a deal yesterday?

39
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,300
Let's mind our own business.

40
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,070
How come so many good things

41
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,740
have been happening
in our office recently?

42
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:46,920
Dinner,

43
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,200
breakfast.

44
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:50,550
It's too obvious.

45
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,700
Ten minutes later,

46
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:55,050
come to my office to report on your work.

47
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,560
Okay.

48
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,300
Tell me about it.

49
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,800
How is everything going 
between you and Yun Shu?

50
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:14,220
How do you know 

51
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,670
it's between Yun Shu and me?

52
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,019
I have known you for over twenty years.

53
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,940
I have never seen you like this.

54
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:21,610
So there must be

55
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,880
something wrong with you.

56
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:24,400
It must be Yun Shu.

57
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:28,930
We are influenced by those close to us!

58
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,370
Since you are together with Yun Lan,

59
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,230
you have been becoming smarter.

60
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,760
What do you mean by that?

61
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,130
I really didn't sleep last night.

62
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,510
Tell me about it.

63
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:42,820
What happened last night?

64
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:43,800
Yesterday

65
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,080
was Yun Shu's birthday.

66
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,080
How did you feel?

67
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,100
Quite complicated.

68
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,530
It was something

69
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,280
I have never experienced before.

70
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,320
Did you feel a little resistant

71
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,100
and then a little anger?

72
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,000
Before you went to bed,

73
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,150
you felt a little sad.

74
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,130
That must be it.

75
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,590
You have fallen in love with Yun Shu.

76
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,830
Fall in love with Yun Shu?

77
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:22,860
Yeah.

78
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,520
That's exactly how you
feel when you're in love.

79
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:25,250
Well...

80
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,560
There's only one possibility?

81
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:27,710
What else could that be?

82
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:28,780
That is unscientific.

83
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,060
No research

84
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,570
should be complete
without reverse inference,

85
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,950
because it will make the
results obtained of argumentation

86
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,220
more reliable.

87
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,110
I got it.

88
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,080
Say it.

89
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,590
Men's desire to possess.

90
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,750
Male animals' inborn desire to possess.

91
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,090
Yun Shu is your wife.

92
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,950
Since you've been
together for such a long time,

93
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,880
you have long believed
you have already had her.

94
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,120
But now

95
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,650
another male competitor has appeared.

96
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,080
You must be surprised

97
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,120
and even mad.

98
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:56,630
Then how do you explain "sad".

99
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,050
As for "sad",

100
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,950
maybe you think you may lose the race.

101
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,390
The cooked duck

102
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,190
flies away.

103
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,520
What a shame!

104
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,550
How do you feel?

105
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,750
Last night,

106
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:16,870
how did Mr. Zhang celebrate
your birthday with you?

107
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,890
It was already late

108
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,150
when I got back last night.

109
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,190
It was nothing

110
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,780
compared to my surprise, huh?

111
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,760
No.

112
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,000
Come on! Was there no celebration at all?

113
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,110
Well...

114
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:32,800
That's not it.

115
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,070
I'm telling you,

116
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,550
Zhang Si Nian

117
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,000
has a high IQ

118
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:39,150
but his EQ still remains to be improved.

119
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,340
Forget it.

120
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,310
He will

121
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,850
celebrate it sooner or later.

122
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:46,930
Really?

123
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,640
Yun Shu.

124
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,770
Look at you.

125
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,350
You are overjoyed.

126
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,190
Shouldn't you consider

127
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,190
my feelings more or less?

128
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,159
Sorry!

129
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,500
I didn't mean it.

130
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,550
Okay, okay, okay.

131
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,630
I was just kidding.

132
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,980
But Yun Shu,

133
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,190
I want everything

134
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,550
to go back to what it was.

135
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,540
I don't want

136
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,030
you to avoid me on purpose.

137
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,150
Although I am in love with you,

138
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,590
it does not necessarily mean

139
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,870
you have to love me back right away.

140
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,120
When it comes to love,

141
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:14,740
it would be wonderful if there
is resonance between lovers,

142
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,050
but love can't be compelled.

143
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,130
Do you think so?

144
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,120
Yes.

145
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,630
Actually,

146
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,300
to love someone silently

147
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,670
is also a big pleasure.

148
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,420
Then it's a deal.

149
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,700
You love Mr. Zhang secretly.

150
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,300
I love you secretly.

151
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,220
No. No.

152
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,050
Mr. Meng, that is not what I mean.

153
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,180
I was just kidding.

154
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:39,820
Enjoy.

155
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:40,790
It's all cool now.

156
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:55,240
No, Yi Yi.

157
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:56,320
Are you OK?

158
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:57,400
As for that day,

159
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,430
I didn't mean to hide it.

160
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:00,540
I just want to...

161
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,580
Shut up!

162
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,310
No, I mean...

163
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,960
You are playing the Honour of Kings

164
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:05,870
without telling me.

165
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,610
Obviously you didn't
want me to play it with you.

166
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,320
No, Yi Yi.

167
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:08,790
I mean...

168
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,590
Hurry up!

169
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,000
Can't you see someone's coming for me?

170
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,840
I "died" again.

171
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:15,070
OK.

172
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,480
I'll focus on my game.

173
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,460
Come on, come on.

174
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:22,940
Someone is coming.

175
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,130
Go, go.

176
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,150

based on physiological data.

351
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,970
It is also displayed
on the smart bracelet.

352
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,350
Can it be realized?

353
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:38,900
In theory, it can.

354
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:40,220
But I can't give an

355
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,790
accurate assessment

356
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,640
right now.

357
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:43,630
So...

358
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,220
Can you wear it

359
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:46,070
and experience it?

360
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,070
I already said

361
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:47,660
I have no time.

362
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,620
The boss of the technology
company also said

363
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,120
they developed the technology

364
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:52,320
to help

365
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,790
children with emotional disorders.

366
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,140
Hoping to help them
reintegrate into society

367
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:57,120
through these bracelets.

368
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:58,720
So Mr. Zhang

369
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:00,230
for these kids.

370
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,720
Just help them.

371
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,050
What are you doing?

372
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,280
I didn't speak.

373
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:32,950
I made no noise.

374
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:38,980
It's time for work.

375
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,150
Have you finished all
your work at your law firm?

376
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,190
Don't think you can do whatever you want

377
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,580
if you are Lu Yu.

378
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,070
The schedule is ready.

379
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,270
I've read all the information

380
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:51,990
on several cases.

381
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,940
The data of the cases

382
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,920
has been collated.

383
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,020
To prevent errors,

384
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:55,920
I have to ask Zhang Si Nian to do

385
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:57,120
a new calculation for me.

386
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:58,470
There is no problem at all.

387
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,140
Anything of the data
involved in the case at that time

388
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:00,990
that I felt suspicious

389
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,180
was also annotated.

390
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:04,290
Lawyer Yun.

391
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,730
Any other instructions?

392
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:07,970
You've done a good job!

393
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:09,430
It is worthy of encouragement.

394
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,490
What do you want to do?

395
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,160
Oral commendation.

396
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:26,940
Isn't that a little stingy?

397
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:27,740
You mustn't mess around.

398
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:28,660
Here is the company.

399
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,820
I just want to have dinner together.

400
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:31,920
You think too much.

401
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,500
I'm going to book a restaurant.

402
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:58,870
Isn't that Lu Yu?

403
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,820
It's Lu Yu.

404
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,910
I'm crazy about you.

405
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:03,690
Add me.

406
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,349
I want your signature.

407
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:06,690
Okay.

408
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:10,540
Let me take a photo for you.

409
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:11,750
Let me take a photo for you.

410
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,680
I want to take a photo.

411
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,030
Okay.

412
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:20,329
Have you taken the photo?

413
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,540
Here.

414
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:23,829
Come on.

415
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:28,860
Yun Lan.

416
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:35,090
Didn't we agree to have dinner together?

417
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,150
Why are you leaving now?

418
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,330
I'm tired.

419
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,030
You're not feeling well?

420
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:39,920
Let me see.

421
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:41,000
It's alright.

422
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,780
I told you again and again,
don't tire yourself out.

423
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:53,990
You never listened to me.

424
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,080
You even scolded me.

425
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,090
Eat it when it is still hot.

426
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,480
You may go back first.

427
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:05,850
What's the matter?

428
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:06,980
Are you feeling unwell?

429
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:08,520
Let me see.

430
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:09,750
I'm really fine.

431
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,000
You may go home first.

432
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,300
Alright.

433
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,680
Well.

434
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,950
Remember to eat.

435
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:16,860
Mr. Zhang,

436
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:17,520
you're back.

437
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,070
I made a lot of delicious food today.

438
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,130
Let's eat together.

439
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:21,940
I'm tired

440
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:22,960
today.

441
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,380
I'm going back to my room first.

442
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:26,150
Mr. Zhang.

443
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,150
Last night...

444
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,800
In fact, I...

445
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:35,790
Mr. Zhang.

446
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,700
Is there a power failure in the house?

447
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,050
I think so.

448
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,780
I'll have a look at the distribution box.

449
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:41,620
Go to the study.

450
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:42,850
Inside the cupboard drawer,

451
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:44,500
there should be some candles.

452
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,760
Okay.

453
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,530
Yun Shu.

454
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:01,540
Have you paid the electricity bill

455
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:02,780
this month?

456
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,200
Mr. Zhang, I'm sorry.

457
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:06,750
I...

458
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,630
I'll pay for it tomorrow morning.

459
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,820
Mr. Zhang.

460
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:20,540
What's the matter?

461
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,340
Where on earth do you keep the candles?

462
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,940
Which drawer are they in?

463
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,520
Candles should be in

464
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:27,610
the row near the blackboard.

465
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,510
On the second or

466
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,980
the third layer.

467
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:31,990
Okay.

468
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:32,770
Yun Shu.

469
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,650
Look for it carefully.

470
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:36,940
Okay.

471
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,380
I found it.

472
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,800
I thought you'd forgotten.

473
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,200
The cake has been
sitting in the fridge all day.

474
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:31,870
I don't know if we can still eat it.

475
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,330
It's very beautiful.

476
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:36,000
I'm glad you like it.

477
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,780
By the way,

478
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:54,460
I got you a present.

479
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,100
What is it?

480
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,320
I see that the notebook you used before

481
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:00,400
is almost full.

482
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,080
So I bought a new one for you.

483
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:03,390
Do you like it?

484
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,360
Yes, I do.

485
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:18,660
Sorry!

486
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,400
Why are you apologising?

487
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,980
Last night,

488
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:23,650
I came back late.

489
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,070
Never mind.

490
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,570
You have your own life.

491
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,880
You have your own
choices and arrangements.

492
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,660
I was late

493
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,320
because of work.

494
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,230
Because of work?

495
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,800
Working with Lawyer Meng, I suppose.

496
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:47,820
I wanted to send you WeChat
messages on the way back

497
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,170
last night.

498
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,780
I left my phone there.

499
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:55,270
It was returned to me by Lawyer Meng.

500
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:56,870
So you and Meng Ran were downstairs

501
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,430
last night because he

502
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,930
wanted to give you your phone?

503
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,800
Were you downstairs yesterday?

504
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,060
You just said that.

505
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,980
Lawyer Meng returned you the phone.

506
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:12,360
Make a wish!

507
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:15,000
Or the candle will soon go out.

508
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:46,740
♫ Turning off the lights
in search of its trace ♫

509
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:49,400
♫ I walk steadily
on the path beneath my feet ♫

510
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,280
Yun Shu.

511
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:52,270
Happy birthday!

512
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:53,750
Thanks.

513
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:54,090
Thanks.

514
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:59,020
♫ I hear someone asking,
are you still here? ♫

515
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,850
Hello, Lawyer Meng.

516
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:08,850
Right now?

517
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:12,870
Okay.

518
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,960
I'll go now.

519
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:16,740
Okay.

520
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,850
See you later.

521
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,650
Lawyer Meng?

522
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,600
He told me I had to go
back and work overtime.

523
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:24,650
I might have to go now.

524
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,220
Mr. Zhang.

525
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:28,000
Would you please check the account?

526
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,040
Wait.

527
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,970
I'll be done soon.

528
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,390
Let me give you a ride.

529
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,760
Okay.

530
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,820
Yun Shu.

531
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:48,650
Have you decided to
work overtime at the park?

532
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,320
Lawyer Meng sent me the location.

533
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:51,710
That's right here.

534
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:55,190
Otherwise

535
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,120
let me go off and have a look.

536
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,320
Thank you for dropping me off today.

537
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,450
You may go home first.

538
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,060
No, I mean...

539
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:00,080
Yun Shu.

540
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,020
Our client this time

541
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,300
is very special and mysterious.

542
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:13,310
So.

543
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,250
Just to keep it a secret,

544
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:16,210
I chose here.

545
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,480
I feel like I'm in a spy movie.

546
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:19,920
Yeah.

547
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,220
Was there anyone following you

548
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,430
when you came?

549
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:28,590
I guess no.

550
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,100
I'm kidding.

551
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,060
Let's go.

552
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:38,890
Have you seen this episode?

553
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:39,660
I haven't.

554
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:40,950
It has just been updated.

555
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,270
Lawyer Meng?

556
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,880
Working overtime in the park?

557
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:46,500
Mr. Zhang.

558
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,620
I forgot to mention it.

559
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:50,480
It was Mr. Zhang who sent me here today.

560
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,120
Lawyer Meng, please don't use work

561
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:52,860
as an excuse

562
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,720
to take up Yun Shu's personal time.

563
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,510
Yun Shu.

564
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:58,540
If you don't like working overtime.

565
00:25:58,630 --> 00:25:59,560
You can just tell me.

566
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:00,630
That's okay.

567
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:01,920
No. No.

568
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:03,350
I didn't mean it.

569
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:04,760
Mr. Zhang.

570
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,000
You don't trust Yun Shu, do you?

571
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,910
Please don't change the subject.

572
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,880
Meng Ran.

573
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:11,420
I don't trust you.

574
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:12,390
Why?

575
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,800
You always use your work as an excuse

576
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:15,020
to take up Yun Shu's personal time.

577
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,120
I don't believe there is anyone

578
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:17,340
who comes to the park

579
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:17,850
on the weekend.

580
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:18,810
Lawyer Meng?

581
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,570
I'm so sorry.

582
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:21,740
I’m so sorry.

583
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:22,810
Mr. Wu.

584
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,270
I'm sorry I'm so busy.

585
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,000
It's okay. It's okay.

586
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,170
We just arrived.

587
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,650
Who is this?

588
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:31,750
I am a passer-by.

589
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:57,700
Why do you work on weekends now?

590
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:58,870
Sure.

591
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,550
Now I'm an intern at a law firm.

592
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:02,020
Lawyers have no weekends.

593
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,400
We have to work 24/7,

594
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,780
OK?

595
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,460
Say!

596
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,800
What's going on this time?

597
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:19,820
I thought it was weird.

598
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:21,270
I've been doing some things

599
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,750
without even knowing why.

600
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:23,650
It has never happened

601
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:25,080
to me before.

602
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:27,650
Is it for Yun Shu?

603
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:30,770
Not exactly.

604
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,660
Sometimes I am happy.

605
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,530
Sometimes I get angry.

606
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,540
I feel absent-minded

607
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:38,470
when I do anything.

608
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,970
Is it that

609
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,620
you are happy when you think of Yun Shu,

610
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:43,140
but you get angry when you see Meng Ran?

611
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,270
Not exactly.

612
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,820
For example, sometimes I get angry

613
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:48,020
when I see you.

614
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:48,810
Me?

615
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,400
What's wrong with me?

616
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,950
I get angry when I see you

617
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,750
talk about Yun Lan.

618
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:56,720
You're totally jealous.

619
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:59,100
Si Nian.

620
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,900
You're in love.

621
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,200
In love?

622
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:03,790
If you don't know

623
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,570
if you love Yun Shu

624
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:06,700
or like her,

625
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:09,310
you can feel it for yourself.

626
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:11,750
Then tell me,

627
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,080
how should I feel it?

628
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,060
Kiss.

629
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:15,590
Kiss?

630
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,270
After kissing,

631
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,660
you will get the answer.

632
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:22,810
Kissing.

633
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,620
Coffee's here.

634
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,360
Sister.

635
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,700
What are you thinking about?

636
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,000
It doesn't matter.

637
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:40,190
Why did you suddenly

638
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,680
ask me out today?

639
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:44,020
What has happened to you recently?

640
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,470
You got to come clean!

641
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:47,330
What?

642
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:53,300
Are you in love with Lu Yu?

643
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:56,400
What do you mean?

644
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,080
You still deny it?

645
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:01,130
Then I'll speak the truth.

646
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,080
Look.

647
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,400
Are the two

648
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,750
you in the picture?

Where did you get it?

652
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,550
From the internet.

653
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,870
Lu Yu is now a popular star.

654
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,790
Everywhere he goes,
fans take candid pictures.

655
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,940
You two sure aren't shy,

656
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,460
going public just like that.

657
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,690
I didn't want to let it go public.

658
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,570
So why were you two doing this?

659
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,950
I had neglected the occupation of Lu Yu.

Yun Shu,

665
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:42,690
I have something urgent to do.

666
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,400
I'll be off.

667
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,220
But...

668
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:46,390
Aren't we supposed to
see grandpa together?

669
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,740
I told Mr. Zhang all about it.

670
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:48,920
We'll have dinner together.

671
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:49,890
Next time.

672
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:56,410
Yun Shu.

673
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:58,300
Happy birthday!

674
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:00,950
Thank you, sis.

675
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,270
Would you like some, grandpa?

676

Yun Shu.

677
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:36,850
Have you been busy recently?

678
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:39,830
If you're busy, you don't have to
come back to see me all the time.

679
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,290
Take time to get plenty of rest.

680
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:43,050
You see, your face is getting thin.

681
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:44,350
Grandpa.

682
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,100
It's alright.

683
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,990
No matter how busy I am,
I will come back to see you.

684
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,330
You are the first in my heart.

685
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:52,470
Yun Shu is a sweet talker.

686
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:54,480
She is not like someone.

687
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,810
Grandpa, do you want anything?

688
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,300
Would you like an apple?

689
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:04,850
I'd like some clams.

690
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,320
Clams?

00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,640
