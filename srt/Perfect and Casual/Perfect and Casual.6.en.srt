[Episode 6]

4
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,310
I have looked it over.

5
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,550
Nothing is wrong with it.

6
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,360
Mr. Zhang.

7
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:22,340
Is it too formal for us like this?

8
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,040
This is a basic safeguard for our

9
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,170
coming marriage.

10
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,250
Although we'll be married in name,

11
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,810
I hope we can have a relationship

12
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,560
that doesn't cause any trouble

13
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,870
for either of us.

14
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,170
Based on this premise,

15
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,640
I made out a letter of agreement
for our contractual relationship.

16
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:36,820
Article 1, Chapter 1.

17
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,490
According to the
relevant regulations of the

18
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:40,220
People’s Republic of China (PRC),

19
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,920
Party A and Party B, in the
voluntary and fair principle,

20
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,130
have reached the following
consensus on the matters related to

21
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,270
their limited marriage relationship

22
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,880
through friendly negotiation

23
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:49,910
for common abidance.

24
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:53,120
Mr. Zhang, you may as
well get straight to the point.

25
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,680
Well.

26
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:55,810
That's exactly a priority.

27
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,590
After the one-year expiration of
the contractual relationship between

28
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,610
the parties, Party A will grant the
House No.520 of Building 2, Block A.

29
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,340
Academy Suites, No.3688 Nanwan Avenue,

30
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,560
to party B

31
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,350
without compensation.

32
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,340
Any problem?

33
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,230
No problem, let's go on.

34
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,440
Hold on, Mr. Zhang.

35
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:10,970
Do you really want to give me the house?

36
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,110
Of course.

37
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,730
No, this house belongs to you.

38
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,610
I can't accept it.

39
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,110
First of all, I'll stay
domestically for only one year.

40
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,770
I'll go abroad in a year.

41
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,870
So there is no any practical

42
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,240
value of this house for me.

43
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,270
Secondly,

44
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,710
I don't want you to volunteer your help

45
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,480
because if there is
no price for anything,

46
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,790
it will be more costly in turn.

47
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,130
Take this house as payment,

48
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,770
I will be more assured.

49
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:36,600
Mr. Zhang, I'm willing to help you

50
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:38,790
because I want to help grandpa to

51
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,040
fulfil his wish.

52
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,460
I can't accept the house you give me.

53
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,670
You must accept it!

54
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,370
If you don't accept this house,

55
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,590
our contract will go bad.

56
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:51,570
I see.

57
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,910
Of course, if you feel

58
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,740
really sorry about it,

59
00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:57,390
after you land a job,

60
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:59,390
you can make up for me in line with

61
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,070
the down payment when

62
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,650
you were cheated.

63
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:05,850
I certainly will.

64
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,990
Okay, let's move on to the next one.

65
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,510
During the term when the parties'
contract is coming into effect,

66
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,060
Party A and Party B
shall have no over-intimate

67
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,640
physical contact in any form

68
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,190
or for any reason.

69
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,820
Okay, next one.

70
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:20,800
Hold on, this is a key point.

71
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,790
Over-intimate physical contact.

72
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,990
I need to discuss it with you.

73
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:28,640
Discussion?

74
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:32,610
It's unnecessary. I have
basically known about these all.

75
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,540
Yun Shu, this is a contract,

76
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,909
in which each article must be

77
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,140
specified much clearly

78
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,820
so as to ensure our interests

79
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,810
and avoid them from
damage. Have you got it?

80
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:44,050
I've got it.

81
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,460
So I need to discuss it with you now

82
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,390
or for any reason.

83
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,890
What's the specific definition of it?

84
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,200
And what behaviours does it include?

85
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:56,520
It includes only holding
hands, embracing, and...

86
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:57,730
And what?

87
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,790
Kissing.

88
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:00,130
Kissing.

89
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,970
Well, I have marked
these in this contract.

90
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,610
Dear me! Mr. Zhang.

91
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,720
I sign my name directly, Party B, right?

92
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,910
[Party B: Yun Shu, July 20, 2019]

93
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,360
Mr. Zhang.

94
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,770
May I ask you a question?

95
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:16,910
Yes, please.

96
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,740
We don't have to

97
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,560
have a wedding, right?

98
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:22,690
No, we don't.

99
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,130
I don't think there is any necessity

100
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,270
for such a formalistic, extravagant,

101
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,970
and time-wasting ceremony.

102
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,420
What?

103
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,040
No wedding?

104
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,650
I don't agree.

105
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,820
There is no marriage
without a wedding ceremony!

106
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,790
Of course, it remains necessary.

107
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,290
The custom of wedding is

108
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:38,760
evolved from

109
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:41,150
the "Six Rites" in the Rites of Zhou.

110
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,280
With the wither-away
of feudal society's form,

111
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,010
such a time-wasting and

112
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,520
and money-sinking ritual

113
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,750
is in no need to be existent.

114
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:49,510
Professor Zhang,

115
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,970
please don't mix historical
dross with historical essence!

116
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,800
Wedding!

117
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,340
How remote this word

118
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,370
once sounded.

119
00:05:59,200 --> 00:05:59,960
Who knew

120
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,590
it'd actually come true

121
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,840
when I'm just 21?

122
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,000
Although it is not a real one.

123
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,480
But for me.

124
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,240
The pressure is really big.

125
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,170
Yun Shu.

126
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,970
Did you really make this

127
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,970
decision correctly?

128
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:18,760
Professor Zhang,

129
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,110
you want to use the method of
exhaustion to prove your point,

130
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,880
then you're going to lose.

131
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:27,120
You can look up statistics data

132
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,940
by 2019.

133
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:30,850
The people who think of weddings

134
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,340
as a necessary process of marriage take up

135
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:36,190
82.33 percent.

136
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,290
Mr. Zhang.

137
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,190
They are willing to hold the wedding.

138
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:40,750
I respect their ideas.

139
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,090
But that doesn't mean

140
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:45,950
that I am obliged to hold the wedding.

141
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,150
It makes no sense to argue.

142
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,940
Let's hear

143
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,620
Yun Shu's opinion.

144
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,720
Well.

145
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,000
Yun Shu.

146
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,760
You judge.

147
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,350
Who is right, my grandfather or me?

148
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,790
In this view.

149
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:08,620
I agree with Si Nian's opinion.

150
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,550
Actually,

151
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,600
when I was young, I had
the same idea as you,

152
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,250
thinking that weddings were just a farce.

153
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,770
We didn't hold the wedding

154
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,810
but then I felt there
must be something wrong.

155
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,210
We couldn't find the
feeling of getting married.

156
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,310
Even our colleagues around us felt

157
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,200
we didn't seem like a couple at all.

158
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,920
When we realized that

159
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,850
at the beginning

160
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,820
we should have held a wedding,

161
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,210
we have grown old.

162
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:54,990
Yun Shu, Si Nian, whether you will
hold a wedding ceremony

163
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,960
is up to you.

164
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,390
I don't want to force you.

165
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:01,540
My final question is,

166
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:04,540
if you don't hold the wedding,

167
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,160
how will you prove to others

168
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,520
and yourselves that

169
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,520
you really got married?

170
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,970
Just do as you say.

171
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,090
Mr. Zhang.

172
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,240
Don't we agree not to hold the wedding?

173
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,169
Why do you change your mind?

174
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,210
I've just reevaluated.

175
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:35,030
No wedding

176
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,020
means that we need to pay more money.

177
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:38,940
What does that mean?

178
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,820
If we refuse to hold the wedding blindly.

179
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:42,140
Our grandfather will doubt

180
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,309
the authenticity of our marital relations.

181
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,410
The purpose of making a contract is

182
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,160
to enable him to believe.

183
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,410
That is why it will be the
best choice to hold a wedding.

184
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:49,890
But...

185
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:50,510
That's all.

186
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,470
Let us do some preparatory work.

187
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,210
You'll go to choose a wedding company

188
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,740
and then make the wedding program.

189
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,990
I will make a list of
the guests to be invited.

190
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,030
We will only invite

191
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,310
those who are closest to us

192
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,040
and make our wedding
as small scale as possible.

193
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,290
Hold on, Mr. Zhang.

194
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:04,690
I…

195
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:04,980
Well.

196
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,160
All the wedding costs

197
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,410
will be borne by me,

198
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,310
including formal dress,
wedding dress and wedding ring.

199
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,460
By the way, what are your clothing size

200
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,460
and BWH?

201
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,420
I... Well...

202
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,210
Go back and measure it.

203
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,740
Tell me exact measured values.

204
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:20,470
By the way, have you decided on the
groomsman and bridesmaid for the wedding?

205
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,200
I've chosen the groomsman.

206
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,240
Is your sister going to be the bridesmaid?

207
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:25,820
But...

208
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,570
If nothing unexpected happens,

209
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,840
the wedding can be held next weekend.

210
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,640
However, do you think
that we are too anxious?

211
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,440
I am still thinking of
how to tell my sister

212
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:35,990
about our marriage.

213
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,870
As we've come so far,

214
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:44,950
let's figure out ways as soon as possible.

215
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:57,200
Marriage? Have you thought
about it carefully?

216
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,330
How long have you been staying
together before you want to get married?

217
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,740
Don't you think it's too fast?

218
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:02,710
Zhang Si Nian...

219
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,830
Zhang Si Nian.

220
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,610
Sister, don't you think he's quite good.

221
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,460
He is handsome.

222
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,410
He is kind and

223
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,030
has a good

224
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,370
educational background.

225
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:11,430
So if I married him,

226
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,510
I would not lose anything.

227
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,470
Then...

228
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,470
Actually, our relation...

229
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,540
Sister, you always told me that

230
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,240
I should make my own decision

231
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:20,760
instead of being indecisive

232
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,190
and hesitant.

233
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,290
So you...

234
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,630
It has not been a long time since
we got acquainted with each other,

235
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,320
but I am serious with our relationship.

236
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,120
So it will be better to get
married earlier than later.

237
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:36,920
So you're sure about it?

238
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:39,040
I'm sure.

239
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:41,790
Sister, I know that you care about me.

240
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,670
It's not because of that.

241
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,510
It's because you're a grown-up now.

242
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,890
I have no right to interfere in your
decision and don't want to worry about you.

243
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:50,190
Now that you have thought it over.

244
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,900
Just go ahead.

245
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:54,340
It's rare that you are
so certain about something.

246
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:58,840
I…

247
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,070
Is there anything else?

248
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:03,910
That bridesmaid...

249
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,970
Must be me.

250
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,600
Sister.

251
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,570
Thank you.

252
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:10,980
In tens of thousands of people,

253
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,700
meet whom you are destined to meet.

254
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,340
Through thousands of years,

255
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,870
with the boundlessness of time,

256
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,220
neither a moment earlier
nor a moment later.

257
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:23,770
Mr. Zhang, you are back.

258
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,690
I've already chosen the groomsman.

259
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:29,070
How are things over there?

260
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,990
I was just going to discuss it with you.

261
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,890
There are Dream Wedding,

262
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,560
Dreamy Wedding, and Good Day Wedding.

263
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:40,230
How do you choose the wedding company?

264
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,970
Too many.

265
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,640
Just make a choice.

266
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,890
I know it's my fault.

267
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,740
July 24, 2019,

268
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,300
2:31 p.m.

269
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,840
Party A violated the contract

270
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:06,160
for overly intimate
behaviour toward Party B,

271
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,840
or for any reason.

272
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:08,510
Thus,

273
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,340
Party A paid liquidated damages
of one hundred yuan to Party B.

274
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,390
Mr. Zhang, what are you doing?

275
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,260
I made an addition to the contract.

276
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,930
For breach of contract.

277
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,140
Just do so.

278
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,590
As for the previous liquidated damages.

279
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:26,910
You will receive.

280
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,350
Do you have to be so serious?

281
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,830
All details included in the contract

282
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,690
must be treated carefully.

283
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,510
Then, Mr. Zhang, what
about the wedding company?

284
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,800
You make the decision.

285
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,650
Hello, is this Miss Yun?

286
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:22,990
I am...

287
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,940
You want to ask for
wedding planning, right?

288
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:25,610
Yes.

289
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,590
Here we chat.

290
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,560
Well.

291
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:30,510
Miss Yun.

292
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,490
What kind of wedding do you have in mind?

293
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,050
The wedding in my mind?

294
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,990
To tell the truth, I
haven't thought about it.

295
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,020
It's okay.

296
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,040
We have many options
here for you to choose from.

297
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:41,560
For example, seaside church wedding,

298
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:43,070
Chinese wedding, Japanese wedding.

299
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,860
Martial arts wedding
and fairytale wedding.

300
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:47,050
See which one speaks to you.

301
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,180
Well.

302
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,720
Dad, do you know what the White House is?

303
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,070
That's a church.

304
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,560
Yun Shu will grow up

305
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:16,080
and will marry inside.

306
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:19,170
Great, I would like
to marry in the church.

307
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,080
You really have a good eye.

308
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:25,670
This is the

309
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,240
most romantic and
gorgeous seaside wedding.

310
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:28,260
Do you like it?

311
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:28,790
Well.

312
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,790
Wait for a moment.

313
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,720
Let me make a call.

314
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,690
Okay.

315
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:47,840
Hello, may I help you?

316
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:51,620
Mr. Zhang, now I am at
Wedding Planning company.

317
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,090
There are different wedding programs

318
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,640
including seaside church wedding,

319
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,040
Chinese wedding,

320
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,940
and Japanese wedding.

321
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,770
You make the decision.

322
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:07,610
Well, it's up to you to decide, I think.

323
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,000
After all, you will pay for it.

324
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:12,790
Don't worry about that, it's up to you.

325
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,260
But...

326
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:13,460
I…

327
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,490
I'll hang up.

328
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:25,690
Well? Have you decided?

329
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,620
How about seaside wedding?

330
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:30,640
Seaside wedding? Forget about it.

331
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:34,250
I want to choose a simple one.

332
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:35,970
Okay, think it over again.

333
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,420
Yun Shu.

334
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,520
Mr. Zhang.

335
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:55,490
I've modified the agreement.

336
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,460
Well receive it.

337
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:57,930
Alright.

338
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,420
Well.

339
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,720
This is the wedding company's
wedding procedure manual.

340
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,290
There will be a rehearsal tomorrow.
Would you like to take a look first?

341
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,090
No, I've remembered.

342
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,910
I’ve just informed the
groomsman of the time.

343
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,830
Remember to give a call to your sister.

344
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,650
Okay, I'll make a call.

345
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,760
Okay.

346
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,060
What's the matter?

347
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:31,910
Hello, sister, I have something to tell you.

348
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,970
I am busy now, let's talk later.

349
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:36,390
Sister, wait, in a few words.

350
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,010
After two o'clock, tomorrow afternoon

351
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,810
our wedding rehearsal will begin.

352
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:43,020
You are the bridesmaid. Please come.

353
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,640
Look at this one.

354
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,420
I have meetings all day
tomorrow. I won't have time.

355
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:48,820
Sister, I beg you.

356
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,960
It's really very important.

357
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:53,560
Besides, only when all of us are
familiar with the wedding process

358
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:55,590
will our wedding be perfect.

359
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,240
Perfect.

360
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,580
You always take things as they are,

361
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,310
why do you suddenly seek perfection?

362
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,089
Sister, anyhow, this is my wedding.

363
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,730
Even if I'm contented,

364
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:07,670
I will seek perfection for my wedding.

365
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,109
That's all.

366
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,040
Okay.

367
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:14,910
Okay, I will come tomorrow.

368
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,040
Okay, bye, sister, love you.

369
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,440
Help me to select the best package.

370
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:23,700
Okay, okay.

371
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,740
Why not drink some milk today?

372
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,990
I forgot to buy the milk yesterday,

373
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,660
so there is only one cup here.

374
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,520
No problem, Mr. Zhang, you drink.

375
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,510
Breakfast is the time for protein intake,

376
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,620
which is very important for energy.

377
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:06,520
Drink it up.

378
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,570
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

379
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:11,690
Mr. Zhang, I'm sorry.

380
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,390
I didn't mean to do it.

381
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,340
Let me get a napkin.

382
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,620
It doesn't matter, let me wipe it away.

383
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,160
Mr. Zhang.

384
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,570
You scratch my hand.

385
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,470
I see.

386
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:33,570
Sorry.

387
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:34,600
It's my fault.

388
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,540
Alright.

389
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,040
You didn't do it deliberately.

390
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,300
I don't mind.

391
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,180
Besides,

392
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,870
I have something else 
to discuss with you.

393
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:46,830
During this year,

394
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,540
everyday

395
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,710
I'll spend two hours at least

396
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,020
tutoring you homework.

397
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,190
In this case, I can make sure that

398
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,990
you can pass thesis defence one-time.

399
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:56,670
Two hours?

400
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:57,810
Not enough?

401
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,460
I can add another hour.

402
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:00,480
No, thanks, Mr. Zhang.

403
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:03,410
Actually, you don't need
to waste time on me.

404
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,380
Don't worry,

405
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:05,780
I'll coach you myself.

406
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:07,290
It won't be a waste of time.

407
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,380
Wondered what to do?

408
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:12,210
I'm going to work.

409
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,490
See you at rehearsal this afternoon.

410
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:37,580
Hello, sis.

411
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,060
Yun Shu, I've arrived.

412
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,250
Where are you?

413
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:42,290
Where are you?

414
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,770
What?

415
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:44,790
Don't you let me come at 2 o'clock?

416
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,710
To rehearse with you?

417
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,660
I'm already here.

418
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,790
Where are you?

419
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,240
It's two o'clock now.

420
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,670
I thought it's one o'clock.

421
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,410
Stop stalling and come now.

422
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,420
OK, I'll be right there.

423
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,380
Wait!

424
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,680
The wedding company let me remind you

425
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:01,090
to bring the flow chart.

426
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:03,920
OK, I'll be right there, sis.

427
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:05,920
Goodbye.

428
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,940
She should be here soon.

429
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,170
Yun Shu.

430
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:35,720
Mr. Zhang.

431
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:37,980
Sister.

432
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:41,550
Sorry, I'm not late, am I?

433
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,440
Very punctual, five
minutes and forty seconds.

434
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:49,570
You two need to get used
to each other from now on.

435
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:52,120
Is everybody here?

436
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,190
The groomsman hasn't arrived.
You go in first.

437
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,420
I'll just wait for him.

438
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,990
Not bad, I'm not the last one.

439
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,130
Let's go.

440
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:27,920
Nian Nian.

441
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,370
Happy wedding!

442
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,660
What are you wearing?

443
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,920
What happened to the clothes I gave you?

444
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,660
Your clothes are boring.

445
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,580
This is my original costume

446
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,310
for the

447
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,390
Transfiguration of the
Prince of the Royal Wedding.

448
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,260
The auction price is
up to millions of yuan.

449
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,490
Are you going to give a concert?

450
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,320
No one wears these designs for concerts.

451
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,460
Don't worry.

452
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:52,130
Today,

453
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,960
I am sure to adjust my position.

454
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:55,620
You are the leading role.

455
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,650
The environment here is not bad.

456
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,620
Nian Nian, where is the bride?

457
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:07,820
Sister.

458
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,870
It's Lu Yu! The living Lu Yu!

459
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:11,060
Who is Lu Yu?

460
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:12,410
Didn't you know Lu Yu?

461
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,070
He is a popular actor.

462
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:16,340
Very handsome!

463
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:21,390
[A city abroad]

464
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:41,320
Couldn’t he be the groomsman?

465
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,760
I'm so happy to see the real person.

466
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,650
Yun... Yun Shu.

467
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,490
I... I just need to refine the make-up.

468
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,490
OK, come back quickly.

469
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,480
Okay.

470
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,600
Let's go.

471
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,550
Let me introduce.

472
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,850
This is Yun Shu

473
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,990
who will marry me.

474
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,260
This is Lu Yu.

475
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,640
My childhood friend and the groomsman.

476
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,910
Hi, sis.

477
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,730
Hi, Mr. Lang.
(*Lang shares same pronunciation with wolf)

478
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,740
Sorry!

479
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,470
Hi, Mr. Lu.

480
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,010
You are so clever, sis.

481
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,540
You know my essence at a glance.

482
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,720
A lonely wolf.

483
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,760
You are more interesting

484
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:35,840
than on TV.

485
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,660
Do you know?

486
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,190
You are the dream lover
of our dormitory manager.

487
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:40,960
Dormitory manager?

488
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:42,120
Dream lover?

489
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:44,560
I didn't mean it.

490
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:45,460
I mean...

491
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,790
Well, don't talk if you
can't say good things.

492
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,440
Where is your sis?

493
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:50,840
She went to the dressing
room for a touch-up.

494
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,600
The wedding rehearsal will begin soon.

495
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:54,960
I'll go get her right now.

496
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:00,370
Nian Nian, you have a good taste.

497
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,370
A pure girl.

498
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,070
She is really interesting.

499
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,300
She has a sister.

500
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:10,670
Sister.

501
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,320
Why is he the groomsman?

502
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:17,510
It's too awkward.

503
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,320
What shall I say to him when I see him?

504
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,320
Calm down.

505
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:24,120
Calm down.

506
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,550
Everything has a solution.

507
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:31,990
Sister.

508
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:36,770
What's wrong with you?

509
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:38,170
I'm okay.

510
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,280
No, I have something else. I'm in a hurry.

511
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:42,010
I have to go.

512
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:42,890
Oh, hell no!

513
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,290
The wedding rehearsal hasn't begun.

514
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:45,270
Give me the flow chart.

515
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,420
I'll check it at home.

516
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:47,780
Quick.

517
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,240
What's the hurry?

518
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:55,260
Look it over when you are back.

519
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:57,410
By the way, I have bought
a wedding gift for you.

520
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,410
Come to my home in a few days.

521
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,380
Well.

522
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,630
This is first time I'm seeing
my sister panic like this.

523
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,470
What the hell is going on?

524
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,010
When will the rehearsal start?

525
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,420
I have waited for half a day.

526
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,360
Let's begin.

527
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:20,160
No.

528
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,920
How can we start when
the bride is absent?

529
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,510
You!

530
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,290
You play dual roles, can you?

531
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:29,300
Me?

532
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:30,290
Yes, yes.

533
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,770
My newly-weds are late.

534
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:34,320
You appease your newly-weds first.

535
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:36,320
I don't know either.

536
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:38,200
Let's begin.

537
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,070
Well.

538
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:41,100
How about the bride.

539
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,260
Me.

540
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,570
You...

541
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:53,170
Why do you look so familiar?

542
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:58,370
It's true that

543
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:01,300
I've been married many times.

544
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:03,740
Let's begin.

545
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:04,820
I can't wait!

546
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,870
Quick.

547
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:07,070
Well...

548
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,740
We have seven intimate contacts today.

549
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,210
This is 700 Yuan.

550
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,510
No, thanks. Mr. Zhang.

551
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,620
The contract is very clear about this.

552
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,680
I can't take your money anymore.

553
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:27,410
If you default,

554
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,110
I'll come to you for money.

555
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,080
We live under the same roof every day.

556
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:32,770
I'm so careless.

557
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:34,440
I'll be punished many times by you.

558
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:37,010
The agreement is to
constraint each other.

559
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,740
We can't let conventional thinking

560
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,420
affect the big plan.

561
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,490
I know all these things.

562
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,460
But,

563
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,240
after we signed this agreement,

564
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:47,210
I started to think everyday.

565
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,560
How should I avoid to touch you?

566
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,540
I'm so foolish.

567
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:53,040
Unlike you who have a high-powered CPU

568
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:54,370
in your brain.

569
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:56,560
Afterwards, what should I
do if I give the show away

570
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:58,100
before grandpa?

571
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,920
It sounds

572
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,250
reasonable.

573
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:07,370
If we keep our distance all the time,

574
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,790
we are likely to show our slip.

575
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,520
It's not good for our big plan.

576
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:12,600
Yeah.

577
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,270
Then.

578
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,470
Well,

579
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,990
I'll change the contract again.

580
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:18,490
The restrictions on
normal physical contact

581
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,770
in daily life

582
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:20,910
will be removed.

583
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,790
Well, that's a relief.

584
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,150
So in this case,

585
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,240
we might as well pretend truly

586
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,640
before the grandfather at the wedding.

587
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,400
The wedding kiss remains.

588
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,540
Mr. Zhang, that's hypercorrection.

589
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:39,860
I've got another solution.

590
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,190
It won't be a real kiss.

591
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,580
Hi, Mr. Liu.

592
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,220
I have revised the contract.

593
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,720
Item 8, Article 10.

594
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,600
Please wait a moment.

595
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,500
[Zhang Si Nian and Yun Shu's
Contractual Marriage Agreement]

596
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:32,870
Mr. Liu,

597
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,600
I'll call you back later.

598
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,580
[Party A: Zhang Si Nian,
Party B: Yun Shu]

599
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,960
At the wedding party.

600
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:47,190
The audience is under the stage.

601
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,870
We two are on the stage.

602
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:51,140
We are parallel with the audience.

603
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,970
We just need to show
the profile to the audience.

604
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,610
So we just need to find

605
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,510
the specific post and angle,

606
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,450
close to each other
and use stereo disparity.

607
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,710
We can keep clear of each other and

608
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,390
let the audience and grandpa

609
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:07,190
see we are kissing

610
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:10,070
just like hand shadow play.

611
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:11,090
Understand?

612
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,270
I'm not sure.

613
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,170
Why don't you teach me?

614
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,140
It's okay.

615
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,810
Let's walk through the process first.

616
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:24,840
Then I'll tell you.

617
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:26,900
Let's go.

618
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:41,270
We'll start from here.

619
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:43,430
When the wedding march begins,

620
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,020
we'll step onto the red carpet.

621
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:50,440
We need to stand two
meters behind the flower door.

622
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:51,770
Then,

623
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,820
we hold hands...

624
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:05,770
Move left foot first,

625
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:11,100
then walk to the main stage.

626
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:13,980
Remember,

627
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,820
don't walk too quickly

628
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,620
or too slowly.

629
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,820
30 seconds is OK.

630
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:36,970
OK, stop.

631
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,290
Then, Bride and groom
walk into the main stage.

632
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,430
There are steps in front you.

633
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,920
Remember, left foot first.

634
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:44,350
Ready.

635
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:46,650
One.

636
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,880
Two.

637
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,500
You turn right. I turn left.

638
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:53,140
We'll stand face to face.

639
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,110
Just a little slower.

640
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:03,250
Next,

641
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:05,860
we need to hold hands.

642
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:21,470
Then...

643
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:26,520
Then... then, somebody will ask,

644
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,700
Mr. Zhang Si Nian.

645
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,030
Do you take Yun Shu as
your lawful wedded wife?

646
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,670
For better, for worse.

647
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,840
For better, for worse.

648
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:38,810
In sickness

649
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,460
and in health.

650
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,340
And in health.

651
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:41,970
I do faithfully cherish him.

652
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:43,480
Faithfully

653
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:45,940
-cherish him,
-Protect him.

654
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,190
until death do you part?

655
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:52,960
I'll say

656
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,220
I will.

657
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,170
Miss Yun Shu.

658
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,810
Do you take Zhang Si Nian

659
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,860
for your lawful wedded husband?

660
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:04,490
For richer,

661
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,440
and for poorer.

662
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,470
In sickness

663
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,020
and in health

664
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,770
to love him as before?

665
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:19,620
I will.

666
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,840
Then, we will exchange rings.

667
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,350
Hold out your right hand.

668
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,420
Your turn.

669
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:17,240
♫ Turning off the lights
in search of its trace ♫

670
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,110
Good job!

671
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,090
And finally,

672
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:20,050
a kiss.

673
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:21,470
a kiss.

674
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,170
By my calculations,

675
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:25,330
grandfather will sit there.

676
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:25,750
grandfather will sit there.

677
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:26,300
We just need to stand here

678
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,360
We just need to stand here

679
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:29,310
and approach each other
at a 30-degree angle.

680
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,570
Stop when the distance is 5cm.

681
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:31,930

I shouldn't give the money to you.

But, sis.

Don't worry

764
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,690
I will find our cousin

765
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:37,010
to make up for the mistake.

766
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,190
You made so many mistakes.

767
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:40,020
Tell me how to make up?

768
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,540
You are so careless about the house.

He didn't cheat you.
Then I'm the one who cheated you?

I'm your sis.

782
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:02,810
Who is he?

783
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,290
He's using this house as bait

784
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,610
to make you sign the contract.

785
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,360
But, I don't think

786
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,590
he's that kind of person.

787
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,960
Actually, he is kind.

788

Don't you think so?

789

That was before, because

I thought you two are real lovers.

Anyway,

792
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:23,390
don't worry about the house.

793
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:24,520
I'll deal with it.

794
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,410
Don't mention the wedding anymore.

795
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,140
You have to tell Zhang Si Nian.

796
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,210
Call off the wedding.

797

800

dress up a little formally
