00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,380
Okay.

177
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:03,610
Then I'll go first.

178
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:52,690
Is it very hot?

179
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,410
You sweat a lot.

180
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,630
I’m... I'm a little nervous.

181
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:02,890
Why are you nervous before we start?

182
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:04,500
Let's start.

183
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:05,770
Mr. Zhang.

184
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,460
What on earth are you doing?

185
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,720
About

186
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,690
the kiss at the wedding today.

187
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:15,220
I've thought about it for a long time.

188
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:17,910
I think I should reward you.

189
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,250
After all, I don't like
to owe others much.

190
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,520
Reward?

191
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:27,000
How are you going to reward me, Mr. Zhang?

192
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,300
Just relax.

193
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:31,450
In this case,

194
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,930
you'll do better later.

195
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,180
It may take a little longer.

196
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,570
You lean it on your waist.

197
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:03,800
On... On the waist?

198
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,380
You’ll be more comfortable
when you do it later.

199
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,470
Let's start.

200
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,440
Mr. Zhang,

201
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,730
Mr. Zhang,

202
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,170
I'm... I'm not ready yet.

203
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,420
You’ll never be ready if you don't do it.

204
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,840
I’ve already said it just now.

205
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,900
You’ll never know if

206
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:40,190
you’re ready for it unless you start
to do it.

207
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,720
I carefully selected this

208
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,120
elementary exercise for you.

209
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,350
Finish it in an hour and a half.

210
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:46,440
So I can figure out

211
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:47,780
the situation of your
professional courses.

212
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,610
Then make a tutorial plan for you

213
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,360
according to your situation.

214
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:52,710
I believe that

215
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,010
your grades will definitely be
among the best in the next year.

216
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:55,990
I thought...

217
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:57,930
What did you think of?

218
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,120
Nothing.

219
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,010
Pretty good.

220
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:06,590
OK.

221
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,250
Get ready.

222
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,340
Let’s start.

223
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,840
Mr. Zhang,

224
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,970
I'm tired today.

225
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,570
We are all tired.

226
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,570
You still have eighty-nine minutes.

227
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,680
Come on!

228
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,160
Childish!

229
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,300
Lady, you succeeded
in catching my attention.

230
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:31,290
Let’s call it a day.

231
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:32,290
Go to bed early.

232
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,640
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

233
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,700
Good night.

234
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,360
Good night.

235
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:10,900
♫ Turning off the lights
in search of its trace ♫

236
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:17,089
♫ I walk steadily
on the path beneath my feet ♫

237
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:23,369
♫ I hear someone asking,
are you still here? ♫

238
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:29,330
♫ The kind person replies,
I've always been here ♫

239
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,850
♫ This love cuts through the crowd
in search of me ♫

240
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,980
♫ It isn't easy ♫

241
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:38,940
♫ I only wish to cherish it with you ♫

242
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:41,010
♫ Each and every moment ♫

243
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,480
♫ If I missed out, I will meet you again
in another lifetime ♫

244
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,840
I can't believe this is my wedding night.

245
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,330
I can't believe this is my wedding night.

246
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:48,890
I can't believe this is my wedding night.

247
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,720
I worked on the test paper all night!

248
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:53,710
Maybe God wants to tell me that.

249
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,400
I’ve changed from a graduate

250
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,520
to a man’s wife.

251
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,090
My life

252
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,780
has entered a new stage.

253
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:04,520
And maybe I’ll also face
some new life exam questions.

254
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:13,680
[Writing like crazy]

255
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:46,110
Mr. Zhang, why don't you go first?

256
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,490
No, you first.

257
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:50,260
But it's not time yet.

258
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,950
And I didn't apply today.

259
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,490
There’s no need to strictly
follow the schedule in the future.

260
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,720
You go first.

261
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,090
Alright.

262
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:02,870
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

263
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:08,140
Why did he let me use
the bathroom first today?

264
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:28,890
Oh, that's right.

265
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:30,810
The ring!

266
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,860
The wedding ring!

267
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:34,050
I'm married to Mr. Zhang.

268
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,020
I can't believe I forgot this.

269
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,410
Today's the first day after my wedding.

270
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,470
I'm married.

271
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,570
Please remember the password 
20190720.

272
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,290
I'm married.

273
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:04,020
Mr. Zhang,

274
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:06,890
why did you change the home password?

275
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,420
With my knowledge of your memory,

276
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:13,100
you shouldn't remember
these numbers wrong again.

277
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,400
Don't worry, I’ll keep it in mind.

278
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,500
It's our wedding date.

279
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,200
That's good.

280
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,320
Yun Shu,

281
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,430
do you have any other plans today?

282
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,020
No!

283
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,110
Dress yourself up. We're going shopping.

284
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,050
Although it’s a contractual relationship,

285
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,580
Yun Shu doesn't delay

286
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,620
and becomes a love and career bumper.

287
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,700
Good!

288
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,210
What’s the matter? You're jealous.

289
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,970
I'm jealous? I'm not jealous.

290
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,050
Anyway, I'm almost there.

291
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,400
Almost there?

292
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,540
What do you mean?

293
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,650
Feng Qi and I!

294
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,010
It's basically settled.

295
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:01,750
Come on. Come on.

296
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,430
You two... In such a short term?

297
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,510
Of course it's true love.

298
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:06,780
I told him yesterday that

299
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,130
as long as he proposes to me,

300
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,230
I’d marry him.

301
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:10,590
Then what did he say?

302
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:12,870
Of course he said "okay".

303
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,760
Okay?

304
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,270
Just okay?

305
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,170
What do you mean "just okay?"

306
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:20,580
"Okay" means okay.
It means he agreed.

307
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,580
I'm thinking

308
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,000
if he’s planning

309
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:25,540
to propose to me now.

310
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:26,860
Not really.

311
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,850
A man who answered such a question

312
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,690
with merely "okay"...

313
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:32,290
No, it's not what you think.

314
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,430
Do you think everyone
is as incompetent as you?

315
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,960
Feng Qi is head over heels

316
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:37,510
for me.

317
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,890
See? He misses me all the time.

318
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,060
He sends messages to me all the time.

319
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,460
Do you want to hear it?

320
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:46,800
No, I’ll be "jealous".

321
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:49,860
Jealous? I’ll let you feel it really.

322
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,620
Yi Yi, I think our relationship
has developed too fast.

323
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:57,860
We'd better be friends.

324
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:02,280
Gao Zhi Yi, I told you that
you were being self-righteous

325
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:03,840
and being embarrassed.

326
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:06,260
You're overthinking.

327
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:12,390
Yi Yi.

328
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,120
Leave me alone.

329
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,080
Come on.

330
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,420
Yi Yi, don't be sad.

331
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,220
Feng Qi isn't good for you.

332
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,900
Mr. Zhang,

333
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,070
what exactly do you

334
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,180
want me to do here today?

335
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,320
Although we are in a
contractual relationship,

336
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:34,290
you're still my wife

337
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,370
to outsiders.

338
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:37,400
So I hope when we go out

339
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:39,170
or when we visit
grandpa or our families,

340
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,240
you can present yourself

341
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:41,770
in a way that's more compatible with me.

342
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,200
A moment please.

343
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,790
Hello,

344
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,670
I want to ask if there's
a bookstore ahead.

345
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:05,750
Mr. Zhang,

346
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,000
in fact, I appreciate your kindness.

347
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:10,580
You really don't have to
spend so much money for me.

348
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,950
It's my duty.

349
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,890
Let's go. It's just ahead.

350
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,850
Mr. Zhang,

351
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:25,980
so you brought me here today

352
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,040
to buy books?

353
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,280
Then what do you think you want to buy?

354
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,720
Nothing. It's fine.

355
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,340
I've read the test paper
you finished yesterday.

356
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:43,140
You're found deficient in basic knowledge.

357
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,800
And tutoring needs to be
carried out systematically.

358
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:48,280
I made a book list for you.

359
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:50,380
Just find out all the books.

360
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:01,600
Statistics by editor-in-chief
Zhang Yi Hua.

361
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,570
Statistics.

362
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:06,080
Zhang Yi Hua.

363
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:09,010
I found it.

364
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,490
Applied Linear Analysis.

365
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,180
Theory of Probability
and Mathematical Statistics.

366
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:16,120
Statistics: From Statistics to Conclusion.

367
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,360
Found it.

368
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:25,830
Next.

369
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:27,560
Functions of Complex Variables.

370
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:29,210
Experimental Guidance
of Statistical Principles.

371
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,780
Management Statistics.

372
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,100
Found it.

373
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:34,330
Next tier.

374
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:38,220
From today on,

375
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,130
you should learn to read more efficiently.

376
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,010
Because this is just
your book list for a week.

377
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:43,730
One week?

378
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,370
By the way, there's another one.

379
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,140
High-order Statistics Method

380
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,530
of Independent Analysis of Components.

381
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:51,080
It's over there. I just saw it.

382
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:54,160
Where is the book, Mr. Zhang?

383
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,600
I see it.

384
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:47,730
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

385
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:05,650
Are you hungry?

386
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:07,750
Not me.

387
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,150
There's no one else here.

388
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:15,100
Really not me!

389
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,720
Let's eat something.

390
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,370
Good afternoon! What
would you like to order?

391
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,020
Are you dissatisfied with the food here?

392
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:52,730
No! No!

393
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:54,810
Then you want to eat something else?

394
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:01,140
I... I want fried chicken.

395
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:03,280
Sorry, we don't offer fried chicken.

396
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:08,600
OK, then I'll order something else.

397
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:11,890
Is there any fresh chicken in the shop?

398
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,390
Yeah.

399
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,230
Do you have linseed oil or olive oil?

400
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:16,290
Yeah.

401
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,250
You have eggs, flour and bread crumbs

402
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:19,990
and all kinds of spices, right?

403
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:20,780
You have all the things I said.

404
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,460
Then there should be no
difficulty in making a fried chicken.

405
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:24,430
The oil temperature should
be kept at 180 degrees.

406
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,170
The error should not exceed three degrees.

407
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,950
Only then will it have a nice texture.

408
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:30,000
I'm sorry, sir. Restaurant policy.

409
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:31,350
We can only cook what's on the menu.

410
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,000
Mr. Zhang.

411
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:37,650
I remember you.

412
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,220
You’re from Zheng Ben University, right?

413
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,520
In Mr. Zhang's class last time,

414
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:41,920
you sat in front of me.

415
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,510
Sister, you do have a good memory.

416
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,700
I major in Economics.

417
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,770
This is my senior year.

418
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,680
I often go to Mr. Zhang's class secretly.

419
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,050
I'll deal with it.
You go on with other things.

420
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:51,840
Mr. Zhang,

421
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:53,490
what would you like to eat today?

422
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,050
A seafood salad with vinegar dressing

423
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,730
and a fried chicken

424
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,760
with canola oil.

425
00:27:58,870 --> 00:27:59,780
Fried chicken?

426
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:07,600
Who told you to add
dishes without permission?

427
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:10,290
The rhythm of the kitchen
is all messed up by you.

428
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,490
The dishes they requested
weren't complicated.

429
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:13,450
So I...

430
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:15,150
Can you do that as long as
it's not complicated to make?

431
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,060
I just...

432
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:17,960
Sorry, manager.

433
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:19,870
Please don't say that about her.

434
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,680
We made her do it.

435
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:23,580
So please stop blaming her.

436
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,050
Guest.

437
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,630
We have met all your requirements.

438
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:30,250
Please stop interfering with

439
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,760
my discipline of my employees.

440
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,900
Then you can't personally attack her.

441
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:35,340
Because she's useless

442
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:36,660
and ruins business.

443
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,300
On what background can you say that?

444
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:41,830
If all of your employees were like her,

445
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:43,330
your restaurant would be better off.

446
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,510
What makes you say that?

447
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,380
Because the other
employees in your restaurant

448
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,640
look unhappy.

449
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:48,530
She's the only one

450
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,970
who deals with the guests with a smile.

451
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:52,390
Smile can make more profits?

452
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,350
Why are you all so naive?

453
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,140
You.

454
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:56,330
This is really not naive.

455
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:00,940
I'm sure you don't know

456
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,930
the variable relationship between the
index model of customer satisfaction

457
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:05,350
and beverage profits.

458
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:08,430
The catering industry
belongs to the service industry.

459
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,210
Customer satisfaction
is the primary productivity.

460
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,950
Instead of blindly rejecting
the guest's request,

461
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:16,030
it's better to adapt to
meet the needs of guests.

462
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,240
I suggest you study

463
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:19,500
index models carefully.

464
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:20,730
If you can't understand,

465
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,150
you can ask her for advice directly.

466
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:23,520
And she'll give you all the answers.

467
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:23,930
Come on.

468
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:24,850
Besides,

469
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:25,670
have you noticed

470
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,020
the man by the window?

471
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:30,060
He's a Michelin star inspector.

472
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,550
Don't you want your restaurant

473
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,050
to be on the Michelin Restaurant Guide?

474
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:44,210
Mr. Zhang, I have a question for you.

475
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,900
How did you know the
one by the window just now

476
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,890
was a Michelin star inspector?

477
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:51,100
I really didn't know.

478
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,780
Then you lied?

479
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:56,150
A white lie is not a lie.

480
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:57,880
That's what you said.

481
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,370
Mr. Zhang, don't worry.

482
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,640
I'll definitely finish reading
these books when I go back.

483
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:22,610
And

484
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,430
I certainly won't let you down.

485
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:27,510
I'll do my best in my senior year
to graduate.

486
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:29,450
What about after that?

487
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:34,540
Mr. Zhang,

488
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:36,930
do you also feel that

489
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,350
I'm a useless person?

490
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:46,260
Why do you think about yourself like that?

491
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:48,930
Does it matter what I think?

492
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,420
Anyway, everyone
thinks I'm fooling around.

493
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:52,650
At least in my opinion,

494
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,260
you aren't nothing

495
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,710
or a useless person either.

496
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:57,470
You just haven't found

497
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,660
your place yet.

498
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:03,990
Just like the theory of
"casual" you told me about.

499
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:06,450
You want to make
yourself at ease and happy.

500
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:07,910
This is indeed a choice

501
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,940
and a good idea.

502
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:10,640
But the reality

503
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,860
usually makes you feel
that it's counterproductive.

504
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:14,460
Oh?

505
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:15,430
Do not worry.

506
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,280
This year,

507
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:18,390
I'll try my best to help you.

508
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:19,980
Let's start with a degree certificate.

509
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:23,000
I believe that when the contract ends,

510
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:23,770
you're sure to find

511
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,320
your own life direction.

512
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:30,620
Let's go home.

513
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,260
Okay.

514
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,580
Yi Yi.

515
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:41,450
I just thought about it.

516
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:43,280
In fact, I think Zhang Si Nian

517
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:45,240
is a very nice person.

518
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:46,120
Think about it.

519
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:50,460
He is thoughtful and straightforward.

520
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,110
Handsome and rich.

521
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:58,170
With high IQ and EQ,

522
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,980
and quite responsible.

523
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:06,540
I see.

524
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:08,580
You know what?

525
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:10,510
I know what's wrong with you.

526
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,200
What's wrong with me?

527
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,360
Yun Shu,

528
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:17,280
you like Zhang Si Nian.

529
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:18,440
Nonsense.

530
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:20,650
How can I like Zhang Si Nian?

531
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:21,690
Question.

532
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:22,310
Answer.

533
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,590
Coffee or tea?

534
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:24,190
Coffee.

535
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,280
Latte or American coffee?

536
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:25,930
Latte.

537
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,050
Cold or hot?

538
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:27,540
Cold.

539
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:28,620
Red or blue?

540
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:29,260
Red.

541
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:29,880
Summer or winter?

542
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:30,290
Summer.

543
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:31,130
Chinese or Math?

544
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:31,450
Chinese.

545
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,340
Wu Yi Fan or Zhang Si Nian?

546
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:33,310
Zhang Si Nian.

547
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:52,820
Yun Shu.

548
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:55,910
Mr. Zhang, when did you come back?

549
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:58,050
It's been more than three
minutes since I came back.

550
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:01,140
Did you just

551
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:03,430
wipe your face with my clothes?

552
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,870
No, I was just checking

553
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,900
if the clothes are clean.

554
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,530
It turned out that it didn't
seem to be very clean.

555
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,139
So I'm going to wash it again.

556
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:11,110
Wait.

557
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:15,639
I have something

558
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:17,050
to talk to you about.

559
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:19,270
I'll take a shower first.

560
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:53,290
Mr. Zhang.

561
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,600
Yun Shu,

562
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:03,350
sit over here.

563
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:12,670
I bought you a financial product

564
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,210
with the gift money grandpa gave you.

565
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:20,420
And a supplementary agreement
was added to the contract.

566
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:22,270
Income from wealth management products

567
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:24,470
will be your monthly expenses.

568
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:26,280
If there's no problem,

569
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:27,400
just sign here.
