[Episode 18]

4
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,060
Is this love now?

5
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,760
Do I ask too much?

6
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,490
Or

7
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,720
is Mr. Zhang too reserved?

8
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,810
Will I be too unemotional?

9
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,440
Lu Yu also said

10
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,410
we can't deal with love

11
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,960
like we do business.

12
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,620
Yun Shu.

13
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:38,950
I was wondering

14
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,300
if we should add

15
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:41,160
a supplementary clause?

16
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,440
In the previous clauses,

17
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,790
the one that

18
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,760
"Falling in love with each
other shall not be allowed"

19
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,670
seems inappropriate for

20
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,050
our relationship now.

21
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,280
Then I'll revise it now.

22
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:54,490
Okay.

23
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,210
I was thinking,

24
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,330
since we are a couple,

25
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:07,850
and you like me

26
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:08,810
and I like you,

27
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,590
why don't we

28
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,630
cut all the

29
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,460
cumbersome procedures?

30
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,640
Do you agree?

31
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,460
How about

32
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,130
we sleep together tonight?

33
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:24,170
Mr. Zhang.

34
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,090
I...

35
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,060
I'm sorry.

36
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:27,380
You...

37
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,360
What did

38
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,650
you say?

39
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,880
I said

40
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,930
since we are a couple,

41
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:34,790
it's okay for us

42
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,760
to sleep together,

43
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,079
right?

44
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,440
No problem.

45
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:44,280
You can bring Wuqian

46
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,520
to sleep with us.

47
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:47,610
Then.

48
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:48,650
I...

49
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,770
I'll change the sheets.

50
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,620
How about.

51
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,080
Let's sleep.

52
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,200
Okay.

53
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,600
You...

54
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,250
What's your favourite position?

55
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,350
I mean

56
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,000
your sleeping position.

57
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,810
I prefer to sleep on my side.

58
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,280
Mr. Zhang.

59
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,930
What position

60
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,370
do you prefer?

61
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,260
I also like to

62
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,340
sleep on my side.

63
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,610
Mr. Zhang.

64
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,570
The quilt is gone!

65
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:33,840
Sorry.

66
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:36,330
How about.

67
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,090
Let's get closer.

68
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,760
So we can share the quilt.

69
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:50,890
Is this better?

70
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,910
Is it too superficial for us

71
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,680
to sleep like this?

72
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,920
How about

73
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:12,880
I'll sleep with you in my arms, okay?

74
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:27,850
Good night.

75
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,370
Good night.

76
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:43,920
Mr. Zhang.

77
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,520
Mr. Zhang.

78
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,850
Mr. Zhang.

79
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,390
I can't sleep

80
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,930
if you continue holding me like this.

81
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,720
Mr. Zhang.

82
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,159
You're up early.

83
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,260
Did you sleep well last night?

84
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,300
Yes.

85
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,260
You...

86
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,090
You don't look so good.

87
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,530
Maybe I can only sleep well in my bed.

88
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,960
Mr. Zhang.

89
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,810
Does the relationship

90
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,720
develop too fast?

91
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,110
How about.

92
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,450
Let's slow it down.

93
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,120
I'll look into it.

94
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:26,090
Okay.

95
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,600
Turns out

96
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:38,390
it was only a sleeping position.

97
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,169
We may as well sleep back to back.

98
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,090
At least I could get some sleep.

99
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,450
Miss Shen,

100
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,210
I’ve encountered a
difficult problem recently

101
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,800
and I want to ask you for advice.

102
00:08:58,930 --> 00:08:59,660
Tell me.

103
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,560
What can possibly

104
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:01,530
be troubling you?

105
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,000
Simply,

106
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,190
someone you like

107
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,280
suddenly tells you

108
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,280
that you have a fast-going

109
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:08,230
relationship.

110
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:09,500
What does this mean?

111
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,380
Does it mean

112
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,470
we're not suitable for each other

113
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,500
or

114
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:13,220
she wants to break up?

115
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:14,800
Most relationships

116
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:15,620
need

117
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,170
to develop step by step.

118
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:17,820
If any one step

119
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,080
were missing,

120
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:19,920
the relationship

121
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:21,200
would make the people involved

122
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:22,330
feel unsafe.

123
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,970
I'm still quite confused.

124
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:25,740
Then.

125
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,210
What on earth should I do?

126
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,620
For example, you should go to dinner

127
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:30,410
and watch movies

128
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,030
or date with each other.

129
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,900
You should spend

130
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,260
more time with each other.

131
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:34,720
Once you've spent some time together,

132
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:35,700
you'll know whether

133
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,410
you're suitable for each other.

134
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,170
I really ignored these aspects.

135
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:42,950
Yun Shu.

136
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,940
It's almost noon.

137
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:44,910
Just go for lunch.

138
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,590
You go first

139
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,780
I'll follow later.

140
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,200
Alright.

141
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:49,350
Then I won't wait for you.

142
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,320
Okay.

143
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,430
Lawyer Guan.

144
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,090
Come on, let's have lunch together.

145
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,120
You can draw

146
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:26,720
Mei.

147
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:27,880
Can I have a look?

148
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:32,970
I just

149
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,240
draw for fun.

150
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:35,530
Yun Shu,

151
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,010
do you keep a diary in comics?

152
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,850
My dad taught me this when I was a kid.

153
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,120
And I have the habit

154
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:43,400
when I grow up.

155
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,290
Nice.

156
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:49,030
You're as good as

157
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,410
many of our studio's

158
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,570
professional artists.

159
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,120
Mei.

160
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,360
Are you trying to poach her?

161
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,350
Lawyer Meng,

162
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,840
you reminded me.

163
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,440
Yun Shu,

164
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:01,420
are you interested

165
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,920
in becoming a professional artist?

166
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,040
It won't happen.

167
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,180
Yun Shu is our star.

168
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:07,210
All the more reason for me to poach her.

169
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,130
I'll have to think about

170
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,930
the terms under which

171
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:13,020
I'm willing to let Yun Shu go.

172
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:13,500
All right.

173
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,270
Please

174
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,120
stop making fun of me.

175
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,100
All right.

176
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,360
Don't joke.

177
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:20,430
Let's talk in the office.

178
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,400
Okay.

179
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,720
See you soon.

180
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:26,870

355
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:34,100
Hi.

356
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,590
Why is Mr. Zhang...

357
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,950
We came here

358
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,490
to tell you something.

359
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,200
It's

360
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,200
about cousin.

361
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,440
You found him?

362
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,560
Huo Qi.

363
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:45,530
Come in.

364
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:55,430
Yun Lan.

365
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,850
It's been a while!

366
00:23:58,820 --> 00:23:59,200
Sis.

367
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:00,710
How dare you come to see us?

368
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,360
I thought I'd never see you again

369
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:02,320
in my life.

370
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,330
I'm here

371
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,240
to admit my mistake.

372
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:13,250
Mei.

373
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:14,880
Take a break.

374
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,840
I'll handle this.

375
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,890
Did you make Yun Lan angry?

376
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,020
How could that be possible?

377
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:20,540
I just think you're too tired

378
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:21,520
and want you to have a rest.

379
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:22,730
Yu.

380
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,420
You're so good at coaxing girls.

381
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:29,090
You brought Yun Shu

382
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,010
to the usury's office?

383
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:34,890
No.

384
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:35,670
I have to call the police.

385
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,630
Yun Lan.

386
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,240
I was wrong.

387
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,000
I really was wrong.

388
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:43,120
I promise

389
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:43,980
it won't

390
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,260
happen again.

391
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,080
I promise.

392
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:48,170
You really don't know how
dangerous it was that day.

393
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:51,080
If my brother-in-law
hadn't paid debt for me,

394
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:52,130
I really don't know

395
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:52,920
what Mr. Tu would do to me.

396
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:53,890
Maybe...

397
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,130
I'm really scared.

398
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:57,890
I'll never dare to do that again.

399
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,000
Yun Lan.

400
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,570
I can only pay back

401
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,110
the money I owe you little by little.

402
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,030
This is the repayment plan

403
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,090
and guarantee I wrote.

404
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,120
I don't need it.

405
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:08,320
Men like you

406
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:09,970
never remember
unless you suffer a little.

407
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:10,720
Yun Lan, let me explain.

408
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:12,360
Can you give me another chance?

409
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,480
One last chance.

410
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,120
I've learned my lesson, seriously.

411
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,440
Besides...

412
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,520
Besides, my brother-in-law got me a job.

413
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:24,100
I can go to work soon.

414
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:25,290
I swear

415
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:26,440
from now on,

416
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,860
I will work honestly

417
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:29,950
and get my act together.

418
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,160
I'll make more money

419
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,760
to pay off my debts as soon as possible.

420
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,130
I'm not Yun Shu.

421
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:34,790
I don't believe

422
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,250
- anything you said.
- Yun Lan.

423
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,670
Don't be too harsh.

424
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,790
He admitted his mistakes.

425
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,270
You should let it go.

426
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,220
Can you change your

427
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:42,190
bad temper?

428
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:44,040
Do you understand what happened to us?

429
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:45,260
Do you know what he has done?

430
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,070
You don't know anything.

431
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,610
You're not qualified to
express your opinion here.

432
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,400
Although I don't know
about his wrongdoings,

433
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,470
I know your temper.

434
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,760
You always show no mercy
to others when you're in the right.

435
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:52,480
Since he has apologised

436
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,640
so sincerely,

437
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:55,050
can't you give him a chance?

438
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:58,050
This is my family's business,

439
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:58,830
not yours.

440
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,770
Get out.

441
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,770
Not my business?

442
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,220
I'm your boyfriend.

443
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,880
Your family business is also mine.

444
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:06,250
Brother-in-law.

445
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:09,690
Thank you.

446
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:10,820
Cousin,

447
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:12,360
I hope you can take care of yourself.

448
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:13,230
According to Yun Lan's temper,

449
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,660
she won't forgive you
for the second time.

450
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,010
Why don't you go?

451
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,650
Didn't you say you’d make money?

452
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:22,650
Why are you still here?

453
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:24,480
Thank you all.

454
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,330
Go back first.

455
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:32,510
I have work to do.

456
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:33,430
Sis.

457
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,400
All right.

458
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,530
We're going back.

459
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:36,500
You go on with your work.

460
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:38,170
By the way,

461
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:39,910
Huo Qi just said

462
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:40,870
the house where Yun Shu lived before

463
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,960
will be rented out.

464
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,050
He has something there.

465
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,050
Help him with it.

466
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:45,710
No problem.

467
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,060
I want to go too

468
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:47,790
but

469
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,340
I have to work overtime this afternoon.

470
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:50,290
That's okay.

471
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,690
I can do that by myself.

472
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:52,280
Let's go.

473
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:53,690
Okay, sister, we're leaving.

474
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,160
Yun Lan, I...

475
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:45,500
Today's the day

476
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,220
my sister goes abroad to study.

477
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,510
From now on,

478
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,640
I'm all on my own.

479
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,360
Although I feel a little scared

480
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,670
and nervous,

481
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:56,210
that's okay.

482
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,230
Yun Shu,

483
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,470
you can do it.

484
00:27:58,670 --> 00:27:59,790
Believe in yourself.

485
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:00,900
Fight on!

486
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,110
I have friends.

487
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:04,870
Our threesome was given

488
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,120
resounding nicknames.

489
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:06,960
Casual.

490
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,760
Love brain.

491
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:08,840
Copycat.

492
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,730
Although it's not very nice,

493
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,350
we don't care.

494
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,080
In a word,

495
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:15,450
they're basically okay.

496
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:18,840
Lin finally caught up with Yi Yi.

497
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:21,150
When I see them immersed in sweet love,

498
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:23,170
I feel happy and upset at the same time.

499
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,720
Where's

500
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:26,370
my love?

501
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:28,510
Everyone says college life isn't complete

502
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:29,840
without a romantic relationship.

503
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,930
I'm about to graduate.

504
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:32,780
Mr. Right

505
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:34,410
please show up.

506
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:37,840
I hope I can find

507
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:39,720
an ideal job

508
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:41,410
and a generous boyfriend

509
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:44,120
after graduation.

510
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:45,280
Little girl.

511
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:46,840
He can cook a good dish

512
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:48,480
and it's best for
him to have little talents.

513
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,390
He'll be gentle with me

514
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,920
and always amaze me with surprise.

515
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,670
Whenever I'm tired from work,

516
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,210
he’ll say to me,

517
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,570
"I can support you."

518
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,400
Sometimes he seems like a superman.

519
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:01,880
He'll show up in time

520
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:03,660
when I need him.

521
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,000
Twenty-four mate selection criteria.

522
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:09,040
If I look handsome,

523
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,930
I'm qualified up to 16 of the criteria.

524
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:22,560
Stop dreaming.

525
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:23,360
What a silly girl.

526
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:25,440
With your ordinary looks

527
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,030
and silly character,

528
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,010
nobody will like you.

529
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,520
I like you.

530
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:45,080
What can I do for you?

531
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,530
Just chit-chat.

532
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:48,970
I want to chat with you.

533
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:56,040
What do you think Yun Lan meant

534
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,440
by "we're of the different kind"?

535
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,600
She isn't human

536
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:00,920
or I'm not?

537
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:04,200
I think what she said

538
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:05,490
is reasonable.

539
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:07,610
Whose side are you on?

540
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:10,330
Who is your brother?

541
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:12,000
I'm on the side of logic.

542
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,360
I'm talking about Yun Lan here.

543
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:15,050
Why are you talking about logic?

544
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,080
Who is it?

545
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,840
You are a public figure.

546
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:19,910
You can always

547
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,540
encounter various things

548
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,830
in life.

549
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:24,200
You get used to dealing with the media

550
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:26,120
in daily life.

551
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,050
But for ordinary people,

552
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,920
they may never

553
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:30,780
encounter the same situation as you.

554
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,110
So she feels nervous

555
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,360
and more repulsive.

556
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,720
Really?

557
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:37,210
Are they all like that?

558
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:38,830
This is the normal behaviour logic

559
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,280
of ordinary human beings.

560
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,360
So

561
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:45,120
give Yun Lan more time.

562
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,620
Or

563
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,210
she’ll become more and more nervous

564
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,720
and repulsive to you.

565
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:51,650
Nian Nian,

566
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:52,750
I realised

567
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,960
you know a lot about women.

568
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:55,220
I just tried to

569
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:56,690
understand them.

570
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,090
But in the problems you just mentioned,

571
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,760
gender attributes are not included.

572
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:02,310
That's why I can analyse it.

573
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,540
There seems to be a story.

574
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,050
What's wrong with you and Yun Shu?

575
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,360
I made a formal confession

576
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:08,970
to Yun Shu.

577
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,500
You finally did that to her.

578
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:14,210
Okay.

579
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:16,250
But the two of us

580
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,880
have just fallen in the relationship.

581
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:21,030
What do you mean?

582
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:27,750
I'm far worse

583
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,090
than Yun Shu's

584
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:30,370
ideal boyfriend.

585
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:33,530
Nian Nian,

586
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,850
I think you finally got it.

587
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,510
You're no longer a fool of love.

588
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,270
If you want to become

589
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,960
your girlfriend's ideal boyfriend,

590
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:41,550
I can give you some tips.

591
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,520
You?

592
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,230
With the way you and Yun Lan turned out,

593
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,030
what can you teach me?

594
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,890
That won't last for too long.

595
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:47,990
Okay.

596
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,410
Then tell me

597
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,560
how are you going to teach me?

598
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,560
Watch my show!

599
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:52,900
Many viewers treat my show

600
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:54,970
as a love bible.

601
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:56,940
Come on.

602
00:31:58,330 --> 00:31:59,420
Are your shows legit?

603
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:00,720
Of course.

604
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:02,120
When you watch my shows,

605
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:02,730
do you get

606
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,880
a little

607
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:04,780
sense of love?

608
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:05,440
Not at all.

609
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:06,470
Are you a monster?

610
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,580
Many people get diabetes

611
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:08,960
because my show was so sweet.

612
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:10,490
Why don't you feel anything?

613
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,970
I didn't feel the sweetness

614
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:13,610
but just a sickening feeling.

615
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,510
Okay.

616
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,040
You don't need to understand it anyway.

617
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:17,960
Let me show you.

618
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:23,720
Let me tell you something.

619
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:24,690
Trust me.

620
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,400
Girls like this very much.

621
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,480
They like to get pressed against a wall.

622
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:30,560
At that moment, girls will think,

623
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:31,540
wow,

624
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,960
you're so brave.

625
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:34,490
Get it?

626
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,160
I'll try it.

627
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:05,610
Let me tell you something.

628
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:06,570
Trust me.

629
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,280
Girls like this very much.

630
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,410
They like to get pressed against a wall.

631
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,260
Mr. Zhang.

632
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,240
Are you all right?

633
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:22,620
You liar!

634
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:24,290
Look...

635
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,420
Did I hurt you?

636
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,090
No, no, no.

637
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:26,920
Why are you here?

638
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:27,430
You scared me.

639
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,010
I just came to see

640
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,320
if I can help you with something.

641
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:29,710
Here...

642
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:30,610
Look out!

643
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,580
Go on!

644
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:45,280
Handsome.

645
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,480
(Handsome, √）

646
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:51,280
(Yun Shu's criteria for boyfriend)

647
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,240
Mr. Zhang.

648
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,930
Do you want to sleep together tonight?

649
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,580
Isn't this one of my

650
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:03,920
comic books?

651
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:05,370
Where did you find it?

652
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:08,400
I found it on that day when

653
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,760
I helped you move in.

654
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,620
How nostalgic.

655
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:15,000
It was so long ago.

656
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,639
I thought they were all lost.

657
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,850
Sorry, Yun Shu.

658
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,620
I saw one of the pages

659
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:23,000
without your permission.

660
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,889
It was about your
mate selection criteria.

661
00:34:26,449 --> 00:34:27,760
I found out

662
00:34:27,889 --> 00:34:29,050
I'm far below the standard.

663
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:33,940
I wrote this a long time ago.

664
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,889
I didn't understand
anything at that time.

665
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:37,429
So it doesn't count.

666
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,590
Mr. Zhang.

667
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:41,040
You're already good enough.

668
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:44,320
But seeing your standards,

669
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,030
I suddenly realized that

670
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,920
I really don't seem to
know much about romance.

671
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,760
I've never given you surprises

672
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:54,600
or made you feel excited.

673
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,969
For me,

674
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,010
this can't be solved by mathematics.

675
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:11,840
♫ You're a familiar stranger ♫

676

677
