174
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,650
Phone's ringing.

175
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,850
(We can meet. Send me your phone number)

176
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,470
Si Hua Nian texted me back

177
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,630
and he agreed to meet.

178
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:55,820
Is it so?

179
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,860
That's really great!

180
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,680
You need me to come with you?

181
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,650
Don't worry.

182
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,480
I can fix it myself this time.

183
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,410
All right. I will tell
you after it's done.

184
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,170
What a coincidence!

185
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,480
Do you still remember me?

186
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,510
Definitely.

187
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,740
I will remember everyone I met.

188
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,700
I still remember

189
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,590
you had a best friend called Gao Zhi Yi.

190
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,480
You are so amazing!

191
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:46,810
You have an appointment?

192
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,390
Same to you?

193
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,150
It's still early.

194
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,470
That's destiny.

195
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,780
Shall I buy you a cup of coffee?

196
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:58,750
OK.

197
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,690
Hi, waiter!

198
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:06,950
Hi.

199
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,130
What can I get for you two?

200
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,110
A cup of cold brew.

201
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:12,300
I'd like a cup of latte.

202
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,180
90 Celsius degree water.

203
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,100
Vapour pressure at 3 bars.

204
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,780
Pine-leaf shaped latte art.

205
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:17,130
Thank you.

206
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,260
I'll be back.

207
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:21,640
Very unique drinking style of you.

208
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,430
Learned from a friend

209
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,480
many years ago.

210
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:25,930
I've got used to it.

211
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:29,280
So... your friend must
be important to you, right?

212
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:33,670
The one you are waiting
for hasn't come yet?

213
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,650
Let me text her

214
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,100
to see where she is.

215
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,080
Are you Si Hua Nian?

216
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,450
You are Yun Shu?

217
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,550
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

218
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,970
I didn't mean to do that.

219
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:49,800
I just honestly don't know

220
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,300
these words are copyrighted.

221
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:52,680
I am so, so sorry.

222
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:53,130
Sorry.

223
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:53,840
I will never ever

224
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:54,850
make such a mistake again.

225
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:55,810
If you.

226
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,980
Sit down please.

227
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:00,380
Not a big deal for me.

228
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:01,720
I actually made an appointment with you

229
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:03,300
to tell you that

230
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,910
I will withdraw the charge.

231
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,390
You... you are not suing me?

232
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:10,450
Actually, I wrote those words

233
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,720
while I was studying abroad,

234
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,080
when I get bored.

235
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:14,550
Earlier the agent company

236
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:15,650
suddenly called me

237
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:16,610
saying

238
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:19,210
there was someone
plagiarizing my words online

239
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,390
and they will issue a
lawyer's letter to protect rights.

240
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,130
I was too busy at that time

241
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,340
so I agreed with that.

242
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,270
It just occurred to me yesterday.

243
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,150
I hurried to search online

244
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,580
to read your comics.

245
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,480
I'd like to know how you plagiarized.

246
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,970
But I didn't expect that

247
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,600
I like your comic.

248
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,990
Perfect And Casual.

249
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,010
You... you really like it?

250
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,680
If you find it appropriate

251
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,510
I'd like to cooperate with you.

252
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,870
That is to say, in the future

253
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,540
if you need words for your comic,

254
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,000
I'd like to be a part of that.

255
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:50,780
Great!

256
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,800
It... it will be my honour.

257
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:54,450
For this special cooperation.

258
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,640
Cheers.

259
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,850
Mr. Zhang,

260
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:07,980
I will not be charged.

261
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,180
Looks like she has withdrawn the charge.

262
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,090
Then she is a good person.

263
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:14,800
She is a

264
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:17,410
kind-hearted and beautiful lady.

265
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,150
If you are Mr. Perfect,

266
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,000
she will be Ms. Perfect then.

267
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:25,400
It's a pity that you
are no longer available.

268
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,700
So she has no chances.

269
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,730
Will you come down now?

270
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,220
Nevertheless, the beautiful lady

271
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:39,080
has the same taste of coffee as you do.

272
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:42,480
Is it so?

273
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:43,150
What's more,

274
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,760
eat less food with sugar.

275
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,050
It is not good for health.

276
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,050
Got it?

277
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,100
Sweet?

278
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:14,250
Yes.

279
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:24,510
That company has withdrawn the charge.

280
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:24,950
Now,

281
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,130
I have already signed

282
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:27,410
a cooperation agreement with her.

283
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:29,550
She is really kind-hearted and beautiful.

284
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,980
You should seize the opportunity.

285
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,680
Yes, tightly.

286
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:34,630
Lin Nuo got promoted.

287
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,670
Would you join us for a meal on weekend?

288
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,900
Get Mr. Zhang please.

289
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:38,250
I can do that.

290
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,210
But

291
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:41,150
isn't it better to leave you two alone?

292
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,730
Why invite us?

293
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,650
A world for two sounds good

294
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,880
but... but the more the merrier.

295
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,300
Did you quarrel?

296
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,470
I don't know why.

297
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,970
Me and Lin Nuo,

298
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,260
when we were alone,

299
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,010
I feel uncomfortable.

300
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:04,530
Uncomfortable?

301
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:05,850
Before you two getting back together,

302
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,500
aren't you being with
each other all day long?

303
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,530
Yes.

304
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,500
When we were not together,

305
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,030
it feels fine even we
see each other everyday.

306
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,830
But now, as long as he
kisses me or holds me.

307
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,000
I...

308
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:17,700
I just feel uncomfortable.

309
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:18,670
It's like...

310
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:20,530
I am dating you.

311
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,000
You know what I mean?

312
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:25,660
It's truly weird if so.

313
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,000
So now, every time he asks me out,

314
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:29,350
I want to have someone with me.

315
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,200
At least one more person,

316
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:31,610
it would have been less awkward.

317
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,800
Lin Nuo.

318
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,430
What are you talking about?

319
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,500
Nothing special.

320
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,120
Didn't we say meet at the restaurant?

321
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,200
What do you do here?

322
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,790
I am off night duty,
so I come here directly.

323
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,010
Hey, Yun Shu.

324
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,120
A few days earlier,

325
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:56,100
I met Grandpa Zhang in the hospital.

326
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,770
Grandpa?

327
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,740
Right.

328
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:00,660
Yun Shu.

329
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,700
Shall we have lunch together?

330
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,720
Yi Yi,

331
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,950
I have some business later.

332
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,380
Another day maybe?

333
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,130
You really don't want to go?

334
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:17,060
I really have some business.

335
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:20,200
It hurts!

336
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,720
So... you are really leaving?

337
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:23,530
I will leave you two alone

338
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:25,030
in your little world for two.

339
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,660
Very few people here.

340
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,370
Thank you.

341
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,750
Your payroll day today?

342
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,270
Such a high-end restaurant.

343
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,250
I promised you a long time ago,

344
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,680
and today is a good day.

345
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,040
So be it.

346
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,370
What can I get for you two?

347
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,340
Right.

348
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,680
I have reserved a combo online.

349
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:59,330
Just serve the combo.

350
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:02,770
No problem, a moment please.

351
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:03,830
OK, thanks.

352
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,020
Lin Nuo.

353
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:08,800
Why are you so generous today?

354
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:09,680
Tell me.

355
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:10,470
Did you do something

356
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,640
sorry for me?

357
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,280
You are thinking this way.

358
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:15,050
Then forget about it.

359
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,079
Let's leave, I am not eating.

360
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:17,420
Just kidding.

361
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,400
Let's have lunch here.

362
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:21,910
We finally made it here.

363
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:27,270
Here you go.

364
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,660
Yi Yi.

365
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,930
Have you ever thought about

366
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,070
our future?

367
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:39,970
No, I didn't.

368
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,540
Why are you planning so long?

369
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:42,720
Have you thought about it?

370
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:44,190
Sometimes, I think...

371
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,780
I feel that

372
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:49,520
the city we are living in is so big

373
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,890
and the pace of life is so fast.

374
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,480
If it is possible,

375
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,660
I want to take you to my hometown.

376
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,700
I have saved some money,

377
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,210
we can start a small business

378
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,870
and live a life without quarrels

379
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,310
and without worries.

380
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:02,730
A peaceful life.

381
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,250
What do you say?

382
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,760
You are saying

383
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,000
leave here.

384
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:07,970
Yes.

385
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,000
No matter where we are,

386
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:12,200
I will be good to you with all my heart.

387
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:13,420
If you are unhappy,

388
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:14,640
I will make you happy.

389
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:15,920
If you don't have money,

390
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:17,050
I will go make money.

391
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,740
I will not let you down.

392
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,240
Lin Nuo.

393
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,520
I'm really moved

394
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:28,230
by what you just said.

395
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,530
I really appreciate it.

396
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,300
However,

397
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:33,660
we fought so hard

398
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,900
to stay in this city, right?

399
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,300
Now that we are here

400
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:39,130
why not keep up a little bit?

401
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:46,690
Sir, your meal.

402
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,060
Thank you.

403
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:54,460
(Gu Xiao)

404
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,660
(Declined)

405
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:58,850
Who is that?

406
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,100
Insurance sale.

407
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,700
Already made several calls today.

408
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:04,740
It's alright.

409
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,880
Let's have some steak.

410
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,420
This is the experimental subject's

411
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,800
report from three months' ago.

412
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,550
This is the newest data report.

413
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,180
By comparison, we can find that

414
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,750
with the new algorithm,

415
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,080
the data from the experimental subject

416
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,530
have shown large differences.

417
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:33,300
I think it might be because
in the new algorithm,

418
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,020
we have adjusted the
heart rate monitoring cycle

419
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,450
to three times higher.

420
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,630
Three effective cycles

421
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,630
changed the average value of the sample.

422
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:40,520
That's right.

423
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,050
So the data of the experimental subject

424
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,720
has raised some issues.

425
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:44,750
Professor Zhang,

426
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:47,470
I heard that you and
Ms. Lin are classmates.

427
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,770
In university

428
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,660
you had good teamwork.

429
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,200
When we were on campus,

430
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,710
we were in the same research group.

431
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,130
You two have been
legends of your university.

432
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,200
So called a formidable combination

433
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,510
is being afraid of nothing.

434
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:00,330
Mr. Lin,

435
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,760
do you have a boyfriend?

436
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,060
No.

437
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:05,970
That's great.

438
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,520
Professor Zhang
doesn't have a girlfriend.

439
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,630
If you two can continue the story,

440
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,730
that would be fantastic.

441
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,570
That is a couple of legends.

442
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,430
Everyone would envy that.

443
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,460
I am already married.

444
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,550
Si Nian.

445
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,250
Si Nian.

446
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,310
They all say that

447
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,000
a campus life without campus love

448
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:45,090
is incomplete.

449
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,980
You are about to graduate,

450
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,910
don't you want to try it?

451
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,170
The best years of a mathematician

452
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,910
is before 35 years old.

453
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,940
So before winning the Fields Medal.

454
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:56,670
Any emotion

455
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,730
shall not be considered by me.

456
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:04,070
What's the matter?

457
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,380
Aren't you going to the lab?

458
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,120
Sure.

459
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,540
Let's go.

460
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:30,490
Si Nian.

461
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:32,770
Chu Chu.

462
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:33,740
Anything else?

463
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,140
You married?

464
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,760
Yes.

465
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,130
How long?

466
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,130
Almost a year.

467
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:41,960
What's the matter?

468
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,720
No.

469
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,880
I am just a bit surprised.

470
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,510
Didn't you say

471
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:54,860
before winning the Fields Medal

472
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:56,530
any emotional problem

473
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,680
shall not be considered by you?

474
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,640
Yes.

475
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,450
I used to think that way.

476
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,250
But after I met my wife,

477
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:03,900
I realised

478
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,660
I might be a bit naive at that time.

479
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,070
Life

480
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,760
doesn't have to be one way or the other.

481
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,880
Sometimes if you look in another way,

482
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,760
you can get more.

483
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,710
I am just curious.

484
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:55,600
What kind of girl

485
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:57,470
can change you so much.

486
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,720
She is a girl that with a
little less attention paid,

487
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:02,110
she will get in trouble.

488
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:14,900
Yun Shu.

489
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:16,320
Aren't you going to buy
something for your husband?

490
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:18,610
It is our shopping time.

491
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:19,770
You are right.

492
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:21,000
Chu Chu,

493
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:21,700
I never knew

494
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,460
you were a shopaholic.

495
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,580
When women are in a bad mood,

496
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,950
there are two ways to let off steam.

497
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,350
Eat like you are dying

498
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,760
or shop like you are dying.

499
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,500
I don't want to become fat.

500
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:34,270
Shopping

501
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,980
sounds much easier.

502
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:38,220
Well, let's see what we have got.

503
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,810
You must be in real bad mood.

504
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:41,620
Kind of.

505
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:43,910
Is it because of relationship problems?

506
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:48,430
Nice hit.

507
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,200
Chu Chu.

508
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:51,270
Excellent as you are,

509
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,070
you should have no problems with work,

510
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,280
then there's only one
option left, relationship.

511
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,280
I found out

512
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,100
the man I love

513
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:03,450
is married.

514
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:07,550
Chu Chu,

515
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,710
are you OK?

516
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:11,260
I'm OK.

517
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:13,360
There is another store ahead.

518
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:13,870
Today

519
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,340
we will shop until we die.

520
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,760
Chu Chu.

521
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:23,310
You want a drink?

522
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:24,390
OK.

523
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:32,010
So, Chu Chu,

524
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:34,420
is he the guy you told me?

525
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:36,280
Mr. Perfect?

526
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:38,870
Come on.

527
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:50,180
We were classmates in university,

528
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,740
and we joined the university's
debate team together.

529
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:54,880
We were in the same
school when we went to study abroad,

530
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:57,730
even after graduation,

531
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:01,210
we went to the same research institute.

532
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,110
We were

533
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,290
reading recommended books together,

534
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,180
doing experiments together,

535
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:09,590
always together.

536
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:14,050
The books you recommended to me?

537
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,530
Sophie's World.

538
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,450
The Conquest of Happiness by B. Russell.

539
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,080
And the.

540
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:19,230
An invitation to philosophy.

541
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,410
You still remember?

542
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:23,730
I am planning on reading them
in the next few days.

543
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,410
Those

544
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,480
are my memories with him.

545
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:37,190
What happened after that?

546
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,190
I once thought

547
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,900
I could keep going on with him.

548
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,160
That we'd get married sooner or later.

549
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:46,630
But afterwards,

550
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,350
he went back to China before me
due to some circumstances.

551
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,580
Why didn't you

552
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,630
come back together with him?

553
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:59,230
My advisor and I

554
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,680
were working on a project.

555
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:02,390
I couldn't really leave.

556
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:09,760
Then

557
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:12,860
does he know that you like him?

558
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:16,650
I thought he should know.

559
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:21,030
Now, thinking back,

560
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:22,850
my feelings for him.

561
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:24,460
It is admiration at the beginning.

562
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:26,230
But it turns out

563
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,220
we have so many interests

564
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,410
in common.

565
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,500
We become more and
more tacit while doing things.

566
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:35,800
Later on,

567
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:39,060
I found out he was a complete amateur

568
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,710
when it comes to romantic relationships.

569
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,860
But I don't know why

570
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,060
I still love him so much.

571
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:51,650
I was thinking I can wait.

572
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,660
Did he understand your thoughts?

573
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:04,930
The day he went back to China,

574
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,830
I went to see him off.

575
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,950
I really hated to see him leaving.

576
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:11,000
I thought

577
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:13,330
I had to let him know how I felt.

578
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,400
So I kissed him.

579
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,510
So that's your first kiss?

580
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:22,660
Did you confess your feelings?

581
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:24,910
No.

582
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:26,580
Why?

583
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:30,530
He was in a hurry to get on the flight

584
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,100
and we were separated right after that.

585
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,650
Did you give up?

586
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:37,340
Of course not.

587
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:39,630
I thought we had a tacit understanding.

588
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,030
I didn't expect

589
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:46,910
when I got back this time,

590
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,480
he is already married.

591
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,460
Chu Chu,

592
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:04,120
I think I understand

593
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:05,180
why you wrote

594
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,390
those sad things.

595
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:11,270
Yes.

596
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:13,090
I spent all my time

597
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,660
studying.

598
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,530
I barely had any friends.

599
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,010
It was the same when I was abroad too.

600
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,710
I spent all my time

601
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,610
in the library with him.

602
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:23,400
I thought

603
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:25,050
after he fulfills his dreams,

604
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,600
I can confess my feelings to him.

605
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:28,700
But occasionally in the middle of
the night when it is dark and quiet.

606
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,000
I would think

607
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,750
my insistence on this relationship,

608
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,960
is it right or wrong?

609
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,290
So those words on the
internet from that time

610
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,200
were my true feelings in my heart.

611
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:43,070
Chu Chu.

612
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:46,360
In the future, if you are unhappy,

613
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,570
you can tell me everything.

614
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,540
Pinky promise.

615
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:52,960
Pinky promise.

616
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,710
Why are you calling so late?

617
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,730
Si Nian was married, do you know that?

618
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,840
I do.

619
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,960
Why did he suddenly get married?

620
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:14,680
You are drunk.

621
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,720
Have you ever met his wife?

622
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:22,690
I have.

623
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,800
What is she like?

624
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:29,060
She is a

625
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,580
woman that gets you addicted.

626
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,660
Wait.

627
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,900
Honey.

628
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,010
Are you busy now?

629
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:55,360
No.

630
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:56,980
I am meditating.

631
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:03,910
I have a question.

632
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:05,270
But

633
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,210
it might be associated
with your privacy.

634
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,180
I don't know if it is
OK for you to answer.

635
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,480
Try me.

636
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:19,010
Did I have your first kiss?

637
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:35,610
Definitely yes.

638
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,010
You had mine too.

639
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:49,480
What is this hard thing?

640
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,540
No, I didn't.

641
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:07,010
You read these books?

642
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,480
Since you called me honey,

643
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:11,700
I think our relationship

644
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:12,580
may be changed from love

645
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:13,650
to marriage.

646
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:14,990
So...

647
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,960
So...

648
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:23,910
I was thinking I should
learn something more.

649
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,500
It might be good for our relationship

650
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:28,130
in the future.

651
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:29,900
Then,

652
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:31,980
I will leave you alone.

653
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,410
You surely come from Venus.

654
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:13,430
We have never been
apart for over three days.

655
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,590
With your new love, you
have forgotten the old one.

656
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,400
She just came back

657
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:19,270
and she has no friends.

658
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,070
And she is not in a good mood.

659
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,050
So I can only keep her company.

660
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:23,750
You value new friend

661
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,830
over your old friend.

662
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:26,490
I am not in a good mood.

663
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:27,380
Yi Yi.

664
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:28,150
Don't get angry.

665
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,200
Next time she goes shopping,

666
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:30,250
we'll go together.

667
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,090
I am not going.

668
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,630
I do not want to be a third wheel.

669
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:33,720
Yi Yi, let me tell you

670
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:35,050
your position in my heart.

671
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,370
No one can replace you.

672
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,300
Top of the list.

673
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,590
What about Zhang Si Nian?

674
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,060
He can't beat you.

675
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:44,970
Hypocritical.

676
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:46,350
Yi Yi.

677
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,550
Don't be mad.

678
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,700
Let's eat out for a special treatment.

679
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,380
It's on me.

680
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:51,770
I have classes later.

681
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:52,700
Next time.

682
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:53,670
Put it on the record.

683
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:54,250
Put it on the record.

684
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,220
No problem.

685
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,340
Twice.

686
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,410
This is not bad.

687
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:01,180
Si Nian.

688
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,610
What do you want for lunch?

689
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,080
Anything will do.

690
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:05,300
By the way,

691
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:07,410
survey report from the first
phase has been generated.

692
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:09,000
Contact the headquarters
as soon as possible.

693
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:10,250
-Have the lab check the data,
-Okay.

694
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,850
so that we can start the second phase

695
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:12,980
of sample surveys.

696
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:13,540
[Classroom Building]

697
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,380
[Classroom Building]
I will check and send it this afternoon.

698
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:15,470
[Classroom Building]

699
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:16,350
[Classroom Building]
Alright.

700
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:16,550
[Classroom Building]

701
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:18,270
Si Nian.

702
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,700
Let's have a meal with Meng Ran some day.

703
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:22,330
Meng Ran?

704
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:24,140
Bring your wife, too.

705
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,520
I haven't met her.

706
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:26,490
Okay.

707
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:27,680
Look out!

708
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,230
Are you all right?

709
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,860
It's alright.

710
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,510
And that time there were...

711
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:39,810
Mr. Zhang.

712
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,510
Chu Chu.

713
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,080
Yun Shu.

714
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,030
What are you doing?

715
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,600
Why are you here at the campus today?

716
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:05,080
I was going to get Yi Yi

717
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,130
and decided to pick you up on the way.

718
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:10,610
Let me introduce officially.

719
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:11,300
Yun Shu,

720
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:12,560
my wife.

721
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,980
How did you two know each other?

722
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,650
Chu Chu, also known as

723
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:20,610
Si Hua Nian.

724
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:24,210
OK, why are you two together now?

725
00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:25,620
Chu Chu is

726
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:26,780
the director of the project.

727
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:35,730
We were classmates before.

728
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:41,960
We will make an appointment 
for a meal the other day.

729
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:43,520
Yun Shu.

730
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:44,199
Wait for me.

731
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:45,199
I will go get the car.

732
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:46,170
Okay.

733
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:55,530
So Chu Chu,

734
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:58,230
the classmate you mentioned is

735
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,280
Mr. Zhang, right?

736
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,060
I didn't expect

737
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,730
you to be Si Nian's newly wedded wife.

738
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:12,010
Actually, I didn't expect

739
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:15,780
we'd be talking about the same person.

740
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,830
Our fates

741
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,480
are truly intertwined.
