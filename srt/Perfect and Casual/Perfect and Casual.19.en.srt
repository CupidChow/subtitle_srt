4
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,760
Have you made your mind?

5
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,400
It's almost interdisciplinary.

6
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,160
Sometimes you change
your hobby into your job,

7
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,660
but at last you find it totally
different from what you thought.

8
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,370
Yi Yi.

9
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,380
Fair enough.

10
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,300
But I think

11
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,000
I'll regret it

12
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,200
if I don't give it a try.

13
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,700
Well, I got your back.

14
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:21,870
We are young anyway.

15
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,280
We shouldn't be afraid to try.

16
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,940
Let's go shopping and get pretty.

17
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,400
-Let's go.
-Okay.

18
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,800
Look.

19
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,920
Come on!

20
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:43,880
Hold or not?

21
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,950
Hurry up! Come on.

22
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,620
Shall we go over and talk to them?

23
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:52,740
He almost got it.

24
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,040
Come on.

25
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,720
Sorry for bothering.

26
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:18,120
Just offer your hand if you like her.

27
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:20,079
You've got it wrong.

28
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,710
We are just friends.

29
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,400
More than friends,

30
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,650
less than lovers, right?

31
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,450
If someone still doesn't take action,

32
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,720
maybe he will miss the right one.

33
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:33,170
Su Yu,

34
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,510
I've loved you for a long time.

35
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,550
Me too.

36
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,850
So that's what people call

37
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,880
the goddess with beauty and wisdom.

38
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:45,900
Wait. I'm going to talk to her.

39
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:47,380
Wait a minute, Yi Yi.

40
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,000
-Hey, miss.
-That's too bold.

41
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,600
What's the matter?

42
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,640
Nothing.

43
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,400
I just think you were so cool.

44
00:03:58,490 --> 00:03:59,430
On that occasion,

45
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,970
very few would dare to do that

46
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,410
for fearing of being called...

47
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,640
A meddler, right?

48
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,080
You both

49
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:06,610
must also think that I'm a meddler.

50
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,080
No. It's not true.

51
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:09,950
Maybe my friend

52
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,760
is a little thoughtless.

53
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:12,580
So,

54
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,760
please don't mind.

55
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,870
It's alright.

56
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,959
I just feel one should be brave

57
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,250
in a relationship,

58
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:20,360
or

59
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,680
you'll miss the one

60
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:22,970
before knowing it.

61
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,680
I was anxious to help.

62
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,400
Well, I have to go. Bye.

63
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,420
Good.

64
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,400
Bye.

65
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,680
What a beauty!

66
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:36,170
Yi Yi.

67
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,390
I know you are good
at hooking up with boys.

68
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,680
I didn't expect you could
even hit on a lady.

69
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:45,690
Resign?

70
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:48,210
You are going to work
at a comic studio?

71
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,190
Days ago, Mei showed me

72
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,890
their recruiting poster.

73
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:53,850
So...

74
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,170
I want to try it.

75
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,480
You want to work at the comic studio??

76
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,640
You don't have to resign first.

77
00:04:58,730 --> 00:04:59,610
You can just try your hands
there for a couple of day

78
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:00,450
and come back if it's not suitable.

79
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,270
That's no good.

80
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,220
That kind of behavior is so-called
'having a foot in both camps'.

81
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,140
Maybe my expression is not very accurate.

82
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,500
We usually call that

83
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,640
"riding a donkey while
looking for a horse".

84
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,640
Mr. Meng,

85
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,620
I know what I decided to do

86
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,200
might betray your trust in me.

87
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:15,850
Stop.

88
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,240
Don't make it like you were
accepting education here.

89
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:18,730
Have you really made up your mind?

90
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,080
I will not stop trying

91
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,090
even if I fail this time.

92
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,160
I know you really love comics.

93
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,700
But I still want to tell you that

94
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,500
it doesn't always turn
out to be a good thing

95
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:30,980
to treat your hobby as your job.

96
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,400
However, you have my support.

97
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:34,790
Do the handover in the afternoon.

98
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,920
Mr. Meng, thank you so much.

99
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,050
Stop!

100
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,800
Don't play the nice guy card.

Mr. Zhang.

103
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,450
Your grandson is not here?

104
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,420
Dr. Zhang.

105
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,760
Just say it.

106
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,210
It's

107
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:01,770
serious, right?

108
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,850
I think we'd better
wait for your grandson.

109
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,790
Don't worry.

110
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,920
I can take it.

111
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,320
Don't bother the young ones.

112
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,460
I suggest

113
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:16,190
you stay in the hospital.

114
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,620
It's not like home.

115
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,870
Just tell me

116
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,270
how much time is left.

117
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,590
You are making things hard.

118
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,600
Dr. Zhang.

119
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,440
Just let me spend

120
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,280
my remaining time with the kids.

121
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,310

I'll leave the key of
the rest room to you.

124
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,250
-Got off work?
-Yeah.

125
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,740
Thank you for covering
for me the day before.

126
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,700
I'll treat you to a movie
some other day, okay?

127
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:19,480
Don't bother.

128
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,190
It's not a big deal.

129
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,290
Then,

130
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,500
a meal together?

131
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,330
Okay.

132
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,940
I'll choose an expensive restaurant.

133
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,920
No problem.
I'll offer my one-month salary.

134
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:29,750
No. That's too big an amount

135
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,960
to spend on me.

136
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,730
Go home and have some rest.

137
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,200
See you then.

138
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,480

00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,400

00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,200

Gao Zhi Yi.

143
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,990
Yi Yi, I'll leave first.

144
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,020
Why didn't you pick my calls?

145
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:07,030
You know the answer.

146
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,270
Why should I pick up your phone?

147
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:09,250
Yi Yi.

148
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,180
You are not even giving
me a chance to explain.

149
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,100
Douchebags always have
all kinds of excuses.

150
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,530
Which one will you use today?

151
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,600
The girl you met before.

152
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,220
Yeah, she used to be my girlfriend

153
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,580
that my family introduced to me.

154
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:22,950
We dated for a period of time

155
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,160
and found that we were not for each other.

156
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,560
So we broke up.

157
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:27,690
Then I met you.

158
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:28,780
But her mum

159
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,160
had a heart attack

160
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,670
for which a surgery was needed.

161
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:33,570
So you see,

162
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,740
to console her mum,

163
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,809
she asked me to pretend
that I was still her boyfriend.

164
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,020
I had to say yes.

165
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,150
The story is touching.

166
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:44,980
But I don't believe it.

167
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:45,950
Yi Yi.

168
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,400
I can bring you to her

169
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:48,750
if you don't believe.

170
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,010
Let her tell you the truth.

171
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,900
You are really good at making up stories.

172
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:52,750
What?

173
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,010
Even the actor is prepared?

174
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,020
Why are you here?

175
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,300
Lin Nuo.

176
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,520
I'm telling you now,

177
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:00,670
I never lied to her.

178
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:03,450
Yi Yi.

179
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,450
You don't really believe that, do you?

180
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,600
Didn't you say that you would go home

181
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,340
after night duty

182
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,500
and have dinner with me?

183
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,360
Why did you come here?

184
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,450
I was just on my way

185
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,870
and wondering if I
could have lunch with you.

186
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,540
You two are dating?

187
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:22,570
Yes.

188
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:23,770
We're together.

189
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,800
Yi Yi.

190
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,240
Is that true?

191
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,700
Let's go. I'm hungry.

192
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:29,670
Let's go for lunch.

193
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:40,330
I just watched a video online.

194
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,170
A man and a kid.

195
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,090
The man's right foot

196
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,090
stepped forward

197
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,720
while getting out the car

198
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:46,850
and kicked the kid to the ground.

199
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:47,820
The kid

200
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,650
fell into a dirty puddle.

201
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,860
So funny, right?

202
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,420
Funny.

203
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:54,660
You didn't even listen to me.

204
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,040
Tell me again.

205
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,710
I will definitely laugh my head off.

206
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,960
You believed him, didn't you?

207
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:06,810
No, I didn't.

208
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,930
I don't believe what he said.

209
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:09,900
It's okay.

210
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,470
Just tell me your thoughts.

211
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,120
You can say anything

212
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,370
to your best friend.

213
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,380
It's not important
whether I believe or not.

214
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,820
You are my boyfriend now.

215
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,350
What do you mean?

216
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,290
Well, you also can regret it.

217
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:23,330
Regret?

218
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,090
Lin Nuo. Are you kidding me?

219
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,720
Regret now? Fine.

220
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:28,750
Okay, I regret it.

221
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,720
Is that okay?

222
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,190
No, no. Yi Yi.

223
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,250
Just a joke.

224
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:35,650
A joke?

225
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,010
Some things cannot be taken

226
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,060
as a joke.

227
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,400
Okay.

228
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:41,210
I promise

229
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,620
I will never say that kind
of nonsense anymore.

230
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,360
Come here.

231
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:44,940
Your favorite soup.

232
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:47,720
Never again!

233
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,560
I promise.

234
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:53,950
One more spoon.

235
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,110
Yun Shu,

236
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,680
I really don't want to let you go.

237
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:02,220
You haven't introduced your cousin to me.

238
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,300
Is he really married?

239
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:06,820
He's married.

240
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,880
Yun Shu.

241
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,150
What are you doing here?

242
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:14,810
I'm here to get you home.

243
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,380
Cousin, hi.

244
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:20,100
Is everything done?

245
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:21,530
Yeah, it's done.

246
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,500
That's good.

247
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,700
Okay, Liane.

248
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,620
We're leaving.

249
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:25,590
Yun Shu.

250
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,060
Shall we

251
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,570
have dinner with your cousin?

252
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,540
No, thanks.

253
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,160
We have other plans today.

254
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,470
And

255
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:33,550
I'm not her cousin.

256
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:34,970
I'm her husband.

257
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,840
What?

258
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,800
Let's go.

259
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,260
♫ You're a familiar stranger ♫

260
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,770
♫ Who keeps appearing before me ♫

261
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,880
♫ You're clumsy yet kind ♫

262
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:55,390
♫ Ringing the bell in my heart ♫

263
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,390
♫ You predict and plan ♫

264
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,180
Yun Lan.

265
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,370
Shall we have a talk?

266
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,080
I have an appointment tonight.

267
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,050
Some other day.

268
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,660
Don't always avoid me.

269
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,360
I understand why you hesitate.

270
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,960
But since we decided to love each other,

271
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,880
we must try to accept the other's life.

272
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:26,170
But I...

273
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:27,820
Miss Yun Lan.

274
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:32,950
I have to go.

275
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,640
Mr. Han.

276
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:42,780
Why are you here?

277
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:44,590
I said I would pick you up.

278
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,040
I won't eat my words.

279
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,100
Actually, I can go there by myself.

280
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,070
That won't be okay.

281
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:56,120
It's my pleasure

282
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,290
to take Miss Yun.

283
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,380
Come on, be careful.

284
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,670
A'Mei.

285
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,120
Find me Mr. Han's schedule tonight.

286
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:17,310
Okay.

287
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,420
Mr. Han.

288
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,210
Do you like Yun Lan?

289
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:33,680
Come on.

290
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:34,910
Come on.

291
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,230
Cheers.

292
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,320
Cheers.

293
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,610
Drink it up.

294
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,650
It's not going to work.

295
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,890
Mr. Han, Miss Yun.

296
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,430
Miss Yun, here's to you.

297
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,660
Here.

298
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:49,350
Here's to you.

299
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,490
Cheers!

300
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:56,700
Have fun, everybody.

301
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:57,910
I have to go there.

302
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,400
I think maybe we can deepen

303
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:03,950
our relationship.

304
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,200
Hurry up! One more glass.

305
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:07,330
We work well together.

306
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:10,110
We might also be suitable
for each other in life.

307
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,400
Mr. Han, it's getting late.

308
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:15,250
I have to go.

309
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,610
There is a meeting tomorrow morning.

310
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,800
It's early.

311
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,430
I heard that lawyers

312
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,730
are all night owls.

313
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,740
Wait.

314
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:27,850
Just hold on, everybody.

315
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,530
Miss Yun is going to go.

316
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,180
Let's drink a toast to her!

317
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,010
Okay, we shall have a toast.

318
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:34,980
Okay.

319
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,110
Fill up your glasses.

320
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,520
Miss Yun.

321
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:38,730
The last one.

322
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,410
Miss Yun.

323
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,600
The last one.

324
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:41,910
Yeah, the last one.

325
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:44,610
Miss Yun.

326
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,520
This is the last toast to you.

327
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,050
Wish you success in your career

328
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:48,900
and good health.

329
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:49,390
Come on.

330
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,530
Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!

331
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:51,710
-Come on.
-The last toast.

332
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,050
-Come on.
-Cheers!

333
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:53,940
Cheers!

334
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:54,910
Drink it up.

335
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:58,370
Wait.

336
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:59,800
Who are you?

337
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:00,900
Her boyfriend.

338
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,890
He's Lu Yu.

339
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:03,950
Yes, it's him.

340
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:04,970
Sorry.

341
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,420
Mr. Han.

342
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,110
-We have to go.
-Yun Lan.

343
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:09,260
Don't leave us hanging.

344
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:11,320
Everybody is holding the glass for you.

345
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,840
You cannot refuse the toast.

346
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,010
Okay. I'll have it.

347
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,400
I'll have it for her.

348
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:25,400

Yeah, Mr. Han.

353
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,050
Of course.

354
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,770
That's Lu Yu, the popular actor.

00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:40,750
Interesting.

-Don't come near.

I think those scums

Are you okay?

365
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,320
Shall I take you to the hospital?

No one really wants to
get to know me.

Do you really think it's okay?

520
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:53,610
Is it too plain?

521
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:54,860
Totally not.

522
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:57,680
But, I think

523
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:59,930
it'll be more
appealing if you name each day

524
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:00,930
with a popular sentence.

525
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,080
Popular sentence?

526
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,840
Just like trendy titles
you can see on Weibo.

527
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:07,940
"Rationality is like a useless lid

528
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,890
which would be bumped
off when feelings boils."

529
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:11,860
Something like that.

530
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,010
In this way,

531
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,850
we will be able to raise each theme

532
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,000
with a popular sentence.

533
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:19,680
I think that'll spread faster.

534
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:22,100
I got it, Mei.

535
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:24,090
I'm on it.

536
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:35,350
Si Nian.

537
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,530
You look different

538
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,290
from what I remember.

539
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,320
Different?

540
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:43,130
In what way?

541
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,480
You seem warmer.

542
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:50,600
How is it?

543
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,210
Has everything been okay?

544
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:55,660
Yes, pretty good.

545
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,410
Are you in a relationship?

546
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,000
No.

547
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,540
(Si Hua Nian's blog)

548
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,160
Yun Shu.

549
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,670
I think what Si Hua Nian writes

550
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,810
suits your comic.

551
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:13,930
Yun Shu.

552
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:15,720
This one is pretty good.

553
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:19,460
"Love is like sneezing,

554
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:21,580
unstoppable when it comes,

555
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:23,580
and impossible to pretend
when it doesn't."

556
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,690
Is that for me?

557
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:27,870
It's a pretty fitting for you
and Mr. Zhang.

558
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,450
Look this one I think it's for you.

559
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,690
"After all it's overcrowded
in your surrounding,

560
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,560
and I'm not your one and only."

561
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:39,740
Oh, poppycock.

562
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:40,910
I’m annoyed enough.

563
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:45,160
Why are you annoyed?

564
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:47,770
Gu Xiao came to the school.

565
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:49,200
Gu Xiao?

566
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,360
An old acquaintance.

567
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,130
You finally get your chance
to take revenge on me, huh?

568
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,300
No.

569
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:59,710
Well, let's talk seriously.

570
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,250
Why did he come here?

571
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:08,060
The girl you met before

572
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,350
used to be my girlfriend

573
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,840
my family had found for me.

574
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,350
We dated for a period of time

575
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:13,740
and found that we were not for each other.

576
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:15,760
So we broke up.

577
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:16,920
Then I met you.

578
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:19,380
But her mum
had a heart attack

579
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,950
for which a surgery was needed.

580
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:22,810
So you see?

581
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:32,470
So...

582
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:34,310
Do you believe him?

583
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:37,110
My instinct tells me
that he was not lying to me.

584
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,200
Yi Yi.

585
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,680
Has your instinct ever worked?

586
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:44,720
Of course.

587
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,300
My instinct was right about you

588
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:47,450
and Mr. Zhang, wasn't it?

589
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,910
Then,

590
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,380
what about Lin Nuo?

591
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:58,560
Are you breaking up with him?

592
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,960
I never thought about
breaking up with him.

593
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,860
Then what about Gu Xiao?

594
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:07,840
No idea.

595
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,070
But I have forgiven him.

596
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,240
You still love him?

597
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:19,690
I don't know.

598
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:22,020
Don't ask me such difficult questions.

599
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:24,050
Will you continue looking
for romantic quotes?

600
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,560
Yes, of course.

601
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:26,560
Come on, go on.

602
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,070

Worth reading.

606

Pretty interesting.

607

Yes.

608
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:22,880
Very special.

609
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:29,860
All right.

Feel free to talk.

612

I think it's attractive

613
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:36,560
right from the title.

614
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:39,540

615
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,310

that we are well prepared

679
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,679
You must give me the true answer.

680
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,570
Many netizens

681

are curious as to

682
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,520
why your comic is so sweet.

683
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:43,340
Is it because you had some

684
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:46,040
sweet love experiences in your life?

685
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,190
Well, it's a little bit
difficult to answer.

686
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:52,190
I suddenly

687
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:54,810
came up with the inspiration

688
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:59,000
after Mr. Zhang forced a kiss on me.

689
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,410
And then I just drew it.

690
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,950
