1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I

4
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,560
I

5
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:57,460
called

6
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,260
Come on.

7
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,260
Be careful.

8
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,380
Comrades,

9
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,460
Chief, we've brought the patient to the hospital.

10
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,460
Take it easy.

11
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,460
Take it easy.

12
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,460
Take it easy.

13
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,460
Take it easy.

14
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,460
You two, take it easy.

15
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,460
Take it easy.

16
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,460
Take it easy.

17
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,460
Take it easy.

18
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,460
Chief, you're all like this.

19
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,460
Why are you so unwell?

20
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,460
Chief, you have to be careful.

21
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,460
I'm not that important.

22
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,460
I'm not that important.

23
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,460
I'm not that important.

24
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,460
You're just resting.

25
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,460
Right.

26
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,460
I didn't expect that.

27
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,460
I'm a cat.

28
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,460
Chief, you're all like this.

29
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,460
You've been resting for a few days.

30
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,460
You still don't trust us.

31
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,460
Right.

32
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,460
What are you talking about?

33
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,460
You have to work.

34
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,460
This demon is not a patient.

35
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,460
Besides,

36
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,460
I've been here for a few days.

37
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:46,460
Every day is more precious than every day.

38
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,460
Chief, you're so sad.

39
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,460
You're not a retired.

40
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,460
You went to the police station.

41
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,460
You're not a retired.

42
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,460
You're a retired.

43
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,460
You can come back anytime

44
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,460
and take a look at the hospital.

45
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,460
Right?

46
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,460
Yes.

47
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,460
What's the problem?

48
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:08,460
We police are all ordinary people.

49
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,460
In Paris,

50
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,460
we worked hard

51
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:16,460
to create a warm and warm community.

52
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,460
But in recent years,

53
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:22,460
Paris has been a little more and more difficult.

54
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,460
There are many things to do.

55
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,460
So, this is the third system.

56
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,460
Chief, don't worry.

57
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,460
Before you retired,

58
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:34,460
we had to take a look at the first place.

59
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,460
We had to take the money with us.

60
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:41,460
It's a good idea to keep a look at Paris.

61
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,460
Paris is a place

62
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,460
that can create a new history

63
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,460
if you want to fight for the first place.

64
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,460
I'm satisfied with the new achievement.

65
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,460
We want to be the first place.

66
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,460
You're so excited.

67
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,460
I'm going to do something good.

68
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,460
I've decided to

69
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,460
take the time to study

70
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,460
and work hard

71
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,460
for the next six months.

72
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,460
Thank you.

73
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,460
Thank you.

74
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,460
Thank you.

75
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,460
Thank you.

76
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,460
Thank you.

77
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,460
Thank you for trusting me.

78
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,460
Thank you, Chief.

79
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:18,460
Thank you.

80
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,460
I'll work hard.

81
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,460
Thank you.

82
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,460
This is the second team

83
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,460
of the Paris He-Pieze Club.

84
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,460
Right.

85
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,460
By the way,

86
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,460
you've been a teacher for Jiwei for half a year.

87
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,460
Jiwei,

88
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,460
follow me.

89
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,460
Follow me.

90
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,460
This is my dad and Xu

91
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,460
and Du this afternoon.

92
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,460
Follow me.

93
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,460
What are you talking about?

94
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,460
It's my dad.

95
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,460
Okay, okay.

96
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,460
You're not in the right shape.

97
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,460
What do you think of Zhao?

98
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,460
Zhao,

99
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,460
you should do it yourself.

100
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,460
You're going to be a transfer soon.

101
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,460
You have to work hard.

102
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,460
Tell me.

103
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,460
You should take care of Zhao.

104
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,460
This is the community.

105
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,460
You've been doing a great job

106
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,460
for the time I've been working on.

107
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,460
You've been working on it

108
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,460
for a long time.

109
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,460
Yes.

110
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,460
Okay,

111
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,460
let's all do it.

112
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,460
Get ready for the morning meeting.

113
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,460
Can you do it?

114
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,460
I'm not good.

115
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,460
I'll just stand there.

116
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,460
I'll just stand there.

117
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,460
Okay.

118
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,460
Come on, let's go.

119
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,460
If you say so,

120
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,460
I can't solve the problem

121
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,460
of the back door.

122
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,460
No,

123
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,460
we can.

124
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,460
But,

125
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,460
our neighborhood is quite old.

126
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,460
There's no underground car shop.

127
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,460
The car can only stop by the side.

128
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,460
There's less monitoring in the neighborhood.

129
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,460
In the country,

130
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,460
we've provided some convenience

131
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,460
to the criminal to jump into the back door.

132
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,460
At the same time,

133
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,460
we've also brought some difficulties

134
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,460
to break this case.

135
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,460
So...

136
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,460
What?

137
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,460
So I should be punished?

138
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,460
No,

139
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,460
we can't say that.

140
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,460
I hope you can be patient.

141
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,460
Give us more time.

142
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,460
It's been half a month.

143
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,460
There's no traffic at all.

144
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,460
Since the attack on the back door,

145
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,460
the two-way street in the neighborhood

146
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,460
has been knocked down.

147
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,460
Do you care?

148
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,460
If Officer Zhang is here,

149
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,460
he won't be like this.

150
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,460
What's going on?

151
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,460
What's going on?

152
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,460
Brother Cao?

153
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,460
You're off work?

154
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,460
Why are you standing here?

155
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,460
Look at this car.

156
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,460
There's no underground car shop in this neighborhood.

157
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,460
The car can only stop by the side.

158
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,460
The weather is hot.

159
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,460
The thief is also living.

160
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,460
Recently,

161
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,460
a car accident happened in the street.

162
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,460
The car was knocked down by the back door.

163
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,460
I've responded to the traffic.

164
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,460
I want them to install more cameras.

165
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,460
They said that

166
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,460
when the high price is fixed,

167
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,460
we'll plan it together.

168
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,460
We'll adjust this.

169
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,460
When the high price is fixed,

170
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,460
we'll have to spend a lot of time.

171
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,460
That's what I'm saying.

172
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,460
If people can't catch me,

173
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,460
the group will start to complain.

174
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,460
They'll complain a lot these days.

175
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,460
Then we have to catch them.

176
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,460
If there's no surveillance,

177
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,460
we won't break the case.

178
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,460
When I was in the city,

179
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,460
that person said the same thing.

180
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,460
But if there's no surveillance,

181
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,460
I can't catch them.

182
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,460
The police's boss

183
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,460
is a basic worker.

184
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,460
He's a guard.

185
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,460
A guard.

186
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,460
You mean,

187
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,460
we have to catch them in the street?

188
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,460
That's not it.

189
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,460
We can do something else.

190
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,460
Police.

191
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,460
Let me help you.

192
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,460
Brother Cao, no need.

193
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,460
No need.

194
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,460
Well,

195
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,460
I'm the chief of the police.

196
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,460
What's the chief?

197
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,460
The...

198
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,460
I'm not the chief.

199
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,460
Brother Cao,

200
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,460
I'm waiting for you at home.

201
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,460
Why don't you go home?

202
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,460
Well,

203
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,460
I'm leaving, too.

204
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,460
I'm leaving.

205
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,460
Bye.

206
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,460
Bye.

207
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,460
Bye.

208
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,460
Bye.

209
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,460
Bye.

210
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,460
Bye.

211
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,460
Bye.

212
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,460
Bye.

213
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,460
Bye.

214
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,460
Bye.

215
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,460
Bye.

216
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,460
Bye.

217
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,460
Bye.

218
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,460
Bye.

219
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,460
Bye.

220
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,460
Bye.

221
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,460
Bye.

222
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,460
Bye.

223
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,460
Bye.

224
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,460
Bye.

225
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,460
This is the road.

226
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,460
The south side of the station.

227
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,460
The four of us are here.

228
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,460
The four of us are over there.

229
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,460
Two of us.

230
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,460
According to my judgment,

231
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,460
the last case he did was three days ago.

232
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,460
According to his rule,

233
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:21,460
he will be here in a few days.

234
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,460
It's almost 1 p.m.

235
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,460
Everyone, please be careful.

236
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,460
I think he's almost here.

237
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,460
We'll take a look at the two of us

238
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,460
and put him in the car.

239
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,460
No hurry.

240
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,460
There's a long road.

241
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,460
There are several roads in the middle.

242
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,460
Once he shows up,

243
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,460
we'll block him.

244
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,460
And there's no one on the road

245
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,460
in the middle of the night.

246
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,460
Once he shows up,

247
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,460
he'll run away.

248
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,460
There are so many of us.

249
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,460
What are we going to do?

250
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,460
Hey,

251
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,460
let's talk about something good.

252
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,460
There are so many cars and trees on the road.

253
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,460
We should be able to hide.

254
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,460
Okay, okay.

255
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,460
Just do as Zhao said.

256
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,460
Zhao, Lao and Xu

257
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,460
are all on the road.

258
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,460
You go to the back road.

259
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,460
We'll block them.

260
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,460
We'll block them.

261
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,460
Let's go.

262
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,460
Don't make things difficult for him.

263
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,460
When he shows up in the morning,

264
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,460
I'll ask him to come over.

265
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,460
Here,

266
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,460
take Xiao Lin to the back road.

267
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,460
You stay here.

268
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,460
Okay, let's go.

269
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,460
This road is more difficult.

270
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,460
How about this?

271
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,460
One person is on the road.

272
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,460
Once he shows up,

273
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,460
one person will follow him.

274
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,460
What do you think?

275
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,460
Okay.

276
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,460
Mr. Qi,

277
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,460
you can't sleep.

278
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,460
You can't play with your phone.

279
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,460
You can't play with your phone.

280
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,460
Don't wake him up.

281
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,460
No, I'm not.

282
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,460
I'm not.

283
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,460
I'm not.

284
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,460
I'm not.

285
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,460
I'm not.

286
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,460
Xiao Chuan.

287
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,460
Who is it?

288
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,460
Cao Ge.

289
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,460
Why are you here?

290
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,460
It's hot.

291
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,460
I can't stay here.

292
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,460
I'm here to sit.

293
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,460
Come in.

294
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,460
Maybe he'll be here in a while.

295
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,460
Come on.

296
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,460
Let's go.

297
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,460
Come on.

298
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,460
Come over here.

299
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,460
Xiao Chuan.

300
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,460
Tell me.

301
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,460
I'll help you analyze

302
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,460
how much he has shown up.

303
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,460
Cao Ge,

304
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,460
that's it.

305
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,460
Okay, come on.

306
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,460
No.

307
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,460
Why did he come here?

308
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,460
I...

309
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,460
I did it.

310
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,460
What did you say?

311
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,460
I...

312
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,460
I didn't mean it.

313
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,460
I...

314
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,460
I didn't mean it.

315
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,460
What did you say?

316
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,460
I...

317
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,460
I...

318
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,460
I didn't mean it.

319
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,460
I didn't mean it.

320
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,460
I...

321
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,460
You go on.

322
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,460
What did you say

323
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,460
was the same?

324
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,460
I...

325
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,460
I...

326
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,460
I...

327
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,460
I...

328
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,460
I...

329
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,460
Be quiet.

330
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,460
Be quiet.

331
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,460
I...

332
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,460
I...

333
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,460
I...

334
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,460
I'll be here in a while.

335
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,460
I'll be here in a while.

336
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,460
I'll be here in a while.

337
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,460
Xiao Ting.

338
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,460
Didn't Wen Zi call you?

339
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,460
Why not?

340
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,460
Didn't I say

341
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,460
I shouldn't call you?

342
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,460
Cao Jian is here, too.

343
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,460
He was here before we went there.

344
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,460
Nonsense.

345
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,460
You didn't tell him

346
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,460
how he knew about it?

347
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,460
I...

348
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,460
I didn't tell him.

349
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,460
I...

350
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,460
I didn't tell him.

351
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,460
President.

352
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,460
Can you give

353
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,460
Cao Jian a chance?

354
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,460
No.

355
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,460
First,

356
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,460
he's not our person.

357
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,460
Second,

358
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,460
we didn't ask him

359
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,460
to help us.

360
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,460
It has nothing to do with him.

361
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,460
Did you hear me?

362
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,460
But...

363
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,460
But what?

364
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,460
Go down.

365
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,460
What?

366
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,460
What did you say?

367
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,460
I asked the police to help us.

368
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,460
They didn't listen.

369
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,460
Why do you hate

370
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,460
Jian Jun so much?

371
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,460
He's a good guy.

372
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,460
He's a good guy.

373
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,460
What do you think?

374
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,460
You think he's okay?

375
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,460
He's in the police station.

376
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,460
He's in the police station.

377
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,460
The police are here.

378
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,460
Let's go.

379
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,460
Go.

380
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,460
Jian Jun.

381
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,460
Brother Cao.

382
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,460
Did you see me run away?

383
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,460
I didn't.

384
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,460
I... I didn't run away.

385
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,460
How is it?

386
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,460
It's good for you

387
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,460
to have a good relationship with your son.

388
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,460
I think it's good.

389
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,460
How much is it?

390
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,460
Three thousand and five.

391
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,460
Three thousand and five

392
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,460
is a little too little.

393
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,460
It's not enough.

394
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,460
No.

395
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,460
It's half less than him.

396
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,460
Jian Jun.

397
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,460
There's an old saying

398
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,460
called

399
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,460
A man who loves his wife for a hundred years.

400
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,460
It makes sense.

401
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,460
You married a wife.

402
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,460
You hope she'll follow you

403
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,460
and you'll follow you.

404
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,460
But what's the point?

405
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,460
Zhou Hui is a good woman.

406
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,460
But a good woman

407
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,460
isn't used to test her.

408
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,460
She's been through so much for you.

409
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,460
You have to let her live a good life

410
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,460
so that she can treat you well.

411
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,460
You have to do it well.

412
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,460
Make more money.

413
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,460
And get the family back.

414
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,460
Aren't you the one in the prison now?

415
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,460
I hope you don't

416
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,460
take part in the prison anymore.

417
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,460
Do you understand?

418
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,460
I understand.

419
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,460
Fine.

420
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,460
I understand.

421
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,460
I'll say it here.

422
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,460
I hope I won't see you again.

423
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,460
Take care.

424
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,460
Detective.

425
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,460
Detective.

426
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:00,460
The prison is really different from me.

427
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,460
No.

428
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,460
You're no longer the person in the prison.

429
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,460
I'm sorry.

430
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,460
Why didn't you come at 3 o'clock?

431
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,460
I didn't come.

432
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,460
We can't even say

433
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,460
whether it's not coming.

434
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,460
Brother Cao.

435
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,460
I've got you a reward.

436
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,460
But...

437
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,460
I want a reward.

438
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,460
That's not good.

439
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,460
Brother Cao.

440
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,460
When we catch the thief,

441
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,460
I'll help you get the reward.

442
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,460
I don't want it.

443
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,460
Xiao Zhang.

444
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,460
You're so good.

445
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,460
Take good care of yourself.

446
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,460
I know it's not good.

447
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,460
Do you have friends?

448
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,380
No.

449
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,460
Brother Cao.

450
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,460
You can't even look at it.

451
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,460
You'll know it's not because of sound.

452
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,460
The speed of such an accident

453
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,140
is so fast

454
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,140
for a while?

455
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,140
You too.

456
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,140
You still have experience.

457
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,140
You still have the nerve to say that.

458
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,140
If I didn't tell you this,

459
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,140
I would have been so heartbroken.

460
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,140
But I'm not.

461
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,140
I'm going back to my room.

462
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,140
I'm going back to my room.

463
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,140
There's another person.

464
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,140
Look at this.

465
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:59,140
There's another person.

466
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:08,140
I'm afraid that I can't get up.

467
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:12,140
The more anxious you are, the less you can't get up.

468
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,140
When will you be anxious?

469
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,140
Maybe he will come.

470
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,140
This is a big job.

471
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,140
A big man.

472
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,140
He always takes the door and asks Wenzi to shake it.

473
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,140
I dare to say that after this job,

474
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,140
Wenzi is not a pig anymore.

475
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,140
The problem is that this job can still be done.

476
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:32,140
I'm afraid that he will come.

477
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,140
The problem is that this job can still be done.

478
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,140
Brother Xu, thank you.

479
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,140
Thank you.

480
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,140
I'm going to eat dinner.

481
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,140
Brother Du, I'll tell you.

482
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,140
Okay, okay.

483
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,140
I'll do the work.

484
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,140
The problem is that Xiaozhao,

485
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,140
you're right.

486
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,140
It's been four days.

487
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,140
I haven't seen anyone show up.

488
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,140
Xiaozhao, he's been here for several times.

489
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:59,140
Do you think that the oil here is almost done?

490
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,140
It's changed.

491
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,140
If it's not done,

492
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,140
Wenzi will be in vain.

493
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,140
How do you know?

494
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:08,140
But I think he will come.

495
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,140
You think?

496
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:12,140
Didn't you say that he did it once in three to five days?

497
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,140
It's been four days.

498
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,140
It's been seven days since he joined the front.

499
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,140
He hasn't shown up yet.

500
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,140
I don't know.

501
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,140
But he used to be such a coward.

502
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,140
Well, Ji Wei,

503
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,140
come here.

504
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,140
Look at this.

505
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,140
What's wrong?

506
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,140
You haven't shown up yet?

507
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,140
I'm in the east.

508
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,140
I'm so happy.

509
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,140
I know, boss.

510
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,140
Take this.

511
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,140
Let's find someone to help.

512
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,140
I'll go to the other side.

513
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,140
I'll find someone to help.

514
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,140
I'll be there in time.

515
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,140
Go.

516
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,140
Thank you, sir.

517
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,140
They're all at the fire station next door.

518
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,140
Look, they're all going to the boat.

519
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,140
Is it for the drinks?

520
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,140
No.

521
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,140
This is really good.

522
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,140
This is for your son.

523
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,140
Why is it so expensive?

524
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,140
It's even more expensive than this.

525
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,140
Of course, it's cheap.

526
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,140
Which one do you want?

527
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,140
I'll take this.

528
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,140
Okay.

529
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,140
40 is 42.

530
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,140
I want 8.

531
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,140
8?

532
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:02,140
This is a paper.

533
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,140
One is enough.

534
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,140
Do you want 8?

535
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,140
8.

536
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,140
Okay, fine.

537
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,140
7 chicken legs.

538
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,140
Boss, I'll get another bottle of water.

539
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,140
Okay.

540
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,140
Please help me put 7 drops.

541
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,140
7 drops?

542
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,140
Okay.

543
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,140
And the head meat.

544
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:28,140
How many do you want?

545
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,140
12.

546
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,140
Okay, let's go.

547
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,140
Excuse me, this is the toilet.

548
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,140
How is it, boss?

549
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,140
Do you have any news about tonight?

550
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,140
I don't know.

551
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,140
I'm worried.

552
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,140
Don't worry.

553
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:59,140
You'll be out tonight.

554
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,140
I'll tell you.

555
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:09,140
Boss, if you don't show up tonight,

556
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,140
you'll have to find someone else tomorrow.

557
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,140
Okay.

558
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,140
Okay.

559
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:16,140
This is the night snack I prepared for you.

560
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,140
And this fan and this protective film.

561
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,140
You can touch it.

562
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,140
Okay.

563
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,140
Let's have some snacks.

564
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,140
Here, have some.

565
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,140
Here.

566
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,140
Here.

567
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,140
Thank you.

568
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,140
Here.

569
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,140
Here.

570
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,140
Here, go ahead.

571
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,140
I'll get you some.

572
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,140
Here.

573
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,140
Boss.

574
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,140
Here.

575
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,140
Here.

576
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,140
Water.

577
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,140
Here.

578
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:49,140
Please help me.

579
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,140
Please help me.

580
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,140
Please help me.

581
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:04,140
I don't have a chance to go back.

582
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,140
Boss.

583
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,140
Boss.

584
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,140
What did you say?

585
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,140
I said I...

586
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:20,140
I don't believe it.

587
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,140
What do I have?

588
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,140
Boss.

589
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:25,140
You should touch this fan.

590
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,140
It's too much.

591
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,140
Here.

592
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,140
I don't want it.

593
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,140
I'm going to bite the scissors.

594
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,140
Comrade.

595
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,140
Comrade.

596
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,140
Comrade.

597
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,140
Here.

598
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,140
Please take a look.

599
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,140
Here.

600
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,140
Look.

601
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,140
Is it you who reported the police?

602
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,140
Yes.

603
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,140
It's me who reported the police.

604
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,140
We've been here for five days.

605
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,140
They're here to investigate.

606
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,140
What's the problem?

607
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:13,140
It means that the safety rules of our previous analysis are not established.

608
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,140
Brother Xu, don't say that.

609
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:18,140
The people who reported the police are the rules of the previous analysis.

610
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,140
They're alive.

611
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,140
Who would have thought that they went there last night?

612
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:24,140
Then did he find out that we were waiting for him?

613
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:27,140
If it was there, we wouldn't have been waiting for him.

614
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,140
Impossible.

615
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:31,140
How would he know that he didn't use the gun in our group?

616
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:35,140
The latest version shows that he has a big range of crimes.

617
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,140
How can we hide it from him?

618
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,140
Here.

619
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,140
What's the matter?

620
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,140
Are you in a hurry?

621
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,140
Here.

622
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,140
Sit.

623
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,140
It's okay.

624
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:52,140
At least it shows that the rules of the previous analysis are correct.

625
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:55,140
Didn't he come out yesterday?

626
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:58,140
If he turns into a rascal,

627
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:01,140
he can't get away from the same place.

628
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,140
I'm sorry.

629
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:11,140
I've made you suffer.

630
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,140
It's okay.

631
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:18,140
It's normal to climb the stairs.

632
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:20,140
According to the rules you've studied,

633
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:22,140
he jumped once every three to five days.

634
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,140
No, he jumped all night.

635
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:27,140
At least he won't do it again in three days.

636
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,140
Let's all take a break.

637
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:34,140
It's really hard to get over this.

638
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,140
Thank you.

639
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,140
Why?

640
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:43,140
We've been taking a break for three days.

641
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:48,140
Let's study and see if there's any place we can lose.

642
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,140
I'm sorry.

643
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,140
Sit down.

644
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,140
You're fine.

645
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,140
Zhao.

646
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,140
It's been eight days.

647
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,140
When will you be able to get it?

648
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,140
Can you still earn it?

649
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,340
Sorry, I made you suffer.

650
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:49,140
What? You? Who are you?

651
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:00,140
Sorry, I don't know how to speak.

652
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:03,740
But if I can't catch her, I'll keep stewing.

653
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,740
I know it's been hard for you.

654
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:10,340
Or you can rest. I'll go by myself.

655
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,340
Fine, go by yourself.

656
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,340
Go away.

657
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,340
Listen, listen.

658
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,340
What are you talking about?

659
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,340
I'm the only one.

660
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,340
Why are you doing this for her?

661
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,340
Is it for her?

662
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,340
She's for her own good.

663
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,340
What's wrong with you?

664
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:36,340
I haven't caught her yet.

665
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,340
Xiao Jie.

666
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,340
Xiao Jie.

667
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,340
Xiao Jie, wake up.

668
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,340
Xiao Jie.

669
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,340
Xiao Jie, wake up.

670
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,340
Xiao Jie.

671
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,340
It's 1 o'clock.

672
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,340
We didn't call her here. She's leaving.

673
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,340
Okay.

674
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,340
Hurry up.

675
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,340
Did you go to the bathroom?

676
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,340
I don't want to.

677
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,340
I'm going to bite the scissors.

678
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,340
Hurry up.

679
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,340
Xu, don't go to the bathroom.

680
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,340
Xiao Ding, don't try to be naive.

681
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:30,340
I'm going to change.

682
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,340
I can't go to work.

683
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,340
Why are you so busy?

684
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,340
Director.

685
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,340
Director.

686
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,340
Xiao Zhou is here.

687
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,340
You're all here.

688
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,340
Why didn't you follow Xiao Zhou?

689
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,340
Director.

690
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,340
Xiao Zhou is too good at talking.

691
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,340
Don't be so slow.

692
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,340
Hurry up.

693
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,340
Let's go to the bathroom.

694
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,340
You're not late, right?

695
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,340
I'm not late.

696
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,340
Xiao Zhou.

697
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,340
This way.

698
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,340
Brother Cao.

699
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:29,340
Why are you here alone today?

700
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,340
It's okay.

701
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,340
They can do it.

702
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,340
I'm not going to go to the bathroom.

703
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,340
I'm going to the bathroom.

704
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,340
How about this?

705
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,340
Let's take a shot.

706
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,340
If he comes,

707
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,340
we'll just chase him from one direction.

708
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,340
You stay here.

709
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,340
I'll go that way.

710
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,340
Brother Cao.

711
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,340
Thank you.

712
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,340
I'm sorry.

713
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,340
Hello there.

714
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:48,340
Xiao Zhou wants to see you.

715
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,340
And here,

716
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,340
it's very stuffy.

717
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,340
Get out of my room.

718
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,340
Mister Cao.

719
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,340
Xiao Chuan.

720
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,340
Are you here to grow?

721
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:16,340
How many people are there?

722
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:22,340
What's wrong?

723
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:26,340
Why are you looking at me?

724
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,340
You are my sister.

725
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,340
Look.

726
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,340
The whole room.

727
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:43,340
Your mom is so touched.

728
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:45,340
She has been taking care of people.

729
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,340
She came to support you.

730
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,340
Now, it's our family's fault.

731
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,340
This person is not a good person.

732
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,340
We are not sick.

733
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,340
There is.

734
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,340
Look at your mom.

735
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,340
She is so noisy.

736
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,340
Mom.

737
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,340
Mom.

738
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,340
She is crying.

739
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,340
She is in danger.

740
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:20,340
She is falling.

741
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,340
She is not falling.

742
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,340
She is holding a hat.

743
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:24,340
She is holding a handkerchief.

744
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:26,340
Sit down. Sit down. Sit down.

745
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,340
I want to take your medicine.

746
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:32,340
It's okay. Sit down. Sit down.

747
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,340
It's okay.

748
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,340
Why are you so angry?

749
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,340
Sit down.

750
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,340
I have a fish.

751
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,340
Okay.

752
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,340
I have water.

753
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,340
Okay.

754
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,340
I have a fire extinguisher.

755
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,340
I want it.

756
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,340
It's not bad.

757
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:02,340
You are prepared to fight.

758
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:05,340
You are not prepared to fight, are you?

759
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:06,340
Are you like this?

760
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,340
Okay.

761
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,340
I have to praise you.

762
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:12,340
But you tell me.

763
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,340
Why are you crying?

764
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:23,340
I feel that I am very stupid.

765
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,340
I can't say anything.

766
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:27,340
I can't say anything.

767
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,340
Sometimes, I do things wrong.

768
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:31,340
I don't know what to do.

769
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,340
I want to find a question.

770
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,340
I don't know who to ask.

771
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,340
I used to have my master.

772
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,340
Now, my master is gone.

773
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,340
Xiaochun.

774
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,340
I always remember you.

775
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:51,340
When I just got into the police.

776
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:55,340
My 7 o'clock is far from you.

777
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,340
I came out of the countryside.

778
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:01,340
I have not been through the year.

779
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,340
After I became a few years' soldier.

780
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,340
I returned to the public security system.

781
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,340
I became a civil police officer.

782
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,340
Chief.

783
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:12,340
You also came out of the countryside.

784
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,340
No way.

785
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:17,340
When we were children.

786
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,340
We came out of the city.

787
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,340
There are no beauty.

788
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,340
There are no roots.

789
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,340
What's the point?

790
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:29,340
It's just that we can suffer.

791
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:32,340
We stand here.

792
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,340
We stand here.

793
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:35,340
We walk here.

794
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,340
We walk here.

795
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,340
We run here.

796
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:40,340
We do things more than others.

797
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:44,340
What's the point?

798
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,340
When we see something.

799
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,340
We don't know what to do.

800
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,340
But when we see something.

801
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,340
We can find it.

802
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,340
When we see something.

803
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,340
We can find it.

804
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,340
When we see something.

805
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,340
We can find it.

806
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,340
But the thing about the pain.

807
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,340
When we were children.

808
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:07,340
We didn't have this life.

809
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:16,340
You can be a good civil police officer.

810
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:20,340
You can be a good civil police officer.

811
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:26,340
I know you are close to the police.

812
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:30,340
Remember his teachings.

813
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:33,340
You think you can be a good civil police officer.

814
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,340
Chief.

815
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,340
I remember.

816
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,340
Is it her?

817
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,340
It's me.

818
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,340
Come.

819
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:14,340
Come.

820
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,340
Come.

821
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,340
Come on.

822
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,340
Come on.

823
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:26,340
Where did she say she was?

824
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,340
I said don't forget.

825
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,020
What did you say?

826
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:33,900
Don't forget to go home.

827
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,340
Did I say something?

828
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:41,060
I said don't forget to remind me

829
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:42,860
to tell you to go home.

830
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:45,860
You have a big fist.

831
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,660
After this...

832
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,460
Let's go.

833
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,780
S夜薄

834
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,580
Oh, my God.

835
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:21,580
Mor WAY

836
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:26,700
Chief

837
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,080
Stop

838
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,580
Well, come up

839
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:38,540
Mountain is beaten

840
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:39,660
güzel

841
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:40,380
I'll stand for the first one

842
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:41,480
photo

843
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,180
Manage it

844
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,700
Where is the mindset

845
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:43,900
You let me in

846
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,100
and the outside

847
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,020
Bring him a one in

848
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,140
I'm an example

849
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:47,700
What's wrong?

850
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:48,860
Zuo Zuo, you're here too?

851
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:51,180
Did I say that I'm a waiter?

852
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:53,740
It was said that the security guard was a good man.

853
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:57,340
I didn't expect that he would be caught the first day of work.

854
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,340
Can I go first?

855
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:02,700
Chief.

856
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,780
Where's the one who followed you?

857
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,980
He was here when I came.

858
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,980
How many times have I told you?

859
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,460
Don't look for him.

860
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:13,780
Why don't you listen?

861
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:16,380
Chief, I'm not listening.

862
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:20,540
Why are you so terms of ?

863
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:21,040
Chief

864
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:23,140
All right.

865
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:25,440
Let's go where we came from.

866
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:33,940
Director Guo

867
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:39,060
Our guys

868
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,620
Since they were built by him,

869
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,340
There are blisters everywhere.

870
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:46,340
A total of some people are buried there.

871
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,300
50,000 yuan.

872
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,460
Xiao Zhao, you've done your job well.

873
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,740
You've solved the case.

874
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,700
I didn't solve it.

875
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,660
Everyone did.

876
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,180
Look, look, look.

877
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,620
Master is not here.

878
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:59,620
He just learned the case.

879
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,540
He even learned the precepts.

880
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:02,500
Let's round up the price.

881
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,380
I'm serious.

882
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:16,020
I'm here at their place.

883
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:17,620
It's been almost a year.

884
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:20,020
I've been very sleepy

885
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:21,940
in this year.

886
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,580
I don't know if I can

887
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:26,100
become a good cop.

888
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:28,100
I don't know

889
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:29,940
if I can do well.

890
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,060
But I know now.

891
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,180
What do you know?

892
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:37,540
My master once told me

893
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:39,780
I have no other ability.

894
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:41,700
As long as I can suffer,

895
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,060
work hard,

896
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:44,260
I'll work hard.

897
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,260
Everyone will see it sooner or later.

898
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:47,620
I understand now.

899
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:48,740
That's what he meant.

900
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:00,660
He called me

901
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:01,460
just now.

902
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,540
He said we should go to his place.

903
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:05,060
We'll have news.

904
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,220
I think so.

905
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:08,740
Let's go.

906
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:09,300
Okay.
