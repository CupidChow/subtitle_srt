I don't know how Li David is inside

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,520
It's almost time to move

7
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,380
On the second day

The boss is there.

00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,400

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,200
Hurry up!

00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,040

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:24,920
Be careful!

59
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,480
Hurry up!

00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,840
Don't move.

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,520
Go, go.

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,060

00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,420

00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,300

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,040

łec entry!

69
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,680
Bring that over here!

70
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,380
Hi.

71
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,700
Clearly, we have taken three days.

72
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,540
General Manager.

73
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,420
General!

74
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,100
General!

75
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,460
General!

76
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:34,980
Brother-in-law!

77
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,860
Nothing happened.

78
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,020
It's not possible!

79
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,020
You're not the police!

80
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,380
No, brother-in-law.

81
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,660
Why are you here?

82
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,180
Did you get caught?

83
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,260
Tell me if you have nothing to say.

84
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,380
I found them.

85
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,820
You got caught?

86
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,340
Yes.

87
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,220
You got caught?

88
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,380
They suddenly...

89
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,340
I got caught in my heart.

90
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,260
Heart?

91
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,580
I got caught?

92
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,780
No, I went to the blue sky.

93
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,460
It's okay.

94
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,020
As long as you got caught,

95
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,580
they won't blame you.

96
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,740
I'll go to the police and ask them

97
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,820
who is so organized

98
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,380
to catch my brother-in-law?

99
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,700
You...

100
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,940
Don't care if you're right or wrong.

101
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,500
Can you give me the old chief first?

102
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,580
Brother-in-law, look.

103
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,500
This action

104
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,380
is unified by the whole community.

105
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,700
The law is strict.

106
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,700
Who dares to be the top officer at this time?

107
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,060
The police won't do it.

108
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,260
But don't worry.

109
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,420
As long as you don't get caught,

110
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,100
you won't do anything illegal.

111
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,220
The problem is not big.

112
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,580
They got caught?

113
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,300
But...

114
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,100
They took me from the bed.

115
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:46,980
Brother-in-law, you...

116
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,820
No, no.

117
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,740
I really can't think of it.

118
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,180
How could you?

119
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,500
Can you call your sister-in-law?

120
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,580
I mean...

121
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,540
I mean...

122
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,940
Someone in our company

123
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,540
was caught by the sea

124
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,100
in Somali.

125
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,700
I went to negotiate

126
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,740
and saved him.

127
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:08,660
I won't go home for now.

128
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,060
But you went to Somali

129
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,660
and didn't say hello to my sister.

130
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,580
But you told me.

131
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,100
Isn't it weird?

132
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,540
How about this?

133
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,260
I'll ask Zhou Hui to talk to her.

134
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,380
No, no, no.

135
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,540
Your daughter-in-law is so thoughtful.

136
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,420
She's a fake.

137
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,460
Fine.

138
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,260
Brother-in-law,

139
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,980
take good care of yourself.

140
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,820
I'll go and see if there's any other way.

141
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,580
Well...

142
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:55,420
We'll see you in the Со-ünder.

143
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,220
Hui Hui.

144
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,460
Hui Hui.

145
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,340
Dad.

146
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,500
Let's have dinner.

147
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,940
Also, we'll have a business trip this evening.

148
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:16,940
What?

149
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,020
Do you want to know something?

150
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,020
My sister is crying inside.

151
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,580
What happened?

152
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,940
My brother-in-law suddenly disappeared.

153
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,420
He called his phone and turned it off.

154
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,700
The car wasn't in the company.

155
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,020
He asked everyone where he went.

156
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,500
Jianjun.

157
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,620
Your sister is here.

158
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,380
Jianjun.

159
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:43,700
He might have something wrong with your brother-in-law.

160
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,860
I was so angry.

161
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,420
I really had no other choice.

162
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,740
I came to see you.

163
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,740
Jianjun.

164
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,780
Don't panic.

165
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,820
Sit down.

166
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,740
Let's go to work.

167
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,660
Sit down.

168
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,900
What happened?

169
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,340
Your brother-in-law went to work in the company.

170
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,940
Then he didn't go home.

171
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,620
Sometimes, he doesn't work in the company.

172
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,580
It's normal.

173
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,820
So I didn't take it seriously.

174
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,500
But until today...

175
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,900
Until today, he hasn't reported anything.

176
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,460
I was a little nervous.

177
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,500
Then I called him.

178
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,580
I called him a lot.

179
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,300
But the phone was off.

180
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,220
I went to the company to find him.

181
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:37,180
But no one knew where he went.

182
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,820
He might have been kidnapped.

183
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,460
No, no.

184
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,660
No way.

185
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,700
Jianjun.

186
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,260
You're the police. Help me.

187
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,900
You can't find him.

188
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,460
Jianjun.

189
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,500
Don't worry.

190
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,260
Sit down.

191
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,340
Wait.

192
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,380
Come here.

193
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,580
I'll talk to you.

194
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,580
Jianjun will figure it out.

195
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,580
Sit down.

196
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,620
Don't cry.

197
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,620
Why are you cooking?

198
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,500
Don't you know what it is?

199
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:30,980
Shun.

200
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,340
He went to Somali.

201
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,380
Where?

202
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:44,260
He was kidnapped by an employee.

203
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,820
He went to Somali to rescue the employee.

204
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,820
Mr. Cao.

205
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,420
You're stupid.

206
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,100
You said he went to Somali

207
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,180
to rescue the employee who was kidnapped.

208
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,660
But he didn't believe me.

209
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,500
Is that the kind of person Sun Yongguang is?

210
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,700
What are you laughing at?

211
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,900
You're so stupid.

212
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,060
I told Sun Yongguang

213
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,820
that he couldn't do it.

214
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,220
He didn't let me say that.

215
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,820
He told you?

216
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,340
He saw you.

217
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:20,940
Where is he?

218
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,460
Why can't he come back?

219
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,860
Don't worry.

220
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,380
I'll go.

221
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,860
Don't be silly.

222
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,700
Are you sure?

223
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,860
Are you sure?

224
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,580
Are you sure?

225
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,580
Yes.

226
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,020
Is there a fake one?

227
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,020
Sure.

228
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,700
Sun Yongguang.

229
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,860
He's so talented.

230
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,420
He can make up a lie like Somali.

231
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,180
He's making me a fool.

232
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,860
Even if I'm a fool,

233
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,420
he still has my sister.

234
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,620
He's a very good man.

235
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,820
He's a good man.

236
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:03,980
Because of that,

237
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,100
he hasn't told Soli to tell his family.

238
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,260
What should I do?

239
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,460
What should I do?

240
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,860
Tell the truth.

241
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,140
I must tell my mom.

242
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,660
What kind of person is he?

243
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,740
I knew it.

244
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,380
He's not a good man.

245
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,900
He's so fast.

246
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,300
But he's a good man.

247
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,540
If he tells Soli,

248
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,860
he'll be in trouble.

249
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,180
What should I do?

250
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,500
He'll be in trouble.

251
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,740
Why do you keep such a old man?

252
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,780
Wait for me.

253
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,620
Leave my younger sister a person.

254
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,060
If it's seu,

255
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,500
assign all in all.

256
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,220
Another comment.

257
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,300
She's an expert at rumors.

258
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,140
About the sc להיות.

259
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,100
I'm afraid that暴辰

260
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,060
he'll be dead in no time.

261
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:02,540
No.

262
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:04,460
You think

263
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,940
barrels the��

264
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:07,300
things

265
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,540
When your brothers

266
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,660
gets to know that

267
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:14,420
we took the killer

268
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:19,700
I'll still follow your order

269
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,300
Really

270
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:29,820
What is the legal

271
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,540
component of the criminal

272
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,740
to ensure that such scenes

273
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,620
Don't350

274
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,700
This is the situation.

275
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,820
My brother-in-law is in the prison of the Jians.

276
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,140
The Jians have already been in love with my brother-in-law.

277
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,900
But because of my brother-in-law,

278
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,900
I was still naked and was carried from my sister's bed.

279
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,500
So there's really no way.

280
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:56,940
Don't worry. Let's think of a way to save my brother-in-law first.

281
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,500
Okay?

282
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,300
Brother-in-law.

283
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,900
Where did you guys catch him?

284
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,700
Did you make a mistake?

285
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:10,100
Sister, don't be too anxious.

286
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,500
It's a wedding card of Lan Tingya.

287
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,900
It's 120,000 yuan.

288
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,700
Other people will vote for him.

289
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,300
He will vote for him.

290
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,900
Who will he vote for?

291
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,900
Didn't I tell you? He's a high-ranking person.

292
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,900
High-ranking? He has a reason.

293
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,500
He's a great person.

294
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,300
He's a great person.

295
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,700
He's worth 120,000 yuan.

296
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,100
He's really a good person.

297
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,300
I'm not a high-ranking person.

298
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,700
What are you talking about?

299
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,700
Sister.

300
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,700
Sister.

301
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,500
Sister, where are you going?

302
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,900
I...

303
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,100
Sister, wait for me.

304
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,700
I'm not going to go to the wedding.

305
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,500
I'm not going to go to the wedding.

306
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,500
What's wrong?

307
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,100
What's wrong?

308
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,100
What's wrong? Tell me.

309
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,300
Mom.

310
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,900
Mom.

311
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,500
What's wrong?

312
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,100
What's wrong?

313
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,300
I'm not going to go to the wedding.

314
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,900
What's wrong?

315
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,300
Brother-in-law.

316
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,500
What's wrong?

317
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,500
Tell me. What's wrong?

318
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,500
What's wrong?

319
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:29,700
Are you going to make me and your mom die in a hurry?

320
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,100
He...

321
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,100
He's being kidnapped.

322
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,300
He's getting paid, right? How much do you want?

323
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,700
Tell me.

324
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,500
Tell me. How much do you want?

325
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,900
He's a high-ranking person.

326
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,300
He's a high-ranking person.

327
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,300
What?

328
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,300
He's getting paid.

329
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:56,700
He's getting paid 120 million for the wedding.

330
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,500
120 million?

331
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,900
You're so lucky.

332
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,500
I want to divorce him.

333
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:07,300
I've always seen that he's not a good person.

334
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,900
Okay.

335
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,300
I should let the police teach him a lesson.

336
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,900
Get divorced.

337
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,900
You!

338
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:20,100
You're going to divorce him after saying everything!

339
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,300
Yes.

340
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,300
Let the police catch him.

341
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,500
And then make a good change in the police station.

342
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,500
If you don't change, you can't let him out.

343
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,500
I'm telling you, you owe him a debt of debt.

344
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,100
Don't cry.

345
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,500
You can cry. You can cry him back.

346
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,700
Don't cry. Don't cry.

347
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,700
He's going to do this.

348
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,700
I can't live anymore.

349
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,700
If you don't want to live, then just die.

350
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:53,700
If you don't want to live, then leave your family, your property and money to him.

351
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:58,700
If you want him to find someone younger and prettier than you,

352
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,700
then give him all of them.

353
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,700
Right?

354
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,700
You...

355
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,700
Why are you so idle?

356
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,700
Hurry up and cook noodles.

357
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,700
He's not eating.

358
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,700
He's tired.

359
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,700
Hurry up and go.

360
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,700
Put more hot soup.

361
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,700
Don't cry. You'll cry.

362
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,700
Mom, go to the room and talk to you. Listen to me.

363
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,700
It's easy for you to cry. Get up.

364
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,700
Get up. Listen to me.

365
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,700
Come. Don't cry.

366
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,700
Come.

367
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,700
Guess.

368
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,700
Listen to me.

369
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,700
You have to tell your sister about this.

370
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,700
Look at it.

371
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,700
I didn't know.

372
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,700
My brother-in-law told me.

373
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,700
He can do this.

374
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,700
He's a cop.

375
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,700
He should have called the police.

376
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,700
Then he should have taken her out.

377
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,700
Don't be angry with him.

378
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,700
We can't just forget him.

379
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,700
Mom, it's Sun Youguang.

380
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,700
Why do you blame him?

381
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,700
I want to divorce him.

382
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,700
Old Huahua is right.

383
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,700
A cat doesn't steal stars.

384
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,700
I told you before.

385
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,700
I'm a married man.

386
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,700
I'm a man.

387
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,700
If you don't take care of the house,

388
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,700
he'll be in trouble sooner or later.

389
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,700
You think your dad is honest?

390
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,700
You're in trouble.

391
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,700
What do you want?

392
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:04,700
You should have taken the sick.

393
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,700
You should have taken care of him.

394
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:11,700
You should have taken the financial power.

395
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,700
You should have done this.

396
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,700
It's easy for divorce.

397
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,700
You're divorced now.

398
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,700
You have to find another one.

399
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,700
You can find Sun Youguang.

400
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,700
You can find the condition of Sun Youguang.

401
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,700
You can find him.

402
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,700
You can find him.

403
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,700
You can promise that he won't go out with Sun Youguang

404
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,700
and find another woman.

405
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,700
You can promise me.

406
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,700
What you mean is...

407
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:44,700
I've thought about it.

408
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,700
You've thought about it.

409
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:02,700
Brother-in-law, you're here.

410
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,700
I have a business to attend to.

411
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,700
I don't need help.

412
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,700
I'll go and ask the leader.

413
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,700
You don't have to ask me.

414
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,700
I'll go and ask her.

415
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,700
I'll go and ask her.

416
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,700
You can ask her.

417
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,700
I'll go and ask her.

418
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,700
I'll go and ask her.

419
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,700
I'll go and ask her.

420
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,700
I asked the leader to get the key.

421
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,700
But he didn't have a choice.

422
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:35,500
He has already punished the most innocent person in the house.

423
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,700
I know.

424
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,500
The condition is not bad.

425
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,700
It's clean.

426
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,500
The fire is bad.

427
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,700
I'll drink with my friend for a few days.

428
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,700
I'll eat something good.

429
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,700
I'll get the lost paper back.

430
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,300
Brother-in-law.

431
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,500
You...

432
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,900
Let me tell you about the matter in the police station.

433
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,900
I told my sister.

434
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,300
She didn't believe me.

435
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,700
I was afraid that she would make a big deal out of it.

436
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,700
So I told her.

437
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,900
I know.

438
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,900
She'll know if she doesn't do anything.

439
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,900
It's okay. Don't mind her.

440
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,900
Don't you worry about my sister?

441
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,300
What am I worried about?

442
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,100
It's very suitable for me to stay here.

443
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,300
I understand.

444
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,500
I can't say a word.

445
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,900
It's been years since I've seen a face like this.

446
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,700
It's okay to change your mind.

447
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,900
If she really doesn't want to go, I'll make her do it.

448
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,700
No, brother-in-law.

449
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,300
You just need to rest.

450
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,300
I'll call you back.

451
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,300
Hui Hui, my sister has arrived.

452
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,500
I'm telling you.

453
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,300
I feel that she's not worried about anything.

454
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,300
No, it's just a little bit of a...

455
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,700
a little bit of a break.

456
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,300
No, is your sister here?

457
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:05,300
Why don't you call Yu Pang Zhang and tell her first?

458
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,900
Okay.

459
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,300
Okay.

460
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,300
Ding Mang, let's go.

461
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,500
Brother-in-law,

462
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,900
the phone that Hui Hui just called,

463
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:43,900
my sister is very angry now and very sad.

464
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,300
Where's her mother?

465
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,300
Her mother is fine.

466
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:53,900
She just wants to stay. She doesn't want to go back.

467
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:58,700
Brother-in-law, don't blame your brother for being so stubborn.

468
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:02,300
I think if you do this, it will be over.

469
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,700
Look, you're a very good person.

470
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,900
It's not good to hear such things.

471
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:12,700
After my sister heard it, she cried like a crybaby.

472
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,300
But she didn't say a word.

473
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:18,500
She even told her company's people that you went to Somali.

474
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,900
Where are they going to find her?

475
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,700
You're talking about my sister's personality.

476
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,700
That's a lot more gentle than Xiaohui, right?

477
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,700
She has a lot more to say.

478
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:31,700
So, don't be so close to her.

479
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:35,300
Go back to your place and make her feel better.

480
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,500
I can't be taken by her anyway.

481
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,300
Here, I'll give you a face.

482
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,300
Hui Hui, find a place to clean up.

483
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,300
I'll clean up the house.

484
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,300
No problem.

485
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,100
That's right.

486
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:56,300
Big husband can clean up.

487
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,300
Mom, I'm back.

488
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,300
Mom.

489
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,300
You're doing a good thing.

490
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:34,700
No, you're not. You're sorry to come back.

491
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,300
This is my home.

492
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,900
If I don't come back, where will I go?

493
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:43,100
I'm not a father, am I?

494
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:47,100
Do you still want your sister to always keep me away from home?

495
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,300
Hui Hui, hurry up.

496
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,300
Ask your sister to go.

497
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:58,100
If I don't eat or drink, I won't sleep.

498
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:02,100
You Guang, I'm not talking about you.

499
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:06,100
You did something wrong.

500
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:09,100
You've lost our whole family.

501
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:12,100
Have you ever thought about your child?

502
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:15,100
Luckily, our Congcong is still alive.

503
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:18,100
I'm not going to let you go.

504
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,100
I'm not going to let you go.

505
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,100
I'm not going to let you go.

506
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,100
Have you ever thought about your child?

507
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:29,100
Luckily, our Congcong is still alive.

508
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:32,100
I'm not going to let you go.

509
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,100
Sun You Guang,

510
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,100
I've thought about it.

511
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,100
I'm going to divorce you.

512
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,100
I'm going to stop you.

513
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,100
Look.

514
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,100
You have several companies.

515
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,100
They're going to divorce you.

516
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:59,100
You have to give half of your property to them.

517
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,100
It's my duty.

518
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:05,100
You have your own fault, right?

519
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,100
You made such a big mistake this time.

520
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,100
Do you remember?

521
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,100
Do you remember?

522
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,100
Hurry up and persuade your wife.

523
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,100
You're talking about such a good wife.

524
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,100
Hurry up.

525
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,100
I'm sorry.

526
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,100
Take your property here.

527
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,100
Okay.

528
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,100
That's all?

529
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,100
You're done?

530
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,100
I'm done.

531
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,100
What if I'm not done?

532
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,100
What if I'm not?

533
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,100
No.

534
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:42,100
When you were young,

535
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,100
that time,

536
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,100
you let me hide at the door.

537
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,100
I was crying and you didn't care about me.

538
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,100
You're done.

539
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,100
What's wrong?

540
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,100
What are you talking about?

541
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,100
What are you talking about?

542
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,100
Dad.

543
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,100
Don't hit me.

544
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,100
It's not their business.

545
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,100
It's not over.

546
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,100
I shouldn't have forgiven her.

547
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,100
I'm so angry when I see her.

548
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,100
Don't say that.

549
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,100
You're taking a break.

550
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,100
What's wrong? I'm wrong.

551
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,100
You've seen your sister's life.

552
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,100
You remember, right?

553
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,100
You should take a break.

554
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,100
What do you mean?

555
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,100
What do I mean?

556
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,100
Mom.

557
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,100
I know.

558
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,100
Stop talking.

559
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,100
Mom doesn't care.

560
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,100
What do you care?

561
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,100
What do you mean?

562
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,100
Jianjun.

563
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,100
Mom doesn't care, right?

564
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,100
How do you want me to care?

565
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,100
How do you want me to care?

566
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,100
If I care,

567
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,100
do you want them to leave?

568
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,100
No.

569
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,100
I don't even like to talk about you.

570
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,100
You're a little bit of a fool.

571
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,100
You're a big cop.

572
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,100
Your sister is in your police station.

573
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,100
You can't say something.

574
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,100
Take her out.

575
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,100
You're here to be a good person.

576
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,100
If you have the ability,

577
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,100
she can't be in trouble.

578
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,100
What?

579
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,100
Wait.

580
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,100
Mom, what do you mean?

581
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,100
What do I mean?

582
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,100
Who brought her here today?

583
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,100
My sister and I

584
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,100
got injured outside

585
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,100
and became Jianjun's fault.

586
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,100
She's going to be a cop.

587
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,100
She's a little bit of a cop.

588
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,100
She can stay with her for a few days.

589
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,100
Mom, you're so interesting.

590
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,100
You always say we're a cop.

591
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,100
But today, you're still like this.

592
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,100
So, you have a few debts.

593
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,100
You think she's like

594
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,100
the woman she's been working for.

595
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,100
Jianjun is so hardworking.

596
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,100
He can't even look at you.

597
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,100
You're so kind.

598
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,100
How did you marry me?

599
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,100
Huihui,

600
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,100
I'm against you.

601
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,100
I can't stand this anymore.

602
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,100
What?

603
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,100
You're free.

604
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,100
Jianjun is not rich.

605
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:34,100
I'm willing to live with him.

606
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,100
What's the relationship with you?

607
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,100
General Cao,

608
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,100
you're interesting.

609
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,100
Why do you care?

610
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,100
You should tell their company

611
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,100
to take her out of the valley.

612
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,100
What are you doing?

613
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,100
What's so glorious about this?

614
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,100
What do you mean?

615
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,100
Everyone should know about this.

616
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,100
What's wrong with you?

617
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,100
You have to piss me off.

618
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,100
I dare not piss you off.

619
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,100
You're so good at this.

620
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,100
You haven't even thought about it.

621
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,100
How can you die?

622
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,100
General Cao, go home.

623
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,100
Go home.

624
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,100
You're so capable.

625
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,100
You can go home if you don't want to.

626
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,100
Why don't you go home?

627
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,100
You haven't finished yet.

628
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,100
What do you want to say?

629
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,100
What else do you want to say?

630
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,100
Don't go, Huihui.

631
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,100
Don't go.

632
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,100
If you go,

633
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,100
you'll never come back.

634
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,100
I really don't want to go back.

635
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,100
You're so capable.

636
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:19,100
I've heard enough of what you said.

637
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,100
Can you hurry up?

638
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,100
Go.

639
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,100
Go.

640
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,100
Don't you really...

641
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,100
really think I didn't go out?

642
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,100
I'm bored.

643
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,100
But you're my man.

644
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,100
You've never done anything that sorry me.

645
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,100
Can you hurry up?

646
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,100
I can say that

647
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,100
others can't do it.

648
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,100
I'm not going anywhere.

649
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,100
I'm not going anywhere.

650
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,100
I'm going to the hospital.

651
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,100
I'm not going anywhere.

652
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,100
I'm not going anywhere.

653
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,100
I'm not going anywhere.

654
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,100
Let's go home.

655
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,100
Let's just live our lives.

656
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,100
Huihui.

657
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,100
One day,

658
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,100
I'll have you

659
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,100
with me.

660
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,100
What are you thinking?

661
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,100
Take your safety belt.

662
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,100
What's wrong?

663
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,100
I'm so angry.

664
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,100
Let's go home.

665
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,100
Mom.

666
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,100
Son.

667
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,100
Here.

668
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,100
Here.

669
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,100
Son, you're here.

670
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,100
Son, I'm behind you.

671
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,100
Behind you?

672
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,100
Be careful.

673
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,100
Don't get hurt.

674
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,100
Be careful.

675
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,100
Be careful.

676
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,100
Be careful.

677
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,100
Thank you.

678
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,100
Son,

679
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,100
take care, son.

680
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,100
Be careful.

681
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,100
Mom,

682
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,100
it's been more than a month since we left.

683
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,100
Is it enough?

684
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,100
We've been to

685
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,100
ten countries.

686
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,100
It's the place where your dad used to go.

687
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,100
You should say that your dad's life.

688
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,100
There are so many places to go.

689
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,100
That's the only place.

690
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,100
There are many places to go.

691
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,100
We won't be able to go back this time.

692
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,100
We won't.

693
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,100
We won't be able to go back.

694
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,100
Mom,

695
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,100
have some.

696
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,100
I'll eat it later.

697
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,100
He fell asleep.

698
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,100
I can't sleep anymore.

699
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,100
His things are in his mind.

700
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,100
His life,

701
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,100
I'm afraid,

702
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,100
he won't be able to sleep anymore.

703
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,100
Contact the hospital.

704
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,100
The hospital.

705
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,100
You didn't say that before.

706
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,100
Contact him.

707
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,100
Okay.

708
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,100
There's one more thing.

709
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,100
Your dad can't leave now.

710
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,100
If he stays in the hospital,

711
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,100
I'll be 24 hours in a row.

712
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,100
I'll be 24 hours in a row.

713
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,100
What about you?

714
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,100
I'll try.

715
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,100
But you know my job's job.

716
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,100
I know.

717
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,100
Your dad said that you're a police officer.

718
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,100
You're very busy.

719
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:19,100
He doesn't want to delay your work

720
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,100
because of his things.

721
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,100
But I think

722
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,100
your dad will be more responsible

723
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,100
before he leaves.

724
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,100
I'll go to the hospital.

725
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:00,100
The doctor said that he still has a lot of time left.

726
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,100
He won't be back for a month.

727
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,100
He just came back from abroad yesterday.

728
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,100
He's almost my mom's back.

729
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,100
A person?

730
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,100
Dawei,

731
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,100
you'll be fine this month.

732
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,100
You can take a leave of absence.

733
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,100
You can take care of him in the hospital.

734
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,100
You can stay with him for a day or two.

735
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,100
No, director.

736
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,100
My mom doesn't want me to do this.

737
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,100
She wants me to work less.

738
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,100
I just want to work less this month.

739
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,100
I'll talk to my mom.

740
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,100
She'll be here in the evening.

741
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,100
Okay, I got it.

742
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,100
You can go.

743
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,100
Thank you, director.

744
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,100
Hello, Yuebei.

745
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,100
Come over here.

746
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,100
Director, what's the matter?

747
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,100
Li Dawei's father is gone.

748
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,100
You see,

749
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,100
you can move the power

750
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,100
that can move in our lock.

751
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,100
Don't forget the brand.

752
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,100
Just a little bit.

753
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,100
Okay, I'll go.

754
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,100
Okay.

755
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,100
I'll go.

756
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,100
I can move the power.

757
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,100
I'll take a look.

758
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,100
Help Li Dawei

759
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,100
take care of his father in the hospital.

760
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,100
Okay.

761
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,100
Is something wrong?

762
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,100
Nothing.

763
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,100
Director.

764
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,100
I...

765
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,100
I want to work.

766
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,100
Where do you want to go?

767
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,100
To the police.

768
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,100
I'll recommend you

769
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,100
to the person

770
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,100
who needs to be in the police.

771
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,100
I...

772
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,100
I don't want to be a police anymore.

773
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,100
What?

774
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,100
Director,

775
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,100
don't misunderstand.

776
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,100
I've been a police for ten years.

777
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,100
If I hadn't been a police officer for ten years,

778
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,100
I wouldn't have been a criminal today.

779
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,100
But...

780
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,100
But I really have no choice.

781
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,100
I can't think of a better way.

782
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,100
So, I can't work

783
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,100
anymore.

784
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,100
What's going on?

785
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,100
What's wrong?

786
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,100
Why is it so serious?

787
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:41,100
Is it because of the old man?

788
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,100
My father is not well.

789
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,100
My uncle is in the ICU.

790
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,100
You know that

791
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,100
my father and I

792
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,100
are both children.

793
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,100
We are four old men.

794
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,100
Sometimes,

795
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,100
we can still bear

796
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,100
the illness of their lives.

797
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,100
But sometimes,

798
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,100
they are like

799
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,100
a couple

800
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,100
who are just like a couple.

801
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,100
They fall down together.

802
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,100
They have two children at home.

803
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,100
My head is in the water.

804
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,100
My head is in the water.

805
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,100
I don't know

806
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,100
what my surname is.

807
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:24,100
I want to ask Wang to leave.

808
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,100
But his income

809
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,100
is a big part of our family.

810
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,100
His work

811
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,100
is not paid

812
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,100
for work.

813
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,100
His boss said

814
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,100
he could ask for a leave.

815
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,100
But he didn't go to work.

816
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,100
So,

817
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,100
we

818
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,100
can't afford to pay for this.

819
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,100
But I am a police officer.

820
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,100
I am sorry

821
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,100
for the request of the police.

822
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,100
So, I want

823
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,100
to change

824
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,100
the unit of the youth.

825
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,100
In this way,

826
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,100
I can get some money.

827
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,100
The work

828
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,100
is provided to me.

829
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,400
So,

830
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,400
I can find a way.

831
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,100
Rui Rui,

832
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:28,100
when the police are tough,

833
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:28,900
besides

834
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,100
you areising to get a leave

835
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,100
from the law,

836
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,100
I agree

837
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:40,100
You just saw our police's work.

838
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:44,100
But our police's job is different from other jobs.

839
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:49,100
The more you are in trouble, the more you need this body.

840
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:52,100
The body can help.

841
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,100
Right?

842
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,100
You call.

843
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,100
You can take another form.

844
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,100
Let other colleagues in the lock room

845
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,100
also help you.

846
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,100
Take care of the old man.

847
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,100
No, director.

848
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:04,100
I am the instructor.

849
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,100
How can I let my colleagues help me

850
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,100
to do my family's work?

851
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,100
I can't do that.

852
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,100
Why not?

853
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,100
You can ask other colleagues to take care of Li Davei's father.

854
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,100
Why can't you ask the lock room

855
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,100
to take care of your old man?

856
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,100
No.

857
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,100
Are you a instructor?

858
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,100
No, it's not like that.

859
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,100
Besides,

860
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,100
our police is all about

861
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:27,100
caring, caring, helping, and helping.

862
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,100
Right?

863
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,100
Director.

864
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,100
Okay, okay.

865
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,100
Control the air.

866
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,100
Control the air.

867
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,100
Okay.

868
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,100
Okay, go to your mom.

869
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,100
Okay.

870
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,100
Okay.

871
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,100
Okay.

872
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:34,100
Okay.

873
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:04,100
Okay.

874
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:34,100
Okay.

875
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,100
Okay.

876
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:34,100
Okay.
