00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000

00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,140
Come on

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,520
ComPERM sphere

6
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,040
Supercross

7
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,020
Supercross

8
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,160
Supercross

9
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:10,800
Supercross

10
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,300
This is telling you what looks like Supercross

11
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:13,600
Super gosh

12
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,420
What does this look like ?

13
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,440
Supercross

14
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:15,860
What is this ?

15
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,020
Hey let's see us

16
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,160
Why does someone call you Supercross ?

17
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,140
you've told too many people

18
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:20,920
What are you coldest ?

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,380
Supercross

20
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,300
I'll be calling you Super cross

21
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,440
What kind of cross are we ?

22
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,200
They've been calling me the dead

23
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,100
Be careful

24
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,920
I told you, I'm just going to call the Supercross

25
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,580
Look

26
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,460
What are you doing to the kids?

27
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,580
Comrade Jincha, you have to save us.

28
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,340
Don't cry.

29
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,460
Don't cry.

30
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,460
The police is here.

31
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,260
The police is here.

32
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,340
Protect us.

33
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,580
Don't cry.

34
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,460
It's okay.

35
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,340
Comrade Jincha.

36
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,660
You have to think of a way.

37
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,700
You have to protect us.

38
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,060
What happened?

39
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:46,580
Don't worry.

40
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,220
I'll tell you.

41
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,460
Tell us slowly.

42
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,220
Comrade Jincha, you have to think of a way.

43
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,620
They really come here all day.

44
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,460
Especially when it's that time.

45
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,580
When it's that time, they come here at night.

46
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,700
They scare us.

47
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,020
They really have a hard time.

48
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,540
We think,

49
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,020
okay, we can't fight you.

50
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,980
We can't hide.

51
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:08,780
So we think,

52
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,620
we can send the kids to the old house.

53
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,580
We can hide for a while.

54
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,100
But the old man is not feeling well.

55
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,220
We can't do anything.

56
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,780
We can only put on a headband.

57
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,060
But...

58
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,300
The medical department of Kang Hospital,

59
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,660
we are followed by people.

60
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,900
They follow us.

61
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,900
We...

62
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,900
We can't hide from you.

63
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,580
We're going to Lucas a lot.

64
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:40,460
If we decide to cancel our project about the final decision.

65
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,180
We'll ask for a capitalization procedure.

66
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,980
This development they perform

67
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,900
must buy our house a way

68
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,380
to satisfy theirhappiness.

69
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,520
If we cancel our project,

70
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,500
my friend becomes a millionaire.

71
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,160
Dis着急,

72
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,480
let's go.

73
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,440
It's okay.

74
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,000
What should we do now?

75
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,480
Right.

76
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,920
You guys calm down first.

77
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,040
Calm down first.

78
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,400
How can we calm down in this situation?

79
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:04,840
How about this?

80
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,000
Why don't you solve the problem?

81
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,920
We won't leave today.

82
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,440
We'll stay here today.

83
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,440
Mr. Liu, calm down.

84
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,440
You have to trust us.

85
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,080
We'll solve the problem for you.

86
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,880
I'm afraid we can't bear to lose.

87
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,520
Don't worry.

88
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,680
You have to trust the police.

89
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,240
We'll do our best to solve it.

90
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,600
And protect your human safety.

91
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,200
Okay?

92
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,680
Come on.

93
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,240
Eat something.

94
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:28,880
Okay.

95
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:29,920
No.

96
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,480
Come on.

97
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,000
We have to hurry.

98
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,440
We can't do anything without the help of the police.

99
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:35,840
We can't.

100
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,080
We can just knock the door.

101
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,280
We can't get the money out.

102
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,800
We can't get the money.

103
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,400
Right?

104
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,160
What are you doing?

105
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,720
If we don't, we'll be robbed.

106
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,960
We'll be caught.

107
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,720
Right.

108
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,400
What should we do?

109
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,120
What do you think?

110
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,760
We can't do anything.

111
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,000
We'll be caught.

112
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,400
What are you doing?

113
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,400
Da Hong.

114
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,400
Da Hong.

115
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,640
What are you doing? Don't get caught.

116
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,560
Where's the police?

117
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,560
Hurry up. Don't get caught.

118
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,880
We'll be in line.

119
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,200
We'll call the police later.

120
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:31,720
Da Hong.

121
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,360
We'll explain.

122
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,160
Okay.

123
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,480
Where's Da Hong?

124
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,200
Da Hong.

125
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:35,800
Where's Da Jia'er?

126
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,560
He's gone.

127
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,040
Come on.

128
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,560
Come on.

129
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,120
This way.

130
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,480
Come on.

131
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,520
Come on.

132
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,000
Come on.

133
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,480
Come on.

134
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,600
I'll go with you.

135
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,200
What are you doing?

136
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,040
You're the police officer of the police station in Paris.

137
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,880
Why are you here?

138
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,840
What's wrong?

139
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,440
You're not welcome.

140
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,600
Damn.

141
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:55,640
Tell you.

142
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,920
The police are not good at catching bad people.

143
00:05:59,080 --> 00:05:59,800
They said the left-wingers

144
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,000
would help us.

145
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,440
They always say that.

146
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,480
This means that we have a family.

147
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,040
Who's going to help you?

148
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,440
Where's your father?

149
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,440
Why do your family

150
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,240
always make a scene?

151
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,200
Dr. Sun.

152
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,520
Your son is Zhao Jinbao.

153
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,160
Yes.

154
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:17,600
Yes.

155
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,400
Because the poison was kept.

156
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,200
You keep making such a scene.

157
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,280
You can't save him.

158
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,760
You're in trouble.

159
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,440
Where's your son?

160
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,520
Let him go.

161
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,120
Let him go.

162
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,120
Let him go.

163
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,440
What are you talking about?

164
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,680
Who are you talking to?

165
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,760
Do you know where this is?

166
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,360
The police station is your home.

167
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,960
Your son's second attempt

168
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,560
is to take the penalty

169
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,120
for the 15 days

170
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,560
he spent on the crime.

171
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,000
He's in charge of the penalty.

172
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You're saying

173
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,760
that I let your son go?

174
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,040
No.

175
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,200
You're lying.

176
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,080
I'm telling you.

177
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,080
He's gone.

178
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,280
He's not going to let you go.

179
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,760
I'm not going to let you go either.

180
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,360
You're lying.

181
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,720
Let me see.

182
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,160
And there's evidence.

183
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,760
Your son may

184
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,880
be in a state of emergency.

185
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,960
Listen carefully.

186
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,600
He's in a state of emergency.

187
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,840
If he really has a lot of poison,

188
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,560
his temperament will change.

189
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,000
That's not

190
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,120
the safety rules.

191
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,200
That's impossible.

192
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,280
That's impossible.

193
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,040
That's impossible.

194
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,960
That's impossible.

195
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,480
Big sister.

196
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,120
No.

197
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,600
Sister.

198
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,520
What should we do?

199
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,160
This is...

200
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,920
Mr. Cheng.

201
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,120
The second daughter of the Sun family

202
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,680
is almost done.

203
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,400
The little couple

204
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,920
will leave it to me.

205
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,080
We'll go there now.

206
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,040
We'll talk about

207
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,320
our business.

208
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,360
Let the little couple

209
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,680
have a peaceful day.

210
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,280
Master.

211
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,400
Please give me a question.

212
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,040
We

213
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,880
used Sun's son's poison

214
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,000
to threaten them.

215
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,680
Isn't that appropriate?

216
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,320
Be careful.

217
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,040
What's the need?

218
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,360
There's no need.

219
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,600
Did he try to poison Sun?

220
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,160
We caught him.

221
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,520
It's a legal case.

222
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,240
But it's to save Mr. Liu's family.

223
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,320
That's what we should say.

224
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,280
We'll deal with

225
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,200
the process of

226
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,800
the two families' civil war.

227
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,160
We'll find out

228
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,560
the various clues

229
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,000
Sun's grandson poisoned

230
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,240
and the suspect's son.

231
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,800
We'll kill him.

232
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,920
What?

233
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,720
Is there a way

234
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,240
to solve this problem?

235
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,920
What do you mean?

236
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,600
This is a good thing.

237
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,040
It's a good thing

238
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,400
to have a solution.

239
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,720
But I think

240
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,120
using this method

241
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,800
can't be a standard.

242
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,680
It's not a standard.

243
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,440
How can it be a standard?

244
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,120
Through the law,

245
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,360
they can realize

246
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,160
their own behavior.

247
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,440
Do you think they can't

248
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,840
realize their own behavior?

249
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,840
They're not

250
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,840
sure about it.

251
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,680
But our task now

252
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,920
is to make the two families

253
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,680
have a peaceful life.

254
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,040
Mr. Liu.

255
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,760
Where's Mr. Wang?

256
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,840
He's in the fridge.

257
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,040
He's sending the emergency services.

258
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,240
Thank you.

259
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,680
Mr. Chen.

260
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,720
Mr. Zhang.

261
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,000
Thank you.

262
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,120
How was it?

263
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,160
The doctor checked.

264
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,000
He said it was urgent.

265
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,640
He said he'd come back

266
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,180
or we should

267
00:09:46,180 --> 00:10:05,800
put the

268
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,680
test results into

269
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,680
The current situation of the exchange is definitely not good for the team.

270
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,680
Unless...

271
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,680
Unless what?

272
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,680
Unless the team is willing to donate.

273
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,680
Look.

274
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,680
I said there's something good.

275
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,680
Is there anything good?

276
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,680
Sun Tianran is willing to accept the adjustment.

277
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,680
As long as you sign this adjustment agreement,

278
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,680
they won't come to trouble us again.

279
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,680
This is it?

280
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,680
What else can we do if we don't finish them?

281
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,680
It's not what they can do.

282
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,680
They've been making trouble for so many days.

283
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,680
If we don't say that our family

284
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,680
is being caused by their mental disorder,

285
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,680
the neighbors around them will soon be in trouble.

286
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,680
Now, the situation is getting worse.

287
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,680
What's the problem?

288
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,680
I know.

289
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,680
I understand.

290
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,680
This time, your family is being affected.

291
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,680
But I think it's best to face people like them

292
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,680
who don't speak ill of you.

293
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,680
Or to step back and work hard.

294
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,680
They can't face us.

295
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,680
They don't need to be angry.

296
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,680
We're cultured people.

297
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,680
We can't do that.

298
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,680
Yes.

299
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,680
We can't make trouble out of nothing.

300
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,680
But if we don't make trouble out of nothing,

301
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,680
we'll have to bear the pain of being a burden.

302
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,680
Isn't that what we're doing?

303
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,680
Mr. Liu, don't be so excited.

304
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,680
No one said

305
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,680
that you're being angry and angry.

306
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,680
I'm talking about this adjustment book.

307
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,680
Didn't I tell you just now?

308
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:17,680
This is the dispute between you and that Mr. Sun.

309
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,680
The dispute is over before the adjustment book.

310
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,680
They won't make trouble again.

311
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,680
You won't be in trouble again.

312
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:28,680
Of course, the thing they're making trouble at the door is another thing.

313
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,680
We'll deal with it.

314
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,680
Don't worry.

315
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,680
Don't worry.

316
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,680
We haven't been in a fight for a long time.

317
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,680
It's just a adjustment book.

318
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,680
How can we not worry?

319
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,680
Yes.

320
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,680
It's our job to make you feel wronged.

321
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,680
I apologize to you on behalf of the office.

322
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,680
No need.

323
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,680
But I hope you can understand us

324
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,680
by our perspective.

325
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,680
We've been working hard.

326
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,680
What are you doing?

327
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,680
We don't want this adjustment book.

328
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,680
We want their punishment.

329
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,680
You didn't say you don't want to punish them.

330
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,680
Now you just have to step back.

331
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,680
Don't ask for the responsibility of the other party.

332
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,680
Sign this adjustment book as soon as possible.

333
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,680
We can also live a peaceful life as soon as possible.

334
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,680
Don't ask for the responsibility of the other party.

335
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,680
In other words,

336
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,680
we have the responsibility to deal with this.

337
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,680
Where is the responsibility?

338
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,680
Tell me.

339
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,680
Shouldn't our family live there?

340
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:48,680
Or should our children be seen by their family?

341
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,680
Or should our children be injured and frightened?

342
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,680
We shouldn't go to the hospital to see the patient.

343
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,680
We have the responsibility there.

344
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,680
Mr. Liu,

345
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,680
I don't mean that.

346
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,680
But if you don't understand it,

347
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,680
I can't talk anymore.

348
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,680
Look at this.

349
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,680
It's already like this.

350
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,680
The police want to help us

351
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,680
to solve the problem of the early-distance conflict.

352
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,680
Let your life be back to normal as soon as possible.

353
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,680
Isn't this good?

354
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,680
Yes, it's good.

355
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,680
Anyway, no matter what,

356
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,680
the police inform us that we are grateful to you.

357
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,680
But I don't think there's anything I can do.

358
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,680
We did something wrong.

359
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,680
If we didn't do something wrong,

360
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,680
why should we bear the responsibility?

361
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,680
The difference is the responsibility of the two.

362
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,680
Mr. Liu, Ms. Liu,

363
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,680
I think you can do the legal procedure.

364
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,680
For the Sun family,

365
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,680
for your harassment and fraud,

366
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,680
you can do the legal procedure.

367
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,680
What?

368
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,680
Yes.

369
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,680
Do you want Mr. Liu and his family

370
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,680
to live without any problems?

371
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,680
No.

372
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,680
I think they should be fair to themselves.

373
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,680
Besides, our law will never tolerate

374
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,680
such a shameless and ungrateful thing.

375
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,680
Mr. Liu is a selfish person.

376
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,680
Yes, yes, yes.

377
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,680
I think the young police are right.

378
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,680
We should do the legal procedure.

379
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,680
Then you two can think about it.

380
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,680
Let's go first.

381
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,680
Think about it.

382
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,680
Thank you.

383
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,680
It's okay.

384
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,680
No need to send it.

385
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,680
It's okay.

386
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,680
Goodbye.

387
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,680
No need to send it.

388
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,680
Goodbye.

389
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,680
You only wore a few-day-dress.

390
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,680
You think you know everything?

391
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,680
Did I say something wrong?

392
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,680
I asked them to send the procedure

393
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,680
and let the law to protect justice.

394
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,680
Did I do something wrong?

395
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,680
The law is to protect justice.

396
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,680
What justice?

397
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,680
What do you know about the law?

398
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,680
The law is the law that is passed on

399
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,680
by the old man who is over 70 years old.

400
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,680
Do you know that?

401
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,680
The court is in charge of the law.

402
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,680
We should solve it.

403
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,680
Do you understand?

404
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,680
For the two old men,

405
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,680
we spent a lot of time and effort

406
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,680
to suppress many cases.

407
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,680
What should we do about the cost of this?

408
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,680
What about the evil people in the Sun family?

409
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,680
Let them go.

410
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,680
What about the law and justice?

411
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,680
What evil people?

412
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,680
What evil people?

413
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,680
Which law tells you

414
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,680
who is the evil and who is the bad?

415
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,680
Besides, do we have evidence?

416
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,680
Remember,

417
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,680
personal feelings are always personal feelings.

418
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,680
You can't replace the law.

419
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,680
Don't think that you know everything

420
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,680
about this year's tree.

421
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,680
Do I know what is important?

422
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,680
The law is passed on by the law.

423
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,680
The black and white will naturally be broken up.

424
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,680
What?

425
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,680
Then let them go.

426
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,680
We spent a lot of time and effort

427
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,680
to make them feel guilty.

428
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,680
Then two years later,

429
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,680
the court may not have the intention to pay the money.

430
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,680
Even if they do,

431
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,680
they will not pay the money.

432
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,680
What should we do?

433
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,680
We should wait

434
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,680
for the time, the money,

435
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,680
and the money

436
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,680
to be forced to be executed.

437
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,680
Then the two old men

438
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,680
will be completely removed.

439
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,680
Did you ever think

440
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,760
that the people who are always

441
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,680
guilty of personal feelings

442
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,680
are the witnesses you are pursuing?

443
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,680
The witnesses you are pursuing

444
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,680
are nothing but the peace,

445
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,680
happiness and exception

446
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,680
of the three of us.

447
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,680
Uncle Yang,

448
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,680
did you do it on purpose?

449
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,680
No.

450
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,680
No?

451
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,680
No.

452
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,680
I know that

453
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,680
you have resentment for me

454
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,680
about the things that happened to the police.

455
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,680
But think about it carefully.

456
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,680
I said something wrong.

457
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,680
Did I call you back then?

458
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,680
Even if I did something wrong,

459
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,680
you can't take this thing

460
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,680
to the police station and get angry with me.

461
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,680
I didn't.

462
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,680
I have something to say to you.

463
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,680
It has nothing to do with this.

464
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,680
In this matter,

465
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,680
I think

466
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,680
the law should be passed on.

467
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,680
Fine.

468
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,680
Fine.

469
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,680
You are better than me.

470
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,680
Should I call you back

471
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,680
and ask you to be my teacher?

472
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,680
I'm sorry.

473
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,680
I'm sorry.

474
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,680
Master.

475
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,680
I'm sorry.

476
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,680
This matter

477
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,680
is decided by you.

478
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,680
Of course.

479
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,680
At last,

480
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,680
we can talk about it.

481
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,680
If you don't want to,

482
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,680
don't be stubborn.

483
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,680
Don't worry about others.

484
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,680
What do you mean?

485
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,680
I know

486
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,680
except for you,

487
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,680
no one

488
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,680
knows what kind of pain you have experienced.

489
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,680
And what kind of feelings

490
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,680
this person has.

491
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,680
So,

492
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,680
don't worry about others.

493
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,680
I...

494
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,680
Fine.

495
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,680
We have also told your father

496
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,680
about the situation with Miss Zhou.

497
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,680
She said

498
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,680
Miss Zhou was very angry.

499
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,680
But

500
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,680
she also decided

501
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,680
not to have your father's responsibility.

502
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,680
She agreed to it.

503
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,680
If you think there is nothing wrong,

504
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,680
just call her father

505
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,680
and let her sign the contract.

506
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,680
I'm sorry.

507
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,680
You're so stubborn.

508
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,680
Why do you have to

509
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,680
change your mind?

510
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,680
You're a man.

511
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,680
I'll tell you.

512
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,680
You're a man.

513
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,680
I'm not.

514
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,680
I'm just a man.

515
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,680
I'm just a man.

516
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,680
I'm just a man.

517
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,680
I'm just a man.

518
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,680
I'm just a man.

519
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,680
I'm just a man.

520
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,680
I'm just a man.

521
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,680
You don't need to be a man.

522
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,680
You're a man.

523
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,680
No.

524
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,680
It's too simple.

525
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,680
Then why?

526
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,680
The whole world is talking about

527
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,680
Chinese flowers,

528
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,680
and the words of Chinese children.

529
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,680
They're becoming more and more international.

530
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,680
Son,

531
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,680
why are you back?

532
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,680
What are you looking at?

533
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,680
You're an old man.

534
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,680
You're still smart.

535
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,680
You're a man.

536
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,680
I'm a man.

537
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,680
Son, you eat this first.

538
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,680
Okay, mom.

539
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,680
You look so good with this.

540
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,680
Right?

541
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,680
You eat first.

542
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,680
I'm just around here.

543
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,680
Come and see.

544
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,680
I'll wash my hands.

545
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,680
You wash your hands?

546
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,680
Okay.

547
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,680
Li Yisheng.

548
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,680
Yes.

549
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,680
What are you doing?

550
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,680
Didn't you hear your son say

551
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,680
that you should come back to see you?

552
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,680
You're so cute.

553
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,680
I'm the main character.

554
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,680
Mom, I'm here to see you.

555
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,680
I'm not here to see him.

556
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,680
You're so cute.

557
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,680
You're so cute.

558
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,680
You're so cute.

559
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,680
How's the toilet?

560
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,680
Is it comfortable on the table?

561
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,680
Oh, right.

562
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,680
I'm paying for it.

563
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,680
I'll transfer the rent to you.

564
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,680
You can do it.

565
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,680
No, no.

566
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,680
What are you doing?

567
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,680
Mom, I've split the rent

568
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,680
with the others.

569
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,680
Now we rent a flat.

570
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,680
I don't have much pressure.

571
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,680
I just want

572
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,680
to give you some pressure.

573
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,680
Mom,

574
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,680
why are you

575
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,680
so upset now?

576
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,680
That's great.

577
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,680
Then you can come back to see me.

578
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,680
Come back to see me.

579
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,680
Come back to see me.

580
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,680
Come back to see me.

581
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,680
Come back to see me.

582
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,680
You're here.

583
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,680
Come, have a taste.

584
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,680
What are you talking about?

585
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,680
I'm talking to you.

586
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,680
Why are you

587
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,680
so upset?

588
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,680
Why are you starting to get angry?

589
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,680
You have this family in your heart.

590
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,680
Why do you have to talk so hard?

591
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,680
So he's young

592
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,680
and just like you now.

593
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,680
Just like you.

594
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,680
Enough. Don't talk.

595
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,680
Eat.

596
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,680
Eat.

597
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,680
Have a taste.

598
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,680
Have a taste.

599
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,680
How is it?

600
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,680
It's like your dad's.

601
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,680
Does it taste like

602
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,680
your childhood?

603
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,680
Wait.

604
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,680
I forgot something.

605
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,680
I'll be right back.

606
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,680
What's wrong?

607
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,680
It's so secretive.

608
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,680
This is your favorite

609
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,680
food in childhood.

610
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,680
It's noodles, chili,

611
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,680
oil, noodles.

612
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,680
It's okay.

613
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,680
It's okay.

614
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,680
It's okay.

615
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,680
It's okay.

616
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,680
It's okay.

617
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,680
Did you lose your voice?

618
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,680
No, no, no.

619
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,680
I forgot.

620
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,680
It's okay.

621
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,680
Mom, I have something to do in the dorm.

622
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,680
I'm not eating.

623
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,680
What are you eating?

624
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,680
I have something to do in the dorm.

625
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,680
I forgot.

626
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,680
Dad.

627
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,680
Eat.

628
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,680
PSYEN will eat it.

629
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,680
What?

630
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,680
Is anyonearse?

631
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,680
Are they still out?

632
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,680
I'm sorry.

633
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,680
I'm sorry.

634
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,680
I'm sorry.

635
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,680
I'm sorry.

636
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,680
I'm sorry.

637
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,680
I'm sorry.

638
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,680
I'm sorry.

639
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,680
I'm sorry.

640
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,680
I'm sorry.

641
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,680
I'm sorry.

642
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,680
I'm sorry.

643
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,680
Chief, you didn't see it.

644
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,680
You're so mean.

645
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,680
I didn't expect you to come up here.

646
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,680
I'm not a good person.

647
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,680
I don't know what to do.

648
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,680
Uncle Yang can't help me.

649
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,680
He's trying to prove his right.

650
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,680
He's trying to talk to me.

651
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,680
I'm not a good person.

652
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,680
I don't know who's the master.

653
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,680
Okay, I got it.

654
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,680
I'm not a good person.

655
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,680
I'm not a good person.

656
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,680
I'm not a good person.

657
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,680
What's wrong?

658
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,680
I don't want you to come to save me.

659
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,680
No, save me.

660
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,680
Save me.

661
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,680
You can't go this way.

662
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,680
You can't go that way.

663
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,680
He's going in like this.

664
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,680
It's not like his style.

665
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,680
Right.

666
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,680
He's not going to come here.

667
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,680
It's a bit annoying.

668
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,680
Turn around.

669
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,680
Come on.

670
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,680
It's weird to be together.

671
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,680
One by one.

672
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,680
Turn around.

673
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,680
I can't turn around.

674
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,680
Li Jiawei's case.

675
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,680
Didn't you sign the divorce papers?

676
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,680
Signed?

677
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,680
I saw it.

678
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,680
I'm sorry.

679
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,680
Where are you?

680
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,680
You're here too.

681
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,680
I saw someone in the room.

682
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,680
You're so angry.

683
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,680
I see.

684
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,680
I saw someone in the room.

685
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,680
I'm sorry.

686
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,680
I'm sorry.

687
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,680
I'm sorry.

688
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,680
I'm sorry.

689
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,680
I'm sorry.

690
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,680
I'm sorry.

691
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,680
I saw someone in the room.

692
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,680
You're so angry.

693
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,680
I'm sorry too.

694
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,680
Who's the man in the back?

695
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,680
Who's the man in the back?

696
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,680
Don't tell me.

697
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,680
Li Lun.

698
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,680
What's wrong with him?

699
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,680
Why are you crying?

700
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,680
Why are you crying?

701
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,680
Why are you crying?

702
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,680
I'm sorry.

703
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,680
You're so angry.

704
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,680
Why are you crying?

705
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,680
I'm sorry.

706
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,680
I'm sorry.

707
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,680
I'm sorry.

708
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,680
I'm sorry.

709
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,680
You're very angry.

710
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,680
Get out.

711
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,680
Let's play.

712
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:43,680
I have a very complicated feeling about the case of Sun Family and the Liu Family.

713
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,680
Do you know?

714
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,680
Because of this case,

715
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,680
I have a brain-washed relationship with my master.

716
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:57,680
He told me that it's not all the same.

717
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,680
It's all the same for both right and wrong.

718
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,680
I knew these things in the past.

719
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:08,680
But after my own experience, my experience is completely different.

720
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,680
To be honest,

721
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,680
I think your master is right.

722
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,680
The day after the accident

723
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,680
Hello, Mr. Sun.

724
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,680
Where are you?

725
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,680
Hello, Mr. Sun.

726
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,680
Hello, Mr. Sun.

727
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,680
Hello, Mr. Sun.

728
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,680
Hello, Mr. Sun.

729
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,680
What did you do yesterday?

730
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,680
I was talking about something.

731
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,680
We are going to have a meeting today.

732
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,680
You call the police.

733
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,680
Yes, sir.

734
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,680
Hello, sir.

735
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,680
Hello, sir.

736
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,680
We are going to the office.

737
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,680
We are going to the toilet.

738
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,680
We will discuss this matter.

739
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,680
I will take a look.

740
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,680
I will arrange the work.

741
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,680
This is for you.

742
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,680
Mr. Sun,

743
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,680
what do you want to do?

744
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,680
Go to the office later.

745
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,680
Okay.

746
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,680
We have something to do.

747
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,680
Do you want coffee?

748
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,680
No, thanks.

749
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,680
Thank you, Mr. Sun.

750
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,680
No, thanks.

751
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:20,680
I have to go to the office.

752
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:21,680
You can go down the stairs.

753
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,680
We will take a look.

754
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:23,680
Okay, okay.

755
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:24,680
Okay.

756
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,680
I will go to the office.

757
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,680
Mr. Sun,

758
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,680
we are going to the office.

759
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,680
We have something to discuss.

760
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:30,680
What is it?

761
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:31,680
You go to the office.

762
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:32,680
Send it to the office.

763
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,680
My mother.

764
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,680
Good morning, Mr. Sun.

765
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,680
I have something to do.

766
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,680
Come, come, come.

767
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,680
Sit inside.

768
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:49,680
Sit, sit, sit.

769
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,680
Mr. Sun,

770
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,680
I want to talk to you.

771
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,680
What do you want to drink?

772
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,680
I don't drink.

773
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,680
Mr. Yang,

774
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,680
you are so well-educated.

775
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,680
It's not true.

776
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,680
It's true.

777
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,680
No matter what,

778
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,680
it's better than me.

779
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,680
Actually, I don't have anything

780
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,680
to teach you.

781
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,680
We are not only

782
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,680
the age.

783
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,680
I am a few years older than you.

784
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,680
This man's family

785
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,680
is a little more than you know.

786
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,680
You have been training here since you were a kid.

787
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,680
No matter what happens in the future,

788
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,680
the most important thing is to learn

789
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,680
the human affairs.

790
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,680
To put it bluntly,

791
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,680
nothing is

792
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,680
a black and white thing.

793
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,680
Even the right and wrong

794
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,680
are not determined and not changed.

795
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,680
What did you learn

796
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,680
to do?

797
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,680
It's to use it

798
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,680
to understand these things.

799
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,680
Do you understand?

800
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,680
Yes.

801
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,680
Then, what else

802
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,680
do you want to say?

803
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,680
Nothing.

804
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,680
If you need anything,

805
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,680
just come to me.

806
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,680
We can talk directly.

807
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,680
Liu, okay?

808
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,680
I will go first.

809
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,680
Okay, go ahead.

810
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,680
I am going to the hospital.

811
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,680
I will be there.

812
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,680
I will be there.

813
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,680
I will be there.

814
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,680
I will be there.

815
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,680
I will be there.

816
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,680
I will be there.

817
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,680
I will be there.

818
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,680
I will be there.

819
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,680
I will be there.

820
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,680
I will be there.

821
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,680
I will be there.

822
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,680
I will be there.

823
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,680
I will be there.

824
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,680
I will be there.

825
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,680
I will be there.

826
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,680
I will be there.

827
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,680
I will be there.

828
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,680
I will be there.

829
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,680
I will be there.

830
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,680
I will be there.

831
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,680
I will be there.

832
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,680
I will be there.

833
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,680
I will be there.

834
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,680
I will be there.

835
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,680
I will be there.

836
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,680
I will be there.

837
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,680
I will be there.

838
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,680
I will be there.

839
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,680
Jiang Xia,

840
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,680
I don't think you didn't knock on the door.

841
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,680
You will leave?

842
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:29,640
Lie down czyn Sa Zong' bamboo

843
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,520
How about

844
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,240
We sit in it

845
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,360
Ok

846
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,000
Sit with you

847
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,060
Sorry

848
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:41,400
I...

849
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,060
In that day

850
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,280
I was touched

851
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,040
Trust you on dancing

852
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,580
It's not wrong to say it

853
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:50,500
But

854
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:55,500
But in any case, you should choose first.

855
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,500
Choose a way that is more beneficial to solve problems.

856
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:02,500
And the speed of the process is not lacking.

857
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:08,500
Instead, choose to combine and make a profit.

858
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,500
Yes, I agree. I agree with you.

859
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:16,500
You agree?

860
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,500
I agree with the solution.

861
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:32,500
To be honest, I have never told anyone about the reason why I chose to combine.

862
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:39,500
Recently, they haven't come here.

863
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,500
It's really great.

864
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:46,500
An Ning is great.

865
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,500
He Ping is great.

866
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,500
He Meng is great.

867
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:01,500
I'm really angry with them.

868
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:09,500
Yes, An Ning is great. He Ping is great.

869
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:17,500
Of course, all the efforts are from your police uncle.

870
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,500
That's why we can change such a situation.

871
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:23,500
Yes, we should. We should leave.

872
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,500
Mr. Liu, Miss Liu.

873
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:34,500
Since you all understand,

874
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:40,500
let's sign this agreement.

875
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,500
Do I have to sign two?

876
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,500
I've signed it.

877
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,500
When Mr. An Ning had left this time,

878
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,500
he probably hasn't meeting for the rest of the family.

879
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,500
If we don't get out,

880
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,500
when I cooked it,

881
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,500
he might not be able to stand.

882
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:25,500
We alsoagan and miss Ou Dongs immediately.

883
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,500
Big sister,

884
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:35,980
Yes, couldn't have easily told you.

885
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,800
What's wrong with you two?

886
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,660
Who're you in love with?

887
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,600
Unbelievable!

888
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,640
The person I can fall out with now is so Phone.

889
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:58,640
I feel like I'm a burden to you.

890
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,640
I can't get into it.

891
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,640
I'm nervous about the relationship.

892
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,640
I'm lost in my colleagues.

893
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,640
I feel like I'm about to leave.

894
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,640
I feel very comfortable.

895
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,640
I'm not the same.

896
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,640
Solid is my specialty.

897
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,640
I need to protect it.

898
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:28,640
You... You're still talking about me?

899
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,640
What are you two talking about?

900
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,640
You're a man.

901
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,640
You're a man.

902
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,640
I'm not a man either.

903
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,640
I'm usually very close to you.

904
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:44,640
I've been a good friend since I was a kid.

905
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,640
But since I got here,

906
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,640
I feel...

907
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,640
very lonely.

908
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,640
I'm lost.

909
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,640
What are you two talking about?

910
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,640
First, you've been too smooth before.

911
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,640
Second, you've been thinking too much.

912
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,640
You should think about what's not happening.

913
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,640
Then when it really happens,

914
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,640
you should come and test yourself.

915
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,640
Are you tired?

916
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,640
You're like me.

917
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:28,640
I've been playing the game since I was a kid.

918
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,640
I've been playing the game for more than ten years.

919
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,640
I've been playing the game for more than ten years.

920
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,640
This is called playing the game against the game.

921
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,640
Why are you thinking so much?

922
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,640
Just sit down.

923
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,640
Okay, you two think about it.

924
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,640
I'm busy. I'll go back first.

925
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,640
I'll go back first.

926
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,640
I'll practice more.

927
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,640
Okay.

928
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,640
Take care.

929
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,640
Take care.

930
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:20,640
I'm sorry.

931
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:50,640
I'm sorry.

932
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:20,640
I'm sorry.

933
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:50,640
I'm sorry.

934
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,640
I'm sorry.

935
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,640
I'm sorry.

936
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:26,640
I'm sorry.

937
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,640
I'm sorry.

938
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:28,640
I'm sorry.

939
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:29,640
I'm sorry.

940
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:30,640
I'm sorry.

941
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:31,640
I'm sorry.

942
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:32,640
I'm sorry.

943
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,640
I'm sorry.

944
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:34,640
I'm sorry.

945
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,640
I'm sorry.

946
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:36,640
I'm sorry.

947
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:37,640
I'm sorry.

948
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:38,640
I'm sorry.

949
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:39,640
I'm sorry.

950
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:40,640
I'm sorry.

951
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:41,640
I'm sorry.

952
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:42,640
