1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I

4
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:30,800
W

5
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:37,040
It commercialized

6
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:58,040
something

7
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:09,040
I'm thinking about how evil the world is.

8
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:14,040
It has already taken away the one and only gold.

9
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,040
And that is a lot of assets.

10
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,040
But when he left, he still wanted to borrow a large amount of high-end gold.

11
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:30,040
Is he not interested in the fact that he has no trust in this woman?

12
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,040
This is the feature of the Internet fraud.

13
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,040
When you were the most murderous, they thought of many ways.

14
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,040
They hoped that those who killed people would not be the most evil.

15
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,040
Except for the Westerners.

16
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:47,040
The most important thing is that they want to turn the murder into a normal job.

17
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,040
And the people who were killed will be destroyed.

18
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,040
That is to say, the people who were killed were not killed by people.

19
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,040
The things you do every day are not killed.

20
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,040
Just like ordinary people, you go to work, get a card,

21
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,040
kill a few criminals in the unit, and then go home to work.

22
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,040
Those kneeling hands are all the best of the best.

23
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,040
They are full of responsibility and responsibility.

24
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:15,040
Every morning, they will gently talk to their wives and children.

25
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,040
If they go to work, you have to listen to their mother.

26
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,040
Then go to work and kill people.

27
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,040
They have no sense of guilt.

28
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,040
This is very scary.

29
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,040
The same as the murderous plate.

30
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,040
You think of Wang Luo.

31
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,040
He turned the liar and the victim into a criminal.

32
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,040
Why do you lie to normal people?

33
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,040
The victim has long been turned into a pig by them.

34
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,040
The more you lie to them, the better the KPI is.

35
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,040
They will not have any guilt.

36
00:03:54,040 --> 00:04:00,040
So, we must take all these frauds back.

37
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,040
Bring them to the face of the injustice.

38
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,040
Let them face the victim who was killed.

39
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,040
Let the victim turn into a person in front of them.

40
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:18,040
Gao Cheng, I don't care how much money Wu Yu can get back.

41
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:27,040
But I ask you and your team to take all the crimes in front of Wu Yu.

42
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,040
Yes.

43
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,040
These websites are all forged.

44
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,040
Yes, they are all forged.

45
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,040
When Wu Yu went to the scene of the two-way street,

46
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,040
the website that the liar has used to search for him

47
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,040
is all fake.

48
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,040
All of these websites are forged by him.

49
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,040
Now, these two-way street is all forged.

50
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,040
Look.

51
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,040
Okay, let's not care about these websites.

52
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,040
Let's check the cash flow.

53
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,040
Let's see where Wu Yu's cash is.

54
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,040
Look.

55
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,040
This is a photo of the overseas.

56
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,040
It can be sure that the money of the victim

57
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,040
will flow into the cash pool outside the sea

58
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,040
once he enters this account.

59
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,040
It's like a bucket of water is flowing into the sea and it's drowned.

60
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:20,040
What you mean is that the money can't be spent on this?

61
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,040
Even if we are abroad, we can't chase it.

62
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,040
You can see the cash pool as a pipe.

63
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:33,040
The money goes into another cash pool through the pipe.

64
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,040
It seems that the water flows into a big water tank.

65
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,040
Even if the water in the water tank flows out,

66
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:45,040
you can't be sure which water flows out from this account.

67
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,040
Look.

68
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,040
There are only two pieces of money left in this account.

69
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,040
This means that once the money is in,

70
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,040
they will transfer it out immediately.

71
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,040
They will transfer it to another cash pool.

72
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,040
It's very likely that the cash pool will transfer it again.

73
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:06,040
If they do that, the money will disappear and be gone.

74
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,040
Thank you, Madam.

75
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,040
Please remember this account.

76
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,040
If not, the electronic fraud would be very difficult to break.

77
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,040
In the past, if you caught a criminal,

78
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,040
except for the money he saved,

79
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,040
we can still return the money to the victim.

80
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,040
The fraud can also be punished.

81
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,040
Now, we can't catch anyone and money.

82
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,040
Tell me, how is the victim's situation?

83
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,040
The principal said that he looks calm and quiet.

84
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,040
He rarely speaks and eats.

85
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,040
But in this situation, he is the most worried.

86
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,040
Fortunately, his mother is with him.

87
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,040
So, tell me,

88
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,040
whether we can catch this fraud

89
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:52,040
and the victim is very important to us,

90
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,040
since the cash pool is not in,

91
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,040
we can transfer it to another person.

92
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:02,040
Okay, since the cash pool is not in,

93
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,040
we can transfer the money to another person.

94
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,040
If the fraud starts from the internet,

95
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,040
we can transfer it to another person.

96
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,040
You eat noodles alone?

97
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,040
You are so selfish.

98
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,040
I'm so mad.

99
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,040
I just ate one.

100
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,040
If you don't eat, I'll eat.

101
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,040
I'm hungry.

102
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,040
This is a fraud case.

103
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,040
It's a fraud case.

104
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,040
It's a fraud case.

105
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,040
I'm so worried about it.

106
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,040
You catch the fraud?

107
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,040
I...

108
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,040
David, you're not selfish.

109
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,040
Come and eat.

110
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,040
I'll eat.

111
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,040
I'll eat.

112
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,040
I'll eat.

113
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,040
I'm so worried about you.

114
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,040
Did you catch the fraud?

115
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,040
I can't catch him.

116
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,040
I just want to check.

117
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,040
The information he has registered is for someone else.

118
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,040
Come on.

119
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,040
We have to go to the bank.

120
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,040
The fraud is still in the bank.

121
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,040
You are Zhang Xinyu's official official.

122
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,040
The official is with us.

123
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,040
I believe you should be able to get out of here.

124
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,040
I went to the hospital with my master this afternoon.

125
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,040
And the victim...

126
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,040
is still feeling uncomfortable.

127
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,040
I just thought that we are police.

128
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,040
It's really meaningless.

129
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,040
If there is no police,

130
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,040
who can I find the victim?

131
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,040
Zhang Xinyu,

132
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,040
leave me alone.

133
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,040
What are you doing?

134
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,040
I'm just sitting here.

135
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,040
I'm listening to you.

136
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,040
I'm listening to you.

137
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,040
You look so serious.

138
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,040
What happened next is you...

139
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,040
are worried about me.

140
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,040
The person who knows things

141
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,040
will be angry at me.

142
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,040
David,

143
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,040
you know things.

144
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,040
Why don't you be angry?

145
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,040
You are in a good mood today.

146
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,040
What's the matter?

147
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,040
Just listen to me.

148
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,040
There's nothing to be angry about.

149
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,040
It's nothing specific.

150
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,040
I'm just happy.

151
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,040
You are a nurse.

152
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,040
Not at all.

153
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,040
I used to think that

154
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,040
it was meaningless to be in a police

155
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,040
and solve the emergency.

156
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,040
I think that it's meaningless

157
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,040
to be in a nurse.

158
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,040
Good.

159
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,040
I'll cook noodles for you.

160
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,040
I'll cook noodles for you.

161
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,040
You are making me look like a pig.

162
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,040
You are making me look like a pig.

163
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,040
Why are you making me look like a pig?

164
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,040
Why are you making me look like a pig?

165
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,040
Why are you making me look like a pig?

166
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,040
I'm hungry.

167
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,040
I'm not hungry.

168
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,040
I'm not hungry.

169
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,040
This is my bowl.

170
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,040
Don't take it.

171
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,040
You can confirm the investigation information.

172
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,040
The location of the fraud

173
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,040
is on the sea line.

174
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,040
You can't understand

175
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,040
why they chose this place.

176
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,040
Because the sea line

177
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,040
is located on the border of Southeast Asia.

178
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,040
If there is any wind and debris,

179
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,040
you can go abroad at any time.

180
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,040
We suspect that

181
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,040
these frauds

182
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,040
are colluding with the overseas.

183
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,040
But

184
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,040
the investigation is stopped

185
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,040
by this clue.

186
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,040
Because the sea line

187
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,040
has more than 200,000 people.

188
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,040
The number of people

189
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,040
who live in the sea line

190
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,040
is more than 100,000.

191
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,040
The area is not small.

192
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,040
The PR Bureau of the Sea Line

193
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,040
gave us the answer

194
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,040
that if we can't provide

195
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,040
more accurate information,

196
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,040
they can't

197
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,040
make more accurate positioning.

198
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,040
We don't have a fraud.

199
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,040
Is this a fact?

200
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,040
That's not true.

201
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,040
The person named Tian Gaoping

202
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,040
died two years ago.

203
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,040
The fraud

204
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,040
was just a trick.

205
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,040
It was his code.

206
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,040
Anyway, until this point,

207
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,040
we have lost

208
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,040
all clues about the fraud.

209
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,040
We can't catch up with them.

210
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,040
Anyway, this clue

211
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,040
will end here for the time being.

212
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,040
That's not possible.

213
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,040
You are still

214
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,040
lying in the hospital.

215
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,040
We can't use

216
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,040
a word

217
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,040
to catch up with them.

218
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,040
We will send them off.

219
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,040
Didn't I ask for it?

220
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,040
No matter if it's a sea line

221
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,040
or a place to go,

222
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,040
we must catch them all.

223
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,040
Yes, yes, yes.

224
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,040
I'm sure we can't do it.

225
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,040
We are also

226
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,040
expanding the clue

227
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,040
on the way.

228
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,040
So we...

229
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,040
Director.

230
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,040
Tell Ji Weishu

231
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,040
what you think.

232
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,040
Chief.

233
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,040
I thought about it with Zhao Ji Wei.

234
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,040
Do we still have a way?

235
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,040
What way?

236
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,040
This is a trick

237
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,040
known to us

238
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,040
through the 1000-mile network station.

239
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,040
According to

240
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,040
the analysis of other

241
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,040
murder cases,

242
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,040
the victim of the fraud

243
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,040
is one of the commoners

244
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,040
who is used

245
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,040
in the crime scene.

246
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,040
So we

247
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,040
found another victim

248
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,040
on this 1000-mile network station

249
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,040
through the same trick.

250
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,040
This is Fan Wenxiu.

251
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,040
She is 54 years old

252
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,040
and has a daughter.

253
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,040
Fan is

254
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,040
a big girl.

255
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,040
She has grown up

256
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,040
and has a boyfriend.

257
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,040
She is going to get married.

258
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,040
Fan is

259
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,040
planning to

260
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,040
find a reliable person

261
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,040
for her

262
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,040
for her whole year.

263
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,040
So she

264
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,040
met this person

265
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,040
through the 1000-mile network station.

266
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,040
The information

267
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,040
is shown by her name.

268
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,040
Her name is

269
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,040
Tong Lei.

270
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,040
She is a network repair engineer.

271
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,040
From the current situation,

272
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,040
this person

273
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,040
is a liar.

274
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,040
Even if she is not the same person,

275
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,040
she is the same group of people.

276
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,040
Why?

277
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,040
Because in their chat,

278
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,040
the video they use

279
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,040
is the same.

280
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,040
This liar

281
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,040
is the same as

282
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,040
Fan's method

283
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,040
and the method of cheating.

284
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,040
The only difference is

285
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,040
after Tong Lei

286
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,040
cheated on Fan's

287
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,040
over 100 million,

288
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,040
one day

289
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,040
a person

290
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,040
called Tong Lei's sister

291
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,040
contacted Fan

292
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,040
through the same QR code.

293
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,040
She said she was sick.

294
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,040
She has such a thing.

295
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,040
How did Mei Chou die?

296
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,040
To be honest,

297
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,040
when we were repairing the ticket station,

298
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,040
we were sucked into the poisonous body.

299
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,040
This is a common

300
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,040
and realistic imagination.

301
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,040
I really can't imagine

302
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,040
what poisonous body

303
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,040
could be in this ticket station.

304
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,040
At first,

305
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,040
Fan believed

306
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,040
that

307
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,040
she would give this

308
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,040
Tong Lei's sister a reply,

309
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,040
which means she was hurt.

310
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,040
Then,

311
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,040
Tong Lei's sister

312
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,040
gave her a reply and said thank you.

313
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,040
I was thinking

314
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,040
about it with Zhao Juewei.

315
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,040
Think about it.

316
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,040
Don't hide.

317
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,040
We have

318
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,040
read

319
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,040
their previous chat records.

320
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,040
We found that

321
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,040
Fan used to tell Tong Lei

322
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,040
that

323
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,040
she might have broken her own house.

324
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,040
Tong Lei was very interested in this.

325
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,040
But later,

326
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,040
because of the city's plan,

327
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,040
Fan's house

328
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,040
couldn't be removed for a while.

329
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,040
Tong Lei might have

330
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,040
already cheated

331
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,040
over one hundred thousand people.

332
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,040
We analyzed that

333
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,040
she might be afraid

334
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,040
of the owner's son.

335
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,040
So, she couldn't take the money.

336
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,040
She told Fan

337
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,040
that she was dead.

338
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,040
As for the above situation,

339
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,040
we were thinking

340
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,040
if it was possible...

341
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,040
What's possible?

342
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,040
Don't be so stupid.

343
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,040
Okay?

344
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,040
My dad is so insensitive.

345
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,040
We were thinking

346
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,040
if it was possible

347
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,040
to send a message

348
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,040
to this liar

349
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,040
with the evidence

350
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,040
of Fan's death.

351
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,040
We said

352
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,040
you don't have to be so blameful.

353
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,040
You will be punished for your life and death.

354
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,040
If this happens,

355
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,040
your brother

356
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,040
wouldn't want to see it.

357
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,040
Luckily,

358
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,040
our debt is about to start.

359
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,040
I heard

360
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,040
I can get more than

361
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,040
six hundred thousand

362
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,040
to compensate for my loss.

363
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,040
So,

364
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,040
you don't have to worry about it.

365
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,040
You little boy.

366
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,040
You have to be positive.

367
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,040
We are together.

368
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,040
Director,

369
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,040
is it okay?

370
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,040
You can try.

371
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,040
What are you doing

372
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,040
while you are sleeping?

373
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,040
Sit down.

374
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,040
Sit down.

375
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,040
I'll read it out for you.

376
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,040
It starts from the first note.

377
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,040
Sister-in-law,

378
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,040
I'm so sorry.

379
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,040
I noticed

380
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,040
your message at this time.

381
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,040
Because there were

382
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,040
so many things

383
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,040
that happened these days,

384
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,040
we were all in a mess.

385
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,040
Sister-in-law,

386
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,040
believe me,

387
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,040
you are dead.

388
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,040
This happened

389
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,040
in our house.

390
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,040
Simply put,

391
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,040
my brother died

392
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,040
three days later.

393
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,040
After three days,

394
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,040
he was alive.

395
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,040
What is this?

396
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,040
Look,

397
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,040
Sister-in-law,

398
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,040
we have a funeral here.

399
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,040
We have a funeral for the dead.

400
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,040
I went to my brother's funeral

401
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,040
this morning.

402
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,040
I suddenly heard

403
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,040
a sound of anger and pain.

404
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,040
I was so scared.

405
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,040
I listened carefully.

406
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,040
It was indeed my brother's voice.

407
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,040
He asked,

408
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,040
how long has it been?

409
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,040
Did you hear it?

410
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,040
I went home

411
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,040
and opened the door for my dad.

412
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,040
When I opened the door,

413
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,040
my brother sat down

414
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,040
in the coffin.

415
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,040
He actually survived.

416
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,040
He said he was dead.

417
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,040
He said he was hungry.

418
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,040
He said he wanted to drink a tomato soup.

419
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,040
No.

420
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,040
My god.

421
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,040
Shouldn't we ask Sister-in-law Feng?

422
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,040
No.

423
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,040
Next sentence is,

424
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,040
Sister-in-law,

425
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,040
he asked you the second sentence.

426
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,040
He said he helped you

427
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,040
to invest money in the past.

428
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,040
He said he was sorry.

429
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,040
He said he slept in this coffin

430
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,040
and had a few dreams.

431
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,040
He wanted to

432
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,040
fix your loss

433
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,040
in his dreams.

434
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,040
He helped you to turn the script.

435
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,040
He also said

436
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,040
he had found a way.

437
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,040
Sister-in-law,

438
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,040
my brother was so jealous of you.

439
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,040
He even made me

440
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,040
jealous of you as a sister-in-law.

441
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,040
I was also jealous.

442
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,040
Really.

443
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,040
Sister-in-law,

444
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,040
you just sent a message.

445
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,040
I showed it to my brother.

446
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,040
My brother is in a bad state now.

447
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,040
I can't go back to you personally.

448
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,040
But he wants me to tell you

449
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,040
that your money is yours.

450
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,040
Don't give it to anyone.

451
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,040
He helped you

452
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,040
to invest money in the past.

453
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,040
He must find it for you.

454
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,040
Come, have a look.

455
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,040
These are the letters.

456
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,040
What is the meaning of

457
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,040
the author's feeling?

458
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,040
How can I answer it?

459
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,040
I can't answer it.

460
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,040
Take care of yourself.

461
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,040
Come to the funeral.

462
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,040
You are dead.

463
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,040
You should see what time it is.

464
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,040
It's not appropriate

465
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,040
to give him a night's sleep.

466
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,040
What can I do?

467
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,040
I can only answer him

468
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,040
in a few hours.

469
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,040
I'm so worried.

470
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,040
These cheaters.

471
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,040
They really don't want to answer the purpose,

472
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,040
right, brother-in-law?

473
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,040
They dare not write the last letter.

474
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,040
They really don't want to.

475
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,040
Brother-in-law,

476
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,040
you should take care of the work.

477
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,040
Don't overdo it.

478
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,040
You are a cheater.

479
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,040
Don't worry.

480
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,040
He is a rich man

481
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,040
who is rich in the debt.

482
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,040
Maybe he will use the debt

483
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,040
to make a living.

484
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,040
No, no, no.

485
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,040
If he is dead

486
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,040
and he comes back to life again,

487
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,040
then Sister Fan

488
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,040
will be in a bad mood.

489
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,040
That's too stupid.

490
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,040
You are so suspicious

491
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,040
that you are a cheater.

492
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,040
I think

493
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,040
we should

494
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,040
show him the negative

495
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,040
and show him the suspicion.

496
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,040
Let him prove himself to be alive.

497
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,040
How about it?

498
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,040
You are risky.

499
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,040
It may not be a good idea.

500
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,040
Let's only ask the question.

501
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,040
Let the cheaters think of their own way.

502
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,040
I think we can try.

503
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,040
Try?

504
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,040
You are really a cheater.

505
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,040
You are really alive.

506
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,040
Where are you now?

507
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,040
How is the situation?

508
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,040
I want to see you.

509
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,040
Is that okay?

510
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,040
Let's do it.

511
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,040
Don't come.

512
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,040
I don't want you to see me

513
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,040
like a living dead.

514
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,040
Dear,

515
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,040
if you are in a bad mood

516
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,040
for a long time,

517
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,040
I want to take good care of you.

518
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,040
The damage you caused last time

519
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,040
with the best condition

520
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,040
will appear in front of you.

521
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,040
Dear,

522
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,040
that day is not far away.

523
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,040
The boss is so good.

524
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,040
Thank you.

525
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,040
Thank you.

526
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,040
I can get off the bed today.

527
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,040
My legs are a little bit soft.

528
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,040
When I walk down the first step

529
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,040
under my sister's clothes,

530
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,040
I feel that I am really alive.

531
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,040
Dear,

532
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,040
don't worry.

533
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,040
I just need to recover my body.

534
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,040
I will go to the door to find my uncle.

535
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,040
I will definitely

536
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,040
get your money back.

537
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,040
Dear,

538
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,040
this is my bed in front of the hospital room.

539
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,040
I will go now.

540
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,040
Okay,

541
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,040
I will inform the brothers of the sea.

542
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,040
If you have this video,

543
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,040
they can decide for me.

544
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,040
The video and other clues

545
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,040
that were uploaded to the room

546
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,040
were immediately recorded by the technical team.

547
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,040
Now we can confirm that

548
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,040
the person who posted the video

549
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,040
is in the room 602.

550
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,040
We have conducted a secret investigation

551
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,040
on the internal situation of this building.

552
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,040
We found that in room 601 and room 602,

553
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,040
there were ten men and women

554
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,040
who were all the same.

555
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,040
Moreover,

556
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,040
they have rented the entire floor of the five floors

557
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,040
to the security guards.

558
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,040
We have also found that

559
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,040
the floor of the five floors is rented.

560
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,040
There are about 40 people living there.

561
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,040
You will often hear about the sound of the door

562
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,040
and the sound of the passengers.

563
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,040
The first step is to break the door.

564
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,040
The five floors should be a fake training class.

565
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,040
What?

566
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,040
Now the lie is being spread to school?

567
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,040
Most of our lies

568
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,040
are learned from Southeast Asian schools.

569
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,040
We have experienced one in the end of last year.

570
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,040
The lie is a professional training institution.

571
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,040
There are professional training textbooks.

572
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,040
The tuition fee is high.

573
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,040
The tuition fees are the most money

574
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,040
that we have earned in the first two years.

575
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,040
The school will take away the high-ranking students.

576
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,040
The students will be controlled by the fraud group.

577
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,040
Turn around.

578
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,040
With the Southeast Asian Commission,

579
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,040
the fraud has formed a kind of industry.

580
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,040
Or,

581
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,040
it has formed a hundred-thousand-fifth company.

582
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,040
We have to break it down.

583
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,040
We just break down the fake company.

584
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,040
We can't get it through.

585
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,040
If we want to stop this black industry,

586
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,040
we can do it internationally.

587
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,040
Boss.

588
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,040
Take a toilet and use it.

589
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,040
Dad, what are you eating?

590
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,040
Sit down.

591
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,040
Boss, order.

592
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,040
Come on, guys. Have some food.

593
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,040
Take the food.

594
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,040
Thank you.

595
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,040
Let's go.

596
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,040
This is it.

597
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,040
The old horse is in the hotel.

598
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,040
He is on fire downstairs.

599
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,040
We said we would catch the client's heart.

600
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,040
How can we catch the client's heart?

601
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,040
We said,

602
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,040
we would give you the pressure

603
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,040
to cherish the top-level motivation.

604
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,040
What is the pressure?

605
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,040
What is the pressure?

606
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:52,040
The pressure is when you are talking to the client.

607
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,040
You have to quietly mention the client

608
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,040
and the difficulties and pressure that you will face in life.

609
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,040
Do you hear me?

610
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,040
Yes.

611
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,040
We cherish it.

612
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,040
What we cherish is telling the client

613
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,040
that you need to be confident.

614
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,040
What if the client

615
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,040
missed the chance?

616
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,040
Chief Gao,

617
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,040
we are responsible for this operation.

618
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,040
Please cooperate.

619
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,040
Don't act rashly.

620
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,040
Don't worry. We are waiting.

621
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,040
Wait a minute.

622
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,040
Chief Gao,

623
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,040
I will teach you.

624
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,040
No.

625
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,040
What?

626
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,040
Our chief said he won't act rashly.

627
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,040
That's good.

628
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,040
You catch the person who is the wind-sweeping man first.

629
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,040
Okay. I understand.

630
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,040
Hurry up.

631
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,040
What a fool.

632
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,040
I am really alive.

633
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,040
You want to see me?

634
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,040
Of course you can't let him come.

635
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,040
Tell him that you will go to Macau tomorrow.

636
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:09,040
Your uncle has already made a machine on the plane.

637
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,040
He will definitely return all the money.

638
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,040
Don't forget.

639
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,040
We are counting on you.

640
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,040
Okay.

641
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,040
Don't directly ask for money from him.

642
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,040
Think of a way to make him take the initiative.

643
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,040
What kind of person is he?

644
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,040
Move.

645
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,040
There are two people standing here.

646
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,040
The four-story building is upstairs.

647
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,040
Be careful.

648
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,040
The seven-story building.

649
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,040
Chief Gao,

650
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,040
I am going to the apartment.

651
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,040
I am going to the apartment.

652
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,040
Go in there.

653
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,040
Remember?

654
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,040
Yes.

655
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,040
Remember?

656
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,040
Yes.

657
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,040
Do you want to take the money?

658
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,040
Yes.

659
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,040
Do you want to?

660
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,040
Yes.

661
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,040
Do you want to?

662
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,040
Yes.

663
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,040
Move.

664
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,040
Bao.

665
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,040
Yes.

666
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,040
Okay.

667
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,040
He is going to the apartment.

668
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,040
The money is already here.

669
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,040
Move.

670
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,040
Move.

671
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,040
Move.

672
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,040
Move.

673
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,040
Move.

674
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,040
Move.

675
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,040
Move.

676
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,040
Move.

677
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,040
Move the phone out of the way.

678
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,040
Move.

679
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,040
Move.

680
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,040
Move the phone out of the way.

681
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,040
Move.

682
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,040
Hold it.

683
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,040
Who used this phone?

684
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,040
Who said it?

685
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,040
Bao.

686
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,040
Bao, save me.

687
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,040
Bao, save me.

688
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,040
Bao, save me.

689
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,040
Bao, save me.

690
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,040
Bao, save me.

691
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,040
Okay.

692
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,040
I will call the police.

693
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,040
You just ate it, right?

694
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,040
I...

695
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,040
I am not going to call the police.

696
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,040
I am going to call the police.

697
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,040
Okay.

698
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,040
Be careful.

699
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,040
You see the money.

700
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,040
Let's go.

701
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,040
Okay.

702
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,040
Dawei.

703
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,040
Hello, master.

704
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,040
I got it.

705
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,040
The chat,

706
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,040
the transfer,

707
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,040
the training,

708
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,040
the one pot of stew.

709
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,040
Great.

710
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,040
Good boy.

711
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,040
What about the dirty money?

712
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,040
Can you pay back?

713
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,040
How much can you pay back?

714
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,040
Didn't the chief say it?

715
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,040
How much?

716
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,040
You pay back.

717
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,040
No matter how much it is,

718
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,040
it's a deal for the victim.

719
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,040
Yes.

720
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,040
I just heard that

721
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,040
when I reported to the chief,

722
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,040
he meant it.

723
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,040
The chief said,

724
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,040
even if the money is not enough,

725
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,040
at least the criminal who

726
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,040
is lying to the suspect

727
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,040
is to apologize to him

728
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,040
in front of the suspect.

729
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,040
I think this is the most basic thing.

730
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,040
But now,

731
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,040
the transfer is a bit difficult.

732
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,040
Hai Ming is not letting go of the person.

733
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,040
There must be a problem.

734
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,040
Just cooperate with the high-speed operation.

735
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,040
Yes.

736
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,040
We will do our best to

737
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,040
quickly suppress the criminal.

738
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,040
Okay.

739
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,040
Dawei,

740
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,040
you can be more careful.

741
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,040
Okay.

742
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,040
Tell me.

743
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,040
Chief Zhao.

744
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,040
Chief Zhao.

745
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,040
Chief Zhao.

746
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,040
What I just told you...

747
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,040
You saw it all.

748
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,040
What we are doing now

749
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,040
is just that they lied to the suspect

750
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,040
yesterday.

751
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,040
They didn't even turn around.

752
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,040
It's more than one hundred thousand people.

753
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,040
If we look closely,

754
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,040
how many they lied to,

755
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,040
I'm afraid it will take a lot of time.

756
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,040
I guess more than one hundred thousand people

757
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,040
didn't even get their head cut.

758
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,040
I know, Chief Zhao.

759
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,040
It's impossible to completely lose the loss.

760
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,040
But we still have to do our best.

761
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,040
We have two victims

762
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,040
who have already committed suicide.

763
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,040
So I hope

764
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,040
we can give them more losses.

765
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,040
Maybe we can

766
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,040
make them have the courage to live.

767
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,040
I'm sorry, Chief Zhao.

768
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,040
Before the investigation of the case is clear,

769
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,040
no one can use this money.

770
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,040
Not only your victims

771
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,040
have committed suicide,

772
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,040
our victims are the same.

773
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,040
So,

774
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,040
please understand.

775
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,040
Okay, I understand.

776
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,040
I understand completely.

777
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,040
Can we

778
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,040
use the two victims'

779
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,040
who are directly related to us

780
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,040
to put the suspect in the case?

781
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,040
I'm sorry.

782
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,040
This is not possible.

783
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,040
Chief Zhao,

784
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,040
don't be anxious to refuse.

785
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,040
I know.

786
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,040
After this is cheated,

787
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,040
the victim who committed suicide

788
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,040
must not know that we have it.

789
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,040
But this is not more than a test for our police.

790
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,040
Can we think about

791
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,040
each victim

792
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,040
from every angle?

793
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,040
Please understand.

794
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,040
Chief Zhao,

795
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,040
after the case was solved,

796
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,040
I called the family

797
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,040
and told them

798
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,040
that we have a victim

799
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,040
who committed suicide

800
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,040
again in the hospital.

801
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,040
I know

802
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,040
we have some overestimation.

803
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,040
We didn't follow the rules.

804
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,040
But the fate of the people

805
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,040
can be discussed.

806
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,040
Chief Zhao,

807
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,040
this is really a big problem.

808
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,040
If we can bring the suspect back,

809
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,040
maybe it's just a fate.

810
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,040
I'll treat you to a meal.

811
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,040
Thank you.

812
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,040
Thank you.

813
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,040
Chief Zhao.

814
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,040
Get out.

815
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,040
Chief Zhao.

816
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,040
Hi.

817
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,040
Chief Zhao.

818
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,040
Chief Zhao.

819
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,040
Chief Zhao.

820
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,040
Chief Zhao.

821
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,040
Chief Zhao.

822
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,040
What's wrong?

823
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,040
Who told you to do this?

824
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,040
What's wrong with you?

825
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,040
You look so excited.

826
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,040
I'm excited.

827
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,040
The victim is in a trance.

828
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,040
We called the police

829
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,040
last night.

830
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,040
The police and the people

831
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,040
have discussed it.

832
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,040
We'll arrest them

833
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,040
tomorrow morning.

834
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,040
That's great.

835
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,040
That's great.

836
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,040
Yes.

837
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,040
That's a good thing.

838
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,040
By the way,

839
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,040
I have a better thing to tell you.

840
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,040
Go to the hospital right now.

841
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,040
Tell Wu Yu

842
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,040
about this good news.

843
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,040
Tell her

844
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,040
to bring the criminal back

845
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,040
and to her right away.

846
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,040
She'll be punished.

847
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,040
Chief Zhao.

848
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:59,040
Let others do this.

849
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,040
Why?

850
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,040
Actually,

851
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,040
I went to the hospital yesterday.

852
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,040
I really don't know

853
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,040
how to persuade her.

854
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,040
You...

855
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,040
What's wrong?

856
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,040
I can't find a way.

857
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,040
You can't find a way?

858
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,040
You have a way now.

859
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,040
You said you'd say

860
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,040
you'd persuade her, right?

861
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,040
Now?

862
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,040
There's a good news.

863
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,040
You got it.

864
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,040
Tell her

865
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,040
to bring the criminal back

866
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,040
and to bring the criminal back.

867
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,040
Chief Zhao.

868
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,040
Chief Zhao.

869
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,040
Come here.

870
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,040
Chief Zhao.

871
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,040
What's the matter?

872
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,040
You go to the hospital

873
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,040
with the director.

874
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,040
Is it uncomfortable for you

875
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,040
to go with the director?

876
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,040
The director

877
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,040
asked us to go to the hospital.

878
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,040
He comforted Wu Yu.

879
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,040
He told her

880
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,040
to lie to her.

881
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,040
She got caught.

882
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,040
But I can't open the door.

883
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,040
Don't bother.

884
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,040
In a while,

885
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,040
how will you

886
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,040
get into the hook with Zhao Jiwei?

887
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,040
You know this.

888
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,040
Just tell her

889
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,040
about this.

890
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,040
Just tell her

891
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,040
about the story.

892
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,040
If you want to break it,

893
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,040
you can do it again.

894
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,040
Go ahead.

895
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,040
I'll change my clothes.

896
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,040
I'll be right down.

897
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,040
I'll send a message first.

898
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,040
Go ahead.

899
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,040
A man who believes in life

900
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,040
and believes in himself

901
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,040
completely.

902
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,040
How do you think

903
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,040
we should persuade him

904
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,040
to re-convince him

905
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,040
to use his life?

906
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,040
If he gets caught,

907
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,040
he should be at ease.

908
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,040
It's him.

909
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,040
Director Zhao,

910
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,040
I think

911
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,040
Wu Yu will feel at ease

912
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,040
when he hears the lie.

913
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,040
But I think

914
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,040
it's just a matter of time.

915
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,040
Because the liar

916
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,040
didn't only listen to his money,

917
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,040
but also encouraged him

918
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,040
to continue living.

919
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,040
I think

920
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,040
we should

921
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,040
try to get into this.

922
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,040
Am I wrong?

923
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,040
No.

924
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,040
Well,

925
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,040
I think

926
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,040
after you arrive at the emergency room,

927
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,040
the whole person

928
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,040
will be in danger

929
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,040
from the inside out.

930
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,040
Am I?

931
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,040
Of course.

932
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,040
We'll be there soon.

933
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,040
I'll keep the message

934
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,040
you saw at the emergency room.

935
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,040
I'll tell him.

936
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,040
Okay.

937
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,040
The assistant director is over there.

938
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,040
You can talk to him.

939
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,040
I'll talk to him.

940
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,040
What's wrong?

941
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,040
Wu Yu?

942
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,040
Stop!

943
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,040
Stop!

944
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,040
Wu Yu!

945
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,040
Wu Yu!

946
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,040
Wu Yu!

947
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,040
Wu Yu!

948
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,040
Stop!

949
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,040
Don't jump!

950
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,040
I'm telling you,

951
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,040
I'm telling you,

952
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,040
I'm telling you,

953
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,040
don't do anything stupid!

954
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,040
Don't do anything stupid!

955
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,040
Hurry up and call the police!

956
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,040
The police are here.

957
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,040
The police are here.

958
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,040
The police are here.

959
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,040
The police are here.

960
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,040
The police are here.

961
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,040
The police are here.

962
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,040
The police are here.

963
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,040
The police are here.

964
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,040
The police are here.

965
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,040
The police are here.

966
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,040
The police are here.

967
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,040
The police are here.

968
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,040
The police are here.

969
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,040
The police are here.

970
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,040
The police are here.

971
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,040
The police are here.

972
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,040
The police are here.

973
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,040
The police are here.

974
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,040
The police are here.

975
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,040
The police are here.

976
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,040
Hello, Li Jiawei.

977
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,040
What are you doing here

978
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,040
in the middle of the night?

979
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,040
I'm out of the room.

980
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,040
I'm out of the room.

981
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,040
Why are you sitting here?

982
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,040
Wei, Wei.

983
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,040
I've been with you

984
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,040
for a long time in the hospital.

985
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,040
Let's go.

986
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,040
What are you two doing?

987
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,040
Are you going to be the guard of the hospital?

988
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,040
Dawei.

989
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,040
Dawei.

990
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,040
Didn't I tell you

991
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,040
that we've done our best

992
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,040
and not our responsibility?

993
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,040
I know it's not our responsibility.

994
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,040
I still don't think it's our responsibility.

995
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,040
I just think

996
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,040
we've done our best.

997
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,040
But there are still things we can't do.

998
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,040
I saw Wei jump into the building.

999
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,040
It's very close.

1000
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,040
It's almost like a nose

1001
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,040
that's been drawn by you from the eyes.

1002
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,040
I can't describe it.

1003
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,040
I can't say it's not my fault.

1004
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,040
I feel it.

1005
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,040
But this time,

1006
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,040
it's different from Dr. Zhuo's.

1007
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,040
I'm not that scared.

1008
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,040
I just think

1009
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,040
these are things I need to go through.

1010
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,040
I'm not scared.

1011
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,040
I just asked myself

1012
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,040
if I still want to be a police officer.

1013
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,040
The police will be very sure.

1014
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,040
I do.

1015
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,040
I do.

1016
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,040
At this moment,

1017
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,040
I think about Dr. Zhuo.

1018
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,040
I think about the sense of helplessness

1019
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,040
when I face Dr. Zhuo

1020
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,040
with a dozen of knives.

1021
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,040
I think about the sense of helplessness.

1022
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,040
Liar.

1023
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,040
I'm not poor.

1024
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,040
I'm guilty every day.

1025
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:05,040
But it's not realistic

1026
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,040
to ask the police to stop me.

1027
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,040
Where's the meaning of our police work?

1028
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,040
Last night,

1029
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,040
when I heard that the fraud was arrested,

1030
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,040
a call from Ms. Fan, the victim,

1031
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,040
called me.

1032
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,040
She said she got the understanding

1033
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:35,040
of the daughter and the son-in-law.

1034
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,040
She wanted to live well.

1035
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:43,040
I think this is the meaning of our work.

1036
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,040
We may not be able to follow the criminal.

1037
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,040
We can't protect everyone.

1038
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,040
But the police are there.

1039
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,040
The social defense is there.

1040
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,040
The kindness and justice are there.

1041
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,040
For those who were saved,

1042
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:08,040
our police work is meaningful.

1043
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,040
The anti-fraud fraud case.

1044
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,040
I'll talk to you about it.

1045
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,040
Let me say something.

1046
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,040
The anti-fraud fraud case

1047
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,040
is the same as the one

1048
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,040
that was arrested.

1049
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,040
The social defense is more important

1050
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,040
than the one after the death.

1051
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,040
So,

1052
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,040
the police have made a counter-fraud fraud case.

1053
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,040
They have invited experts

1054
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,040
to give the public a lesson.

1055
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,040
After that,

1056
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,040
the police will take care of the case.

1057
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,040
The requirements.

1058
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,040
The technical requirements

1059
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,040
are sent to every community,

1060
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,040
every family,

1061
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,040
and to all residents in the region

1062
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,040
to do counter-fraud fraud.

1063
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,040
Do you understand?

1064
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,040
Yes.

1065
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,040
Besides,

1066
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,040
the police decided

1067
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,040
to take the counter-fraud fraud case

1068
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,040
as our long-term job.

1069
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:11,040
We must continue to stick to it.

1070
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,040
Do you believe it?

1071
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,040
Yes.

1072
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,040
I'm done.

1073
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,040
Okay.

1074
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,040
See you.

1075
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,040
Mr. Liang.

1076
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,040
Mr. Liang.

1077
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,040
Why are you here?

1078
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,040
My master won't come today.

1079
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,040
He's not here.

1080
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,040
I'll go to the hospital.

1081
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,040
I'll go to the hospital.

1082
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,040
I'll go to the hospital.

1083
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,040
Mr. Liang.

1084
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,040
Mr. Liang.

1085
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,040
Mr. Liang.

1086
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,040
Mr. Liang.

1087
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,040
Mr. Liang.

1088
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,040
Mr. Liang.

1089
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,040
Come out.

1090
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,040
I'll welcome him.

1091
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,040
You still remember him?

1092
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,040
No, Mrs. Liang.

1093
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,040
Mr. Su called me to remind me of him.

1094
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,040
He also wants to come.

1095
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,040
He's too busy.

1096
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,040
He can't do anything.

1097
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,040
I understand.

1098
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,040
I'm sorry.

1099
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,040
I'm sorry.

1100
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,040
I'm sorry.

1101
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,040
I'm sorry.
