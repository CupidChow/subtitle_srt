1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I

3
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,440
I

4
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Here you go.

6
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Bye.

7
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Bye.

8
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Bye.

9
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Bye.

10
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Bye.

11
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Bye.

12
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Bye.

13
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Bye.

14
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Bye.

15
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Chief,

16
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
we've been going up the last quarter.

17
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The situation is getting better.

18
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The same goes for the quarter of 2014.

19
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Chief,

20
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
you don't know what's going on in Paris.

21
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You're a famous person.

22
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Chief,

23
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I was about to tell you.

24
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You're taking care of him?

25
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
There are four of us.

26
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
One of us is a senior.

27
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
He's a good guy.

28
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
He's a good guy.

29
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
He's a good guy.

30
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
He's a good guy.

31
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
He's a good guy.

32
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You're a big guy.

33
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Chief,

34
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
you're not a good guy.

35
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You're a big guy.

36
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You're a big guy.

37
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Don't ask me.

38
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I've known him.

39
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
He's a famous guy.

40
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
He was a good guy.

41
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
He was a good guy.

42
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
He was a good guy.

43
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
He was a good guy.

44
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
If he wasn't a good guy,

45
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
would you let him join us?

46
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Chief,

47
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
we need time to raise money.

48
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
How about this?

49
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
The next door is the city hall.

50
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The name of the place is Qian Shi.

51
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's a good place to raise money.

52
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
How about we

53
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
compare the resources?

54
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'll change the money.

55
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You can give them the best graduate.

56
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Chief,

57
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
you're taking my 7-seater.

58
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Okay, I've said it.

59
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
We must

60
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
have a warm welcome ceremony.

61
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Let's start at 9.

62
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
What? You're here too?

63
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I said it's still half an hour.

64
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Okay, let's meet at 9.

65
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
See you at 9.

66
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Okay.

67
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
My mom.

68
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You're my best friend.

69
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You're making me so stressed.

70
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You're making me so stressed.

71
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Xiao An,

72
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
move all the green paper on the board.

73
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's a big flow.

74
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You know how to draw.

75
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Go ahead.

76
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Go ahead.

77
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Xiao Lv,

78
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
wipe it inside.

79
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Okay.

80
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Xiao An,

81
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
move all the green paper.

82
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Okay.

83
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Chief,

84
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
we're going to the final.

85
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
The Song Army is coming.

86
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
We must have a warm welcome ceremony.

87
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Don't be so careless.

88
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You should clean this place

89
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
like a new house.

90
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You newbies

91
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
will fall in love with us.

92
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Don't you want to leave?

93
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm watching you.

94
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Okay, I'll go to the reception.

95
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'll go there.

96
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Qin Qiao,

97
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
what are you doing?

98
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm thinking about it.

99
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's been a long day.

100
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
The Song Army is still half an hour.

101
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
We must have a warm welcome ceremony.

102
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You guys should change your clothes

103
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
and go to the welcome ceremony.

104
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Is it worth it?

105
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I haven't slept for a long time.

106
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Of course.

107
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Let me tell you.

108
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
If it's not me,

109
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'll have to put on a face

110
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
and a soft face.

111
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Chief,

112
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
we haven't seen you

113
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
in such a big world.

114
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You're talking about the old law.

115
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Think about it.

116
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Four newbies

117
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
have never been in the history of Paris.

118
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You're so close.

119
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You're working for us.

120
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You're here again.

121
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Do you really need this?

122
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Yes, we're free.

123
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Qin Qiao,

124
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
you should also choose

125
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
a newbie.

126
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
A newbie?

127
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Don't make me do this.

128
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
No, no, no.

129
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I have something to do.

130
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Go to the reception.

131
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Chief, I'm still watching

132
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
the video of the newbie.

133
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I've been watching it for a whole night.

134
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
This is a great idea.

135
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
What is it?

136
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Okay, go to work.

137
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Okay.

138
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
What child?

139
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Three times the correct answer.

140
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You should not rely on

141
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
your own hands to work hard.

142
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You're the best.

143
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I've been told that

144
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
you think you have money.

145
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Do you think

146
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm as happy as you think?

147
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You're wrong.

148
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You're not as happy as I think.

149
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You're so smart.

150
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You're so smart.

151
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You're making a fool of me.

152
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Don't be angry.

153
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You're so stupid.

154
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm saying you should be smart.

155
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You're a smart boy.

156
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You can't be my son.

157
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You're so stupid.

158
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You're a smart boy.

159
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You're not a smart boy.

160
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Stop it.

161
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Stop playing hard to get.

162
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm not playing hard to get.

163
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Fine.

164
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
What's wrong with you?

165
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You're a smart boy.

166
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You're a smart boy.

167
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You're right.

168
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You're not a smart boy.

169
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,200
He's a fool.

170
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,800
He's not good.

171
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,800
No, no, no.

172
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,800
No, no, no.

173
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,800
No, no, no.

174
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,800
No, no, no.

175
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,800
No, no, no.

176
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,800
No, no, no.

177
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,800
No, no, no.

178
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,800
No, no, no.

179
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,800
No, no, no.

180
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,800
Move, move, move.

181
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,800
I'm the police.

182
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,800
Everyone, calm down.

183
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,800
I'm here to handle it.

184
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,800
Grandma, grandma.

185
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,800
Grandma, I'm the police.

186
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,800
You don't have to panic.

187
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,800
Just tell the situation clearly.

188
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,800
Okay.

189
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,800
You're a fool.

190
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,800
Do you have any evidence

191
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,800
to prove your relationship with this child?

192
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,800
Grandma, you...

193
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,800
Grandma, you...

194
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,800
You have a...

195
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,800
Grandma, you're a fool.

196
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,600
Did you bring your ID card?

197
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,600
I didn't.

198
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,600
Then why are you crying so hard?

199
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,600
Are you hungry?

200
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,600
Grandma, you have evidence.

201
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,600
Grandma, you have evidence.

202
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,600
No, why are you crying so hard?

203
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,600
Are you hungry?

204
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,600
You have some milk.

205
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,600
I didn't bring my ID card.

206
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,600
Grandma, get in the car.

207
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,600
Grandma, I'm not going to get in.

208
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,600
Grandma, I'm definitely asking.

209
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,600
I'm definitely asking.

210
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,600
I'm definitely telling.

211
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,600
Grandma, let the police come out and handle it.

212
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,600
Uncle Jin.

213
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,600
Don't run.

214
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,600
You go first.

215
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,600
I'll take them down to the police station.

216
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,600
Okay.

217
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,600
Everyone, calm down.

218
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,600
I'll handle it.

219
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,600
I'm going down now.

220
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,600
Grandma, get in the car.

221
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,600
I'll take the police over.

222
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,600
You go to work.

223
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,600
Okay?

224
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,600
Police, please show us your ID card.

225
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,600
I'm a witness.

226
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,600
I'm not a witness.

227
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,600
You're not a witness?

228
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,600
The police are all here.

229
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,600
I'm not a witness.

230
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,600
You're a fool.

231
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,600
You're a fool.

232
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,600
You're a fool.

233
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,600
You're a fool.

234
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,600
I'm a witness.

235
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,600
I'm a witness.

236
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,600
I'm a witness.

237
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,600
Don't change the law.

238
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,600
Why hasn't the ID card been taken down?

239
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,600
Take it away.

240
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,600
Wait a minute.

241
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,600
Be careful.

242
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,600
Hurry up.

243
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,600
Grandma, who is this?

244
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,600
Did I not get a job outside?

245
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,600
No.

246
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,600
I'm here to report.

247
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,600
Zhao Jiwei.

248
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,600
He's a good guy.

249
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,600
He's got a good eye.

250
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,600
Zhao, come here.

251
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,600
Zhao, come here.

252
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,600
Come here.

253
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,600
Let me introduce you.

254
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,600
This is the chief of the police station in Dalian.

255
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,600
The chief of the police station.

256
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,600
Chief of the police station,

257
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,600
Zhao Jiwei, the police station.

258
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,600
I'm here to report.

259
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,600
Welcome.

260
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,600
What's this?

261
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,600
Chief of the police station.

262
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,600
So excited.

263
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,600
Chief.

264
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,600
Chief.

265
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,600
Who's here?

266
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,600
Who is this?

267
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,600
How can she be with a big girl?

268
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,600
She's a big man.

269
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,600
She can't recognize her.

270
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,600
Chief, I'm here to report to the police station.

271
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,600
Xia Jie.

272
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,600
Comrade of the police station, Xia Jie.

273
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,600
Welcome.

274
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,600
Welcome.

275
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,600
Your mom called us this morning.

276
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,600
She said she'd take good care of you.

277
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,600
Do you know she called?

278
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,600
If she doesn't,

279
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,600
we'll take good care of you.

280
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,600
Thank you, chief.

281
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,600
Thank you, chief.

282
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,600
Thank you, chief.

283
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,600
Thank you.

284
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,600
We're family.

285
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,600
From now on,

286
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,600
you'll follow Cheng Zuo.

287
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,600
She's your master.

288
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,600
Okay?

289
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,600
Your father was my master.

290
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,600
Now I'm his master.

291
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,600
It's a good name.

292
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,600
It's a good name.

293
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,600
You take her to the police station.

294
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,600
Okay.

295
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,600
Later,

296
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,600
we'll send her to the new doctor.

297
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,600
Okay.

298
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,600
Go.

299
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,600
Chief.

300
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,600
I'm Jiang Xixi.

301
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,600
I'm Zhao Junwei.

302
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,600
I'm a student.

303
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,600
Okay.

304
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,600
Hello.

305
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,600
You're a good boy.

306
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,600
Really.

307
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,600
Have a good time.

308
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,600
Xia Jie.

309
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,600
I'll take you there.

310
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,600
How about I clean the yard with you?

311
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,600
Let you go.

312
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,600
Go up there.

313
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,600
Go.

314
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,600
Go.

315
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,600
Okay.

316
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,600
Go to work.

317
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,600
Go to work.

318
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,600
Hurry up.

319
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,600
There are two guys in the yard.

320
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,600
Why are they here?

321
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,600
This way.

322
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,600
Barley and the police station.

323
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,600
What are we doing?

324
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,600
What are we doing?

325
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,600
Chief.

326
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,600
What are we doing?

327
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,600
We're setting up the main stage.

328
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,600
What main stage?

329
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,600
It's a simple wedding ceremony.

330
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,600
No one is talking.

331
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,600
Why are we doing this?

332
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,600
We even brought some incense.

333
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,600
Go back.

334
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,600
Okay.

335
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,600
Let's go.

336
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,600
What are we doing, Xingcheng?

337
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,600
Barley and the police station suspect that there's a criminal.

338
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,600
A criminal?

339
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,600
Yes.

340
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,600
There's a criminal in the early morning.

341
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,600
The police are so violent.

342
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,600
I'll go check the situation first.

343
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,600
Okay.

344
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,600
I'll go check the situation first.

345
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,600
I'll go back later.

346
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,600
Okay.

347
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,600
Okay.

348
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,600
Go.

349
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,600
What's going on?

350
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,600
They're so violent.

351
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,600
I told them I was the police.

352
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,600
They don't believe me.

353
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,600
Get out of the car.

354
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,600
They're late.

355
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,600
It's okay.

356
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,600
Chief.

357
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,600
Chief.

358
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,600
You're going to kill me.

359
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,600
Are you Li Dawei?

360
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,600
You know me.

361
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,600
Who's your brother?

362
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,600
Barley and the police station suspect Li Dawei.

363
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,600
I'm here.

364
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,600
I'm not sure how far I'm from our station.

365
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,600
I can go to the police station at the first day of work.

366
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,600
Do you think you're so capable?

367
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,600
Yes.

368
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,600
I'm the first one to catch a suspect.

369
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,600
Is that okay?

370
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,600
You're not too enthusiastic.

371
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,600
Hello, Mr. Wang.

372
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,600
Chief.

373
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,600
What's up?

374
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,600
That...

375
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,600
Help me find him.

376
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,600
What for?

377
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,600
The police are coming.

378
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,600
Two new people are not here yet.

379
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,600
Where are they?

380
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,600
They're...

381
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,600
Yes.

382
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,600
They must be in contact with the police.

383
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,600
They're calling.

384
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,600
Yes.

385
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,600
One is Li Dawei.

386
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,600
The other is Yang Shu.

387
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,600
I know.

388
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,600
Chief.

389
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,600
Chief.

390
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,600
Let's go.

391
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,600
Didn't Xu's boyfriend let us out?

392
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,600
He's afraid of the police.

393
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,600
Two new people are here.

394
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,600
Chief.

395
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,600
After the meeting is over,

396
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,600
we'll talk to him again.

397
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,600
When the chief is gone.

398
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,600
Okay.

399
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,600
Wait.

400
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,600
We're not always like this.

401
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,600
We always have to face it.

402
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,600
We can hide and hide.

403
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,600
We can't hide.

404
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,600
They must be together.

405
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,600
To solve the problem.

406
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,600
Xiaoting.

407
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,600
Go and let them out.

408
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,600
We'll solve the problem later.

409
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,600
Got it?

410
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,600
Yes, Chief.

411
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,600
Chief.

412
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,600
Chief.

413
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,600
Chief.

414
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,600
I saw it.

415
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,600
Chief.

416
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,600
How is it?

417
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,600
How is it?

418
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,600
There's no personal contact in the notice.

419
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,600
Chief.

420
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,600
What's wrong?

421
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,600
The car is here.

422
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,600
Yes, it's here.

423
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,600
They're not here.

424
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,600
Yes.

425
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,600
They're here.

426
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,600
Come.

427
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,600
Stop.

428
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,600
Chief.

429
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,600
Get in the car.

430
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,600
Get in.

431
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,600
Chief.

432
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,600
Chief.

433
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,600
Welcome home.

434
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,600
I'm Lu.

435
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,600
Uncle Yang brought me here.

436
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,600
To study in the North University.

437
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,600
It's not easy for us to get a license.

438
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,600
Chief.

439
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,600
Don't say I don't take care of the Paris River.

440
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,600
I'll leave the property to you.

441
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,600
Big brother.

442
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,600
You don't take care of the Paris River.

443
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,600
Who takes care of the Paris River?

444
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,600
You're from the Paris River.

445
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,600
Doctor.

446
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,600
Welcome.

447
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,600
Welcome to the Paris River Pact.

448
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,600
Hello, Doctor.

449
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,600
No, Doctor. It's a story.

450
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,600
Whether it's a story or a story,

451
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,600
it's all human beings.

452
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,600
Look.

453
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,600
A person.

454
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,600
By the way, Chief.

455
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,600
It's time to start.

456
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,600
I don't know.

457
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,600
I think we should wait a little longer.

458
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,600
What's wrong?

459
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,600
We need someone.

460
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,600
Who?

461
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,600
You.

462
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,600
You're a big head.

463
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,600
Big head.

464
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,600
What should we do?

465
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,600
Wait.

466
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,600
Let's start.

467
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,600
Let's start.

468
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,600
Chief.

469
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,600
Yes.

470
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,600
What's wrong?

471
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,600
I'll go first.

472
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,600
What's wrong?

473
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,600
What's wrong?

474
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,600
It's a misunderstanding.

475
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,600
What?

476
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,600
Look.

477
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,600
Brother.

478
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,600
I'm Li Dabai.

479
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,600
Who's your brother?

480
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,600
What's the name?

481
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,600
Chief.

482
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,600
Come down.

483
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,600
What's wrong?

484
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,600
What's wrong?

485
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,600
Hurry up.

486
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,600
Take him to the meeting room.

487
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,600
I'll join the wedding ceremony.

488
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,600
Go.

489
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,600
Chief.

490
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,600
It's Li Dabai.

491
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,600
You're Li Dabai?

492
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,600
You know it.

493
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,600
I'm not on the way.

494
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,600
Chief.

495
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,600
I'll join the ceremony.

496
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,600
Do you want me to follow?

497
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,600
Shut up.

498
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,600
What's the matter?

499
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,600
I'll tell you when the wedding ceremony is over.

500
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,600
The send-off is coming.

501
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,600
I'll join the wedding ceremony.

502
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,600
You should perform well.

503
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,600
Chief.

504
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,600
You know what?

505
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,600
You know what?

506
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,600
I'm not on the way.

507
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,600
I'm on the way.

508
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,600
I'm not on the way.

509
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,600
I'm on the way.

510
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,600
I'm not on the way.

511
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,600
I'm not on the way.

512
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,600
Chief.

513
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,600
Go ahead.

514
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,600
Okay.

515
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,600
Let's start.

516
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,600
Okay.

517
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,600
All right.

518
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,600
Go.

519
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,600
Go.

520
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,600
Go.

521
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,600
Go.

522
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,600
Chief.

523
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,600
The party is coming.

524
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,600
Please come in.

525
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,600
Li Dabai.

526
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,600
Zhao Jiwei.

527
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,600
Yang Shu.

528
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,600
Xia Jie.

529
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,600
Xia Jie.

530
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,600
When your father was in trouble,

531
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,600
you were just that tall.

532
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,600
I took you from the school to the hospital

533
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,600
for ten years.

534
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,600
Come.

535
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,600
Some of you may not know

536
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,600
who you are.

537
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,600
Xia Jie is the daughter of the chief of the eight-legged river.

538
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,600
Xia Junxiong's daughter.

539
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,600
Xia Junxiong's daughter.

540
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,600
The daughter of the chief of the eight-legged river.

541
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,600
Ten years ago,

542
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,600
I was still a normal police officer in this department.

543
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,600
During the execution of the mission,

544
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,600
I was holding a knife with a bandage.

545
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,600
I was shot.

546
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,600
I was in a hurry,

547
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,600
but Xia Junxiong was in charge.

548
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,600
He went up and down for me.

549
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,600
I was alive.

550
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,600
But Xia Junxiong was in charge.

551
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,600
Chief Xu.

552
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,600
Let's not talk about this

553
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,600
when we're having a big wedding.

554
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,600
Song Jun.

555
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,600
I promise you.

556
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,600
The eight-legged river and the police station

557
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,600
will protect Xia Jie from the top and bottom.

558
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,600
Let her be in the place

559
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,600
where the chief of the old river has been.

560
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,600
Let her grow up in the country.

561
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,600
I'm relieved to hear that.

562
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,600
I'm relieved to hear that.

563
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,600
Yes.

564
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,600
Guys.

565
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,600
With a warm applause,

566
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,600
please give a big hand to the chief of the old river.

567
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,600
Actually,

568
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,600
I have nothing to say.

569
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,600
The young police is not enough.

570
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,600
It's always the headache in our department.

571
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,600
Chief Wang.

572
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,600
Yes.

573
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,600
You were my master.

574
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,600
You're the chief now.

575
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,600
I'll leave these four young people to you.

576
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,600
You must raise them well.

577
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,600
Okay.

578
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,600
I'll take care of them.

579
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,600
I'll take care of them.

580
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,600
Then, the point is to say the most important thing.

581
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,600
The second quarter's ranking is coming down.

582
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,600
The number of people you belong to is not low.

583
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,600
93.4 percent.

584
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,600
The total is 163 police officers.

585
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,600
You have 144.

586
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,600
I know that you, the eight rivers,

587
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,600
must have a hundred reasons to wait for me.

588
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,600
What is the human resource composition?

589
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,600
Social economic activity?

590
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,600
What is the intersection of the cross-country?

591
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,600
And nodding?

592
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,600
The group of people is not to be explained.

593
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,600
It's not up to you.

594
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,600
There is one thing that I don't need to say.

595
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,600
You know it all.

596
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,600
Your chief Wang Shouyi,

597
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,600
is 54 years old this year.

598
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,600
He will retire to the second line next year.

599
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,600
You just bear it.

600
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,600
He has the record of ranking.

601
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,600
He will retire like this.

602
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,600
Who?

603
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,600
What's going on?

604
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,600
You know it.

605
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,600
It's about the Qiao family.

606
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,600
Isn't it the girl from the Qiao family

607
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,600
and the man from the Xu family

608
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,600
are dating?

609
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,600
After they broke up,

610
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,600
they broke up.

611
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,600
After the girl from the Qiao family,

612
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,600
she committed suicide.

613
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,600
The boy just thought it was true.

614
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,600
Later, he committed suicide as a fake.

615
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,600
He broke up with her.

616
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,600
I didn't expect the girl from the Qiao family

617
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,600
to commit suicide.

618
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,600
The Qiao family didn't want it.

619
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,600
They must demand the life of the killer.

620
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,600
I have never been in love with you.

621
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,600
If you want to marry, then marry.

622
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,600
I will marry.

623
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,600
But I didn't give a damn.

624
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,600
If I don't marry,

625
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,600
I can't marry.

626
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,600
I can only let go of people.

627
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,600
Then you just let them do that?

628
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,600
What if I don't let them do that?

629
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,600
I can't marry.

630
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,600
I can't do anything.

631
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,600
Especially the Qiao family

632
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,600
is always on the Internet.

633
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,600
They are the real ones.

634
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,600
They are the real ones.

635
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,600
They are the real ones.

636
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,600
They are the real ones.

637
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,600
They are so big.

638
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,600
The Qiao family

639
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,600
is the reason they are dating.

640
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,600
We are full of love.

641
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,600
If we have these two,

642
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,600
we will definitely get into the world.

643
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,600
Chief.

644
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,600
Chief.

645
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,600
Chief.

646
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,600
You really got into this fight?

647
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,600
You were about to blow up the house.

648
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,600
You were about to blow up?

649
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,600
You are so good at this.

650
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,600
Drink up.

651
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,600
He has a funny face.

652
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,600
The car door.

653
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,600
You go with the chief.

654
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,600
What are you doing?

655
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,600
Xiao Jing, let's go.

656
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,600
Chief, let's go to the office.

657
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,600
Go to sleep.

658
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,600
My daughter is going to die.

659
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,600
If it's not your daughter,

660
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,600
I will not save her.

661
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,600
Alright.

662
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,600
Enough.

663
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,600
What are you doing?

664
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,600
What are you doing?

665
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,600
Stop it.

666
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,600
Let go of me.

667
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,600
Let go of me.

668
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,600
Let go of me.

669
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,600
Let go of me.

670
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,600
Let go of me.

671
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,600
Let go of me.

672
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,600
Let go of me.

673
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,600
Chief.

674
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,600
Chief.

675
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,600
Let go of me.

676
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,600
Chief.

677
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,600
Chief.

678
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,600
Let go of me.

679
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,600
Chief.

680
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,600
Don't shoot.

681
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,600
Chief.

682
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,600
Chief.

683
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,600
Chief.

684
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,600
Let go of me.

685
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,600
We understand

686
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,600
the girl who died in your house.

687
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,600
But

688
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,600
Xu Zemin

689
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,600
his behavior is not enough to punish him.

690
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,600
He is not enough to punish him.

691
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,600
We have done the criticism and education.

692
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,600
You don't need the financial compensation.

693
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,600
Then why do you want us to do it?

694
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,600
Why are you still here?

695
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,600
What is the law?

696
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,600
He is not a murderer.

697
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,600
He is a murderer.

698
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,600
But he is alive one day.

699
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,600
I will let him live one day.

700
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,600
I tell you.

701
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,600
Xu Zemin is not a murderer.

702
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,600
He is not enough to punish him.

703
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,600
But you beat him up.

704
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,600
You hurt him on purpose.

705
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,600
You still love him.

706
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,600
If you do this,

707
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,600
I will punish you.

708
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,600
I will kill you.

709
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,600
Let go of me.

710
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,600
Let go of me.

711
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,600
Let go of me.

712
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,600
Let go of me.

713
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,600
Stop.

714
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,600
Let go of me.

715
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,600
Let go of me.

716
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,600
He is not listening to me.

717
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,600
Let go of me.

718
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,600
Let go of me.

719
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,600
Let go of me.

720
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,600
Hold the air.

721
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,600
Hold the air.

722
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,600
Chief.

723
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,600
Chief.

724
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,600
Don't go.

725
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,600
Don't go.

726
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,600
We can solve it.

727
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,600
You are doing this to the chief?

728
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,600
How can I do it?

729
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,600
Look at this.

730
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,600
It is public opinion.

731
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,600
Public opinion.

732
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,600
Public opinion.

733
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,600
We should do it.

734
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,600
We should do it.

735
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,600
Chief.

736
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,600
You have been in the police station for too long.

737
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,600
You forgot the name of the bar.

738
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,600
Master.

739
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,600
I still call you master.

740
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,600
I know what you are thinking.

741
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,600
What do I think?

742
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:26,600
You blame me for not letting them come here?

743
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,600
It is not the case.

744
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,600
I don't know.

745
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,600
What is the time now?

746
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,600
It is the age of moving the Internet.

747
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,600
People are free to talk.

748
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,600
When the police are out,

749
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,600
they are monitoring the phone

750
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,600
with a 360 degree angle.

751
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,600
They are making a fuss.

752
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,600
Right?

753
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,600
Look.

754
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,600
This family is dead.

755
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,600
What about the other one?

756
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,600
What is the name of the car?

757
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,600
It is a social death.

758
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,600
It is dead.

759
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,600
We should use violence.

760
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,600
The car is on the Internet.

761
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,600
It is a big mess.

762
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,600
Master.

763
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,600
You are playing with me.

764
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,600
Why are you so funny?

765
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,600
Don't you think I am the one who is making this?

766
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,600
Why do you want to tell me

767
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,600
that the public opinion is so low

768
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,600
because of this?

769
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,600
Or because of what?

770
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,600
Tell me.

771
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,600
You are so hardworking.

772
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,600
You are so hardworking.

773
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,600
Why?

774
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,600
Chief, what am I doing with you?

775
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,600
It is better to catch up with this.

776
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,600
What catch up with this?

777
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,600
Did you just let him go?

778
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,600
No.

779
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,600
You should let him go.

780
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,600
Or you should let him go.

781
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,600
Can I touch this?

782
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,600
You don't know.

783
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,600
It is my fault.

784
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,600
I am afraid that

785
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,600
you forgot about the new man.

786
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,600
I don't know you.

787
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,600
You are the best at making trouble.

788
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,600
Is it the trouble?

789
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,600
You should let me play with you.

790
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,600
What?

791
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,600
You can say whatever you want.

792
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,600
I have given you four new men.

793
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,600
Don't take any more

794
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,600
unnecessary things as the shield.

795
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,600
Okay?

796
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,600
Before we catch up,

797
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,600
we should make the public satisfied.

798
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,600
Yes.

799
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,600
Make it up.

800
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,600
Next time, we will make it to the wall.

801
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,600
How many?

802
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,600
The wall.

803
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,600
There are 100派出所 in total.

804
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,600
Your ambition is to make it to the wall.

805
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,600
If you don't want to make it,

806
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,600
I will take these four men back.

807
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,600
No, no, no.

808
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,600
Don't take them back.

809
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,600
I will try my best.

810
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,600
I will try my best.

811
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,600
Don't just try your best.

812
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,600
Can you let Fengqiao's spirit

813
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,600
develop?

814
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,600
To build the whole work.

815
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,600
To be strong and learn training.

816
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,600
Fengqiao's spirit will be

817
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,600
more powerful than me.

818
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,600
I will be more powerful than you.

819
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,600
Can you do that?

820
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,600
Yes, yes, yes.

821
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,600
Chief.

822
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,600
You are 10000 stars.

823
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,600
I am leaving.

824
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,600
Yes, yes, yes.

825
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,600
Chief.

826
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,600
What's wrong?

827
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,600
What is the end of

828
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,600
the journey

829
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,600
of the senior high school students in Beida?

830
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,600
You are not sure.

831
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,600
Didn't you say it?

832
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,600
It's a smooth journey.

833
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,600
It's a smooth journey.

834
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,600
Laiqing.

835
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,600
Be careful.

836
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,600
Chief.

837
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,600
Chief.

838
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,600
Chief.

839
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,600
Chief.

840
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,600
We have confirmed it.

841
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,600
We have confirmed it.

842
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,600
The old lady is not a criminal.

843
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,600
Isn't that good?

844
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,600
Hurry up and put that old lady down.

845
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,600
No.

846
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,600
The old lady's son

847
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,600
is here again.

848
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,600
Xiao Ge.

849
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,600
I heard that you caught

850
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,600
a human rice today.

851
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,600
It's not even in the office.

852
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,600
Now,

853
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,600
it's a suspect.

854
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,600
He hasn't found out yet.

855
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,600
Can you show me?

856
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,600
It's nothing serious.

857
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,600
I just bumped into that human rice

858
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,600
in the bus.

859
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,600
I lost it.

860
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,600
I caught it by myself.

861
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,600
You are amazing, Xiao Ge.

862
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,600
You are so strict.

863
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,600
You are so strict.

864
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,600
You are right.

865
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,600
This kind of person

866
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,600
should be arrested.

867
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,600
It's better to arrest him sooner.

868
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,600
What can we do about arresting him?

869
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,600
We still don't have a solution to the problem.

870
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,600
You can't be so selfish.

871
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,600
The police should be punished.

872
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,600
There is nothing wrong with being selfish.

873
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,600
The police are supposed to

874
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,600
arrest you.

875
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,600
Instead, they are planning to arrest you.

876
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,600
Yes.

877
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,600
What about now?

878
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,600
Did they plan to arrest you?

879
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,600
They are also arrested.

880
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,600
No wonder they have 144 lives.

881
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,600
If I were to say that,

882
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,600
the water bottle should be the bottom.

883
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,600
What?

884
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,600
You are so eloquent.

885
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,600
How about you come to my place

886
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,600
and sit down?

887
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,600
Chief,

888
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,600
I mean,

889
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,600
the bottom of the water is that

890
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,600
we can break through the city

891
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,600
and become the motivation

892
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,600
for our progress.

893
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,600
I haven't scolded you, you stinky brat.

894
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,600
You will be late for work on the first day.

895
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,600
You even got arrested by the real criminal.

896
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,600
You are mistaken.

897
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,600
You are mistaken?

898
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,600
Is that grandma really impossible?

899
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,600
Her family is here.

900
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,600
They are here to settle the case.

901
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,600
Go and apologize to them

902
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,600
when you are free.

903
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,600
I am afraid that you will be able to do it.

904
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,600
What's going on?

905
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,600
Yes, yes, yes.

906
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,600
I can understand everything.

907
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,600
Chief,

908
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,600
continue.

909
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,600
I am sorry.

910
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,600
Mr. Chen,

911
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,600
we know the situation.

912
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,600
It is a misunderstanding.

913
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,600
Look,

914
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,600
I am sorry to let my mom get the money.

915
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,600
But,

916
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,600
we have to follow the procedure

917
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,600
to get the police.

918
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,600
Misunderstanding?

919
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,600
Why do you misunderstand?

920
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,600
The old man who brought the kids to the street,

921
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,600
you are not only suspecting my mom,

922
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,600
but also your mom's opinion.

923
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,600
Is she wearing a broken shoe?

924
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,600
No, no, no.

925
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,600
Are you people

926
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,600
who are arrested by the police?

927
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,600
Mr. Chen,

928
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,600
you are talking nonsense.

929
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,600
The police never

930
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,600
followed the original

931
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,600
and the original intent

932
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,600
to make a judgment.

933
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,600
You can rest assured.

934
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,600
Is it because the kids are being bullied?

935
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,600
The kids who are bullied

936
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,600
are all criminals.

937
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,600
Mr. Chen,

938
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,600
this big brother,

939
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,600
I apologize to you.

940
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,600
It is a misunderstanding.

941
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,600
But the situation at that time

942
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,600
is really easy to misunderstand.

943
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,600
Your kid is crying in the bus.

944
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,600
The old man is not only angry,

945
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,600
but also scared the kid.

946
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,600
What do you mean scared the kid?

947
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,600
You are a kid.

948
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,600
You should go to the toilet and scare the kid.

949
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,600
You are so cold.

950
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,600
You scared the kid.

951
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,600
So cold.

952
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,600
Yes.

953
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,600
Don't be cold.

954
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,600
Your mom doesn't speak the language of pain.

955
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,600
She is a little stupid.

956
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,600
That's what she said.

957
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,600
Is it because of the gentleness of the head?

958
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,600
Is it because of the scared the kid?

959
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,600
Yes.

960
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,600
I understand what you said.

961
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,600
But I didn't mean anything else.

962
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,600
I just wanted to confirm

963
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,600
the identity and child relationship

964
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,600
with the old man.

965
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,600
But your mom didn't bring the ID card

966
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,600
and didn't bring anything

967
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,600
that can prove the child's relationship.

968
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,600
Even you don't want to be in the police.

969
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,600
You can go now.

970
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,600
You are so cold.

971
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,600
Look,

972
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,600
my mom scared the kid.

973
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,600
She was not good in the first place.

974
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,600
She was angry.

975
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,600
Mr. Chen,

976
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,600
the police is also kind.

977
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,600
What kind of kind?

978
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,600
The one who met the criminal

979
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,600
is only a failure.

980
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,600
They don't care about it.

981
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,600
They don't care about it.

982
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,600
The child will meet the criminal in the future.

983
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,600
What should we do?

984
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,600
I think my legs are soft.

985
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,600
David,

986
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,600
David,

987
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,600
please understand the situation.

988
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,600
Thank you.

989
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,600
Thank you.

990
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,600
Thank you.

991
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,600
Thank you.

992
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,600
Go home.

993
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,600
Go home.

994
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,600
Go home.

995
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,600
Is this over?

996
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,600
Is this over?

997
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,600
Listen,

998
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,600
you shouldn't let your mom

999
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,600
bring the child out.

1000
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,600
Slow down.

1001
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,600
This is your problem.

1002
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,600
It's okay.

1003
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,600
Come on.

1004
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,600
Thank you.

1005
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,600
Thank you.

1006
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,600
Okay.

1007
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,600
Thank you.

1008
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,600
Come on.

1009
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,600
Come on.

1010
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,600
Thank you.

1011
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,600
What's the need?

1012
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,600
Just try to

1013
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,600
to kick us, okay?

1014
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,600
Okay.

1015
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,600
Is the director

1016
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,600
learning to wear a mask?

1017
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,600
He's getting so fast.

1018
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,600
Let me introduce him.

1019
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,600
This is Director Zhao Ye Wei.

1020
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,600
Director Zhao.

1021
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,600
What's the need?

1022
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,600
Just tell us.

1023
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,600
Director Zhao, Director Zhao,

1024
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,600
you don't have to be so polite.

1025
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,600
You don't have to care about it.

1026
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,600
That's fine.

1027
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,600
What are you talking about?

1028
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,600
Of course I have to care about you.

1029
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,600
Yes, you will take good care of me.

1030
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,600
Right?

1031
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,600
Director Zhao,

1032
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,600
my monitoring capacity is really too high.

1033
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,600
Can you find someone

1034
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,600
to look around for me?

1035
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,600
Okay.

1036
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,600
Are you guys

1037
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,600
cleaning up the place?

1038
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,600
No.

1039
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,600
We're done.

1040
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,600
Now,

1041
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,600
we have a very serious task.

1042
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,600
Do you guys want to...

1043
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,600
I do.

1044
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,600
Okay.

1045
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,600
It's your turn.

1046
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,600
Well, let me introduce you.

1047
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,600
Officer Zhang Zhe Jie

1048
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,600
is in charge of the social work.

1049
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,600
You can follow this comrade

1050
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,600
to check the monitoring.

1051
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,600
The residents of this small area

1052
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,600
always ask us to check the

1053
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,600
material of the mask.

1054
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,600
You know what?

1055
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,600
This Zhe Jie

1056
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,600
has collected

1057
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,600
the monitoring video of the

1058
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,600
500 hours of monitoring.

1059
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,600
You can go with him.

1060
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,600
Let's go.

1061
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,600
Look at the monitor.

1062
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,600
It's the material of the mask.

1063
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,600
You're...

1064
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,600
What are you laughing at?

1065
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,600
You can go.

1066
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,600
Okay.

1067
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,600
Let's go.

1068
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,600
Zhe Jie,

1069
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,600
this way.

1070
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,600
This way.

1071
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,600
Xing Cheng,

1072
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,600
what's wrong with you?

1073
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,600
What's wrong with you?

1074
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,600
What's wrong with you?

1075
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,600
Director Zhao.

1076
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,600
Director Zhao,

1077
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,600
aren't you having a rest?

1078
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,600
You're here again.

1079
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,600
I just got home.

1080
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,600
I heard from you.

1081
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,600
Someone is scolding me.

1082
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,600
What's that?

1083
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,600
The informant said

1084
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,600
he was home just now.

1085
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,600
Hello.

1086
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,600
Please wait for a few more people.

1087
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,600
Come.

1088
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,600
Director,

1089
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,600
can I go?

1090
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,600
This is new.

1091
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,600
Yes, it's new.

1092
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,600
Let me introduce you.

1093
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,600
Gao Cao.

1094
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,600
We're the deputy director

1095
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,600
of the new department.

1096
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,600
Gao Cao.

1097
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,600
The informant, Li Da Wei.

1098
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,600
Gao Cao.

1099
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,600
The informant, Xia Jie.

1100
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,600
Gao Cao.

1101
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,600
The informant, Yang Shu.

1102
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,600
Young people

1103
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,600
are new.

1104
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,600
You see,

1105
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,600
they're all so active.

1106
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,600
Director,

1107
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,600
can I go?

1108
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,600
He's giving you

1109
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,600
a job as a deputy director.

1110
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,600
Come on,

1111
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,600
I'll go with you.

1112
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,600
You take a few people.

1113
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,600
Let's go together.

1114
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,600
Director,

1115
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,600
Director.

1116
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,600
What's this?

1117
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,600
You just got off work.

1118
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,600
Forget it.

1119
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,600
Director,

1120
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,600
I'm a professional.

1121
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,600
I'm not in a hurry.

1122
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,600
And I've been

1123
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,600
so tired these days.

1124
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,600
I mean,

1125
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,600
Li Da Wei.

1126
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,600
Can you go?

1127
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,600
You just watch

1128
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,600
if the police

1129
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,600
will take you with them.

1130
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,600
Director,

1131
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,600
I'm fine.

1132
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,600
I'll be back.

1133
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,600
Director,

1134
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,600
I want to go too.

1135
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,600
Director,

1136
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,600
can I go?

1137
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,600
The university

1138
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,600
is a huge treasure.

1139
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,600
You can't go down the steps.

1140
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,600
You've been burned for a long time.

1141
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,600
This mission

1142
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,600
is more dangerous.

1143
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,600
So,

1144
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,600
you two should not go.

1145
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,600
Director,

1146
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,600
it's because of the danger

1147
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,600
that I should

1148
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,600
be careful.

1149
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,600
I'm here to train.

1150
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,600
I'm here to study.

1151
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,600
Director,

1152
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,600
I'm not afraid of danger either.

1153
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,600
You two have this heart.

1154
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,600
Listen to me.

1155
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,600
Listen to me.

1156
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,600
Okay.

1157
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,600
Yang Shu, you go.

1158
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,600
Tell me.

1159
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,600
Let me introduce you.

1160
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,600
Yang Shu,

1161
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,600
a great doctor.

1162
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,600
He's our precious child.

1163
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,600
You know what?

1164
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,600
Stand behind him

1165
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,600
in a dangerous place.

1166
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,600
Take care of him.

1167
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,600
Don't worry, Director.

1168
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,600
I'm here.

1169
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,600
I'm protecting my baby.

1170
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,600
I can protect myself.

1171
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,600
Director, what about me?

1172
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,600
You...

1173
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,600
You...

1174
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,600
I'll take him to the hospital.

1175
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,600
Okay.

1176
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,600
You two change your clothes.

1177
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,600
Okay.

1178
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,600
Director, Xia Jie...

1179
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,600
Are you going?

1180
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,600
If you don't go,

1181
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,600
you can just stay here.

1182
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,600
Go.

1183
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,600
Go.

1184
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,600
You're so cruel.

1185
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,600
Be careful.

1186
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,600
Director.

1187
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,600
What's wrong?

1188
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,600
I'll go with you.

1189
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,600
Xiao Jie,

1190
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,600
don't go, okay?

1191
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,600
Director, I'm a cop too.

1192
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,600
You're a girl.

1193
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,600
You can't be in danger.

1194
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,600
Let me hide behind you.

1195
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,600
I...

1196
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,600
I...

1197
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,600
I'll...

1198
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,600
Look, Xia Jie.

1199
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,600
There are many chances

1200
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,600
of catching bad people.

1201
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,600
Right?

1202
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,600
It's your first day at work.

1203
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,600
Don't let your mom worry.

1204
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,600
Go back to rest early.

1205
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,600
Go, go, go.

1206
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,600
Director.

1207
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,600
You scared me.

1208
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,600
You...

1209
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,600
Are you trying to make me

1210
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,600
wear that big head?

1211
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,600
You're too much.

1212
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,600
I'm not.

1213
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,600
You must be kidding me.

1214
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,600
I'm kidding you.

1215
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,600
I can't stand you.

1216
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,600
Okay, okay.

1217
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,600
Don't think too much.

1218
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,600
Hurry up.

1219
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,600
Hurry up.

1220
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,600
I'm a cop.

1221
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,600
Hurry up.

1222
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,600
I'm leaving.

1223
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,600
Take care of the new people.

1224
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,600
I'm done.

1225
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,600
Remember,

1226
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,600
you must protect your

1227
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,600
finger and hand.

1228
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,600
Especially when you're

1229
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,600
catching bad people.

1230
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,600
You must keep your weapons.

1231
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,600
Don't say other weapons.

1232
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,600
Just a small hand

1233
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,600
is lost.

1234
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,600
Although it's not expensive,

1235
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,600
there are always numbers.

1236
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,600
If you lose, it's a burden.

1237
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,600
Do you understand?

1238
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,600
I understand.

1239
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,600
Come.

1240
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,600
Come, let me see.

1241
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,600
Come, you go first.

1242
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,600
Do you need it?

1243
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,600
Do you need it?

1244
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,600
Also,

1245
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,600
the crime scene

1246
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,600
must be followed by orders

1247
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,600
and instructions.

1248
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,600
Be careful when you're in the scene.

1249
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,600
I just want to remind you

1250
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,600
that you must remember

1251
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,600
everything.

1252
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,600
Take care of yourself.

1253
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,600
Remember.

1254
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,600
Yes.

1255
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,600
You must remember

1256
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,600
what you said.

1257
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,600
Safety is the first.

1258
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,600
Remember?

1259
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,600
Yes.

1260
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,600
Yes.

1261
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,600
Go, go.

1262
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,600
Mom,

1263
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,600
what's up?

1264
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,600
I'm on work.

1265
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,600
Xiao Jie,

1266
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,600
did Wang Shou Yi

1267
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,600
take special care of you?

1268
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,600
Mom,

1269
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,600
how many people did you call today?

1270
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,600
What's wrong?

1271
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,600
Did someone say something?

1272
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,600
No one said anything.

1273
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,600
No need to say anything.

1274
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,600
I can see it all.

1275
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,600
Xiao Jie,

1276
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,600
why are you talking to mom?

1277
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,600
Mom,

1278
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,600
can you not call

1279
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,600
Su Li?

1280
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,600
It's the first day of work.

1281
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,600
Everyone thinks

1282
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,600
I'm a burden.

1283
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,600
A burden?

1284
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,600
A burden is not good?

1285
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,600
I just want them

1286
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,600
to take special care of you.

1287
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,600
Mom.

1288
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,600
Okay.

1289
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,600
Xiao Jie,

1290
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,600
come back early today.

1291
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,600
Mom wants to eat seafood.

1292
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,600
Come back

1293
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,600
and bring your new report.

1294
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,600
I'll try my best.

1295
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,600
What do you mean?

1296
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,600
If they dare to let you work overtime,

1297
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,600
I'll call Wang Shou Yi.

1298
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,600
Okay,

1299
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,600
that's it.

1300
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,600
Mom, you...

1301
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,600
I'm sorry.

1302
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,600
I'm sorry.

1303
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,600
I'm sorry.

1304
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,600
I'm sorry.

1305
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:10,600
I'm sorry.

1306
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,600
I'm sorry.
