1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,600
Honey

6
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I didn't do it.

7
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Before you left, I was told to give you a nosebleed.

8
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And I also dropped a pair of hot dogs.

9
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
After you left, I contacted you again.

10
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
For so many years, I never contacted you.

11
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Xiaoliao, when Yue Fei was in the lock,

12
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
did you find out what she meant?

13
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I didn't feel that.

14
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
But this child,

15
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
don't be so serious.

16
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's okay to have a big brother in the lock.

17
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's not far from anyone.

18
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'll count on you.

19
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Su, can you please tell me something?

20
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Did she ever have anything to do with you?

21
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
What's wrong with her?

22
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Did she get cold?

23
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
She got cold.

24
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
She's fine.

25
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Please continue.

26
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
What did she say?

27
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
When she was doing it,

28
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
she was so upset that she couldn't get up.

29
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
She was so upset that she couldn't get up.

30
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
She was upset.

31
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
She was a woman in the city.

32
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
She couldn't get up.

33
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Take care.

34
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Take care.

35
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Thank you.

36
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Yes.

37
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Could it be because of that thing,

38
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
she left the lock and came here?

39
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What's the matter?

40
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
We're neighbors.

41
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
There are many old people.

42
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Some people just put this leather thing on the mountain.

43
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I once went out to sell silver in the mountains.

44
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I thought I'd be able to get it for a few days.

45
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
But it didn't last for a few days.

46
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I went to your house.

47
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I told her that Yue Wei had found her.

48
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I told her that she'd take her silver from the mountain

49
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
and threaten her.

50
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's not a small thing.

51
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I told Yue Wei to keep an eye on her.

52
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
She said that she had a lover and a garden.

53
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
The law doesn't have any evidence.

54
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So she didn't want to get married.

55
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So this thing happened.

56
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I told her that the law is our enemy.

57
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
No matter if you have any evidence,

58
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Yue Wei's law is wrong.

59
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's not important.

60
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's wrong.

61
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So the law gave her a serious punishment.

62
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I was so ashamed.

63
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I didn't want to see her again.

64
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
What's wrong?

65
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Sorry, sir.

66
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It's our boss.

67
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Let me borrow it.

68
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Hello, boss.

69
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm hungry.

70
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Wait, wait.

71
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I can't hear you clearly.

72
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Wait a minute.

73
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What's wrong?

74
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Yue Wei might have gone home.

75
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
The news from the police is spreading.

76
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
They've been monitoring.

77
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Captain Luo called me.

78
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
He said that he had a car accident.

79
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
He went to the northeast.

80
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
He might have gone home.

81
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Okay, I know.

82
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Sheng Hao,

83
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
we're talking with the old chief of the police station.

84
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
If he really comes back,

85
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
we might have to stay here.

86
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Okay.

87
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Chief,

88
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'd like to ask your sister-in-law.

89
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Who is it?

90
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Zhou Hui.

91
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Li Pei.

92
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Chief Wang,

93
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Chief Cheng, what are you doing here?

94
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's almost New Year.

95
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
We're here to see you.

96
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Chief Wang,

97
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm doing well with the kids.

98
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
There's no man at home.

99
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's not convenient.

100
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
So I invited you two to the office.

101
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Look at your words.

102
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
We're not strangers.

103
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Yes.

104
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Let's go in and sit down.

105
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Chief Wang,

106
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
the police are not the police now.

107
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It has nothing to do with you.

108
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
What are you doing here?

109
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Zhou Hui,

110
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I told you.

111
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Although the police are not the police now,

112
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
in our heart,

113
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
they're always our members.

114
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's almost New Year.

115
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Let's come and see you.

116
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Let's see.

117
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I don't need anyone to pity us.

118
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Sister-in-law,

119
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
why do you say that?

120
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Why do we pity you?

121
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Let's just

122
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
come and see you.

123
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Don't you think

124
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
we're not familiar with things?

125
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Let's go in.

126
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Come in.

127
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Come in.

128
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
No, no, no.

129
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Come in.

130
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Come in.

131
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Come in.

132
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Come in.

133
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You're a big brother.

134
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Come in.

135
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Come in.

136
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Come in.

137
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Come in.

138
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
This one.

139
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
This one.

140
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Why can't you say that?

141
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm his uncle.

142
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's New Year.

143
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I just hope that he can

144
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
grow up happily.

145
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Take it.

146
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
This is the child's fortune.

147
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Thank you, uncle.

148
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Thank you, uncle.

149
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
This is for you,

150
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Uncle Cheng.

151
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I wish you a happy New Year.

152
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Happy New Year.

153
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Take it.

154
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Thank you, Uncle Cheng.

155
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Thank you, Uncle Cheng.

156
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You're welcome.

157
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Happy New Year.

158
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Thank you.

159
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
By the way,

160
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
can you

161
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
let me

162
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
watch TV

163
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
in the house?

164
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Don't.

165
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Watch TV in the house.

166
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Come in.

167
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Come in.

168
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
This is the key.

169
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
This is really hard to keep.

170
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You can say it.

171
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Everyone has it.

172
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It's New Year.

173
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Yes.

174
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Thank you.

175
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Thank you.

176
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Tomorrow is New Year's Eve.

177
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
How are you going to celebrate?

178
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Celebrate with the child.

179
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Zhehui,

180
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I know that

181
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
you have something to do

182
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
with the military.

183
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
But it's your family.

184
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You should go back.

185
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
No need.

186
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm doing well

187
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
with the child.

188
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Okay.

189
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'll send the car

190
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
to pick you up tomorrow afternoon.

191
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
That's it.

192
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Some comrades

193
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
are on business in the lock.

194
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
They'll be back

195
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
tomorrow night.

196
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
So,

197
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Zhehui decided

198
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
to take their family

199
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
to the lock

200
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
and wrap their feet

201
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
and celebrate their 30th birthday.

202
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm not going.

203
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'll be back

204
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
when I pick up the child.

205
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Zhehui,

206
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm going to criticize you.

207
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You think

208
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
we can't see you

209
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
when we're all together?

210
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You can't

211
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
make yourself feel bad.

212
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You don't have to.

213
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
But you should think about

214
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
your son.

215
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
For the child,

216
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
you can go to the lock

217
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
tomorrow night.

218
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Okay?

219
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Let's celebrate.

220
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm so tired.

221
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm going to celebrate

222
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
the New Year.

223
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Is this it?

224
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
This is the lock.

225
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
We'll

226
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
gather here

227
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
later.

228
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Okay.

229
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Do you remember

230
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
the car number

231
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
he set up?

232
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Yes.

233
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Look.

234
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
The car is outside.

235
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
He should

236
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
change the car number

237
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
when he comes back.

238
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
If you don't find the car number,

239
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
pay attention

240
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
to his front headlight.

241
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Okay?

242
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Okay.

243
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Don't touch him.

244
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Come back and report.

245
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Okay.

246
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Let's go.

247
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Okay.

248
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Let's go.

249
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Okay.

250
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Let's go.

251
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Master,

252
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
this car is so cheap.

253
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It's only 200 yuan a day.

254
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
But we don't have

255
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
this price.

256
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It's not good to have

257
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
this kind of money.

258
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It's not done yet.

259
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
We'll find a shop

260
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
and buy some things for you.

261
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Have you bought

262
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
other things?

263
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You think we've seen each other?

264
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Yes.

265
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Put it back.

266
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
This one?

267
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It's so delicious.

268
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's so delicious.

269
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Let's keep looking.

270
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
He must be in this shop.

271
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
He can't get away.

272
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
He must be at home

273
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
in the coming year.

274
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
We'll catch him

275
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
at the best time.

276
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
We'll wait for him.

277
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
We'll wait for him.

278
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
The food is here.

279
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Come.

280
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
We have more food.

281
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Here,

282
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
some more.

283
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
The New Year's food

284
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
is outside.

285
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
We'll add

286
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
some vegetables to it.

287
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
We'll cook pork and rice noodles.

288
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Enjoy your New Year's food.

289
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Thank you.

290
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Thank you.

291
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Thank you, boss.

292
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
We haven't had

293
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
any food for 30 days.

294
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You don't know that, right?

295
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
We have a family.

296
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
We have to eat outside

297
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
during the New Year's Eve.

298
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Come and see it tonight.

299
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It's full.

300
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It's a good time

301
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
to book a two-month leave.

302
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
But we have

303
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
some special books.

304
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
We have to

305
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
spend the New Year's

306
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
time outside.

307
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
There's something

308
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
to do in the city.

309
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
We're done.

310
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
We'll leave today.

311
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Thank you, boss.

312
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Enjoy your meal.

313
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Enjoy your meal.

314
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
See?

315
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Boss has given us all the food.

316
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
We'll find him tonight.

317
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Eat up.

318
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Master,

319
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
have some more.

320
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Okay.

321
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Master,

322
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
this is the village.

323
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It's called

324
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Wang Lishu, the west end of the village.

325
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's the third one.

326
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Look,

327
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
it's Yue Fei's hand.

328
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It's my hand.

329
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Don't let him find out.

330
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I've brought it.

331
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'll get it.

332
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I'll hide in the front.

333
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'll keep an eye on him.

334
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Here,

335
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
it's here.

336
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
What?

337
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You said it's New Year's.

338
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Why did you come back?

339
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I don't know.

340
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
But

341
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
it must be a bit weird.

342
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Maybe

343
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
he found out

344
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
that our captain

345
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
was watching us.

346
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
How long has it been since

347
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
you've been in the police?

348
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
More than three months.

349
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Three months?

350
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
That's impossible.

351
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
They all say

352
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
that the more you fight,

353
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
the more you get closer.

354
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
But it's been three months.

355
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Master,

356
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
don't forget.

357
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
If it's true that he was in the police,

358
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
he was the one who was in charge.

359
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
He didn't know

360
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
that he was in charge.

361
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I'm sure

362
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
he was in charge.

363
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I'm sure

364
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
he was in charge.

365
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I'm sure

366
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
he was in charge.

367
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I don't think so.

368
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You mean

369
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
he was in charge

370
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
of the murder?

371
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Is it possible?

372
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Master,

373
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'm sure

374
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
he was in charge.

375
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'll call him.

376
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Okay.

377
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Hello, Captain Li.

378
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Hello, Captain Li.

379
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Hello, New Year.

380
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I have a question.

381
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Is there

382
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
a serious case

383
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
in your life?

384
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
A serious case?

385
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Yes.

386
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It's mainly

387
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
the disappearance

388
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
of Feng Chen's daughter

389
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
or the death of her son.

390
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
The murder of Liang Qi

391
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
was a big hit.

392
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
She was caught.

393
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Okay, I got it.

394
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Thank you.

395
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I'm sorry.

396
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm sorry.

397
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I'm sorry.

398
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm sorry.

399
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
How is it?

400
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Is there any problem?

401
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
No.

402
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Liang Qi was caught.

403
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
He wanted to kill someone.

404
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And

405
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
the case was solved.

406
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
The case was

407
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
solved.

408
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Why did he come back?

409
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
He was staring at me.

410
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Master,

411
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
we can't be together.

412
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
We're always afraid of each other.

413
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
We're afraid of each other

414
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
and we can't die.

415
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
We can come here at night.

416
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
You

417
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
get in the car

418
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
and get in the car.

419
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Okay.

420
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
The car will be burned.

421
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
What should we do?

422
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
We should be smart.

423
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Don't worry.

424
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I can't think of anything.

425
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
When we're having dinner,

426
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I'll go out with them.

427
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I saw a bridge next door.

428
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Don't worry.

429
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
We'll have a car.

430
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
It's full.

431
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Okay, Xiao.

432
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'll take care of it.

433
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Okay.

434
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I'll be here.

435
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Have fun.

436
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
We'll go to the station.

437
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Okay.

438
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
The train is leaving.

439
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
We'll go to the station.

440
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Okay.

441
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
The train is leaving.

442
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Let's go.

443
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Be careful.

444
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
It's so cold.

445
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
It's so cold.

446
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
It's better to be careful.

447
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
It's slippery.

448
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Let's go.

449
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Let's go.

450
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Are you okay?

451
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I'm fine.

452
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I'm good at taking care of the kids.

453
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Come on.

454
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Thank you.

455
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
You're welcome.

456
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Take care.

457
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I'm going to take care of you.

458
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Brother.

459
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Brother.

460
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Master.

461
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Are you okay?

462
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Let's go out.

463
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Let's go.

464
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Master.

465
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
The person has an impression.

466
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
It must be him.

467
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
The leaves on the window

468
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
and the glass are all on him.

469
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Prepare to leave.

470
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Then hurry up and take care of him.

471
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Come back.

472
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It's a pity to be in the military service

473
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
and come back.

474
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Mr. Zhang.

475
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
You should keep an eye on the road.

476
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I don't think he will leave here.

477
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
It's impossible.

478
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
He's here to go out.

479
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Master.

480
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Today is not the day.

481
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
He's not going out.

482
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
What if?

483
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
What if he's not here?

484
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
He's here to go out.

485
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
We will take other measures.

486
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Brother.

487
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Why don't we go to the data office

488
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
and investigate the household?

489
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
What are you thinking?

490
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Director Liu said

491
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
he wouldn't agree to be caught today.

492
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
We should go to him again.

493
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
He said he wouldn't agree.

494
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
What should we do?

495
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
We didn't make a deal.

496
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
We made a deal.

497
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
We'll wait for the clear evidence

498
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
and then tell them to take care of him.

499
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Okay.

500
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Okay.

501
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Take care of him.

502
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Director.

503
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I'm telling you.

504
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
We found the target.

505
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
But now there's a new situation.

506
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
We have to arrest the comrades in the north.

507
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Why don't you take care of them?

508
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Okay.

509
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Okay.

510
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I understand.

511
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Master.

512
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I'm done.

513
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
You go.

514
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Brother.

515
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Wait for me.

516
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I'm too young to catch fire.

517
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I'm so nervous.

518
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Okay.

519
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
How is it?

520
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Anything?

521
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Nothing.

522
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
The car is still there.

523
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
We have to eat sticky rice

524
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
in the house.

525
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
What should we do?

526
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
It's impossible.

527
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
We haven't been back for so many years.

528
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
We'll be back in a year or two.

529
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
It's not easy.

530
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
What's wrong?

531
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
It's okay.

532
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Li, what's the matter?

533
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Uncle Chen.

534
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Hello, Uncle Chen.

535
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I'm fine.

536
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I called you to send you a message.

537
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Hello, Uncle Chen.

538
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
What's the matter?

539
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Uncle,

540
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
my dad called me to eat rice at home this year.

541
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
My family is making dumplings.

542
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Uncle, have you eaten dumplings?

543
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Yes, I have.

544
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I'm eating them.

545
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Li,

546
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
that's right.

547
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
No matter what happens,

548
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
we'll be together forever.

549
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
We'll be together forever.

550
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Remember,

551
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
work hard with your parents.

552
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Work hard.

553
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Live well.

554
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Okay.

555
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I got it.

556
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Thank you.

557
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
You're more than welcome.

558
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Okay.

559
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Uncle Chen.

560
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
My mom called me to help.

561
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Bye.

562
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Help me.

563
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Get up.

564
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Good morning.

565
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I'm fine.

566
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Li,

567
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
you finally found yourself a good man.

568
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I'm fine.

569
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
When I first saw Lu Jiao Li,

570
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I thought she was a good girl.

571
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
How could you choose to trust her?

572
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
After you've had a baby,

573
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
you've become famous.

574
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Our family

575
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
has been watching me for a while.

576
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
They're like enemies.

577
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I was so confused.

578
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I said,

579
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
why?

580
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
You said,

581
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
you hate me,

582
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
you're a bad guy.

583
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I can understand.

584
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
But you said she was a bad guy.

585
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I don't believe anything you say.

586
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I thought

587
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Li Jiao Li

588
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
would be my family.

589
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Uncle Chen,

590
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
someone's coming out.

591
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Is it Yuan Li?

592
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Yes, yes.

593
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
It's here.

594
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Let's go back.

595
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Wait a minute.

596
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Keep an eye on him.

597
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Master.

598
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Keep an eye on him.

599
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Keep an eye on him.

600
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Coming.

601
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Coming.

602
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Are you okay?

603
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I'm okay.

604
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Drive.

605
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Don't be so close.

606
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
They'll find out.

607
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Uncle.

608
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
It's getting dark.

609
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Where are you going?

610
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I'm going to the station.

611
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Okay.

612
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Hello, sir.

613
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Hello, sir.

614
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Hello, sir.

615
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Hello, sir.

616
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Hello, sir.

617
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Hello, sir.

618
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Hello, sir.

619
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Hello, sir.

620
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Hello, sir.

621
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Hello, sir.

622
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Hello, sir.

623
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Hello, sir.

624
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Hello, sir.

625
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Hello, sir.

626
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Hello, sir.

627
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Hello, sir.

628
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Hello, sir.

629
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Hello, sir.

630
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Hello, sir.

631
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Hello, sir.

632
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Hello, sir.

633
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Hello, sir.

634
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Hello, sir.

635
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Look at this big New Year.

636
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
We're going to have a business trip.

637
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
We don't know if you're going to be together.

638
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
We need to understand.

639
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Zhijie always told us

640
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
that we need to work hard.

641
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
We're happy

642
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
to have a reunion dinner

643
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
with everyone.

644
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Okay, okay.

645
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Okay, okay.

646
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I'm going to go.

647
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Okay, okay.

648
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Get up.

649
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Look!

650
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
My baby girl!

651
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Come on, get up!

652
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Look.

653
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
She's calling me.

654
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Someone's coming.

655
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
You're a good new year.

656
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Let's go.

657
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Hello, sir.

658
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Hello, sir.

659
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Come in.

660
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Let's go in first.

661
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Let's go.

662
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Let's go in.

663
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
This way.

664
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
We're here, sister.

665
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Get down.

666
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Why are they together?

667
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Sir, you are the official.

668
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
They are not only good friends,

669
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
but also Xia Jie's mother and Liang Hai.

670
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
After the college year,

671
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
we have to help them to do something.

672
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Don't be a fool in the big year.

673
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
You can't fool me.

674
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Really.

675
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Hello, sir.

676
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Hello, sir.

677
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Hello, sir.

678
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
You can't go to the big year.

679
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
You can go there alone.

680
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Really?

681
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Yes.

682
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
You are kidding me.

683
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
No problem.

684
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
We can go there together.

685
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
We are good friends.

686
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Xia Jie is with us.

687
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
That's great.

688
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I'll go and say hello.

689
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Okay.

690
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Hello, sir.

691
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Look.

692
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
We have to trouble you in the big year.

693
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
We have already told you.

694
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
You are a worker.

695
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I'm afraid that you won't be able to do anything.

696
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Sir,

697
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
you have to understand our mood.

698
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
The day-to-day action is over.

699
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
We can't solve the case.

700
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
We can't solve it.

701
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
So,

702
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
you need your great support.

703
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I represent the Barrier and the police.

704
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I'm here to help you.

705
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Liu Jiang,

706
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
you have to come to Pingling.

707
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I'll treat you to dinner.

708
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Okay.

709
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I'll treat you to dinner.

710
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Okay.

711
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Mr. Huang.

712
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Here you are.

713
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Thank you.

714
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Call the doctor.

715
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Happy New Year.

716
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Happy New Year.

717
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Let's go inside.

718
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Come on.

719
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Let's go.

720
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Let's go.

721
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
How is it?

722
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I just drove around.

723
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
There is a door in the courtyard.

724
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
There is a window in the back.

725
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
The people inside can see it.

726
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
They should be preparing for the New Year's dinner.

727
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
They can stay at home.

728
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Zhang.

729
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Where is the food?

730
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
This is the food for the two of us.

731
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
We also brought them some food.

732
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Thank you.

733
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Thank you.

734
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
We didn't expect you to be here.

735
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
It's okay.

736
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
We are all here to do this.

737
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
But, Mr. Zhang,

738
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
we can't ruin the atmosphere of the New Year.

739
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
We can.

740
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Are you sure?

741
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Yes.

742
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
He is a good guy.

743
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
He is a good guy.

744
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
He has two children.

745
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
He is a good guy.

746
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
We are leaving today.

747
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
When can we come back?

748
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Yes.

749
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
He can go anywhere.

750
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
He can't go on the road.

751
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
It's almost New Year's dinner.

752
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
We can have New Year's dinner.

753
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Okay.

754
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Let's find a place to eat New Year's dinner.

755
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Okay.

756
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Today is the opening of the restaurant.

757
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Let's go.

758
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Let's find a place to have a activity.

759
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Okay.

760
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Let's go.

761
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
It's so delicious.

762
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
It's so delicious.

763
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Let's go.

764
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Let's go.

765
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Let's go.

766
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Happy New Year.

767
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Happy New Year.

768
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Happy New Year.

769
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Happy New Year.

770
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Happy New Year.

771
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Happy New Year.

772
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I have two words.

773
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
The New Year is coming.

774
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
The New Year you are looking forward to.

775
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
It's coming.

776
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
It's coming.

777
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
It's coming.

778
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
In the past year,

779
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
we have achieved all the achievements

780
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
that Barley and Pansor have achieved.

781
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
We have achieved all the achievements

782
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
that Barley and Pansor have achieved.

783
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Can you believe it?

784
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I hope that in the new year,

785
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
we, the work of Barley and Pansor,

786
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
we still need your support.

787
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Please, please.

788
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Come on.

789
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I have

790
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
a cup of tea.

791
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
For the hard work

792
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
that we did last year,

793
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
for the new year,

794
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
we have achieved even greater achievements.

795
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Let's have a toast.

796
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Cheers.

797
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Where is the car?

798
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I think it's inside.

799
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
It's coming.

800
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
It's coming.

801
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Don't listen to me.

802
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Stop.

803
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Is it a car?

804
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Yes.

805
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I think it's a toy.

806
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
It's in the car.

807
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Wait.

808
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Wait here.

809
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I'll go down and have a look.

810
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I'll go with you.

811
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
The road is too big.

812
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I'll go to the car later.

813
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Drive the car forward.

814
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Wait for me.

815
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Turn off the lights.

816
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I'll go with you.

817
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I'll go with you.

818
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
You're talking nonsense.

819
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I'll go with you.

820
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Stop.

821
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Stop.

822
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Come over here.

823
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Stop.

824
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Stop.

825
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Stop.

826
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Stop.

827
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Stop.

828
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Don't let the old man and the child go.

829
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Be careful.

830
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Don't let them go.

831
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Don't let them go.

832
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
The old man and the child are going to the side.

833
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
You're in the mood to order them.

834
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Master.

835
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Wait for me.

836
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Wait for them to put the child on the side.

837
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
The old man and the child will rest later.

838
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Don't let them go.

839
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Stay here.

840
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Don't let them go.

841
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
What are you looking at?

842
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I miss my father and my mother.

843
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Take care.

844
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Take care.

845
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Take care.

846
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
The festival is about to start.

847
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Go back and see them.

848
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
They'll be back tomorrow.

849
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
They'll be back soon.

850
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
OK.

851
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
You've worked hard.

852
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
See you.

853
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Bye.

854
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Bye.

855
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Bye.

856
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Bye.

857
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Take care.

858
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Bye.

859
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Take care.

860
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Where are you going?

861
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Go back.

862
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I'll stay.

863
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
We have a big business.

864
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Go back.

865
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Go back.

866
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Thank you.

867
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Go back.

868
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Thank you.

869
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Let's go.

870
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Let's go.

871
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
You brought the child home.

872
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
It's late.

873
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Let's go home.

874
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
It's late.

875
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
You need to clean the car.

876
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
You need to clean the car.

877
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
OK.

878
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Go to sleep.

879
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Don't move.

880
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Don't move.

881
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Let me go.

882
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Come here.

883
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Come here.

884
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Let me go.

885
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I'm from the police.

886
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I'll tell you what.

887
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
I've waited for hours to get the child and the patient.

888
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I'll wait for them.

889
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
If you don't mind

890
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I'll take care of them.

891
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Do you hear me?

892
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Don't move.

893
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,640
Go.

894
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,520
Zhang Xiaoqian, listen to me.

895
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,360
You must apologize to the people.

896
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,400
Now, I'll tell you the truth.

897
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,360
Take him away.

898
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,160
Wait for me.

899
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:33,760
Wait for me.

900
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,280
Go.

901
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,640
I want to say hello to my family.

902
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:39,800
Say hello.

903
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:40,960
Say hello.

904
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,480
Zhang Xiaoqian,

905
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,320
you've thought it through.

906
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,400
Your family has been taken away by us.

907
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,840
We've been thinking about your father and son

908
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,960
until now.

909
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:51,880
Do you hear me?

910
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,520
Brother,

911
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:53,960
I've been thinking about it.

912
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,200
I know

913
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,160
that I'll leave like this.

914
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,880
I don't know when I'll come back.

915
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,960
If they can't find me, I'll be in a hurry.

916
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,240
I beg you.

917
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,320
Please let me take care of him.

918
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:05,720
I beg you.

919
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:06,720
I beg you.

920
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:09,880
Xiao Bai,

921
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,360
take care of him.

922
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,240
Remember what I said to you.

923
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,400
Don't forget.

924
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,200
Take the key.

925
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,000
Get in.
