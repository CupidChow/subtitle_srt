1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,760
I

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,200
and the exciting start of the show.

6
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,440
Gao Cao, I think we should follow this plan.

7
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,440
Yes.

8
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,600
You've been working on this plan for so long.

9
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,680
If you think there's still a place that's not enough,

10
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,760
you can change it yourself.

11
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,360
Okay?

12
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,040
I'll go and do it.

13
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,680
Okay.

14
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,680
Gao Cao.

15
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:21,960
Chief.

16
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:22,880
Chief.

17
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,360
I've made it clear.

18
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,360
It's almost the same as you recommended.

19
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,280
This woman is not doing well.

20
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,080
So we'll take her to the police station.

21
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,080
Her husband is in a foreign country.

22
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,720
They're getting divorced.

23
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,800
She's not going home.

24
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,960
She can't take care of her husband.

25
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,240
She's just a kid.

26
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,440
So she's crazy about him.

27
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,240
And she's not good at being in the neighborhood.

28
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,760
She's been changing since she left.

29
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,800
That's why she's so mad at her child.

30
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,360
Let's find her a partner.

31
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,640
But don't say that.

32
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,720
She's a bit of a pain.

33
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,040
I got it.

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,160
Let's use this day to convince her.

35
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,160
Girls are so stubborn.

36
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,200
Let her be a pain.

37
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,360
Chief, I'll try to talk to her.

38
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,360
What? Try?

39
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,520
Of course.

40
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:22,840
Okay.

41
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,160
Your mom will kick you out of your house.

42
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:28,960
Take your time.

43
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,280
You haven't changed.

44
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,880
Shut up.

45
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,600
Is Xia Jie still not apologizing?

46
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,280
I heard she won't apologize.

47
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,880
She's against it.

48
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,040
She isn't cool.

49
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,240
It's a killurble thing.

50
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,440
We'll have to solve the problem, Professor Sus.

51
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,680
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,000
But it seems that Xia Jie's debt

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,240
is not going to work.

54
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,880
I'm telling you.

55
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,760
When Xia Jie comes,

56
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,160
we'll all be in the same boat.

57
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,160
What do you mean?

58
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,480
We'll decide on our own

59
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,520
if we don't apologize.

60
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,520
The more we persuade her,

61
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,680
the more she'll be stressed.

62
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,720
Xia Jie.

63
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,400
Xia Jie.

64
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,040
You can choose the matter of apology.

65
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,640
If you can't hold on,

66
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,480
I can take you

67
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,560
and Professor Su Li.

68
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,600
Thank you, Uncle Yang.

69
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,680
I have my own principle.

70
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,680
I need to find you.

71
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:32,840
President.

72
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,400
President.

73
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,480
Why didn't you eat?

74
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,640
I'm going to eat.

75
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,960
I didn't eat. Let's eat together.

76
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,560
This is so good.

77
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,040
Let's eat.

78
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,480
Xia Jie.

79
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,520
Come on. Sit here.

80
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,440
I sympathize with her.

81
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,680
You mean

82
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,000
I should give her some money?

83
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,800
What are you talking about?

84
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,360
If that's not what you mean,

85
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,400
why should I sacrifice

86
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,600
my dignity to sympathize with her?

87
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,560
Let's eat.

88
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,640
Eat slowly.

89
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,880
Think slowly.

90
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:42,960
President.

91
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,720
Sorry to bother you again.

92
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,480
I went to the district

93
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,080
to know about Miss Wu's situation.

94
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,920
I didn't know which corner to follow.

95
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,000
So I told her.

96
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,560
She thinks our police is going to kill her.

97
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,520
You know what's going on?

98
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,800
She's here again.

99
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,920
She's in the police station.

100
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,560
She's here.

101
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,600
I can't see her.

102
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,320
I have to see her.

103
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,160
Do you think she's human?

104
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,600
Yes.

105
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,360
Let me tell you.

106
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,520
There's a kind of person in this world.

107
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,160
No matter what others do,

108
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,720
she always thinks about bad things.

109
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,560
Let's go.

110
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,080
Am I illegal?

111
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,720
Am I guilty?

112
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,400
Why are you doing this to me?

113
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,560
Why are you gathering my black material?

114
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,480
Why?

115
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:33,840
Let me explain.

116
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,480
President.

117
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,160
Xiao Wang, what are you doing here?

118
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,800
Is this your workplace?

119
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:39,920
Go back.

120
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,280
Go back.

121
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,840
Don't be so pessimistic.

122
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,960
Don't be so pessimistic.

123
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,400
Let's go.

124
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:44,920
Go back.

125
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,800
Hello.

126
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,160
Dr. Wu.

127
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,160
This is our president.

128
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,600
What's the matter with the president?

129
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm the same as the president.

130
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,520
I can't do this to me.

131
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,880
Am I guilty?

132
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,920
Am I illegal?

133
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,840
Comrade.

134
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,920
You see, you're not illegal.

135
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,800
You're not guilty either.

136
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,400
You're here making a big fuss.

137
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,000
You've disturbed our normal office.

138
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:11,960
Well,

139
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,080
let's talk somewhere else.

140
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:14,520
Okay?

141
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,080
Why?

142
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,160
You dare to do this to me.

143
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,640
You dare not let me say it here.

144
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,040
You're afraid that the people will see your true face.

145
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:22,960
I won't.

146
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,600
Let's talk somewhere else.

147
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,080
If something happens,

148
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,040
the patient will be in your office

149
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,480
and you'll be in trouble.

150
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,800
Is that right?

151
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,200
Dr. Wu.

152
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,520
That's not right.

153
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,600
Where are you going?

154
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,320
Let me emphasize again.

155
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,760
I'm not investigating you.

156
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,280
I'm not looking for your black material.

157
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,080
You're a member of our police.

158
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,440
We must know you well.

159
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,080
The member of your police

160
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,320
is in the police station, right?

161
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,080
Why did you run into my neighborhood?

162
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,920
I'm not guilty.

163
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,200
I'm not illegal.

164
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,120
I stole money from three people.

165
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,720
Am I a good citizen of the Fenggong?

166
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,280
yelled my name.

167
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,960
I was afraid that

168
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,960
the rich

169
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,200
people in the neighborhood

170
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,800
would think that I was just talking.

171
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,560
That's great.

172
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,040
As you know that pretend you want to

173
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,400
get rid of me,

174
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,200
you never think of

175
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,800
Networkogy 치지ank.

176
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,800
We just want to solve the little problem between us as soon as possible.

177
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,800
So we have to think of a way.

178
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,800
We definitely don't want to ask you for privacy.

179
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,800
If this thing makes you feel bad, I apologize to you.

180
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,800
Also, give me the list of the three video actors.

181
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,800
I'll face them.

182
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,800
How do I know who it is?

183
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,800
Anyway, it's already in my ear.

184
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,800
This can show how evil your production is.

185
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,800
You have to give me the effect.

186
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,800
You have to do it.

187
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,800
Ms. Wu,

188
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,800
we don't have the information that the three of us are not good for you,

189
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,800
nor do we have the rumor that we have created this.

190
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,800
If we understand the situation and make you uncomfortable,

191
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,800
then I apologize to you too.

192
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,800
It's useless to apologize here.

193
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,800
My request,

194
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,800
you set up the crew,

195
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,800
and send the representative to my district.

196
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,800
You have to apologize to me in front of the crowd.

197
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,800
Ms. Wu,

198
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,800
you are a bit too strong.

199
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,800
You are not, are you?

200
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,800
Dr. Wu.

201
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,800
Dr. Wu,

202
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,800
Dr. Wu,

203
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,800
sit down and have a seat.

204
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,800
Don't come.

205
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,800
Don't come forever.

206
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,800
How can he do it?

207
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,800
How can he do it?

208
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,800
He can do it in a few minutes.

209
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,800
How did his husband come here?

210
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,800
You are Tong Qing's husband.

211
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,800
You are Tong Qing's Tong Qing, right?

212
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,800
Tong Qing is a soldier.

213
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,800
He should be a general and a professional.

214
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,800
Come, sit down.

215
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,800
Sit down.

216
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,800
How about this?

217
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,800
You should leave this to me.

218
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,800
You don't have to face it.

219
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,800
Maybe Ms. Wu will say that I am not good enough.

220
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,800
But I can always think of a way to convince her.

221
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,800
The reason for the problem is because Xia Jie is pregnant.

222
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,800
She didn't want to apologize.

223
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,800
It's also my master's fault.

224
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,800
And it's also because I didn't deal with it,

225
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,800
that I let this matter expand.

226
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,800
I can't be left behind by you.

227
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,800
What are you talking about?

228
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,800
I am just a part of the whole family.

229
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,800
Where is Xia Jie?

230
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,800
She should work.

231
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,800
She should criticize.

232
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,800
She really loves Y2.

233
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,800
Although it's not intentional,

234
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,800
Y2 is also Y2 in the book.

235
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,800
She is pregnant.

236
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,800
She is pregnant.

237
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,800
You advised me to be her master.

238
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,800
I just... I don't want to be her master.

239
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,800
What logic are you talking about?

240
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,800
What logic?

241
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,800
These are two things.

242
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,800
The work should be done.

243
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,800
And the new season should be ended.

244
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,800
Okay?

245
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,800
This has nothing to do with this letter.

246
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,800
I'm sorry.

247
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,800
I have to answer the phone.

248
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,800
I have to...

249
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,800
I have to go out and answer the phone.

250
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,800
Just call me later.

251
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,800
I have something to do.

252
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,800
Thank you.

253
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,800
What's wrong?

254
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,800
I have something to do.

255
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,800
I can't be with you.

256
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,800
Song Jue.

257
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,800
Master.

258
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,800
You can't do anything because of your own fault.

259
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,800
Dr. Wu.

260
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,800
He has been playing the piano for a long time.

261
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,800
He is still not happy.

262
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,800
The police have called me today.

263
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,800
They called me.

264
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,800
How can I answer?

265
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,800
You are the chief.

266
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,800
You are a high level.

267
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,800
Do you know how to answer?

268
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,800
So I have answered.

269
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,800
I said you can solve the problem tomorrow.

270
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,800
Chief Wang.

271
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,800
Tomorrow is the last deadline for solving the problem.

272
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,800
Dr. Wu.

273
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,800
So you insist on asking us to send you the money

274
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,800
and the paper to the community to pay you, right?

275
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,800
Of course.

276
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,800
Otherwise we don't need them.

277
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,800
Okay.

278
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,800
You are right.

279
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,800
We are here to make you misunderstand.

280
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,800
I am the chief.

281
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,800
I have a responsibility.

282
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,800
I will bring someone to apologize to you.

283
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,800
I am sorry.

284
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,800
I am sorry.

285
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,800
I am sorry.

286
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,800
I am sorry.

287
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,800
I am sorry.

288
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,800
I am sorry.

289
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,800
I am sorry.

290
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,800
Chief Wang.

291
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,800
Dr. Wu.

292
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,800
You heard what Dr. Wu said.

293
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,800
We will do as he says.

294
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,800
How many people in our community know about this?

295
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,800
That is too much.

296
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,800
Those people have long tongue.

297
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,800
They don't know how many people they know.

298
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,800
No matter how many people there are,

299
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,800
they will find him.

300
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,800
How big the range is,

301
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,800
we will take this money.

302
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,800
We will expand the range.

303
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,800
We will eliminate the influence within this specific range.

304
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,800
Okay.

305
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,800
What is going on with him?

306
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,800
Dr. Wu and his two mouth.

307
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,800
He is so close to divorce.

308
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,800
Does it have anything to do with him?

309
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,800
It is too much to talk about.

310
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,800
Okay.

311
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,800
I will go and investigate.

312
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,800
No matter where the report is,

313
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,800
we will eliminate the influence.

314
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,800
If the owners know about this,

315
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,800
we will have a meeting with the owners.

316
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,800
No.

317
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,800
Come to our house.

318
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,800
Come to our house to apologize.

319
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,800
Why did you change your mind?

320
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,800
Why is he so naughty?

321
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,800
Miss.

322
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,800
Xia.

323
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,800
Are you okay?

324
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,800
I am also fine because I saw your hair.

325
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,800
Let's take a look.

326
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,800
The owner of the house is protected.

327
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,800
The owner of the house is protected.

328
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,800
Of course.

329
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,800
You must be very protective.

330
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,800
If we make a mistake,

331
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,800
someone will apologize to us.

332
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,800
Okay.

333
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,800
Let's go to the office.

334
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,800
Did you hear that?

335
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,800
You must not apologize.

336
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,800
Let Xiaodong listen to you.

337
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,800
Okay.

338
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,800
Xiaodong,

339
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,800
you must pretend later.

340
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,800
How?

341
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,800
Xiaodong,

342
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,800
I will give you an idea.

343
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,800
I will tell you.

344
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,800
I will give you an idea.

345
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,800
When you go in,

346
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,800
you will see me behind you.

347
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,800
When we make an apology,

348
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,800
you will cry with your eyes closed.

349
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,800
You will cry with your eyes closed.

350
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,800
Of course, you must cry with your eyes closed.

351
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,800
When I make an apology,

352
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,800
you will cry with your eyes closed.

353
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,800
Then you will say three words.

354
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,800
I am sorry.

355
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,800
You must be sorry.

356
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,800
You must cry with your eyes closed.

357
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,800
Well,

358
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,800
if you don't have eyes closed,

359
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,800
you will have to prepare for someone else.

360
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,800
Sir.

361
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,800
Come in.

362
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,800
I will go.

363
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,800
Let's make a psychological test first.

364
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,800
Don't be stressed.

365
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,800
We just go to

366
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,800
a guy who is not very sympathetic

367
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,800
and is very hard to deal with.

368
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,800
Then,

369
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,800
let's have a good time.

370
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,800
The 99s in front of us are defeated.

371
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,800
The last half must be defeated.

372
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,800
Okay?

373
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,800
Especially after entering the room,

374
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,800
pay attention to the mood.

375
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,800
Whatever he says,

376
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,800
we will fight.

377
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,800
Yes.

378
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,800
Don't worry.

379
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,800
Okay?

380
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,800
Let's fight for more than an hour.

381
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,800
Sir.

382
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,800
At least 45 minutes.

383
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,800
Is it over?

384
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,800
Okay.

385
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,800
It's too late.

386
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,800
It's just a delay.

387
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,800
Brother.

388
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,800
I will stop here.

389
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,800
We can catch them up.

390
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,800
Let's go.

391
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,800
We'll take them out starting next week.

392
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,800
I'll send them off as soon as I can.

393
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,800
Here you go.

394
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,660
reverse

395
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,480
I didn't city that you bring flowers

396
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,580
me do it

397
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,540
wu nishi

398
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:10,540
We, the Parisian Party, are here to apologize to you.

399
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,540
Can we go in?

400
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,540
Here, here, here.

401
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,540
Dr. Wu.

402
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,540
Dr. Wu.

403
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,540
You are a little heartless.

404
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,540
It represents our apology.

405
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,540
Dr. Wu.

406
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,540
Because we are not good enough in our work,

407
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,540
we have caused you harm.

408
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,540
We three representatives of the Parisian Party

409
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,540
are all in the field.

410
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,540
And these police officers are here to apologize.

411
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,540
We are here to apologize to you.

412
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,540
Please forgive us.

413
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,540
Here.

414
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:13,540
What's going on?

415
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,540
Is it not this?

416
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:43,540
Please sit down.

417
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,540
Dr. Wu.

418
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:03,540
I didn't expect that because of our work,

419
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,540
you are so sad.

420
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:20,540
You must think I am a liar.

421
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,540
No.

422
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,540
Actually, I live a hard life.

423
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:33,540
I am a doctor.

424
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,540
I know everything about it.

425
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,540
I am very tired.

426
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,540
But I don't care.

427
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,540
For this family, for my daughter,

428
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,540
I will do anything for her.

429
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,540
My husband is not very good.

430
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,540
He thinks I am too much.

431
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,540
I will take care of him.

432
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,540
I will take care of my daughter.

433
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,540
As long as we are together,

434
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,540
I will be satisfied.

435
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:02,540
I will feel worthy of everything I do.

436
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,540
I am busy every day.

437
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,540
He is a good girl.

438
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,540
I caught him.

439
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,540
He told me in a logical way.

440
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,540
It's my fault.

441
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,540
I was wrong.

442
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,540
Because I don't have a home.

443
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,540
I didn't do anything.

444
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,540
I am my daughter.

445
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,540
I even think I am living for her.

446
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:50,540
Every time she finds me,

447
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:54,540
I feel it's okay to call her first.

448
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,540
I can't answer her phone.

449
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:01,540
I am thinking about where she is.

450
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,540
She is so small.

451
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,540
What should I do if I meet a bad person?

452
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,540
If I don't have her,

453
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,540
I will live my life.

454
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,540
Miss Wu.

455
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,540
Miss Wu.

456
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,540
Look at this kid.

457
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,540
He is not a suspect.

458
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,540
He is a...

459
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,540
He is a coward.

460
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,540
His father is a cop too.

461
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,540
He has been a cop for ten years.

462
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,540
He is a cop.

463
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,540
He is a cop.

464
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,540
He is a cop.

465
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,540
He is a cop.

466
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,540
He is a cop.

467
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,540
He is a cop.

468
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,540
In the past,

469
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,540
he was arrested for murder.

470
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,540
He was a cop when he was protecting the war.

471
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,540
He is like his mother.

472
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,540
His mother said that

473
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,540
he was like your daughter.

474
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,540
He is a cop.

475
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,540
Of course,

476
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,540
when he was in the first report,

477
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,540
he was so much more

478
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,540
involved in the way he talked.

479
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,540
He is like you.

480
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,540
I am sorry.

481
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,540
I will apologize to you

482
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,540
for him.

483
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,540
I hope you can forgive him.

484
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,540
He is still a child.

485
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,540
I am sorry.

486
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,540
Mom,

487
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,540
you are not going to be home soon.

488
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,540
I will book a ticket for you.

489
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,540
I just discussed this with your aunt.

490
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,540
Your aunt said

491
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,540
she would take me home.

492
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,540
She can buy the ticket.

493
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,540
You don't need to.

494
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,540
If you don't want to come back alone,

495
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,540
I will ask for a leave.

496
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,540
Your aunt said she would take you home.

497
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,540
She bought the ticket.

498
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,540
Okay.

499
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,540
Your aunt is not an outsider.

500
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,540
Don't worry about it.

501
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,540
Okay.

502
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,540
When will you tell me

503
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,540
that I will go to pick you up?

504
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,540
Mom, I will not say it.

505
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,540
I will come over first.

506
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,540
Mom,

507
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,540
do you still remember me?

508
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,540
Why are you still not going home?

509
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,540
Go back.

510
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,540
I will worry about you.

511
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,540
Can you wait a little longer?

512
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,540
Can you still see your father?

513
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,540
Don't call me father.

514
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,540
I heard your mother say it.

515
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,540
I am sorry.

516
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,540
I asked too much.

517
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,540
I am sorry.

518
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,540
I am sorry.

519
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:03,540
I am sorry.

520
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,540
I am sorry.

521
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,540
I am sorry.

522
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,540
I am sorry.

523
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,540
I asked too much.

524
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,540
I know my father did something wrong.

525
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,540
He is sorry to my mother.

526
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,540
My father said the same thing.

527
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:22,540
But I am still willing to be with my father.

528
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:26,540
I am happy to be with my father.

529
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,540
But I feel sorry to my mother.

530
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,540
Sister,

531
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,540
I know your name is Jingjing.

532
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,540
Right?

533
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,540
My name is Yuan Ya Jin.

534
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,540
My name is Jingjing.

535
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,540
Do you have WeChat?

536
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,540
Can we call another one?

537
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,540
Yes.

538
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,540
I will scan your name.

539
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,540
Here.

540
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,540
Okay.

541
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,540
I am the police officer of Paris and the police department.

542
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:05,540
I will call the police.

543
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,540
I am not sleepy.

544
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,540
Jingjing,

545
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,540
your mother is also very difficult.

546
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,540
You need to understand her.

547
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,540
Do you understand?

548
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:22,540
We have WeChat now.

549
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,540
If you need help,

550
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,540
or want to ask,

551
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,540
you can send me WeChat anytime.

552
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,540
Okay?

553
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,540
Hurry.

554
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,540
Come.

555
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,540
You are a poor man.

556
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,540
Isn't she the daughter of the 5th Miss?

557
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,540
Little friend,

558
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,540
why don't you go home?

559
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,540
I will wait for you at home.

560
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,540
You will be anxious.

561
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,540
Go home quickly, okay?

562
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,540
Goodbye, grandpa.

563
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,540
Uncle Qi, bye.

564
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,540
Xia Jie,

565
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,540
what did you say to her just now?

566
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,540
Just a few words.

567
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,540
Xia Jie,

568
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,540
this 5th Miss,

569
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,540
is very sensitive to girls.

570
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,540
In the future,

571
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,540
you can avoid

572
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,540
their family matters.

573
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,540
Okay, go home.

574
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,540
Xia Jie,

575
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,540
what you said last time,

576
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,540
I am really sorry.

577
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,540
Master,

578
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,540
I was too bad last time.

579
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,540
I apologize to you.

580
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,540
No, no, no.

581
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,540
Xia Jie,

582
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,540
I am not sure

583
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,540
about my own feelings.

584
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,540
I am sorry.

585
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,540
Maybe because...

586
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,540
Master,

587
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,540
my dad's business

588
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,540
has been going on for 10 years.

589
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,540
It's time to make a living.

590
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:01,540
You are my master now.

591
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,540
You just treat me

592
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,540
as a normal disciple.

593
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,540
You can scold me

594
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,540
or you can just tell me the truth.

595
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,540
Don't be so stubborn.

596
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,540
Okay?

597
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,540
I heard

598
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,540
that all three of them

599
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,540
have gone to the hotel.

600
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,540
And Xia Jie,

601
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,540
did she apologize to you?

602
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,540
No, she didn't.

603
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,540
What's wrong?

604
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,540
She even apologized to the leader.

605
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,540
Really?

606
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,540
Master.

607
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:38,540
Hong Chao Yu?

608
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,540
Master Cheng.

609
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,540
Please help me

610
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:42,540
beat up Hong Chao Yu.

611
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,540
I am afraid

612
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,540
that the people who are helping me

613
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,540
will rob me.

614
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,540
Okay, two days.

615
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,540
Xia Jie, you go first.

616
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,540
No, master.

617
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,540
You go first.

618
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,540
Okay, master.

619
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,540
Everyone is here.

620
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,540
Well, I...

621
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,540
Come, sit.

622
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,540
I'll say a few words.

623
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,540
Everyone has heard about Dr. Wu.

624
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,540
Before he left,

625
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,540
our leader's thoughts

626
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,540
were similar to that

627
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,540
of the Qixi master.

628
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,540
He left

629
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,540
and he thought

630
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,540
it was worth it

631
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,540
to leave this place.

632
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,540
We are police.

633
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,540
Maybe we can't help everyone.

634
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,540
But we are a little bit

635
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,540
upset

636
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,540
to let someone

637
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,540
feel that life is better.

638
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,540
That is also our work.

639
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,540
What's the point

640
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,540
of being upset?

641
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,540
Right?

642
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,540
I want to say something else.

643
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,540
We are in this era.

644
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,540
When I first became a police,

645
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,540
it was different.

646
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,540
At that time,

647
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,540
the police had a lot of power.

648
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,540
At that time,

649
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,540
we were in the police.

650
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,540
We didn't have guns.

651
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,540
But the police was talking.

652
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:01,540
Everyone was shut up.

653
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,540
But now,

654
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,540
now we are in the police station.

655
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:09,540
Someone took the phone

656
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,540
and took it

657
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:11,540
with a 360-degree angle

658
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:12,540
and kept it on.

659
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,540
It was so painful.

660
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:16,540
But how about another angle?

661
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,540
Who said

662
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:21,540
that the people's

663
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,540
idea of law

664
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,540
was a gun?

665
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,540
Do you know

666
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,540
how to protect your rights?

667
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,540
The police's law

668
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,540
has raised higher demands.

669
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,540
It forced us

670
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,540
to improve

671
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,540
our law level

672
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:35,540
and our law concept.

673
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,540
To break the law,

674
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,540
we have to

675
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,540
strengthen our law

676
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,540
and protect the dignity

677
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,540
of the law.

678
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,540
This is

679
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,540
my little knowledge

680
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,540
and this sense of duty.

681
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:46,540
I want to share it with you.

682
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:49,540
I hope you can

683
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,540
share this new topic

684
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:52,540
with us.

685
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,540
We have to do this.

686
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:57,540
What are you talking about?

687
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:59,540
Stop it.

688
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:00,540
Let's talk about the law.

689
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,540
How could you

690
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:18,540
let auntie take the box?

691
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,540
You didn't let me take it.

692
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,540
It's not a big deal.

693
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,540
Third sister,

694
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,540
I'll leave you to Xiao Jie

695
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,540
as soon as I'm done.

696
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:29,540
Xiao Jie,

697
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,540
send your mom home

698
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,540
and take good care of your mom.

699
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,540
Aunt,

700
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,540
I'm not here

701
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,540
to send your mom.

702
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,540
I'm here to attend

703
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,540
the 40th anniversary party

704
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,540
of our classmate's wedding.

705
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,540
They've booked a hotel for me.

706
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,540
I'll go there later.

707
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,540
I'll come to visit you.

708
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,540
I'll come to visit you if I'm free.

709
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,540
Take your mom home.

710
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,540
Your auntie

711
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,540
is getting older and younger.

712
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,540
She's not like me.

713
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:50,540
No way.

714
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,540
Aunt, where are you?

715
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,540
I'm driving.

716
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,540
I'll take you there.

717
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,540
No need.

718
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:57,540
Look, they're coming to pick me up.

719
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,540
What's wrong with you?

720
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:03,540
You guys go back first.

721
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,540
Take your mom home.

722
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,540
Okay.

723
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,540
Why are you still here?

724
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,540
Why are you still here?

725
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:08,540
Why are you still here?

726
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,540
Why are you still here?

727
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,540
Why are you still here?

728
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,540
Mom, go home.

729
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,540
Go home.

730
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,540
What's wrong?

731
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,540
Let's go.

732
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,540
Let's go.

733
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,540
Let's go.

734
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,540
Let's go.

735
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,540
Look.

736
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,540
Mom,

737
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,540
it's time to eat.

738
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,540
Xiao Jie,

739
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,540
let's talk to the police

740
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,540
and get you a new job

741
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,540
that's not for your family.

742
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,540
Let's talk about this again.

743
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,540
Actually,

744
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:23,540
I'm afraid you'll be in trouble.

745
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,540
Now,

746
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,540
we both

747
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:28,540
don't have anyone to protect you.

748
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:30,540
How much do you have to be bullied?

749
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,540
Mom,

750
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:42,540
did you call Soli again?

751
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:46,540
Yes, I did.

752
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,540
If I didn't call her,

753
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,540
you wouldn't force Wang Shou Yi

754
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,540
to apologize to me.

755
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:55,540
If you don't tell me,

756
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:57,540
I'll find out.

757
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:59,540
Didn't you promise me

758
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,540
that you won't interfere with my work?

759
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:05,540
I just said whatever I wanted to say.

760
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,540
You're my daughter.

761
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,540
How could I say

762
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,540
whatever I wanted to say to an outsider?

763
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,540
Dr. Wu,

764
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:17,540
if I'm here,

765
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,540
I'll go and find her.

766
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,540
Mom,

767
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,540
don't do that.

768
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,540
If you go and find her,

769
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,540
I'll resign.

770
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:25,540
I won't do it.

771
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,540
We've done a good job.

772
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,540
Wang Shou Yi,

773
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:31,540
why did you force

774
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,540
Wang Shou Yi to apologize to you?

775
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,540
Can't you go to someone else?

776
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,540
They said something

777
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:40,540
before your father passed away.

778
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:42,540
Did they forget?

779
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,540
Mom,

780
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:53,540
my father is a hero in my heart.

781
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,540
But

782
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,540
my work and my life

783
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,540
should be a farewell to him.

784
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,540
Mom,

785
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,540
I was just discussing with you.

786
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:09,540
Why are you crying again?

787
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,540
Xiao Jie,

788
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:15,540
how could you say that?

789
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:21,540
When I was pregnant with you,

790
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:25,540
your father wanted a boy.

791
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,540
He thought that if he had a son,

792
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,540
he would teach him

793
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,540
how to be a good boy.

794
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:34,540
He would teach him how to be a police officer.

795
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,540
Later, when you were pregnant,

796
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,540
your father immediately thought

797
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:43,540
that you were the boy he had always been looking for.

798
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,540
When you were little,

799
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:53,540
your father would come home every time

800
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,540
and hug you and say goodbye.

801
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,540
Before your father passed away,

802
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:08,540
I was afraid that he would call out to him.

803
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:14,540
Your father's mouth was frozen.

804
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:16,540
It was frozen.

805
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:20,540
He would make a loud sound.

806
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,540
Xiao Jie,

807
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,540
Xiao Jie,

808
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:29,540
your father was thinking about you.

809
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:32,540
But now that you think that he has affected you,

810
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,540
I...

811
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,540
Are you angry?

812
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,540
Mom, stop talking.

813
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,540
I didn't mean that.

814
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,540
I just want to beg you.

815
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,540
Please, don't mind me anymore.

816
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,540
Or I will leave this family.

817
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:05,540
Your father was crying.

818
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,540
Lian Feng who uncle Sa sent to you,

819
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,540
didn't talk to you regularly.

820
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,540
Since February,

821
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,540
my brother and my sister

822
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,540
have looked after him for many years.

823
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:23,540
No, she didn't,

824
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,540
but she is still the reason

825
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:28,540
Here we go again.

826
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:30,540
It's still a big one.

827
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,540
It's a big one.

828
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:34,540
It's a big one.

829
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,540
Come here.

830
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,540
It's a big one.

831
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,540
Come on, Dawei.

832
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:42,540
Don't make a fuss.

833
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,540
Who told you?

834
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:46,540
Don't make a fuss.

835
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:48,540
I'll make you a bite of meat.

836
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,540
Come on, Dawei.

837
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:52,540
Come on, Dawei.

838
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:58,540
Come out.

839
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,540
Come out.

840
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,540
Have a rest.

841
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,540
Thank you.

842
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,540
Why are you here?

843
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:10,540
It's just...

844
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:12,540
Didn't he call you?

845
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,540
No.

846
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:16,540
I can't. We can go now.

847
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,540
I said you can go now.

848
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,540
Zhao Jingfan, Li Dawei.

849
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,540
Go.

850
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:24,540
I'll help you exercise.

851
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,540
Are you stupid?

852
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:28,540
Yes.

853
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:30,540
Xiajie's mother is back.

854
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:32,540
She won't come back today.

855
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,540
How do you know?

856
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,540
I asked her.

857
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,540
She didn't have to say it.

858
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,540
She asked me to tell you.

859
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:54,540
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

860
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:04,540
This is Xiajie.

861
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:06,540
This is me.

862
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:08,540
Get lost.

863
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:10,540
Give me money.

864
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:12,540
Give me money.

865
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:14,540
I'm going to throw up.

866
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:16,540
Why are you so dirty?

867
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:18,540
Give me money.

868
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:20,540
Give me money.

869
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,540
Give me money.

870
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:52,540
You're back.

871
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:54,540
I miss you.

872
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:56,540
I want to eat dumplings for you.

873
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:22,540
I'm sorry.

874
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:52,540
I'm sorry.

875
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:22,540
I miss you.

876
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:52,540
I miss you.

877
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:54,540
I miss you.

878
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:56,540
I miss you.

879
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:58,540
I miss you.

880
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:00,540
I miss you.

881
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:02,540
I miss you.

882
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:04,540
I miss you.

883
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:06,540
I miss you.

884
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:08,540
I miss you.

885
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:10,540
I miss you.

886
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:12,540
I miss you.

887
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:14,540
I miss you.

888
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:16,540
I miss you.

889
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:18,540
I miss you.

890
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:20,540
I miss you.

891
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:24,540
I miss you.

892
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:26,540
I miss you.

893
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:30,540
I miss you.

894
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:36,540
I miss you.

895
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:40,540
I miss you.

896
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:48,340
I caress you on
