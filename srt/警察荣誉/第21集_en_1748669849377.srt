I'm hungry.

32
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,960
I was just praising you.

33
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,960
I didn't say anything.

34
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,960
It's really hot.

35
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,960
Have you been here before?

36
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,960
Master,

37
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,960
do you really have a mission?

38
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,960
You found the evidence.

39
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,960
Don't be so careless.

40
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,960
Eat your noodles.

41
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,960
Don't look. Eat noodles.

42
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,960
Uncle Yang,

43
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,960
you sit here and eat slowly.

44
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,960
Wait for me.

45
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,960
Who are you?

46
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,960
I'm a cook.

47
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,960
I'm a cook.

48
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,960
I'm a cook.

49
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,960
I'm a cook.

50
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,960
I'm a cook.

51
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,960
I'm a cook.

52
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,960
Who are you?

53
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,960
I'm a cook.

54
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,960
Boss,

55
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,960
you look old.

56
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,960
Excuse me.

57
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,960
Sit down, Xiao Bai.

58
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,960
Do you know me?

59
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,960
You're Bai Tianyu.

60
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,960
I didn't find a good job at your university.

61
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,960
I went to the dyeing department.

62
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,960
But you didn't expect me to let you do

63
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,960
the work that you're so hard to get.

64
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,960
You've thought about quitting,

65
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,960
but you're not happy about it.

66
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,960
So,

67
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,960
you're hard to get.

68
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,960
Who are you?

69
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,960
I'm a cook.

70
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,960
I'm a cook.

71
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,960
I'm a cook.

72
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,960
I'm a cook.

73
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,960
I'm sorry.

74
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,960
I'm really working.

75
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,960
I advise you to stay.

76
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,960
I'm afraid I'll be rude to you.

77
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,960
What's the point of your son

78
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,960
to be so mature?

79
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,960
And

80
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,960
he's still so high

81
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,960
in your expectations and expectations.

82
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,960
What do you want to do?

83
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,960
I want to help you

84
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,960
with your studies,

85
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,960
your family,

86
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,960
your looks.

87
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,960
You're still a cook.

88
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,960
Why are you so bad?

89
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,960
Why do you have to go to Zigandolo?

90
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,960
I don't know.

91
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,960
I didn't know anything

92
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,960
when I first got in.

93
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,960
My people said

94
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,960
it's a high-level meeting place.

95
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,960
It's a successful business.

96
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,960
I didn't find a good job

97
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,960
after graduation.

98
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,960
I just wanted to be a waiter.

99
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,960
If I could

100
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,960
find someone

101
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,960
who could help me,

102
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,960
I could

103
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,960
find a good job.

104
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,960
I didn't expect

105
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,960
to be like this.

106
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,960
Tell me.

107
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,960
What's your current job?

108
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,960
You already knew it.

109
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,960
I don't want to see you

110
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,960
enter the list

111
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,960
of our major.

112
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,960
So I hope

113
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,960
you can tell me personally.

114
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,960
I just...

115
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,960
I just want to

116
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,960
be rich with those

117
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,960
who have money,

118
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,960
but who have a

119
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,960
very empty life.

120
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,960
I want them to be happy.

121
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,960
It's too dangerous.

122
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,960
You've already

123
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,960
put on a very dangerous

124
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,960
crime.

125
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,960
A crime?

126
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,960
I've been telling you for a long time.

127
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,960
I found you a real criminal.

128
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,960
That's why I found you.

129
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,960
How is it?

130
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,960
Can you cooperate with me?

131
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,960
Give yourself a chance.

132
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,960
No, no, brother.

133
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,960
He's very good.

134
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,960
If he knows,

135
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,960
I'll lose my life.

136
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,960
Can he be good

137
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,960
to me?

138
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,960
You go back

139
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,960
and listen to his instructions

140
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,960
as usual.

141
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,960
Then

142
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,960
I'll contact you.

143
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,960
Brother,

144
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,960
I'm very timid.

145
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,960
I can't do it.

146
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,960
I'll show up.

147
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,960
I'll be afraid

148
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,960
to ruin your plan.

149
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,960
How about this?

150
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,960
Help me with a favor.

151
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,960
What favor?

152
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,960
You help me

153
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,960
introduce a person.

154
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,960
Is this okay?

155
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,960
Who?

156
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,960
I'm thinking about it.

157
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,960
Then I'll contact you.

158
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,960
Okay.

159
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,960
You've been out for a long time.

160
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,960
Don't say it.

161
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,960
Go back first.

162
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,960
Brother,

163
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,960
I don't want to do it.

164
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,960
I can resign.

165
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,960
Okay.

166
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,960
But before you introduce

167
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,960
my person,

168
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,960
you can't resign.

169
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,960
Okay.

170
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,960
Come on.

171
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,960
Mr. Qin,

172
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,960
what do you think?

173
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,960
How do you think

174
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,960
Uncle Yang will be the third-ranked?

175
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,960
Who told him to be the third-ranked?

176
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,960
I'm the third-ranked?

177
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,960
I know what you think.

178
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,960
You must let him be the third-ranked.

179
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,960
If he doesn't,

180
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,960
you'll be a bad guy.

181
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,960
Do you think

182
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,960
he can make it?

183
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,960
Definitely.

184
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,960
That kid

185
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,960
is a bit serious.

186
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,960
You see,

187
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,960
I'm so serious.

188
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,960
I can't find him.

189
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,960
No,

190
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,960
he's not good at making things worse.

191
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,960
He's not good at learning.

192
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,960
He's a human being.

193
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,960
You all think Uncle Yang

194
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,960
can't fight.

195
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,960
Stop fighting.

196
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,960
Is he fighting?

197
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,960
Is he pulling the price?

198
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,960
But I think

199
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,960
he can't make it.

200
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,960
Try it.

201
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,960
Try it.

202
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,960
I think you're right.

203
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,960
We can try it.

204
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,960
But are you sure

205
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,960
there's a real love activity

206
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,960
in there?

207
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,960
Of course.

208
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,960
That little white

209
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,960
has introduced a lot of

210
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,960
the situation inside me.

211
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,960
Once we break this,

212
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,960
it'll be a big deal.

213
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,960
I think

214
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,960
you can try it.

215
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,960
Try it.

216
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,960
It's good.

217
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,960
What are you looking at?

218
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,960
Nothing.

219
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,960
You just lost your eyes

220
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,960
without leaving your phone.

221
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,960
Show me.

222
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,960
You can't do that.

223
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,960
Just show me.

224
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,960
How can I help you?

225
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,960
No.

226
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,960
No.

227
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,960
You think

228
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,960
if he can't make it,

229
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,960
he can write

230
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,960
and write a letter.

231
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,960
Is that a lie?

232
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,960
I know

233
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,960
it's useless.

234
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,960
The problem is

235
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,960
I really don't know

236
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,960
what to do about it.

237
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,960
Let me see.

238
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,960
You're laughing at me.

239
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,960
It's better than not to see it.

240
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,960
Fine.

241
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,960
Fine.

242
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,960
Then you can see it yourself.

243
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,960
Guys,

244
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,960
it's not that I'm

245
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,960
forcing you.

246
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,960
I can't teach you anything.

247
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,960
Master.

248
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,960
Let's be peaceful.

249
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,960
You said

250
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,960
you don't know

251
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,960
what to do.

252
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,960
You just

253
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,960
send me to the lake.

254
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,960
As for that,

255
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,960
I believe

256
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,960
you can handle it.

257
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,960
It's just work.

258
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,960
Isn't it work?

259
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,960
You...

260
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,960
You did it

261
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,960
for work.

262
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,960
Write a letter.

263
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,960
Write a letter.

264
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,960
Write a letter.

265
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,960
Write a letter.

266
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,960
I have to write a letter.

267
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,960
What are you thinking about?

268
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,960
I can't think of anything

269
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,960
in that kind of place.

270
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,960
Here it comes.

271
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,960
Here it comes, Xiao Bai.

272
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,960
It's just a letter.

273
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,960
Come in.

274
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,960
Sit down.

275
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,960
Sit down.

276
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,960
It's him.

277
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,960
What do you think?

278
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,960
Xiao Bai is not bad.

279
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,960
He's got a good figure.

280
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,960
Our boss must like him.

281
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,960
Who is your brother?

282
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,960
I'm a police officer.

283
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,960
I know.

284
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,960
I'm a police officer.

285
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,960
Uncle Yang,

286
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,960
if you know

287
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,960
where you are,

288
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,960
can others take care of you?

289
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,960
Xiao Bai,

290
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,960
do you still remember

291
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,960
how I asked you?

292
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,960
I just said

293
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,960
my cousin is a junior.

294
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,960
He didn't find a job

295
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,960
in college.

296
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,960
He asked me to find a job.

297
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,960
That's all.

298
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,960
As long as your boss

299
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,960
really stays with him,

300
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,960
your work will be done.

301
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,960
If you want to resign,

302
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,960
I won't stop you.

303
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,960
Jianqun,

304
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,960
he's not that anxious.

305
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,960
He just got in.

306
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,960
He has no experience.

307
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,960
I'll be with him for a few days.

308
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,960
Uncle Yang,

309
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,960
you're out.

310
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,960
Okay, okay.

311
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,960
Just say it.

312
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,960
Uncle Yang,

313
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,960
who are you looking for?

314
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,960
What's wrong?

315
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,960
A spy?

316
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,960
He's a good guy.

317
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,960
I'll go with him.

318
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,960
I'm also a part of the police.

319
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,960
You should study more.

320
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,960
Xiao Bai is in this mission.

321
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,960
You're not in trouble.

322
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,960
I'll take care of you.

323
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,960
Jia You.

324
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,960
Jia You.

325
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,960
Jia You.

326
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,960
Jia You.

327
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,960
Jia You.

328
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,960
What's the name of the flower?

329
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,960
How about

330
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,960
the name of the flower?

331
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,960
I'll call you Uncle Yang.

332
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,960
Call me Uncle Yang.

333
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,960
Brother Yang,

334
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,960
are you sure

335
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,960
you'll use the real name?

336
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,960
I'll call you the name of the flower.

337
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,960
It's called

338
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,960
A Wei.

339
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,960
Whatever.

340
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,960
I'll call you A Wei

341
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,960
with this figure.

342
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,960
What are you doing?

343
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,960
Just say it.

344
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,960
Where are you touching?

345
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,960
Listen,

346
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,960
I'm different from you.

347
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,960
I'm a police officer.

348
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,960
Brother Yang,

349
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,960
Jianqun is the one

350
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,960
who asked me to cooperate with you.

351
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,960
If you don't cooperate with me,

352
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,960
my boss won't accept you.

353
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,960
I have no choice.

354
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,960
Let's go.

355
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,960
Listen.

356
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,960
You just need to

357
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,960
introduce me to your boss later.

358
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,960
Don't say anything extra.

359
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,960
Don't talk to me.

360
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,960
Okay, okay.

361
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,960
If you don't want to be with your family,

362
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,960
why don't you introduce yourself

363
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,960
to so many people?

364
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,960
I'll introduce you to them.

365
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,960
Stop.

366
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,960
What are you doing?

367
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,960
I'm taking my cousin to work.

368
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,960
Brother,

369
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,960
here.

370
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,960
Welcome.

371
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,960
Guo Guo.

372
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,960
Hello.

373
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,960
Here.

374
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,960
Hello.

375
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,960
Zhong Jie.

376
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,960
Zhong Jie.

377
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,960
I'm in the bathroom.

378
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,960
Wait for me in the room.

379
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,960
Here.

380
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,960
Here.

381
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,960
Boss.

382
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,960
Zhong Jie, come here.

383
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,960
Who is this?

384
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,960
Who is this?

385
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,960
Zhong Jie.

386
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,960
This is my cousin,

387
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,960
Jia Wei.

388
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,960
Wei.

389
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,960
This is my mother.

390
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,960
Her name is Zhong Jie.

391
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,960
Zhong Jie.

392
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,960
Wei.

393
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,960
Take care.

394
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,960
Wei.

395
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,960
Xiaobai, you're so good.

396
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,960
You're quite a good cousin.

397
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,960
Zhong Jie,

398
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,960
our family is very filial.

399
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,960
We take our cousin as a boy.

400
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,960
I take her as a girl.

401
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,960
This little girl.

402
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,960
She looks quite strong.

403
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,960
She's quite tough.

404
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,960
How hard is it to be famous?

405
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,960
Wei, right?

406
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,960
How old are you?

407
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,960
Twenty-five.

408
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,960
What did you do before?

409
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,960
After college,

410
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,960
I didn't find any good job.

411
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,960
I did everything.

412
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,960
Did you do our business?

413
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,960
No.

414
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,960
I did two years of business.

415
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,960
I went to the wind and rain.

416
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,960
My body got swollen.

417
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,960
Business?

418
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,960
This shape,

419
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,960
this body board is business.

420
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,960
Isn't it a big and small use?

421
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,960
How much can you earn a month?

422
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,960
I can earn ten thousand.

423
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,960
That's it.

424
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,960
If you're doing well at work,

425
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,960
it's possible to earn a lot of money.

426
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,960
Xiaobai,

427
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,960
didn't you say you're going to resign?

428
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,960
Your cousin is coming.

429
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,960
You can resign if you want to.

430
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,960
Zhong Jie,

431
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,960
you're so thoughtful.

432
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,960
My cousin just came.

433
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,960
I'll pay him a few days.

434
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,960
You're so noisy.

435
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,960
You guys,

436
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,960
you're all crying and yelling at the beginning.

437
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,960
You're not leaving even if you're fighting.

438
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,960
You're so smart.

439
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,960
Wei,

440
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,960
do you have any better clothes?

441
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,960
Something bad.

442
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,960
Better?

443
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,960
What do you need?

444
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,960
Zhong Jie,

445
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,960
my cousin used to be a fast learner.

446
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,960
How can I have any good clothes?

447
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,960
You're right.

448
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,960
You take him to our clothing store,

449
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,960
find him some better clothes,

450
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,960
and come to work tonight.

451
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,960
How is it?

452
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,960
Okay.

453
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,960
Okay, we're leaving.

454
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,960
See you later.

455
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,960
Wei, do your best.

456
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,960
Let's go.

457
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,960
Xiao Bai,

458
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,960
where are you going?

459
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,960
This is my cousin.

460
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,960
Her name is Chu.

461
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,960
Don't be so careless.

462
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,960
Xiao Bai,

463
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,960
you're here.

464
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,960
Zhong Jie, you look so pretty.

465
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,960
Wei.

466
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,960
Zhong Jie, look.

467
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,960
Baby,

468
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,960
you look so happy.

469
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,960
You're really a good doctor.

470
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,960
You're so handsome.

471
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,960
You're so nice.

472
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,960
Zhong Jie.

473
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,960
Xiao Bai, go out.

474
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,960
Zhong Jie.

475
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,960
I'm hungry.

476
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,960
Zhong Jie,

477
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,960
I want to ask

478
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,960
who is my cousin's guest?

479
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,960
You've done a good job.

480
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,960
You're a good guest.

481
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,960
You can go out.

482
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,960
Zhong Jie,

483
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,960
my cousin

484
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,960
has no experience in this field.

485
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,960
You're a bit childish.

486
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,960
Your sister is more handsome

487
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,960
than you.

488
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,960
How can you be so useless?

489
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,960
I've been thinking about it many times.

490
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,960
No.

491
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,960
Brother,

492
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,960
I'm leaving you alone.

493
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,960
Zhong Jie.

494
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,960
It's okay.

495
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,960
Relax.

496
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,960
I don't eat.

497
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,960
Relax.

498
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,960
Zhong Jie.

499
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,960
What do I need to do today?

500
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,960
You don't have to do anything.

501
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,960
I'll teach you today.

502
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,960
Just dress up.

503
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,960
Zhong Jie.

504
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,960
Zhong Jie.

505
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,960
That...

506
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,960
I'm not ready yet.

507
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,960
I'm not ready yet.

508
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,960
Why are you here?

509
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,960
You're not ready yet?

510
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,960
Do you think the guest

511
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,960
will give you time to prepare?

512
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,960
Yes.

513
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,960
Let me tell you.

514
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,960
The guest told you to do something.

515
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,960
You should do it immediately.

516
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,960
You know?

517
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,960
If I didn't see

518
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,960
your condition

519
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,960
as a good person,

520
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,960
I would be lazy to talk to you.

521
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,960
Do you know how many people

522
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,960
want to eat dinner

523
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,960
and earn money?

524
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,960
I do what others want.

525
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,960
If I don't want to, I'll go crazy.

526
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,960
It's true.

527
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,960
You're so handsome.

528
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,960
I'm not a good person.

529
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,960
Yes.

530
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,960
Zhong Jie is right.

531
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,960
It's just that I...

532
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,960
I'm really a little...

533
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:38,960
I...

534
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,960
You're a little nervous, right?

535
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,960
Yes.

536
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,960
It's okay.

537
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,960
Relax.

538
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,960
I understand you.

539
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,960
You're going to work

540
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,960
the first day after all, right?

541
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,960
Look at the environment.

542
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,960
Come here.

543
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,960
Sit here.

544
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,960
I'll teach you.

545
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,960
Come here.

546
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,960
Come here.

547
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,960
Come here.

548
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,960
You should be a good worker.

549
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,960
Write a letter.

550
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,960
Do I have to catch you?

551
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,960
What's wrong?

552
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,960
Why haven't you come out yet?

553
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,960
I've been thinking about it for a while.

554
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,960
I'm going to give it to Jiang Jiang.

555
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,960
Don't play dumb.

556
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,960
No.

557
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,960
Didn't you see Uncle Yang so quickly?

558
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,960
He must have something to do.

559
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,960
He can't write such a letter.

560
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,960
Uncle Yang, are you okay?

561
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,960
Uncle Yang, what's wrong?

562
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,960
You really got a hangover.

563
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,960
You're still pregnant.

564
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,960
You're almost there.

565
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,960
I'm thinking about it now.

566
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,960
I'm not as good as you.

567
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,960
What's wrong?

568
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,960
You're almost there.

569
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,960
Uncle Yang, tell me.

570
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,960
Tell me.

571
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,960
Stop talking.

572
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,960
I almost lost my job today.

573
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,960
I lost my job?

574
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,960
You have to listen to me.

575
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,960
Listen to me.

576
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,960
Listen to me.

577
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,960
Captain Zhang, take a shower.

578
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,960
So, what's the specific

579
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,960
feature of your talk about the end of the year?

580
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,960
I'll tell you that.

581
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,960
If I was really under pressure,

582
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,960
I would be doomed.

583
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,960
I should have kicked him.

584
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,960
If he asked me if I was upset with him,

585
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,960
I would have kicked him away.

586
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,960
Then I came back.

587
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,960
So, before you were doomed,

588
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,960
except for the end,

589
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,960
there were no other parents.

590
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,960
There was a person named Xiao Bai.

591
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,960
My master's late-night snack.

592
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,960
My master asked him to introduce me to him.

593
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,960
Xiao Bai.

594
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,960
So, I heard that Xiao Bai

595
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,960
introduced you to the drama.

596
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,960
He was from...

597
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,960
I shouldn't have told you.

598
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,960
No.

599
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,960
If I told you, you wouldn't have told me.

600
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,960
Look at you.

601
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,960
You've seen your sister.

602
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,960
You must have seen her.

603
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,960
Don't make trouble for her.

604
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,960
No, no, no.

605
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,960
I'm not joking.

606
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,960
I'm not joking.

607
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,960
I'm not joking.

608
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,960
Just say it.

609
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,960
The key is that

610
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,960
I didn't finish my task.

611
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,960
How do I finish my task?

612
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,960
You said that

613
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,960
you have to come to Cao Ge.

614
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,960
Uncle Yang shouldn't have done that.

615
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,960
Look at him.

616
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,960
He's tall and tall.

617
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,960
He's a good doctor.

618
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,960
Can he do it?

619
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,960
He should have asked me to do it.

620
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,960
I can do it if I can't.

621
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,960
I can't even hide from you.

622
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,960
You're still so tall.

623
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,960
Go up.

624
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,960
Who's tall?

625
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,960
I'm just saying that you can't finish your task.

626
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,960
If you have a better attitude,

627
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,960
I'll help you.

628
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,960
Get out.

629
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,960
Get out.

630
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,960
Since there's nothing to say,

631
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,960
just say it.

632
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,960
Then, please sign it on your face.

633
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,960
No.

634
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,960
Sit here.

635
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,960
It's hard.

636
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,960
Sit closer.

637
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,960
Sit closer.

638
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,960
Is this evidence enough?

639
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,960
The key evidence

640
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,960
is that the most delicious

641
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,960
food can be caught.

642
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,960
It's not.

643
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,960
Chief,

644
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,960
you saw

645
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,960
that mom

646
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,960
obviously likes Uncle Yang.

647
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,960
If Uncle Yang wants to go in,

648
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,960
he'll have to take the blame.

649
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,960
Yes.

650
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,960
Uncle Yang, you can't go anymore.

651
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,960
Chief,

652
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,960
what if

653
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,960
Li Davei takes over?

654
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,960
Li Davei?

655
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,960
Then Li Davei is not a good person.

656
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,960
Li Davei is a person who dares to take over.

657
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,960
If he does something wrong,

658
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,960
we won't show up

659
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,960
as a good cop.

660
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,960
It's not like there's a story.

661
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,960
Who will take over?

662
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,960
You're too confident

663
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,960
about your own soldiers.

664
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,960
Do you think

665
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,960
that kid is good?

666
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,960
It's because he doesn't have

667
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,960
the evidence of Uncle Yang.

668
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,960
But he didn't pay attention to

669
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,960
the fact that he's been in the

670
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,960
red dust for a few days.

671
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,960
Besides, we have more.

672
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,960
What do you mean?

673
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,960
Li Davei is not a bad person.

674
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,960
I didn't mean that.

675
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,960
You said it yourself.

676
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,960
I'm telling you.

677
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,960
I mean

678
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,960
the difference between a son and a son.

679
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,960
Li Davei and Uncle Yang are the same.

680
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,960
Except for the personality,

681
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,960
they're different.

682
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,960
They're not different in quality.

683
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,960
Look,

684
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,960
he's the chief.

685
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,960
He's the chief.

686
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,960
Others say it's not good.

687
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,960
Isn't that right?

688
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,960
The kids in our family

689
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,960
take over, right?

690
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,960
Yes.

691
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,960
You take over.

692
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,960
Then what do you think

693
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,960
we should do now?

694
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,960
Where is Li Davei?

695
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,960
You call him together.

696
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,960
I'll talk to him.

697
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,960
What does he mean?

698
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,960
Nothing.

699
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,960
There's a case in there.

700
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,960
I've been working for a few days.

701
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,960
He went to the blue roof

702
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,960
and sat on the floor.

703
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,960
He didn't paint it himself.

704
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,960
He had to use others' land.

705
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,960
What are you thinking about?

706
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,960
Uncle Yang can't do this.

707
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,960
He can't do it.

708
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,960
You can do it.

709
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,960
What are you thinking about?

710
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,960
I'm not a good person.

711
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,960
I'm just working.

712
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,960
I'm just working.

713
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,960
If you don't agree,

714
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,960
I won't go.

715
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,960
You have to keep this in mind.

716
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,960
Uncle, I'm busy.

717
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,960
I need to talk to you now.

718
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,960
Go to bed.

719
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,280
You seem to be

720
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,960
veryấuA planet to Stranger Things.

721
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,960
Isn't it their manager

722
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,960
told me to go there?

723
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,960
I'm just repetitive to greet you.

724
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,960
I'm very iOS-packed.

725
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:42,960
It's very high.

726
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,960
But you didn't do it on another mission.

727
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,960
You didn't do it on a few levels.

728
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,960
If you say so,

729
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,960
I won't go.

730
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,960
Okay, okay.

731
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,960
Chief Sun,

732
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,960
Li Davei is doing this for work.

733
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,960
Don't worry.

734
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,960
He has me inside.

735
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,960
I guess I can't go through

736
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,960
his spirit for three days.

737
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,960
I have to say it in my heart.

738
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,960
Three days?

739
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,960
One.

740
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,960
He won't do it so fast.

741
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,960
No.

742
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,960
What did you say?

743
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,960
What did I say?

744
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,960
I said three days.

745
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,960
No, I'll give you five days.

746
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,960
You need to know the situation inside.

747
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,960
You need to know the situation inside.

748
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,960
Keep in touch with the lock.

749
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,960
You should go to this place to get the enemy.

750
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,960
You shouldn't do things you shouldn't do.

751
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,960
Chief Sun,

752
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,960
I guess

753
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,960
I can't do anything inside.

754
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,960
Who knows?

755
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,960
You're so bold.

756
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,960
Don't worry.

757
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,960
I'm not a good person.

758
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,960
I'm not good at reading.

759
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,960
If I'm good at reading,

760
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,960
it's hard to say.

761
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,960
Chief Sun.

762
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,960
Just kidding.

763
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,960
It's okay.

764
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,960
Go.

765
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,960
Chief Sun, you're too old to joke with him.

766
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,960
Just kidding.

767
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,960
Okay, okay.

768
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,960
Let's go, Chief Sun.

769
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,960
Brother Jianzhen.

770
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,960
Come in.

771
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,960
Cousin.

772
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,960
Cousin.

773
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,960
Cousin.

774
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,960
Cousin.

775
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,960
Okay, sit here.

776
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,960
Don't call him Cousin anymore.

777
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,960
Call me Cousin.

778
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,960
Who are you?

779
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,960
I'm here to pick him up.

780
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,960
Isn't he your Cousin?

781
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,960
I'm your second cousin.

782
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,960
You're responsible for sending me to the Blue Sea.

783
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,960
Cousin is

784
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,960
just like you.

785
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,960
I know.

786
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,960
I'll do what I can to teach you.

787
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,960
Do you understand?

788
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,960
Xiaobai.

789
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,960
Listen to him.

790
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,960
He introduced me to the Blue Sea.

791
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,960
Didn't you want to stay here for a few days?

792
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,960
You should bring the eggs.

793
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,960
No, no, no.

794
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,960
Brother Jianzhen,

795
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,960
I have something to do.

796
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,960
I have to go.

797
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,960
I'll take my second cousin to the Blue Sea.

798
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:56,960
Then I'll go.

799
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,960
Don't bother.

800
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,960
Yes, brother.

801
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,960
Uncle Yang has been with you for a few days.

802
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,960
I'm not going to be with you.

803
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,960
You can't be so generous.

804
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,960
I beg you, second cousin.

805
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,960
Sister Zhong.

806
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,960
What are you doing, Xiaobai?

807
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,960
Brother Jianzhen,

808
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,960
I have something to tell you.

809
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,960
Let's continue.

810
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,960
Come in.

811
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:34,960
Sister Zhong,

812
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,960
the one who came the day before yesterday

813
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,960
is my second cousin.

814
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,960
This is my second cousin.

815
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,960
I've never seen my second cousin

816
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,960
before.

817
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,960
I can't do it.

818
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,960
So I'm here as my second cousin.

819
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,960
You have quite a lot of second cousins.

820
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,960
You don't look handsome

821
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,960
without your second cousin.

822
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,960
But you look quite handsome.

823
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,960
You look handsome, Uncle.

824
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,960
You look good.

825
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,960
Right?

826
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,960
Xiaozong is quite smart.

827
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,960
What's your name?

828
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,960
My name is Uncle Yang.

829
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,960
My name is Uncle Da.

830
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,960
Uncle Da?

831
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,960
What have you done before?

832
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,960
I haven't done anything.

833
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:10,960
I've never been to college.

834
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,960
I just play music in the bar.

835
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,960
What music?

836
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,960
What do you play in the music?

837
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,960
I've played everything in my life.

838
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,960
This cousin is quite open-minded.

839
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,960
Fine.

840
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,960
Then you can stay.

841
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,960
Do you know what this place is for?

842
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,960
You heard that it's a service center.

843
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,960
It's a lot of work.

844
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,960
Other people don't know.

845
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,960
How can a service center

846
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,960
earn tens of thousands a month?

847
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,960
Xiaobai, why don't you

848
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,960
stay for a few days and teach him?

849
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,960
Sister Zhong,

850
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,960
didn't you promise me

851
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,960
to let me go

852
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,960
as long as you find a place to help me?

853
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,960
I have something in my house.

854
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,960
I can't leave.

855
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,960
You're so noisy.

856
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,960
Fine.

857
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,960
Then you can leave.

858
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,960
You've already written down

859
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,960
the rules, right?

860
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,960
Don't think that I can't find you

861
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,960
when you leave this door.

862
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,960
Be careful when you talk outside.

863
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,960
If you do something wrong,

864
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,960
don't blame me for being rude to you.

865
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,960
Don't worry, Sister Zhong.

866
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,960
As long as I leave this door,

867
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,960
I'll completely forget about it.

868
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,960
Then I'll leave.

869
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,960
Go ahead.

870
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,960
Take care of yourself.

871
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,960
Take care of yourself.

872
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,960
Second cousin.

873
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,960
Second cousin.

874
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,960
Uncle.

875
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,960
Have you ever been a woman before?

876
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,960
Sister Zhong, what are you doing?

877
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,960
You're so smart.

878
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,960
Why do you have to ask me?

879
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:00,960
Sister Zhong,

880
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,960
is your waist not good?

881
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,960
Yes, it is.

882
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,960
It's not good to be tight.

883
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,960
I'll massage it for you.

884
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,960
Okay.

885
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,960
Sister Zhong,

886
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,960
your age,

887
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,960
I'm Han Jin's sister.

888
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,960
Isn't that the one who touched you?

889
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,960
You're so young.

890
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,960
You're quite good at it.

891
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,960
You're older than my mother.

892
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,960
I must be a mother.

893
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,960
Fine, stop talking nonsense.

894
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,960
You can massage it if you want.

895
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,960
Okay.

896
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,960
You can massage it if you want.

897
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,960
Okay.

898
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,960
What's wrong with you?

899
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,960
Your hand is too heavy.

900
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,960
What are you doing?

901
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,960
You're so strong.

902
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,960
You're going to kill me.

903
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,960
I'm not a mother.

904
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,960
I'm not heavy.

905
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,960
I'm not light.

906
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,960
Fine, fine.

907
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,960
Did someone

908
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,960
send you to my revenge?

909
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,960
You're so scared.

910
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,960
Fine, stop it.

911
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,960
You can massage it.

912
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,960
Massage it.

913
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,960
Uncle, let me tell you.

914
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,960
There are many guests

915
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,960
in our place.

916
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,960
They are all

917
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,960
from different families.

918
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,960
They are very generous.

919
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,960
You just have to

920
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,960
make them happy

921
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,960
after you've done the massage.

922
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,960
You can make a million or two

923
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,960
at night.

924
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,960
It's like playing with them.

925
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,960
Do you remember?

926
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,960
Your current mission

927
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:18,960
is to think of a way to set up a law.

928
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,960
After you've done the massage,

929
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,960
you can make them happy

930
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,960
and make them come here

931
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,960
to pay for their expenses every day.

932
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,960
If you can't keep the guests,

933
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,960
don't blame me for being rude to you.

934
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,960
I understand.

935
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,960
Look at your ability.

936
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,960
Do you want to try it again?

937
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:34,960
Fine, fine.

938
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,960
I want to live longer.

939
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,960
Fine, fine.

940
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,960
Just do it

941
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,960
as you like.

942
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,960
It's fast.

943
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,960
What kind of person is he?

944
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,960
He's a thief.

945
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,960
A thief.

946
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,960
An invitation.

947
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,960
The condition of the entry must have

948
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,960
two members to provide an introduction

949
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,960
and a sheet of guarantee.

950
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,960
The member certificate is 121,000,000.

951
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,960
Every member has a fixed amount

952
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:20,960
to provide services to.

953
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,960
120...

954
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,960
There's no limit

955
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,960
for the service.

956
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,840
and the requirements of the guests

957
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,160
President

958
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,160
This is the list of all members

959
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,760

There is a protective umbrella in this middle

964
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,600

Report to the director.

00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,760
That's right.

976
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,760
Very correct.

977
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,760
You're so stupid.

978
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,760
Brother Cao.

That's good.

982
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,760
You really can do it.

983
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,760
Brother Cao, don't say that.

984
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,760
I can't do it when Uncle Yang can do it.

985
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,760
Did I say Uncle Yang is not as good as you?

986
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,760
No.

987
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,760
Look.

988
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,760
This person has been in there before.

989
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,760
I've seen him before.

00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,760

He seems to be Sun.

992
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,760
Who is he?

993
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,760
Don't ask.

994
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,760
Give me a little bit.

995
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,760
Touch his return.

996
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,760
Brother Cao.

997
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,760
This is not a rule, right?

998
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,760
Don't worry.

999
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,760
Brother Cao has a red line in his heart.

1000
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,760
I will not do anything that can violate the law.

Okay.

Don't be so impulsive.

00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,760
Don't be so impulsive.

1006
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,760
Dawei.
