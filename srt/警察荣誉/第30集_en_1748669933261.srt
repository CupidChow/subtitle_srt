Lion Sounds

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm going to make a little bit of a

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
little bit of a

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
little bit of a

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
little bit of a little bit of a

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
little bit of a little bit of a

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
little bit of a little bit of a little

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
bit of a little bit of a little

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
bit of a little bit of a little

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
bit of a little bit of a little

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
bit of a little bit of a little bit of

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
a little bit of a little bit of a little

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
bit of a little bit of a little

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
bit of a little bit of a little

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
bit of a little bit of a little

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
bit of a little bit of a

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
little bit of a little

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
bit of a little

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
bit of a little

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
bit of a little

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
bit of a little

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
bit of a little

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
bit of a little

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
bit of a little bit of a little

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
bit of having a little

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
bit of a big

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
bit of a big

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
runnerうわ

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
a little

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,680
Remove all the duty- prime,

31
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,180
Remove all the duty- prime,

32
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,040
Remove all the duty- prime,

33
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,080
Save all the duty- prime.

34
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,000
Better say goodbye.

35
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,200
Hello?

36
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:42,740
Hello?

37
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,360
Hello?

38
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:46,960
Hello, how are you?

39
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,360
I'm fine.

40
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,280
I was just here for a brief음.

41
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,580
And I'm glad you two are here.

42
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,140
After you have moved to my town,

43
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,420
he's sent me 12 issues to ask off.

44
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,500
I want to get together and know it better.

45
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,540
Let him go first.

46
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,720
Don't forget about it.

47
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,660
Don't forget the password.

48
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,220
He's the police know-it-all.

49
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,860
I'll give him a copy of it.

50
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:06,660
Leave it to me.

51
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,300
Don't worry.

52
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,740
Why are you calling meой?

53
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,660
I'm called Jia.

54
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,380
How old are you?

55
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:13,820
I'm 28 years old.

56
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:14,460
28.

57
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,420
How long have you been working here?

58
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,820
More than a year.

59
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,580
You want me to eat this on the street?

60
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,580
Isn't this your low-key strength?

61
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,580
I can't eat it on the street.

62
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,580
Then take it.

63
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,580
Go to the store and find a way to eat it.

64
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,580
Don't be so sad.

65
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,580
How can it be?

66
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,580
What about me?

67
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,580
How can you do that?

68
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,580
I can make my mom be more powerful.

69
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,580
You've been busy with the money for so long.

70
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,580
You can't let her get into the company.

71
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,580
Then I can only say that the revolution has not been successful.

72
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,580
The comrades can work hard.

73
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,580
Don't be so pessimistic.

74
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,580
I'm not pessimistic.

75
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,580
I know my mom too well.

76
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:16,580
Her heart can't be untied easily.

77
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,580
As I said,

78
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,580
your heart can't be untied easily.

79
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,580
Your mom's heart can't be untied easily.

80
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,580
The comrades can't be in a hurry.

81
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,580
We didn't think about it.

82
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,580
Sorry.

83
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,580
Sorry?

84
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,580
You've already done your duty.

85
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,580
If you lose her,

86
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,580
you'll be dead.

87
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:58,580
Do you still have the face to live in this world?

88
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,580
Sister-in-law.

89
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,580
Sister-in-law, you're serious.

90
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:09,580
I know that the city is very protective of Xia Jieyang.

91
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,580
Really.

92
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,580
Really?

93
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,580
For this reason,

94
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,580
Xia Jieyang has a lot to fight with the city.

95
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,580
Sister-in-law,

96
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:23,580
our sister-in-law is a good girl.

97
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,580
She's always in front of the lock.

98
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,580
In front of the lock?

99
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,580
What are you doing?

100
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,580
Xia Jieyang's father has sacrificed.

101
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,580
Are you going to chase Xia Jieyang?

102
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,580
Sister-in-law, I just said that you misunderstood.

103
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,580
Yes, you misunderstood.

104
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,580
You're not in the mood.

105
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,580
What do you mean?

106
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,580
Xia,

107
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,580
how did you treat Wang Shouyi?

108
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,580
How did you treat Cheng Hao?

109
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,580
But you did it,

110
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,580
can you do anything else?

111
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,580
That's right.

112
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,580
Gao Chao, what are you doing?

113
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,580
Look, Gao Chao, what are you doing?

114
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,580
No, no, no.

115
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,580
Sorry, sorry.

116
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,580
You continue.

117
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,580
Continue.

118
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,580
You continue.

119
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,580
How many meanings do you think

120
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,580
you can make me into this?

121
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,580
No.

122
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:40,580
Sister-in-law, this, this, this.

123
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,580
Sister-in-law, it's meaningless.

124
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,580
It's meaningless.

125
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,580
Sister-in-law,

126
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,580
wasn't it just by the way?

127
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,580
By the way, you treat me as a suspect

128
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,580
or a criminal?

129
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,580
You're too much, sister-in-law.

130
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,580
You said that a suspect

131
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,580
wouldn't bring a case.

132
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,580
You've already taken the table.

133
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,580
You haven't reached here yet.

134
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,580
I just...

135
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,580
I...

136
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,580
Sister-in-law,

137
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,580
what is the place where A-Li and Pai sent the lock?

138
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,580
I didn't come here.

139
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,580
What are you doing here?

140
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,580
We're all family.

141
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,580
Okay, say it.

142
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,580
When will Wang Shou Yi come back?

143
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,580
Our lock is really on the rise.

144
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,580
We can't contact him.

145
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,580
Okay.

146
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,580
Wang Shou Yi has never seen him.

147
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,580
I'll go to the bureau now.

148
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,580
I'll go to the bureau chief.

149
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,580
Sister-in-law, sit down.

150
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,580
You sit down.

151
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,580
You sit down.

152
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:36,580
Why are you going to the bureau?

153
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,580
The lock is not here.

154
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,580
We're still here, right?

155
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,580
Yes.

156
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,580
Can you handle the matter?

157
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,580
Of course.

158
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,580
Okay.

159
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,580
I'll transfer Xia Jie to the emergency room.

160
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,580
What's going on with him?

161
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,580
Sister-in-law, what are you doing here?

162
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,580
What are you doing?

163
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,580
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

164
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,580
I'm going to the bureau to find Xiaosong.

165
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,580
I'll see if he dares to wait for me.

166
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:11,580
Sister-in-law, what's the problem?

167
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,580
We didn't say we wouldn't solve it.

168
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,580
Solve it.

169
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,580
I'll give you three more days.

170
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,580
If you don't answer me in three days,

171
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,580
I'll ask the bureau chief to take your questions.

172
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,580
Sister-in-law.

173
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,580
Sister-in-law.

174
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,580
Bye.

175
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,580
Liu, you agreed to it?

176
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,580
What can I not agree to?

177
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,580
Can the bureau chief come to work in three days?

178
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,580
You're leaving the problem to the bureau chief.

179
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,580
It's not a big deal.

180
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,580
It's not a big deal.

181
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,580
It's a good deal.

182
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,580
The key is

183
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,580
whether Xia Jie is willing to go to the emergency room.

184
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,580
Is that so?

185
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,580
He can do it.

186
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,580
Don't talk to me.

187
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,580
No.

188
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,580
Enough.

189
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,580
It's not a big deal.

190
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,580
The rest of the things are waiting for the bureau chief.

191
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,580
What's wrong?

192
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,580
I saw the secretary who took you to the bureau.

193
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,580
I called your bureau chief.

194
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,580
I asked why you didn't go to the meeting.

195
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,580
The meeting has just started.

196
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,580
I haven't told you the people yet.

197
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,580
Why did I forget this?

198
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,580
What meeting?

199
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,580
Tell me.

200
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,580
Go back with me.

201
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,580
Me?

202
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,580
No, boss.

203
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,580
Boss.

204
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,580
What meeting?

205
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,580
I have something to do this morning.

206
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,580
It's a formal assembly.

207
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,580
The bureau is going to the district and the street.

208
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,580
We have to do a joint operation.

209
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,580
The personnel service of the bureau

210
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,580
will be held for the personnel inspection.

211
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,580
Including the non-regional house rent,

212
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,580
the tax revenue,

213
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,580
the foreign personnel registration,

214
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,580
the inspection of the security of the inspection,

215
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,580
the social security,

216
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,580
the spirit of the party,

217
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,580
and the meeting of the contact.

218
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,580
I have to attend it all.

219
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,580
So what are you going with?

220
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,580
I really have a secret key this morning.

221
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,580
You should pay for it.

222
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,580
You...

223
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,580
You...

224
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,580
You promised us that

225
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,580
you would take over this department.

226
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,580
Yes, boss.

227
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,580
Just go with me.

228
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,580
I will keep it.

229
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,580
Okay, I will arrange it.

230
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,580
Don't arrange it.

231
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,580
It's too late.

232
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,580
I will leave after I finish.

233
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,580
The bureau.

234
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,580
Please arrange the car.

235
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,580
No.

236
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,580
Okay.

237
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,580
Sister Xu.

238
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,580
You go first.

239
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,580
You go first.

240
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,580
You go with me.

241
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,580
I have a call.

242
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,580
I will arrange it for you.

243
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,580
Okay.

244
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,580
I will go back later.

245
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,580
You help me to arrange it.

246
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,580
Okay, I will tell you.

247
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,580
Did you bring all the things?

248
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,580
Yes.

249
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,580
Look, we have a lot of time.

250
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,580
No, boss.

251
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,580
You go with me.

252
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,580
I will go to the inspection.

253
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,580
There is nothing to do, right?

254
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,580
What are you talking about?

255
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,580
I mean, if you are okay,

256
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,580
you should go with me.

257
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,580
Where are you going?

258
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,580
You will know when you go.

259
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,580
Let's go.

260
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,580
I will go with you.

261
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,580
Then where am I going?

262
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,580
Sister Xu.

263
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,580
Call Sun Jiancheng and Wang Fujian

264
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,580
according to the original plan.

265
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,580
Go to the people in the east

266
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,580
and ask them to arrange the identity of the party.

267
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,580
Look.

268
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,580
Chen Suo.

269
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,580
Yes, what's up?

270
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,580
Where are the director and the chief?

271
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,580
The director went to the meeting.

272
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,580
The chief asked for a leave.

273
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,580
The chief asked for a leave?

274
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,580
What's up?

275
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,580
Yes.

276
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,580
What's up?

277
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,580
Qi Ze.

278
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,580
Wait a minute.

279
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,580
What's up?

280
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,580
What's up?

281
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,580
What's up with the director

282
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,580
for the chief?

283
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,580
Nothing.

284
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,580
What's up with you?

285
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,580
Qi Ze is not doing well.

286
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,580
Really?

287
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,580
No.

288
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,580
Really?

289
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:01,580
Let's go.

290
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,580
Tell me.

291
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,580
What's up?

292
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,580
If I can't do it,

293
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,580
I can make a call for you.

294
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,580
I want to ask for leave.

295
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,580
You want to ask for leave?

296
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,580
What's up?

297
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,580
Can't you work with someone first?

298
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,580
It's not useful.

299
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,580
You can ask for leave if you have nothing to do with it.

300
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,580
If I don't ask for leave,

301
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,580
I feel like my wife is going to divorce me.

302
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,580
I...

303
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,580
No, no, no.

304
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,580
Qi Ze, Qi Ze.

305
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,580
Don't worry.

306
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,580
I understand.

307
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,580
It's serious.

308
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,580
Well...

309
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,580
Let's go.

310
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,580
But...

311
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,580
I don't care about the police.

312
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,580
When the principal comes back,

313
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,580
I'll tell him right away.

314
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,580
Okay?

315
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,580
But...

316
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,580
If I don't ask for leave,

317
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,580
I'll divorce him.

318
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,580
It's not useful for me to ask for leave.

319
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,580
Really?

320
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,580
This...

321
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,580
Hello, ma'am.

322
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,580
What's going on?

323
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,580
The principal just agreed to me.

324
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,580
He won't answer my call.

325
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,580
He went to the community meeting.

326
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,580
I guess it's not convenient to answer the call.

327
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,580
Tell me.

328
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:34,580
When will the summer break be over?

329
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,580
Ma'am,

330
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,580
we just talked about it.

331
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,580
It's been three days.

332
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,580
It's been just a while.

333
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,580
You...

334
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,580
You said three days.

335
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,580
Do you have to drag it to three days?

336
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,580
It's just a human-like interaction.

337
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,580
Why can't we solve it now?

338
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,580
Didn't I tell you?

339
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,580
The principal...

340
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,580
The police haven't come back yet.

341
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,580
Don't tell me it's useless.

342
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,580
Can't we let Xia Jie go to work

343
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,580
before the interaction is over?

344
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,580
Look,

345
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,580
when the principal comes back,

346
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,580
I'll discuss with him.

347
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,580
There's nothing to discuss.

348
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,580
Hello?

349
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,580
Hello, ma'am.

350
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,580
Hello?

351
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,580
Coach,

352
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,580
is Mr. Wang all right?

353
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,580
We're all too tired to be on the plane.

354
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,580
Yes, yes.

355
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,580
Mr. Wei, you're working hard.

356
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,580
What should we do?

357
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,580
The party arranged this for us.

358
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,580
We can only do the work.

359
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,580
The next thing is to work together.

360
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,580
You're the main force of the police.

361
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,580
Mr. Wang isn't here.

362
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,580
The whole unit is on you.

363
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,580
We have to rely on everyone.

364
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:41,580
We have to work together.

365
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,580
Yes.

366
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,580
I'll pick up the phone.

367
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,580
Yes.

368
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,580
Mr. Wei, you're so good.

369
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,580
Don't worry.

370
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,580
Our bar will be with us this time.

371
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,580
We'll complete the task.

372
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,580
Son, what's wrong?

373
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,580
My son is in school.

374
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,580
He asked the principal to go there.

375
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,580
I don't know what's wrong with my son.

376
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,580
He's busy with work.

377
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,580
I'm so busy.

378
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,580
Hurry up.

379
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,580
How can he do that?

380
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,580
We just finished the meeting.

381
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,580
We have to work in the police station.

382
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,580
It's my job.

383
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,580
My master is here.

384
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,580
I'll report to the police after I get back.

385
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,580
I'll have a meeting with the police.

386
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,580
I'll arrange the work.

387
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,580
Okay.

388
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,580
You can go.

389
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,580
You don't believe us, do you?

390
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,580
Yes.

391
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,580
We're here.

392
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,580
Okay.

393
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,580
I'll go now.

394
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,580
I'll go back if there's nothing else.

395
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,580
Go to the police station.

396
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,580
No, I'll go by myself.

397
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,580
I'll be back soon.

398
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,580
Don't worry.

399
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,580
Take care.

400
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,580
Okay.

401
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,580
I'm sorry.

402
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,580
Go to the police station,

403
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,580
take me there.

404
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,580
Don't worry, okay?

405
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,520
I'll be back.

406
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,580
There are noiggeries in the station.

407
00:15:59,060 --> 00:15:59,580
Thanks.

408
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,580
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

409
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,580
I just brought you all the good news.

410
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,580
I understand.

411
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,580
What's going on?

412
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,580
Well, after I came back,

413
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,580
I had a meeting with the provincial committee.

414
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,580
I passed the history,

415
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,580
the region, and the moral of the street.

416
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,580
I also made the specific steps.

417
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,580
I think tomorrow when I get to work,

418
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,580
I'll organize a meeting with the community.

419
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,580
Okay, thank you.

420
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,580
By the way,

421
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,580
my wife wants to ask you for a leave.

422
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,580
I think the meeting is just beginning.

423
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,580
It's not enough for me to say that.

424
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,580
I said, what's the price?

425
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,580
I'll put it on the meeting first.

426
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,580
The provincial committee also told me about this.

427
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,580
We'll have a meeting tomorrow.

428
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,580
Okay, okay.

429
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,580
Besides,

430
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,580
Xia Jie's mom

431
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,580
has no phone calls.

432
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,580
She also called me.

433
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,580
Tell me.

434
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,580
If there's nothing else, you should go home early.

435
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,580
It's been a busy day.

436
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,580
Okay, don't worry.

437
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,580
I'll be there soon.

438
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,580
I'll handle the number of the day.

439
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,580
Okay, thank you.

440
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,580
Okay, bye-bye.

441
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,580
I have a question.

442
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,580
What's the meaning of leaving the store?

443
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,580
Nothing.

444
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,580
What's the meaning of leaving the store?

445
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,580
When you left the store,

446
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,580
did you find any suspicious people?

447
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,580
You have to think it through.

448
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,580
You're the last one to leave.

449
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,580
Your boss came to report yesterday morning.

450
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:52,580
And your door is not damaged.

451
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:55,580
Comrade the police, I really don't know anything.

452
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,580
I haven't been to school for a few days,

453
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,580
but I know that stealing things is for the labor.

454
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,580
Besides, our boss is very nice to me.

455
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,580
How could I steal things?

456
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,580
Don't be nervous.

457
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,580
I didn't say you stole it.

458
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,580
It's just a rumor.

459
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,580
Comrade the police, I know it.

460
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,580
I really told you.

461
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,580
Who else has the keys to your store

462
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:21,580
besides you and your boss?

463
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,580
He seems to have a partner.

464
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,580
He also has a key.

465
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:29,580
But he hasn't been to the store.

466
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,580
How many days have you been in the store?

467
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,580
Two or three days.

468
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,580
I've bought all the new ones.

469
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,580
But we don't know how to press the button.

470
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,580
So I didn't press it.

471
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,580
Who else knows who else knows

472
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,580
about your store's head?

473
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,580
I don't know.

474
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,580
I haven't told anyone.

475
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,580
Comrade the police.

476
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,580
Let's go out.

477
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,580
What's up?

478
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,580
An old lady came to report that

479
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,580
she said she had a son in the store.

480
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,580
Her son went to look for her.

481
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,580
No one else.

482
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,580
Brother Chen, Li Dawei, Qi, and Xiao Lei are all outside.

483
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,580
There was a police officer just now.

484
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,580
He took the two of them to the police station.

485
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,580
Who's in charge of the police station?

486
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,580
Who's the social worker?

487
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,580
The police officer.

488
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,580
Where's he?

489
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,580
He's in the hospital.

490
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,580
Okay, I'll go and check.

491
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,580
Look.

492
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,580
Send this person out.

493
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,580
Then make a base for his boss.

494
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,580
I'll be back in a minute.

495
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,580
Okay, tell me.

496
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,580
Let's go.

497
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,580
Liang, where are you going?

498
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,580
This phone.

499
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,580
You're making me nervous.

500
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,580
Comrade the police officer.

501
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,580
Please sit down.

502
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,580
Please sit down.

503
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,580
Please sit down.

504
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,580
Please sit down.

505
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,580
Please sit down.

506
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:49,580
What's the situation?

507
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,580
I've never been here.

508
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:54,580
I came to the store today.

509
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,580
When I opened the door,

510
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,580
I forgot to close the door.

511
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,580
I was confused.

512
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,580
I was so confused.

513
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:06,580
I realized that my son is missing.

514
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,580
He's not dead.

515
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,580
What are you doing?

516
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,580
Don't cry.

517
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,580
Is your son...

518
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,580
Is there a problem?

519
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,580
You're asking a question.

520
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,580
My son is so smart.

521
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:25,580
We're both in the same family.

522
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,580
If he's lost,

523
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,580
how can I live?

524
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,580
No, no.

525
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,580
You can drink first.

526
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,580
Don't worry.

527
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,580
We'll help you find your son.

528
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,580
Really?

529
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,580
Yes.

530
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,580
Thank you.

531
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,580
I've made the registration documents.

532
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,580
I haven't been there yet.

533
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,580
I was looking for you.

534
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,580
Mom, how old is your son?

535
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,580
He's 14.

536
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,580
14?

537
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:54,580
Can you remember his ID number?

538
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,580
Or do you have a photo?

539
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,580
I have a photo.

540
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,580
You...

541
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,580
This is his son.

542
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,580
Mom, this is your son?

543
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,580
Did you make a dog for him?

544
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,580
Now the city dog needs to be taken care of.

545
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:22,580
You have to help me find him.

546
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,580
Mom, don't worry.

547
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:28,580
We'll help you find your son.

548
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,580
Thank you.

549
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,580
But we have to make the registration documents.

550
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,580
Tell us, there's a report.

551
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,580
There's a fight at the restaurant on the third street.

552
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,580
Let's go there.

553
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,580
Or we'll be killed.

554
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,580
I'll go.

555
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,580
Good.

556
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,580
You make the registration documents for his mom.

557
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,580
Mom, fill the form first.

558
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:47,580
I'll handle your case when I'm back.

559
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,580
Okay?

560
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,580
Thank you.

561
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:50,580
Thank you.

562
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,580
Thank you.

563
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,580
I'm so worried.

564
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,580
Sorry, son.

565
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,580
Something's wrong with Sun Jie.

566
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,580
Get in.

567
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,580
Mr. Liu.

568
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,580
Hello.

569
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,580
Who reported the police?

570
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,580
Nothing.

571
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,580
What?

572
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,580
I don't know.

573
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,580
Nothing?

574
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,580
The police is here.

575
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,580
The police is here.

576
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,580
I won.

577
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,580
You're rich.

578
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,580
You two reported the police?

579
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,580
The police said

580
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,580
you have to be fair with us.

581
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,580
I said

582
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,580
as long as I report the police, the police will definitely be there.

583
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,580
He can't believe it.

584
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,580
He has to be with me.

585
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,580
I'm so angry this time.

586
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:51,580
What are you doing?

587
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,580
Mr. Liu, come back and get some wine.

588
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,580
I won't drink wine.

589
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,580
Do you know what you two are doing?

590
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,580
The police reported the police.

591
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,580
They're wasting the police resources.

592
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,580
They violated the law of the police.

593
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,580
The second rule is that

594
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:05,580
you have to pay more than 50 days for the detention.

595
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,580
You can pay 500,000 yuan for the penalty.

596
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,580
You have to pay 500,000 yuan for the detention.

597
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,580
You have to pay 500,000 yuan for the penalty.

598
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,580
Do you hear me?

599
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,580
I heard you.

600
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,580
I heard you.

601
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,580
Let's go.

602
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,580
I don't know what to do.

603
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,580
You have to leave with us.

604
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,580
What's wrong?

605
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,580
Are you two leaving with me?

606
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,580
Or are we forced to take you home?

607
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,580
We'll go with you.

608
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,580
We'll go with you.

609
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,580
Come, Khor.

610
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,580
Let's go.

611
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,580
Come, see you.

612
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,580
Hello.

613
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,580
Hello, Khor.

614
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,580
We're busy.

615
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,580
Do you need a support?

616
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,580
No, thanks.

617
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,580
I'm busy too.

618
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,580
Hello.

619
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,580
Khor.

620
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,580
What's the matter with you?

621
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,580
Do you need a support?

622
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,580
Nothing.

623
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,580
I've already handled it.

624
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,580
I'll call you later.

625
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,580
Okay.

626
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,580
Okay.

627
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,580
I'll call you later.

628
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,580
Who knows who's broken the camera in your shop?

629
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,580
I think there are many.

630
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,580
I sent a friend's message today.

631
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,580
He asked who's broken the camera in our shop.

632
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,580
Who can help me change it?

633
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,580
I don't think there are many people

634
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,580
who can help me change it.

635
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,580
Can I have a look?

636
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,580
No.

637
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,580
I'll go with you.

638
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,580
I'll go with you.

639
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,580
I'll go with you.

640
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,580
I'll go with you.

641
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,580
I'll go with you.

642
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,580
I'll go with you.

643
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,580
I'll go with you.

644
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,580
You sent a message

645
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,580
to a friend's circle the other day.

646
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,580
The shop was closed last night.

647
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,580
We're suspicious.

648
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:34,580
Someone knows that

649
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,580
your camera is broken.

650
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,580
So, you should pick

651
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,580
the time limit.

652
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,580
That's a waste.

653
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,580
So many people know.

654
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,580
What should we do?

655
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,580
This case is really a little complicated.

656
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,580
Because the daily life

657
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,580
of your shop is relatively large.

658
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,580
More than 100 people

659
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,580
have copied the paper information

660
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,580
in your shop.

661
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,580
So, you can't

662
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,580
lock the suspect

663
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,580
with paper information.

664
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,580
Plus, your shop

665
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,580
and the camera

666
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,580
are broken.

667
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,580
This case

668
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,580
is not a coincidence.

669
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,580
What should we do?

670
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,580
I lost 200,000 to 300,000 yuan.

671
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,580
I'm not easy

672
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,580
to do business as a kid.

673
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,580
Don't worry.

674
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,580
Don't worry.

675
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,580
We're investigating

676
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,580
the camera on the road nearby.

677
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,580
We hope to get

678
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,580
some useful information.

679
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,580
And,

680
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,580
I heard

681
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,580
that your partner

682
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,580
has the key to your shop, right?

683
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,580
Yes, he has.

684
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,580
Can you give us

685
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,580
his contact information?

686
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,580
We'll talk to him.

687
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,580
Okay.

688
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:32,580
Please go in.

689
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:35,580
His name is Zhang.

690
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,580
Why are you talking about it again?

691
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,580
I'm so worried

692
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,580
about the lock.

693
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:47,580
Your son was invited by the family yesterday.

694
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,580
I don't know

695
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,580
what happened today.

696
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,580
Okay, okay.

697
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,580
I'll talk to him later.

698
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,580
I'm busy.

699
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,580
I don't care.

700
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,580
You can come back later.

701
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,580
Good bye.

702
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,580
The house is messy.

703
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,580
I'm telling you.

704
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,580
Especially,

705
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,580
the elderly and the young,

706
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,580
women who have to work.

707
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,580
Really.

708
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,580
It's too hard.

709
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,580
Zhao Xiaoyun,

710
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,580
if you can't get it,

711
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,580
I can help you.

712
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,580
No, no, no.

713
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,580
Thank you.

714
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,580
Zhao Xiaoyun,

715
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,580
don't listen to my mom.

716
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,580
I really don't want to go to the emergency room.

717
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:22,580
As a police officer,

718
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,580
it's my own choice.

719
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,580
All the threats and difficulties,

720
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,580
I should face them and take responsibility.

721
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,580
Xiaodian,

722
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,580
the emergency room

723
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,580
needs to wait for the lock to be fixed.

724
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,580
But your mom is now,

725
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:36,580
she doesn't want you to go out.

726
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,580
So,

727
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,580
Cheng Suo and I,

728
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:41,580
we've decided to let you go to the joint execution.

729
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:44,580
That action is relatively safe.

730
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,580
Okay?

731
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,580
But, Zhao Xiaoyun,

732
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,580
I'm the one who's got my own life.

733
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,580
Not my mom.

734
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,580
I know.

735
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,580
Of course I know.

736
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,580
But your mom is now,

737
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:57,580
she doesn't stop calling me and Cheng Suo.

738
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,580
We also...

739
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,580
Let you go to the joint execution

740
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,580
is not because of anything else.

741
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,580
It's really because of this action.

742
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,580
It's very hard to bear.

743
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:15,580
Then, why didn't my master tell me?

744
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,580
Didn't your master promise you

745
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:23,580
not to protect you too much?

746
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,580
So, I know.

747
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,580
Xia Jie,

748
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,580
protecting your child

749
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,580
is the instinct of a mother.

750
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,580
Especially in your family,

751
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,580
this kind of special situation.

752
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,580
You have to know,

753
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,580
your mom is now,

754
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:41,580
except for you,

755
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,580
nothing else.

756
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,580
So, in this kind of situation,

757
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,580
I can understand.

758
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,580
You also need to understand her.

759
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,580
Then, I'll go first.

760
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,580
Okay.

761
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:58,580
What's up?

762
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,580
Zhang Zeyuan,

763
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,580
can I ask for a few days' leave?

764
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,580
What do you think?

765
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,580
Oh,

766
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:10,580
your business.

767
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,580
Cheng Suo told me everything.

768
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,580
We also agreed.

769
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,580
If you have any special situation,

770
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,580
who should you work with?

771
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,580
You can ask for a day's leave.

772
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,580
There's no problem in the lock.

773
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,580
But this is a long-term leave.

774
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:27,580
It's really hard to work in the lock.

775
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,580
I know it's hard.

776
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,580
I have to do it.

777
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,580
Otherwise, I won't be able to open this door.

778
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,580
I know. I know.

779
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,580
I can understand.

780
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,580
Of course, I can understand.

781
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,580
Who is not like this?

782
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,580
But now,

783
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,580
there's really not enough people in the lock.

784
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,580
Don't say it's a leave.

785
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,580
If it's not a leave,

786
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,580
I can't finish my work.

787
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:47,580
But...

788
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,580
But...

789
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,580
Don't be like that.

790
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,580
Listen, this is not your own situation.

791
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,580
I've already told this to Gao Suo and Cheng Suo.

792
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,580
When the lock is back,

793
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,580
we'll take this as an important issue,

794
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,580
and discuss it with the chairman of the office.

795
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,580
But now,

796
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:01,580
the current lock,

797
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,580
the work is important,

798
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:04,580
the time is tight,

799
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,580
the lock is not here.

800
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,580
Everyone is under a lot of pressure.

801
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:10,580
How about this?

802
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:13,580
You can join the social union and legal action first.

803
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:14,580
Then,

804
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,580
you can change your house a few days later.

805
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,580
Okay?

806
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,580
Okay.

807
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,580
Thank you.

808
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,580
Come, go.

809
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,580
What's wrong?

810
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,580
I've already told the company.

811
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,580
The company agreed to come back.

812
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,580
I'll be back tomorrow.

813
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,580
I've already bought the tickets.

814
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,580
Really?

815
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:42,580
That's great.

816
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,580
Thank you, husband.

817
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:46,580
What thank you?

818
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,580
I just called home.

819
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,580
Mom told me

820
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,580
that dad went to the hospital alone.

821
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:53,580
You should hurry and find him.

822
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,580
Let me go first.

823
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,580
Just now,

824
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,580
my colleague came to ask for a leave.

825
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,580
I've already told him to go back.

826
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,580
I can't go.

827
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,580
I can't go.

828
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,580
I can't be a human being.

829
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:06,580
Is it important to be a human or our dad's life?

830
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,580
Okay, okay, my boy.

831
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,580
I didn't mean that.

832
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,580
I didn't mean that.

833
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,580
Now, there are hundreds of people in the company.

834
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,580
There are hundreds of thousands of people in the company.

835
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,580
Can you understand me

836
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,580
in this way?

837
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,580
I understand.

838
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,580
I didn't tell you that

839
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,580
I can come back tomorrow.

840
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,580
But the problem is

841
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,580
the elderly ate a few meals.

842
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,580
You...

843
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,580
I know.

844
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,580
Okay, okay.

845
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,580
I'll hang up.

846
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,580
I'll hang up.

847
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,580
Comrade, let me tell you something.

848
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,580
Later,

849
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:47,580
my master Zhang Zijie will lead a team.

850
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,580
My wife will lead a team.

851
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,580
I will lead a team.

852
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,580
Our instructor will lead a team.

853
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:53,580
The main thing is to cooperate with the community.

854
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,580
We demand that you obey the command and stop the command.

855
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,580
Do you understand?

856
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,580
Yes, sir.

857
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,580
Instructor,

858
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,580
let's go.

859
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,580
Let's go.

860
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,580
Let's go.

861
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,580
Instructor, what are you looking for?

862
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,580
Looking for you.

863
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,580
Looking for me?

864
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:08,580
I...

865
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,580
I'm standing in front of you.

866
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,580
Wang just called.

867
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,580
He said he was afraid that he would go to the hospital alone.

868
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,580
You go to the hospital.

869
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,580
I'll lead a team.

870
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,580
Can you do that?

871
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:20,580
Isn't it just a matter of cleanliness?

872
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,580
There is Wang.

873
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,580
There should be no problem.

874
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,580
Go, go.

875
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,580
Thank you.

876
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,580
I'll go to the hospital and have a look.

877
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,580
I'll be back soon.

878
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,580
Go, go.

879
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,580
Thank you.

880
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,580
I'll go now.

881
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,580
Wait for me outside.

882
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,580
I'll get the equipment.

883
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,580
Okay.

884
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,580
By the way,

885
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,580
the community is now

886
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,580
running a lot of people.

887
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,580
Let's start.

888
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,580
Let's go.

889
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,580
Your village

890
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,580
has a lot of people running the community.

891
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,580
Do many households

892
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,580
rent out the houses?

893
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:52,580
Yes.

894
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,580
And the people who live here

895
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,580
don't have access to the toilet.

896
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,580
This is the rule of law.

897
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,580
Both of you will live here.

898
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,580
Of course.

899
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,580
Yes.

900
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,580
Otherwise, the security committee

901
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,580
will be very big.

902
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,580
Yes, like the government.

903
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,580
We have to

904
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,580
register the admission of the EZF now.

905
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,580
Okay.

906
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:07,580
Wang,

907
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,580
this is the position.

908
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,580
Why don't you start from here?

909
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:11,580
We will be in charge of this.

910
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,580
Okay.

911
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,580
These houses are very clean.

912
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,580
It's not a big deal.

913
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:17,580
There are three rooms.

914
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,580
You can't break them.

915
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,580
You can't listen to them.

916
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,580
Okay.

917
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,580
Take off your shoes.

918
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,580
It's clear.

919
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,580
It's not good.

920
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,580
And these plants are so dirty.

921
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,580
Clean it up.

922
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,580
Clean it up.

923
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,580
You can't just say yes.

924
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,580
You can check it later.

925
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,580
If it's still like this,

926
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,580
we will have to do it.

927
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,580
Okay.

928
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,580
You will be in charge of it.

929
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,580
Okay.

930
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:46,580
Okay.

931
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:48,580
It's open.

932
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,580
After that,

933
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,580
you can make the room.

934
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,580
We will do it in half a day.

935
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,580
We will do it in a while.

936
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:53,580
Okay.

937
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,580
Let's check this house first.

938
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,580
Is there anyone?

939
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,580
Yes.

940
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:13,580
Is there anyone?

941
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,580
Master.

942
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:16,580
Master.

943
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:25,580
What's going on?

944
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,580
I am...

945
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,580
I am...

946
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,580
I am...

947
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,580
I am...

948
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,580
I am...

949
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,580
I am...

950
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,580
I am...

951
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,580
I am the resident of the Paris Pavilion.

952
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,580
My name is Zhao Jiwei.

953
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,580
This is Wang Fujin.

954
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,580
Are you Mr. Lu Fugui?

955
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:52,580
Yes.

956
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,580
Why are you here?

957
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:56,580
We are here to

958
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,580
find out the safety and safety

959
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:59,580
and clean up the illegal properties

960
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,580
and check the identity.

961
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:02,580
Your identity is expired.

962
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,580
You need to re-enact it.

963
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:05,580
I am...

964
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,580
a safety and safety person.

965
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,580
People are dead.

966
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,580
They haven't burned yet.

967
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,580
They are illegal residents.

968
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,580
Master.

969
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,580
You are so funny.

970
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,580
I said I should stop

971
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,580
your identity.

972
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,580
I didn't say anything else.

973
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,580
I am dying.

974
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,580
Why should I stop my identity?

975
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,580
What's the use?

976
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:27,580
Master.

977
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,580
You are more than 70 years old.

978
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:30,580
You are still young.

979
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:36,580
No one has ever cared about me.

980
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,580
What about your children?

981
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,580
They are all married.

982
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,580
They don't care about me.

983
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,580
They just leave you here

984
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:56,580
alone.

985
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,580
It's too much.

986
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,580
Don't worry.

987
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,580
I will call them

988
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,580
and ask them to come to see you.

989
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,580
Master.

990
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,580
Have you eaten?

991
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,580
Yes.

992
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,580
I have been hungry for 49 days.

993
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,580
Really?

994
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,580
Yes.

995
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,580
If it's true,

996
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,580
what I am talking to you is a ghost.

997
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,580
Is it Lu Changsheng?

998
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,580
Mr. Wu.

999
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:33,580
Yesterday,

1000
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,580
I promised you

1001
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,580
to attend the school meeting.

1002
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,580
But I am sorry.

1003
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,580
I am in the hospital now.

1004
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:42,580
I really can't go today.

1005
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,580
How about this?

1006
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,580
I will

1007
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:46,580
come to the school

1008
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,580
and talk to you

1009
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,580
on the spot.

1010
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:49,580
Okay?

1011
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,580
Cong Cong,

1012
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:52,580
I don't need you to look for me.

1013
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:53,580
Every student

1014
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,580
will attend the school meeting.

1015
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,580
It's a responsibility.

1016
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:58,580
Your mother

1017
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,580
has not attended the school meeting for three times.

1018
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,580
Look.

1019
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,580
It's a big deal

1020
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,580
for you to do this.

1021
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:04,580
I am also

1022
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:05,580
glad to remind you.

1023
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,580
No matter what,

1024
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:07,580
you can't just

1025
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:08,580
teach the child.

1026
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:10,580
I really don't have any bad habits.

1027
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:12,580
You know,

1028
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:13,580
I have a lot of problems.

1029
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:14,580
I am 23.

1030
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:15,580
I will pay for it.

1031
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:16,580
Li Ye,

1032
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:17,580
Li Ye,

1033
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,580
call us.

1034
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,580
Mr. Wu,

1035
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:21,580
I will not talk to you.

1036
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,580
I will call you back.

1037
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,580
Don't call.

1038
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,580
I apologize to you as a friend.

1039
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:26,580
Okay?

1040
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:27,580
Then I will hang up.

1041
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,580
23, 23.

1042
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:32,580
Coming.

1043
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:35,580
23.

1044
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:36,580
Okay.

1045
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:38,580
Open the door.

1046
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,580
The police.

1047
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,580
Someone is coming.

1048
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:45,580
Call the police.

1049
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:46,580
Someone is coming.

1050
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:47,580
Open the door.

1051
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,580
Police.

1052
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:52,580
If you don't open the door,

1053
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,580
you will break the door.

1054
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,580
What are you doing?

1055
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,580
What are you doing?

1056
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,580
Why did you break my door?

1057
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,580
Why did I do that?

1058
00:37:58,580 --> 00:37:59,580
Calm down.

1059
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:00,580
Calm down.

1060
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:01,580
I can't do this.

1061
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,580
If you stay here,

1062
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,580
you will be punished.

1063
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:04,580
You are bullying the teacher.

1064
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,580
You bully the teacher.

1065
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:14,580
Mr. Zhang.

1066
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:17,580
You are back.

1067
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:23,580
Why are you so late?

1068
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,580
Where did you come from?

1069
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,580
I just came back from the community.

1070
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,580
Why are you so late?

1071
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:32,580
Some people like to play games with you.

1072
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,580
They are so annoying.

1073
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:34,580
They are hiding in the morning.

1074
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,580
They have to go home and sleep at night.

1075
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,580
Director Zhang.

1076
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:39,580
We still have a chance.

1077
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:40,580
You have worked hard.

1078
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,580
We are not so busy.

1079
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:42,580
But the chief is here.

1080
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,580
It's a big deal.

1081
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,580
I thought you are the deputy chief.

1082
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,580
You can come back.

1083
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,580
What do you mean?

1084
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,580
I will come back.

1085
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,580
You are almost 70 years old.

1086
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,580
You are fighting with me.

1087
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:54,580
I can't stop you.

1088
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,580
Right?

1089
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,580
Mr. Zhang.

1090
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,580
His family has a safe place.

1091
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,580
Why don't you let him go?

1092
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:00,580
Yes.

1093
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,580
If you think you are a good man,

1094
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:04,580
I will not let you go.

1095
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:05,580
Come back.

1096
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:06,580
My wife.

1097
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:07,580
You are back.

1098
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:08,580
My wife.

1099
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,580
You...

1100
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:11,580
Mr. Zhang.

1101
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,580
Why are you back so soon?

1102
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,580
Of course I am back.

1103
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,580
What's wrong?

1104
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:18,580
My wife can't touch me now.

1105
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:20,580
She is so unkind.

1106
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:21,580
She can't even find a way out.

1107
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,580
What's wrong?

1108
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:24,580
It's a joint operation.

1109
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:26,580
There is an old lady named Zhang.

1110
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,580
She is the man of the village.

1111
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:31,580
According to the report,

1112
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,580
there are suspicious people in her house.

1113
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:36,580
Her wife went to the door to check the safety footage.

1114
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,580
She started to hit the door.

1115
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:39,580
I just met her.

1116
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:40,580
I thought that

1117
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:41,580
I was her wife.

1118
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,580
Let's avoid it.

1119
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,580
Don't make a fuss.

1120
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,580
She was so angry at me.

1121
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:48,580
I just told her to come back.

1122
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:49,580
Yes.

1123
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:50,580
She came back to Zhang.

1124
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,580
What's wrong with her?

1125
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:54,580
She is stressed.

1126
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:55,580
No, Xiaoliu.

1127
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,580
Who is not stressed?

1128
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:58,580
We are all in the same boat.

1129
00:39:58,580 --> 00:39:59,580
Who is not stressed?

1130
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:00,580
Gao Suo.

1131
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,580
Gao Suo.

1132
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,580
I'll tell you.

1133
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:06,580
Okay.

1134
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:07,580
I'll go talk to her.

1135
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,580
I'll go talk to her.

1136
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:13,580
It's okay.

1137
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,580
It's okay.

1138
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:29,580
My dear.

1139
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,580
I just called you.

1140
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:35,580
Listen to me.

1141
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:39,580
You are right.

1142
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,580
You are right.

1143
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:49,580
Hello.

1144
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,580
Your phone is on the phone.

1145
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,580
Please call me.

1146
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,580
Hello.

1147
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,580
Are you calling the director?

1148
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,580
Mom.

1149
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,580
Are you forcing me

1150
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:05,580
to break your relationship with you?

1151
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,580
Mom.

1152
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:09,580
Are you calling the director?

1153
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:14,580
Mom.

1154
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,580
Are you forcing me

1155
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,580
to break your relationship with you?

1156
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,580
I'll tell her to call you.

1157
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:39,580
If you want to bully your father,

1158
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,580
you have to take the legal responsibility.

1159
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:48,580
Don't sleep.

1160
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:49,580
Why are you here?

1161
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,580
I think

1162
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:58,580
I'm here.

1163
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,580
I'm here.

1164
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:02,580
I'm here.

1165
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:04,580
It seems

1166
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:06,580
my mom is still in the house.

1167
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:10,580
It's useless.

1168
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:12,580
Just a dead horse.

1169
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:13,580
That's right.

1170
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,580
It's not appropriate for you to be in a relationship.

1171
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:34,580
You are still here.

1172
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:37,580
I was killed by you.

1173
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,580
Why are you here now?

1174
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:54,580
I'm here.

1175
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,580
Mom.

1176
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:07,580
Why are you here?

1177
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:09,580
Are you here to talk about

1178
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:10,580
the exchange of the money?

1179
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:12,580
Or are you here to do my job?

1180
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:15,580
No.

1181
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:18,580
I'm here to tell you

1182
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:22,580
about the matter between me and master.

1183
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:34,580
I've asked a few questions.

1184
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:39,580
The hot line

1185
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:44,580
is warm.

1186
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:49,580
The shadow of the wind

1187
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:54,580
is chasing the moon.

1188
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:59,580
I chose to compromise.

1189
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:03,580
I'm here to hug you.

1190
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:13,580
I'm here to smile.

1191
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:23,580
I'm here to tell you

1192
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:26,580
why this is the moment

1193
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:29,580
when a future has long been

1194
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:32,580
like a safer place

1195
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:41,580
I am seeing

1196
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:47,080
and every day

1197
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:52,580
will be radius

1198
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:29,580
I will not open my eyes

1199
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:35,580
I will not go back to you

1200
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:43,580
I will not run away

1201
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:47,580
I run towards you
