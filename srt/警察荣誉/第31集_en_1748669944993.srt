1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I

5
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I

6
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Why are you here?

7
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Are you here to talk about the exchange of the street?

8
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Or to do my work

9
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Not at all

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm here to tell you

11
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
About the matter between me and master

12
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
That's nothing to say

13
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You go

14
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Why are you still in bed

15
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Master, I

16
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Master

17
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm here to confess to you

18
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And also to confess to you

19
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
When I faced with Han Fei

20
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I was really scared

21
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
My feet were like on the ground

22
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I couldn't even buy a cloth

23
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I was really scared

24
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I was soft on the moment I went to the hospital

25
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And then

26
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I didn't have the courage to say these

27
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
What's the use of saying these?

28
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I know it's useless

29
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I know it's useless, but I'm silent

30
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You always think I'm guilty

31
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Actually, I know very well

32
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm sorry, master

33
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm sorry to you

34
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm sorry to Xiao Jie

35
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I feel

36
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm so sorry

37
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm so sorry

38
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm sorry

39
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
But

40
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I never had the courage to admit to anyone

41
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
To admit that I'm a coward

42
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Yes

43
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm a coward

44
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You

45
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Director

46
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I have something to do

47
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What?

48
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Okay, I'll be right back

49
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Master

50
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I have something to do

51
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I have to go back

52
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What is it? Is it Xiao Jie?

53
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
No, no, no

54
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You think too much

55
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's not Xiao Jie

56
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Master

57
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Whether you're willing to admit it or not

58
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm Xiao Jie's master now

59
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I will protect her in the future

60
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
But

61
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
This kind of protection

62
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Must be in your Xiao Jie's will

63
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Respect her for the future

64
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
No need to come to teach me

65
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm not teaching you

66
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I don't have the right

67
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Actually, I came today

68
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Just want to spend a good time with the past

69
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I have a great courage

70
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I finally said it

71
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I finally did it today

72
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
So many years of pressure

73
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
See you

74
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Master, I won't say more

75
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Take care

76
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Master

77
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Right

78
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Right, Master

79
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
There's another sentence

80
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I hope you can try

81
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
To spend a good time with the past

82
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Master

83
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Hello, Mr. Yang

84
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Don't worry

85
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
We will quickly organize the book

86
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Report to the general bureau

87
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Ok

88
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Goodbye

89
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Goodbye

90
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Goodbye

91
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
What happened?

92
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Go back to the meeting room

93
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Director

94
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
This is my responsibility

95
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It has nothing to do with telling me

96
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Just deal with me

97
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
What are you talking about?

98
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I asked you to investigate

99
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
What responsibility do you have?

100
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Don't argue with each other

101
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
This is not a good thing

102
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
All conclusions are decided by the bureau

103
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Let's be honest and realistic

104
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Explain the situation well

105
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
What exactly happened?

106
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
The joint operation

107
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
The old lady who was 70 years old

108
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
who didn't let us in

109
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Didn't the high schooler stop the fight

110
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Then she found that

111
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
there was a problem in their house

112
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Who would have thought that they had a tenant

113
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
She knew that we would be late

114
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
and moved to the new street

115
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
She hid the pipe

116
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I don't know what happened

117
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
during the move

118
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
She just lived in the new street

119
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
The pipe was blown

120
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
blown?

121
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Someone was born

122
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
No

123
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
The whole thing was a big crime

124
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
The security of the police

125
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
The security of the police

126
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
and the property of the tenant

127
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
The bureau and the deputy director of the police

128
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
were directly in charge

129
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
The new deputy director

130
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
was directly in charge

131
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And he said

132
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
that the next time

133
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
maybe the deputy director will be free

134
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's because

135
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
we were in charge

136
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Yes

137
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
During the interrogation

138
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
the suspect was in the act

139
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
The new deputy director was a little wrong

140
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
He thought that we didn't

141
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
investigate and deal with the security

142
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
He threw the security

143
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
into their side

144
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
and caused the security accident

145
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I don't know who

146
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
went to the bureau

147
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
The bureau's investigation

148
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
came down to understand the situation

149
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Enough

150
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Let's not talk about

151
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
the result

152
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I have to ask someone

153
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
to take my responsibility

154
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Gao Suo

155
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's my responsibility

156
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I should investigate it

157
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Don't argue with me

158
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
What about me?

159
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I just want to get away from the police

160
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I can't ask the family

161
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I just want to get away from here

162
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
and fulfill my duty

163
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
What did you say?

164
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
My wife

165
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
My wife

166
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
What?

167
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What did you do to her?

168
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'll go

169
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Gao Suo

170
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Sit down

171
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
We need to discuss this

172
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
What?

173
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You can discuss it

174
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
and it will affect the decision

175
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
We have to make it clear

176
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Let's go

177
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Come

178
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Let's talk

179
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Let's talk

180
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Why are you still not home?

181
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I told you

182
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm working overtime

183
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You said I

184
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Don't make it so late

185
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Go back and rest

186
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm a good cook

187
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'll finish the work today

188
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
They'll be fine

189
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
tomorrow

190
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
How about this?

191
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Tell me how to get in

192
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Go back

193
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
There's no emergency

194
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You need to rest

195
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm fine

196
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I'm a good cook

197
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
But you're different

198
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You're here again, Mr. Zhao

199
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Wrong

200
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Actually

201
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It's what I like

202
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I won't feel bitter

203
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
That's right

204
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I heard that

205
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Auntie is looking for her boss

206
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
She wants to get in

207
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
So I want to finish this

208
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
and check my mom's changes

209
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'll catch the opportunity

210
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
and open it

211
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You should teach me how to get in

212
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Go back early

213
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'm almost done

214
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Okay, I'll leave you here

215
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Okay

216
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I heard that

217
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Gao Su might be immune

218
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Why is she so busy?

219
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I think Gao Su

220
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
is fine

221
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Yes

222
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
He's still in the lab

223
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'll try

224
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
We were at the next door

225
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Next door

226
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
We can't go there

227
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
We'll be late

228
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'll go back to the office

229
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
We'll be late

230
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'll go back to the office

231
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'll go back to the office

232
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Next door

233
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
What's next door?

234
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
The interrogation room

235
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Do you know what the interrogation room is for?

236
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
The interrogation room is for

237
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
investigating and understanding

238
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
the person involved in the case

239
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
and the person in the case

240
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
And the interrogation room

241
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
is this room

242
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Why do you want to make this kind of chair?

243
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
This chair is made by a suspect

244
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
If we

245
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
don't get the evidence

246
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
of your crime

247
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
what will we do?

248
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Will I be

249
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
arrested or detained?

250
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I don't think so

251
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I'll judge by the law

252
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
But

253
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I'll make it clear

254
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
If you can tell the truth

255
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
about the situation

256
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
and the situation

257
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
that will be

258
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
for you to be arrested

259
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
or executed

260
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
there must be a good place

261
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I didn't do anything

262
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I earned money by myself

263
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I don't think I can

264
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
pay my own money

265
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
You're not just a criminal

266
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You've already committed a crime

267
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Let me tell you

268
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
All the income in your shop

269
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
belongs to your company's assets

270
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
not your personal assets

271
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Plus

272
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
you came to the police station

273
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
to report the crime

274
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
We can keep you

275
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And

276
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
what's your name?

277
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
The duty of the person

278
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
We're going to

279
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
hand you over to the police

280
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Think about it

281
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
What else can you say?

282
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I earned money by myself

283
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
This shop started from

284
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
finding the money

285
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
and then finding the equipment

286
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I earned every single cent

287
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I made it

288
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I thought of changing the place

289
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
and finding the staff

290
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I didn't do anything

291
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I didn't do anything

292
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Why?

293
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I earned money by myself

294
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
What did I do?

295
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
The case of the crime

296
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
and the crime

297
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
has been settled

298
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
We'll have a discussion

299
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
here today

300
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
We'll report it to the police

301
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Take a closer look

302
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
and see if there's anything else

303
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'll make a statement

304
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I'll take responsibility

305
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
for the decision

306
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I've been in charge

307
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
for the past two or three days

308
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
How can I tell you?

309
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It's all right

310
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You two are starting again

311
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Listen to the people

312
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Take a closer look

313
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
and see if there's anything wrong

314
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Something wrong

315
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Chief, why are you back?

316
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Chief, you're back

317
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Chief, why are you back?

318
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Are you all right?

319
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Sit down

320
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Sit down

321
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Qi Zun

322
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
This is your report

323
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
You're back

324
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
You got the medical certificate

325
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Why didn't you tell me?

326
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
This time, you checked

327
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
the medical certificate

328
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
and found out

329
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I've been a doctor

330
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I'm sick

331
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I'm not ashamed

332
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm not ashamed

333
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
of any disease

334
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Besides, you got this disease

335
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
because of the bad life

336
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
and bad rest

337
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
and a lot of stress

338
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm not used to it

339
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'm not aware of

340
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
this

341
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
We're a family

342
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
We work overtime

343
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
and we're all late

344
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
We're all busy

345
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
and we're all

346
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
negative

347
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
So, we're under a lot of stress

348
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
and we're all tired

349
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
We must focus on this

350
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
and reduce the work

351
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
of the overtime

352
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
We must have a strong

353
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
body and a healthy mind

354
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
to serve the people

355
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Qi Zun

356
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
You're so excited

357
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Look, your eyes are red

358
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
You're excited

359
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It's okay

360
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
It's okay

361
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Well

362
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I'll talk about

363
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
the explosion of the joint treatment

364
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
and the sudden release

365
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
in this time

366
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
In a good way

367
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
It's because

368
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
the joint treatment

369
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
has prevented the safety

370
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
of the bigger and more unobtrusive

371
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
In a bad way

372
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
we have to work

373
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
We must be self-sufficient

374
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
This way, we can do

375
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
better

376
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
This matter

377
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
hasn't been settled yet

378
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
But the director

379
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
thinks it's a mistake

380
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
If there's any

381
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
consequences, I'll take the responsibility

382
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Director

383
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
How could you take the responsibility

384
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I didn't take the responsibility

385
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I should take the responsibility

386
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
What are you talking about

387
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
You're on my side

388
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I'll take the responsibility

389
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
No, director

390
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Director, you're back

391
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
You can take the project

392
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
by yourself

393
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Don't make a fuss

394
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
You can take the project

395
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
and the project

396
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
You can do it

397
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I'll take the responsibility

398
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
But the director

399
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
said he had a rest

400
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
He's the one who's in charge

401
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Director, you're back

402
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
It's great

403
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
You're back

404
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I've decided

405
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
You're our main focus

406
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Don't take the blame

407
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Director said it's our new project

408
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I understand

409
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Really

410
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Qi Zi

411
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
We're having a meeting

412
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
with the leaders

413
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I'll give you a few days' leave

414
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
You have to go back and rest

415
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
No, I'm stressed

416
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
You go back first

417
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Jiu Jie

418
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Don't sit down, you're also practicing

419
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I have something to do

420
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I have to go

421
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Jiu Jie

422
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
What's up?

423
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Master, you went to my house yesterday

424
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Yes, I went

425
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
yesterday

426
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I went to

427
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
to talk to your mother

428
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
about your mother

429
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
to have a meeting

430
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
and a confession

431
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
At the moment when your father passed away

432
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I was in a hurry

433
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I was really

434
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
scared

435
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I didn't get hurt

436
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I didn't save him

437
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
So I'm responsible

438
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
for your father's sacrifice

439
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Master

440
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Who are you talking about?

441
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Who's not scared at the moment?

442
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Besides, even if you really get in

443
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
you can save my father

444
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
At least I should try

445
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Master

446
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
You don't have to blame yourself

447
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
No one is a bad person

448
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I didn't want to be a bad person

449
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I just want

450
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
to talk to you

451
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
to face

452
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
to be honest

453
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I remember

454
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Why do you remember?

455
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I didn't want to teach you

456
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I just

457
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
wanted to see my own feelings

458
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I didn't say you were teaching me

459
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I also think

460
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I don't need to try

461
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
compared to

462
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
doing every little thing

463
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
and doing chores

464
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
How can we say this?

465
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
What's the matter?

466
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I found my mother's

467
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
change yesterday

468
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
What change?

469
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I just feel

470
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
she didn't chase me

471
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I saw Guo Lan

472
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
and she said you were here

473
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I chased her for a few times

474
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
and she had a change

475
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
She sent me out this morning

476
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
and she didn't force me

477
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
That's good

478
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Miss, don't worry

479
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Don't be anxious

480
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I found out

481
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
as long as I accept my mother

482
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I'm not that anxious

483
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Sister

484
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Sister

485
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Sister

486
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I'm your sister

487
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Sister

488
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
You're not at home

489
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
You're not at home

490
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I'm leaving

491
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I'm telling you

492
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
We've had a few nights

493
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
We're going shopping today

494
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
We opened a big mall

495
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
We had food, drinks, and fun

496
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
It's so interesting

497
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
You guys go

498
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I'll go

499
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I'm leaving

500
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I'm leaving

501
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Sister, don't say that

502
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I'll come down

503
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
No

504
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I'm leaving

505
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I'm leaving

506
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Come

507
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Come

508
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Let's go

509
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Let's go

510
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Let's go

511
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
We're going

512
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
We're going

513
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Let's go

514
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
We're going

515
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
We're going

516
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,400
Look, you all danced smoothly.

517
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,400
You still don't know.

518
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,400
What did you say?

519
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,200
You danced smoothly.

520
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,300
I danced...

521
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,400
Okay, okay, okay.

522
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,400
You danced smoothly, let me see.

523
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,100
Come, let's do another one.

524
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,100
Let's not dance. Let's dance ourselves.

525
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,100
Let's dance, let's not dance.

526
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Let's dance.

527
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,800
Sister, do you want to dance?

528
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,400
I don't want to dance.

529
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,200
I just want to tell you,

530
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,100
the time I was young,

531
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,600
I danced with Xia Jie's father.

532
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,400
But I won the prize in the airport dance.

533
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,600
Okay, then you treat me as Xia Jie's father.

534
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,800
Let's dance. Come, we can't dance here.

535
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,800
We can't dance here.

536
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,400
Why can't we dance?

537
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,000
Come, let's take it up.

538
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Let me show you.

539
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,600
Let me see you.

540
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,000
We have a place to dance.

541
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,800
How can I dance without music?

542
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,200
Come, let's dance.

543
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,200
Let's see my sister dance.

544
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,200
Let's dance.

545
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,200
Let's dance.

546
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,800
Let's dance.

547
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,200
Let's dance.

548
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,200
Xia Ye.

549
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,200
Please enjoy.

550
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,000
Sister, I've already said it.

551
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,200
It's okay to talk casually.

552
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,200
I heard that there are all girls now.

553
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,600
Everyone has already decided.

554
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,600
You can have a good talk with me.

555
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,600
Don't worry.

556
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,600
Here you are.

557
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,800
Sorry, I'm late.

558
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,000
Let me introduce you.

559
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,600
This is Sister Xu.

560
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,200
Xia Jie's colleague's mother.

561
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,400
We've been together for a long time.

562
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:17,400
Today, I'm just passing by your unit.

563
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,200
Hello, hello.

564
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,200
Hello, Liao. My name is Xu Cui Ping.

565
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,600
I'm Liang Xiang Zhi.

566
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,600
Hello, hello.

567
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,800
Sit down, big brother.

568
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,800
Sit down.

569
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,800
Sit down, sister.

570
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,600
Here.

571
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,600
It's okay, sisterぎ Ethan.

572
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,600
prettier.

573
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,280
Big brother, please make yourself at home.

574
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,800
Okay, I'm sorry.

575
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,800
Thank you, impacted call back.

576
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,000
Does it fit?

577
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:52,300
You don't need to lift a pot.

578
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,300
We were going to eat together.

579
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,300
No, no, don't like eating together.

580
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,340
Don't continue, mom.

581
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:12,580
You're...

582
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,020
quite good.

583
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,900
I've never seen you when we're apart.

584
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,180
You're still thinking of me?

585
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:23,900
Don't be like that.

586
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:25,980
So...

587
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,540
what about Dalin?

588
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,500
Are you looking for you?

589
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,500
If you don't want me to look for you, then I won't.

590
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,500
Then you are...

591
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,700
Okay, I won't say it.

592
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,300
He is a big mouth.

593
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:41,900
Old Liang.

594
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:42,900
Thank you.

595
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,500
Old Liang, I don't know what you like to drink.

596
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,500
I ordered two.

597
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,500
Okay, okay.

598
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,300
Look at my temper.

599
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,900
I forgot about my work.

600
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,300
You sit here and talk.

601
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,300
I'll go first.

602
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,300
Then you go first.

603
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,700
Big Brother, you sit.

604
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:08,900
I'm going.

605
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,500
Take care.

606
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,300
Who is he?

607
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,500
He is crazy.

608
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,300
He is a crazy patient.

609
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:28,900
Come.

610
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,900
How are you?

611
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,300
I heard you have someone.

612
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,100
It's been so many years.

613
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:46,900
Then you don't know my heart?

614
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:48,900
Xiao Zhi.

615
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:49,900
Where is he?

616
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,900
Why are you here by car?

617
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,900
Xiao Jie is busy.

618
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,900
I didn't ask him to send me.

619
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:04,900
I thought that you can take a taxi.

620
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,900
We also called the police.

621
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:07,900
We are private business.

622
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,900
Why did you call the police?

623
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,900
I thought that you can take a taxi.

624
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:12,900
I thought that you can take a taxi.

625
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:13,900
I thought that you can take a taxi.

626
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,900
I thought that you can take a taxi.

627
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:15,900
We are private business.

628
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,900
Why did you call the police?

629
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:18,900
Yes.

630
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,900
Come on.

631
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:24,900
By the way,

632
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:26,900
I an experienced warehouse.

633
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,900
Are you okay?

634
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:29,900
If you are okay,

635
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:30,900
then I am.

636
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:35,900
Of course I'm fine.

637
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,900
I think so.

638
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,900
I will go back to the first line the next day after.

639
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,300
When you have time, you can take a break.

640
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,900
I'll take you to the market to play.

641
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,900
I'll go with you wherever you go.

642
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,900
This way.

643
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,900
The End

644
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,500
Report.

645
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,900
Come in.

646
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,500
Chief, you want to see me?

647
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,100
Xiao Jie.

648
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:45,700
The little prince of Hu Ji Ke is about to leave.

649
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,300
Hu Ji Ke is his official name.

650
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,700
The rest are all the family members.

651
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:54,300
So, I've decided to take you to Hu Ji Ke

652
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,300
and take you to the house of the little prince.

653
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:01,300
Chief, I've already told my mom.

654
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,300
My mom also recognized my idea.

655
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,700
I said I don't want to go to Hu Ji Ke.

656
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,700
She promised that I wouldn't interfere.

657
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,300
I didn't tell my master about this.

658
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:14,500
This decision is made after all the serious consideration

659
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,500
and all the things that are happening.

660
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,500
It has nothing to do with your mom.

661
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,500
This is the final decision of the organization.

662
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,900
Then, does my master agree?

663
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:30,900
The organization must agree with your master's arrangement.

664
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,300
Yes, Chief.

665
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,700
Okay.

666
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,900
I'll take you to Hu Ji Ke now.

667
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,500
Let's get familiar with each other.

668
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,100
Let's go.

669
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,500
Here.

670
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,500
This one.

671
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,100
Xiao An.

672
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,500
Get it.

673
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:00,300
I'll bring your successor.

674
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,900
Xiao Jie, you're here. I asked you to do it.

675
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,500
Chief asked me to choose one of the women in the lock room.

676
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,100
I asked you to do it first.

677
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,900
It's safe and safe. It's good to have a good brain.

678
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,700
Hu Ji Ke is the best.

679
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,500
Thank you, Wang Jie.

680
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,500
Xiao An, are you still here for two weeks?

681
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,900
You're doing well during the two weeks.

682
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,500
I'm sure that during your production period,

683
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,300
we can't drop our work.

684
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,700
Don't worry, Chief.

685
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,500
You're like Xia Jie, a smart girl.

686
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:30,500
You don't need me to take care of you.

687
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,900
What's wrong?

688
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,700
What's wrong, Wang Jie?

689
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,300
I don't feel right.

690
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,900
Xia Jie, I'll go to the lock room.

691
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,700
Here.

692
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,500
Here.

693
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,500
It's broken. What's wrong?

694
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,900
Hurry and get me to the lock room.

695
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,900
What's wrong?

696
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,300
I'm in Yangshui Pavilion!

697
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,100
Hurry and get me to the lock room!

698
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,500
What's wrong?

699
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,300
I'm in Yangshui Pavilion, Chief.

700
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,100
What's wrong?

701
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:58,900
I'm in Yangshui Pavilion.

702
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:59,500
Get me to the lock room.

703
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,900
No, no. I can't get you to the lock room.

704
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,300
Xiao Jie, go get the medical class.

705
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,500
Okay.

706
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,300
Get her to the lock room.

707
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,100
Yes, yes.

708
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,100
Come on.

709
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,100
You go with her.

710
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,900
Help Xia Jie.

711
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,900
Come on. Be careful.

712
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,700
Hurry up.

713
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,500
Come on.

714
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,300
Slowly.

715
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,900
Be careful.

716
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:19,900
You're running away from home.

717
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,300
You need to go to the hospital. Don't worry.

718
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,500
Xia Jie.

719
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,700
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

720
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,900
Don't worry. I'll work harder.

721
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:25,900
I'm not saying anything.

722
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:26,900
You take care of the child.

723
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:27,900
You, you, you.

724
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,300
Go back.

725
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:29,700
Come on.

726
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,900
Go, go, go.

727
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,700
You think it's a coincidence?

728
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,700
You think it's a coincidence?

729
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,700
You think it's a coincidence?

730
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:40,700
You think it's a coincidence?

731
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,700
You, you, look, look.

732
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,700
Fortunately, I let you get on.

733
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:45,900
If you don't get on,

734
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,700
there's nothing big going on.

735
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,700
Right?

736
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:02,700
Xia Jie, are you really going to the emergency room?

737
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,700
What else?

738
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:04,700
I'm still in the office.

739
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,100
I can't stand the orders of the warden.

740
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:10,100
You didn't resist me.

741
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,700
That's a matter of principle.

742
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,900
This time, Wang Jia is going to give birth to a child.

743
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,100
The nurse is confirmed to be unwell.

744
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,100
This is an irreversible advantage.

745
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,500
Don't think so much.

746
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,100
Maybe it's just a job.

747
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,100
Wang Jia is still in the hospital.

748
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,900
The nurse is so boring.

749
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,500
No one is going?

750
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,900
Who is going? You go.

751
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,700
No. I don't want to see that.

752
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,500
I see Wei Wei.

753
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,500
Don't ask my dad.

754
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,900
I don't want to see him.

755
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,500
I think the social worker is a good person.

756
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,700
I don't want to see him.

757
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,500
You see him, right?

758
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,700
No one is going.

759
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:41,900
Xia Jie, go to the emergency room.

760
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,100
Try it.

761
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,700
Really hard.

762
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,500
You've grown up.

763
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,700
What's this called?

764
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:51,700
It's a different world.

765
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,700
He's so good at it.

766
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,100
It's just your culture.

767
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,900
You're a master.

768
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:57,700
You're a master in literature.

769
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,900
You're so good at it.

770
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,300
That's great.

771
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,700
Well, let me tell you something.

772
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,900
The last time I mentioned

773
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,900
the 100-day wireless theft

774
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,700
was a special event.

775
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,500
I'll emphasize a few words.

776
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,100
Our region

777
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,500
has been doing well recently.

778
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,500
It's mainly because of the promotion of education

779
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,300
and the work of the warden.

780
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,900
It's a good opportunity.

781
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,100
Some criminals

782
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,300
just want to win the ticket

783
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,700
before the Spring Festival.

784
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,700
So everyone must be careful.

785
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,700
Find out early and deal with it.

786
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,100
Fight for it.

787
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,700
Put the

788
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,100
100-day wireless theft special event

789
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,500
on a special occasion.

790
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,700
I'll give you a reward

791
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,700
when the Spring Festival comes.

792
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,100
Good.

793
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,700
What are you doing?

794
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,700
Hello, Ji Wei.

795
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,700
Someone from the new home is reporting.

796
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,700
They said they were in the house.

797
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,700
I'm sorry.

798
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,700
You're in charge of this neighborhood, right?

799
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,700
Yes, give it to me.

800
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,700
Thank you.

801
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,700
What's this?

802
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,700
This is trouble.

803
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:18,700
Xiaowan, I saw my master.

804
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:19,700
Brother Zhuang took a shot.

805
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,700
You're a criminal.

806
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,700
Someone reported the theft.

807
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,700
Can you tell me the situation?

808
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,700
Okay.

809
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,700
Look, this is the three shots.

810
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,700
Brother, this is too little.

811
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,700
How many shots did this thing say?

812
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,700
This thing is saying that it can't be collected.

813
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,700
It's not the waste of the thing.

814
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,700
This thing is so little.

815
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,700
It's really bad that people are gone.

816
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,700
That's right.

817
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,700
You said it was this.

818
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,700
This act of stealing the 100-day house is

819
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,700
not good enough.

820
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,700
But don't make any mistakes in my hands.

821
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,700
That's right.

822
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,700
Let's go.

823
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,700
Last night, the door was closed.

824
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,700
I checked everything.

825
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,700
There was nothing.

826
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,700
Everything was closed.

827
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,700
How did they come in?

828
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,700
It was so scary.

829
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,700
How did you two decide

830
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:13,700
that they were coming in?

831
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,700
You can't know that the knife was

832
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,700
from the kitchen.

833
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,700
You ran into the living room.

834
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,700
I don't know.

835
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,700
Is there anything missing in the house?

836
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,700
It's weird that it's here.

837
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,700
I checked everything.

838
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,700
Of course, we have all the things in the bedroom.

839
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,700
Did they know that someone in the bedroom

840
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,700
was a thief?

841
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,700
This is it.

842
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,700
The 11th floor is not in the control room.

843
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,700
There was a bad one before.

844
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,700
In such a small area,

845
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:25,700
there is little control.

846
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,700
There was a bad one before.

847
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,700
Are you embarrassed?

848
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,700
No.

849
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,700
Then what do you want security to do?

850
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,700
I've been here many times.

851
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:36,700
I just want you to play with your phone

852
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,700
and play with your dog.

853
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:38,700
You just don't want to see the surveillance.

854
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,700
If you have the responsibility,

855
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,700
you can push it to our police.

856
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,700
Then what do you want security to do?

857
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,700
Look, we are making some money.

858
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,700
What a nice look.

859
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,700
I didn't notice it at the beginning.

860
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,700
Until I took the child back,

861
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,700
I found a knife on the table.

862
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,700
Then I checked the room.

863
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,700
The living room was not seen.

864
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:04,700
The bedroom was not seen.

865
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,700
There are two bottles of good wine in the wine pot.

866
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:08,700
Did you knock on the door?

867
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:09,700
No.

868
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,700
The servants are here.

869
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,700
The windows are fine.

870
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,700
How many keys do you have in your house?

871
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,700
Just one of my husband and I.

872
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:19,700
Don't worry.

873
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,700
Think about it.

874
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:23,700
Have you ever lent the key to any relatives or friends?

875
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,700
No.

876
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,700
The rooms have been turned over.

877
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,700
The money was not taken before.

878
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,700
The cash and jewelry were taken.

879
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,700
By the way,

880
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,700
there are two bottles of good wine

881
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,700
in the kitchen.

882
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,700
The kitchen was taken from the kitchen

883
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,700
and the tea machine was taken.

884
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:37,700
Tell me.

885
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,700
What if we were awakened at that time?

886
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:42,700
We don't know what will happen.

887
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,700
Ji Weisheng,

888
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:44,700
tell me the truth.

889
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:45,700
Please remember.

890
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,700
Except the items that we just mentioned,

891
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,700
did you get anything else?

892
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:52,700
I don't think so.

893
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:54,700
Look.

894
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,700
It's him.

895
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,700
Master,

896
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:57,700
is he in?

897
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,700
Come closer.

898
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,700
Can you see the car?

899
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:01,700
I can't.

900
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,700
I can't see.

901
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,700
Why is the glass on the door?

902
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:19,700
Master,

903
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,700
I knew you could see it.

904
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:22,700
Look carefully.

905
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,700
When you see the street lights,

906
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,700
they will come from different directions.

907
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,700
Let's go to the living room.

908
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,700
Go to the surveillance room.

909
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:31,700
Okay.

910
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:43,700
Officer Xia.

911
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:48,700
Officer Xia,

912
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,700
what's the matter?

913
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,700
He wants to ask for a maintenance.

914
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,700
His condition

915
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,700
is in line with the condition

916
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,700
of our previous year's shopping room.

917
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:56,700
He also has enough room.

918
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,700
But this year's policy has been cancelled.

919
00:40:58,700 --> 00:40:59,700
It has been changed to

920
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,700
a major transfer of education.

921
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:02,700
The policy of this year,

922
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,700
he doesn't want to work anymore.

923
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,700
But his house was bought last year.

924
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,700
Well, Chen,

925
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:11,700
I just came here.

926
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,700
I haven't figured out the policy yet.

927
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,700
How did you deal with this problem before?

928
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,700
How did you deal with it?

929
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,700
We can't do it ourselves.

930
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:20,700
Officer Xia,

931
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:21,700
you are the only one here.

932
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,700
You have to be the one to deal with this.

933
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:29,700
Okay.

934
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:30,700
Then,

935
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:31,700
pour the water for the guest.

936
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:32,700
I'll go to the living room first.

937
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:33,700
Okay.

938
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:48,700
Sorry, Sister Wang.

939
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,700
You have a baby.

940
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,700
Okay.

941
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,700
I have something to ask you.

942
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,700
Here's the situation.

943
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:02,700
Don't worry.

944
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:05,700
I'll go to the living room.

945
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:07,700
I'll go to the living room.

946
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:08,700
Okay.

947
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:09,700
I'll go to the living room.

948
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:11,700
Okay.

949
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:13,700
Okay.

950
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:15,700
Okay.

951
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,700
This is the situation.

952
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:27,700
Sister Chen,

953
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:28,700
let me do it.

954
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:32,700
Officer Xia.

955
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:34,700
Sister Chen,

956
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:37,700
I'm not familiar with the policy of the調-tile.

957
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:38,700
But there is a principle.

958
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:39,700
I think it's all there is.

959
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,700
That's the old problem, the old way.

960
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,700
The new problem, the new way.

961
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:44,700
His house was bought last year.

962
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:45,700
The new policy of the household.

963
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,700
Then let's let him go.

964
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:48,700
Let him go?

965
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,700
No, it's not a violation of the policy.

966
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,700
I'll take responsibility for the violation of the policy.

967
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,700
The policy is changing.

968
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,700
The conditions are relaxed.

969
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:00,700
You mean the center is just one.

970
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:01,700
Expanding the city population.

971
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:03,700
Increasing the city's competitiveness.

972
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,700
Give a person who has the ability to buy a house in our town

973
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:06,700
a household.

974
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:07,700
Let him stay here for a night.

975
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:08,700
I think it's not a big deal.

976
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:09,700
Let's go.

977
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:10,700
Okay.

978
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:13,700
Here, give me the things.

979
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:14,700
Okay.

980
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:15,700
Thank you.

981
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:16,700
Thank you.

982
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:17,700
It's okay.

983
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:18,700
Wait a minute.

984
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:19,700
My daughter-in-law,

985
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:20,700
it's okay.

986
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:21,700
Wait a minute.

987
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:22,700
Okay.

988
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:14,700
Oh, oh, oh.

989
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:15,700
Oh, oh, oh.

990
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:16,700
Oh, oh, oh.

991
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:17,700
Oh, oh, oh.

00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:18,700
Oh, oh, oh.

993
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:19,700
Oh, oh, oh.

994
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:20,700
Oh, oh, oh.

995
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:21,700
Oh, oh, oh.

996
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:22,700
Oh, oh, oh.

997
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:23,700
Oh, oh, oh.

998
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:24,700
Oh, oh, oh.

999
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:25,700
Oh, oh, oh.

1000
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:26,700
Oh, oh, oh.

1001
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:27,700
Oh, oh, oh.

1002
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:28,700
Oh, oh, oh.

1003
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:29,700
Oh, oh, oh.

1004
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:30,700
Oh, oh, oh.

1005
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:31,700
Oh, oh, oh.

1006
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:32,700
Oh, oh, oh.

1007
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:33,700
Oh, oh, oh.

1008
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:34,700
Oh, oh, oh.

1009
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:35,700
Oh, oh, oh.

1010
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:36,700
Oh, oh, oh.

1011
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:37,700
Oh, oh, oh.

1012
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:38,700
Oh, oh, oh.

1013
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:39,700
Oh, oh, oh.

1014
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:40,700
Oh, oh, oh.

1015
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:41,700
Oh, oh, oh.

1016
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:42,700
Oh, oh, oh.

1017
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:43,700
Oh, oh, oh.

1018
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:44,700
Oh, oh, oh.

1019
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:45,700
Oh, oh, oh.

1020
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:46,700
Oh, oh, oh.

1021
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:47,700
Oh, oh, oh.
