1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,460
Special effects

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not sure.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not sure.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not sure.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not sure.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not sure.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not sure.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not sure.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not sure.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not sure.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not sure.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not sure.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not sure.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm not sure.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not sure.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not sure.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I got it, nothing for me.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm just scared.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm scared.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not sure.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not sure.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's locked!!

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,760
Stop!

26
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,560
Come here!

27
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,560
Come here!

28
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,200
Let go!

29
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:25,760
Hurry up!

30
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,360
Get closer!

31
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,760
Come on, master.

32
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,760
I caught him.

33
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,360
I caught him myself, master.

34
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,200
What?

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,960
Chief,

36
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,160
the crowd is coming.

37
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,960
We'll get him to the hospital.

38
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,960
Okay.

39
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,760
Get in the car.

40
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,560
Brother Zhang,

41
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,160
you see another one.

42
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,160
Let me see.

43
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,160
Yes.

44
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:12,760
Look,

45
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,160
there are more clear notes.

46
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,360
Yes, there are many.

47
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,360
And the chat record,

48
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,360
I saw it just now.

49
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,960
Did you notice?

50
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,560
All of them are in the garbage.

51
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,760
The chat is all about the price.

52
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:24,960
Brother Zhang,

53
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,760
the chat record, you guys...

54
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,160
Hey,

55
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,560
Chief,

56
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,760
how is it?

57
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,960
The data of the city is out.

58
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,760
More than 500 people are in contact.

59
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,160
Look.

60
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,360
The amount is big enough.

61
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:39,960
Okay.

62
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,760
You guys continue.

63
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,360
Okay.

64
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,160
Don't worry,

65
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,200
we don't have enough time.

66
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,360
The chat is done.

67
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,360
What?

68
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,360
Li Xiao Guang's

69
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,720
body report,

70
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,120
there's a liver disease.

71
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,120
He's sent it to the hospital.

72
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,120
What...

73
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,120
What should we do?

74
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,120
What should we do?

75
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,520
Gao Chao.

76
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,720
Speak.

77
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,520
You're giving me a headache?

78
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,320
Are you sick?

79
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,120
Listen,

80
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,520
you have to do everything you can

81
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,520
to get this guy out of here.

82
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,520
Do you hear me?

83
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,320
You have to think of a way.

84
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,160
Chief,

85
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,120
the transmission is too serious.

86
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,920
He can't do it.

87
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,360
Yes,

88
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,960
he's out of the hospital.

89
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,720
I have to find someone to send him money.

90
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:39,920
Chief,

91
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,960
you're so generous.

92
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,920
What generous?

93
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:44,920
Chief.

94
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,320
Chief.

95
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,520
Chief.

96
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,560
Chief.

97
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,320
Listen,

98
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,120
you have to work hard.

99
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,480
You and Zhijie

100
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,720
can get the list of suspects.

101
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,520
Be careful.

102
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,480
Don't let them down.

103
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,080
Okay.

104
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,560
Go and get the headband.

105
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,520
Okay.

106
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,160
Thank you.

107
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:02,760
Master.

108
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,680
I'll go too.

109
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,080
Okay.

110
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,080
Wait a minute.

111
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,080
Zhijie.

112
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,720
Chief.

113
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,920
I want to go.

114
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,760
You're so hurt.

115
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,600
You just stay at home.

116
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,360
Don't let me run.

117
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,680
Zhijie.

118
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,320
Zhijie.

119
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,520
We'll put some people first.

120
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,920
We'll split into three groups.

121
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,040
According to the list of suspects,

122
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,440
you have to split into two groups.

123
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,920
Do you remember

124
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,920
how long it has been

125
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,920
since you two stayed at the living room?

126
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,920
I have to think about it.

127
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,920
Thank you.

128
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,520
Hello.

129
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,320
Hello, Chief.

130
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:06,920
What?

131
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,320
The dirty stuff is here.

132
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,520
That's great.

133
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,520
Okay.

134
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,320
Yes.

135
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,520
Bring them back.

136
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,520
Bring them back.

137
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,760
We'll find someone

138
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,920
to help us.

139
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,320
No, Chief.

140
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,720
The boss is so stubborn.

141
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,320
He's just a cheap man.

142
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,320
He's just a cheap man.

143
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,520
Who sold this to him?

144
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,720
He can't tell.

145
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,120
You bring them back.

146
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,120
Time is up.

147
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,520
You don't have to let them go.

148
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,320
You have the suspect

149
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,120
to record his WeChat call.

150
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,320
That's too much.

151
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,320
We're just making a move.

152
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,320
He should know it's dirty.

153
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,720
But he doesn't admit it.

154
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,720
You really don't know him?

155
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,320
Fine.

156
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,920
Let the other groups

157
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,520
continue to look for the living room.

158
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,520
Okay, I got it.

159
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:06,920
What's going on?

160
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,520
Brother Su.

161
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,920
What's wrong with you?

162
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:10,920
Brother Su.

163
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,120
You two hurry up

164
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,320
and find a way to put on your mask.

165
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,520
Zhao Jiwei is caught.

166
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,120
That little thief is so violent.

167
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,720
He's already in the hospital.

168
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,120
The whole room is

169
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,920
disinfected.

170
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,320
Where's Zhao Jiwei?

171
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,520
Inside.

172
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,720
You go first.

173
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,120
Why are you standing here?

174
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,720
Zhao Jiwei.

175
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,320
Uncle Wu.

176
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,120
Did I do something wrong?

177
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,520
What are you thinking?

178
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,320
This is like our last meeting.

179
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,320
Who knows that I'm sick?

180
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,920
Don't think about it.

181
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,920
It's time to eat.

182
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,720
My stomach is hungry.

183
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,320
Let's go to the station.

184
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:00,720
Let's eat.

185
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,520
Let's eat.

186
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:01,720
Come.

187
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,120
Let's eat.

188
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,320
Come in.

189
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,920
What's wrong with you?

190
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,720
You're eating so much.

191
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,520
I can't even move this little thing.

192
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,920
What are you eating?

193
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,520
Are you stupid?

194
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,720
Who can't go with me

195
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,120
and not go with their stomach?

196
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,120
You taught me that.

197
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,320
Here.

198
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,520
Eat that.

199
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,720
There's nothing in the world.

200
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,520
It's a good meal.

201
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,320
It can't be solved.

202
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,520
If it doesn't work,

203
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,520
then eat another meal.

204
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,520
Let's eat.

205
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,920
Go ahead.

206
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,720
Don't think too much.

207
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,720
You talked about this before.

208
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,120
You said that it's our fault.

209
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,120
It's not your fault.

210
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,520
But I'm not the one who's talking.

211
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,720
He's still in a hurry.

212
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,720
Eat.

213
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,320
Go and help me get some more.

214
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,320
I'm not coming.

215
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,120
Come.

216
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,320
They're not coming?

217
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,320
They said

218
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,920
that you're the one who's in the police station.

219
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,320
You should take care of Li Siyin.

220
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,720
Come in.

221
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,320
Go and check where the police station is.

222
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,520
Please help them.

223
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,920
Let's solve the problem.

224
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:43,920
Okay.

225
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,120
I'll go.

226
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,920
But you said that it's our fault.

227
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,720
Don't talk.

228
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,720
When I wanted you to be the chief officer,

229
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,720
I went to arrest him.

230
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,720
I didn't catch him.

231
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,720
I was in a hurry.

232
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,920
Enough.

233
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,120
What's wrong with Chen Zhimeng?

234
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,320
Why did you say that?

235
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,320
He said he liked me.

236
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,320
I was wrong.

237
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,720
I shouldn't have said that.

238
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,120
You shouldn't have said that.

239
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,720
Do you have soup?

240
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,520
I'll get some soup.

241
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,520
Uncle.

242
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,720
Chief.

243
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,320
This is my fault.

244
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,320
I went to the hospital to take care of him.

245
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,720
You're so hot.

246
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,520
You're hurt.

247
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,520
I have nothing to do with this.

248
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,320
I'm the one who caused this.

249
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,120
I'll take care of him.

250
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,120
Zhao Jubei.

251
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,120
It's your turn.

252
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,120
Chief, I'll go.

253
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,920
It has nothing to do with you.

254
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,720
It's my business.

255
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,120
Have a good meal.

256
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:52,920
Chief, I'll do it.

257
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,120
You're so capable.

258
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,320
What do you think the police is?

259
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,920
Brothers?

260
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,520
You're the one who said that.

261
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,520
You're still the team member.

262
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,720
Chief.

263
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,720
He caught Xiao Tou.

264
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,920
Even if he's a little bit reckless,

265
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,920
he's not as good as Fan.

266
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,320
Did I say that he's a bad guy?

267
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,520
Did I say that?

268
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,520
I'm trying to solve this.

269
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,120
Enough.

270
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,520
Let's eat.

271
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,320
Jubei.

272
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,120
Let's eat.

273
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,920
Let's eat.

274
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,920
Hello, mom.

275
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,520
Why haven't you slept yet?

276
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,520
I've got a call.

277
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,520
I'm going to sleep.

278
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,720
I haven't got anything to do yet.

279
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,720
I'm just busy lately.

280
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,520
Chief Su is very important to me.

281
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,920
So I'm a little bit confused.

282
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,920
Mom.

283
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,920
I'm not sure if I'm doing it right.

284
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,920
I'm just a little bit confused.

285
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,920
I'm not sure.

286
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,720
Mom.

287
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,520
Take care of yourself with Auntie.

288
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,520
Auntie.

289
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:46,120
Don't leave the bamboo flute outside.

290
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,720
Leave some money for her.

291
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,720
Don't let her look down on you.

292
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,720
Yes.

293
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,720
Auntie.

294
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,720
You've changed your mind.

295
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,720
You've been working for a long time.

296
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,720
You've been working for ten dollars a month.

297
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,720
Yes.

298
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,920
I'm not sure if I'm doing it right.

299
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,720
I'm just a little bit confused.

300
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,520
Don't leave the bamboo flute outside.

301
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,120
I'm listening.

302
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,120
No.

303
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,120
I don't need money.

304
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,920
Really?

305
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,920
Yes.

306
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,920
Why do I hear you?

307
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,520
I'm afraid.

308
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,520
You're afraid?

309
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,520
I'm a little bit cold.

310
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,520
It's okay.

311
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,520
Chief Su is very caring.

312
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,520
She's also caring.

313
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,520
Okay, mom.

314
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,520
You should go to bed early.

315
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,520
Bye.

316
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,520
Bao Juewei, you're not a good boy.

317
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,520
I was waiting for you in the office.

318
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,520
Why are you back?

319
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,520
How's your hand?

320
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,520
I'll take a look.

321
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,520
It's okay.

322
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,520
Don't worry.

323
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,520
I'll take a look.

324
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,520
What are you doing?

325
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,520
I'll give you a hand.

326
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,520
Look at this.

327
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,520
It's so big.

328
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,520
Such a big wound.

329
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,520
It's so dirty.

330
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,520
Can you treat yourself better?

331
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,520
I'll disinfect it for you.

332
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,520
Don't use water for a few days.

333
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,520
It's better to use water.

334
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,520
Bear with it.

335
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,520
Do you know what to do to yourself?

336
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,520
Why is the big man still washing his nose?

337
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,520
Chief Su is a knife-made tofu.

338
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,520
Don't take it to heart.

339
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,520
I'm not doing this to make you cry.

340
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,520
Why are you crying?

341
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,520
I'm moved by you.

342
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,520
What are you doing?

343
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,520
Why are you touching a wound?

344
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,520
What's the point of touching it?

345
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,520
I'm sorry.

346
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,520
Thank you.

347
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,520
What's the point of thanking me?

348
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,520
It's more useful.

349
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,520
It's better to thank you.

350
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,520
I'm serious.

351
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,520
What are you talking about?

352
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,520
Don't be serious.

353
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,520
Stop the relationship for me.

354
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,520
And keep the safety distance.

355
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,520
Look at my nose.

356
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,520
Can I come in?

357
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,520
Yes.

358
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,520
Why are you so serious?

359
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,520
You're already here.

360
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,520
Look at you.

361
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,520
I got a nosebleed.

362
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,520
It's because of me.

363
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,520
It's because of you.

364
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,520
Chief Su, come out.

365
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,520
What?

366
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,520
I told you to come out.

367
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,520
Come out first.

368
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,520
Hurry.

369
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,520
I'll go with you.

370
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,520
Hot pot?

371
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,520
Where did it come from?

372
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,520
Xia Jie's idea.

373
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,520
I'm in line with her.

374
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,520
What do you think?

375
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,520
You two are in line.

376
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,520
Go to the supermarket together.

377
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,520
And cook together.

378
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,520
Or what?

379
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,520
Do you have any idea?

380
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,520
No idea.

381
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,520
I'll eat more.

382
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,520
Xia Jie moved here

383
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,520
specially for you.

384
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,520
I bought it from Shi Yang.

385
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,520
Okay, okay.

386
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,520
You're all done.

387
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,520
I'll eat a lot.

388
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,520
Come on.

389
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,520
I have something for you.

390
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,520
I'm the chief of the Zhao Jigui.

391
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,520
Same.

392
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,520
You can eat it.

393
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,520
Wait, Xia Jie.

394
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,520
When did you get this?

395
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,520
I've been eating for a long time.

396
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,520
I'm used to it.

397
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,520
I'm hungry.

398
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,520
Give me some food.

399
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,520
Give me some food.

400
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,520
Brothers.

401
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,520
Put some of this first.

402
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,520
Brothers.

403
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,520
Da Wei.

404
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,520
I put a piece of meat in it.

405
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,520
I'll tell you this.

406
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,520
This is a good idea.

407
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,520
A boss recommended it to me.

408
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,520
You eat this first.

409
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,520
I'm not going to eat it.

410
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,520
I'm not going to eat it.

411
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,520
It's not good.

412
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,520
Is it vinegar?

413
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,520
Is it vinegar?

414
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,520
Where's the chili?

415
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,520
It's not vinegar.

416
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,520
I'll eat it.

417
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,520
Can you help me with the chili?

418
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,520
No, it's not.

419
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,520
Thank you for being with me

420
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,520
when I was in the most sad state.

421
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,520
I'm so tired.

422
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,520
No matter if you're in Paris or not,

423
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,520
do you have chili?

424
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,520
You're always my family.

425
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,520
No, no, no.

426
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,520
I'm not going to eat it.

427
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,520
It's too hot.

428
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,520
It's hot.

429
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,520
I'm done eating.

430
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,520
I'm done eating.

431
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,520
I forgot about my brother.

432
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,520
They're teasing you.

433
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,520
You didn't see it.

434
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,520
The man in blue

435
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,520
is making a toast for Zhao Jige.

436
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,520
Zhao Jige,

437
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,520
sit down.

438
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,520
I'll make my sister a toast.

439
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,520
What's this?

440
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,520
A toast.

441
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,520
It's hot.

442
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,520
It's hot.

443
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,520
Eat it.

444
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,520
Eat it.

445
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,520
I'll eat it.

446
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,520
I'll eat it.

447
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,520
It's not hot enough.

448
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,520
The pork belly is in the fridge.

449
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,520
They're all gone.

450
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,520
Did you clean it?

451
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,520
No, I didn't.

452
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,520
I didn't wait for your pork belly.

453
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,520
No, I didn't.

454
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,520
Zhao Jige,

455
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,520
we're not eating it.

456
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,520
You can eat it yourself.

457
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,520
No, it's not that.

458
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,520
I'm just eating.

459
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,520
Dawei,

460
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,520
you've lost this door.

461
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,520
What?

462
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,520
Why are you so angry?

463
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,520
I'm having breakfast tomorrow.

464
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,520
Thank you for your help.

465
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,520
I'll eat it.

466
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,520
It's not that.

467
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,520
It's just a matter of time.

468
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,520
Thank you for your help.

469
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,520
Thank you for your help.

470
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,520
Thank you.

471
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,520
Thank you.

472
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,520
Thank you.

473
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,520
I'll eat it.

474
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,520
The vegetables are soft.

475
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,520
Thank you.

476
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,520
Thank you.

477
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,520
Thank you.

478
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,520
Thank you.

479
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,520
Thank you.

480
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,520
Thank you for your help.

481
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,520
Master.

482
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,520
Master.

483
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,520
I heard that you were having dinner

484
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,520
at the hospital last night.

485
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,520
Why didn't you call me?

486
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,520
I called you.

487
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,520
I couldn't even get in

488
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,520
the patient's room.

489
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,520
I even called you.

490
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,520
I was outside.

491
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,520
I found a chair.

492
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,520
I slept there for a night.

493
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,520
Master.

494
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,520
I didn't take care of this.

495
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,520
I gave you a gift.

496
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,520
What did you say?

497
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,520
Who did this?

498
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,520
Who did this?

499
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,520
There was a mistake.

500
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,520
And he's here today.

501
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,520
He doesn't need us.

502
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,520
Then...

503
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,520
I can't find out

504
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,520
the cause of this.

505
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,520
His team members are gone.

506
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,520
Now there's only one left.

507
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,520
And the boss said

508
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,520
he doesn't know

509
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,520
that it's a mess.

510
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,520
We don't have any

511
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,520
evidence to control.

512
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,520
No one should disrupt this.

513
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,520
That's fine.

514
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,520
Don't panic.

515
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,520
We'll not make it face-to-face.

516
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,520
That young man

517
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,520
has been Node who has passed

518
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,520
some serious jobs.

519
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,520
He even set up the hospital for her.

520
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,520
Maybe sheagine

521
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,520
ended up with

522
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,520
everything.

523
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,520
Please.

524
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,520
By the way, you can change your clothes if you want.

525
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,520
I have a mission, master.

526
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,520
Kill me.

527
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,520
I'm so sure I'll catch you.

528
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,520
Okay, okay. I'll do as you say.

529
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,520
I won't catch you anymore. I got a call.

530
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,520
What's up?

531
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,520
What? You came back yesterday?

532
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,520
Don't move. I'll be right there.

533
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,520
I think this case is not ready yet.

534
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,520
We can't just keep it up. Listen to me.

535
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:18,520
Master, I've already been to the factory with David.

536
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,520
The factory agreed.

537
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,520
Shall we go to the residential area to announce it?

538
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,520
Let the residents charge the charging card and charge the GPS.

539
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,520
Is that okay?

540
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,520
The people have their own stores.

541
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,520
I won't be willing to spend money on it.

542
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,520
It's a human error.

543
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,520
After all, it's for the people.

544
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,520
As long as we announce it, we'll do it.

545
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,520
Okay, let's split up.

546
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,520
Go and announce it.

547
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,520
Make more money.

548
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,520
Learn the air-conditioning spirit.

549
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,520
Go to the residential area.

550
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,520
I'll handle the case of the person who was involved two days ago.

551
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,520
I'll talk to him.

552
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,520
I'll be right back.

553
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,520
They're coming out.

554
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,520
Are there 17 people?

555
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,520
Let's go.

556
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,520
Follow them.

557
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,520
The charging card is charged.

558
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,520
The GPS is given to you.

559
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,520
It's for your safety.

560
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,520
Hello, do you want to take a look?

561
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,520
No, thank you.

562
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,520
Ma'am, the charging card is charged.

563
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,520
The GPS is given to you.

564
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,520
It's okay.

565
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,520
Wait, wait.

566
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,520
It's not trash.

567
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,520
It's not trash.

568
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,520
It's not trash.

569
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,520
It's not trash.

570
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,520
It's not trash.

571
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,520
It's not trash.

572
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,520
It's not trash.

573
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,520
It's not trash.

574
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,520
It's not trash.

575
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,520
It's not trash.

576
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,520
Is there a electric car in your house?

577
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,520
Have some water, Mr. Liang.

578
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,520
We're all hungry.

579
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,520
It's useless.

580
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,520
It's him, Officer.

581
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,520
He's in a bad mood.

582
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,520
I'm going, too.

583
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,520
Didn't you just go?

584
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,520
I'll take you to the toilet.

585
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,520
I know they're worried.

586
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,520
It's hard to do work in the community.

587
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,520
Yes.

588
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,520
Xiaoyang, what are you doing?

589
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,520
Sister Feng,

590
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,520
we're promoting the charging card.

591
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,520
After buying it, we'll send it to the GPS.

592
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,520
It can be used for your car.

593
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,520
Did you find my electric car?

594
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,520
No.

595
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,520
But I didn't expect it to be so good.

596
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,520
Okay, okay.

597
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,520
No.

598
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,520
Why are you telling me that?

599
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,520
Okay, okay.

600
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,520
I'm going home to cook.

601
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,520
Calm down.

602
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,520
No, no.

603
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,520
Hurry up.

604
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,520
Sister Feng.

605
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,520
Wait a minute.

606
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,520
Sister Feng.

607
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,520
Wait a minute.

608
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,520
I'll go get some water.

609
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,520
Okay, okay.

610
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,520
Tell me.

611
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,520
Your car didn't find the job.

612
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,520
It's our job.

613
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,520
But we have a way

614
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,520
to protect your car.

615
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,520
We don't need to steal it.

616
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,520
Pai.

617
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,520
I'm a new car.

618
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,520
I've been here for three days.

619
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,520
You told me to steal it.

620
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,520
Sister Feng.

621
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,520
You're so annoying.

622
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,520
Get up.

623
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,520
Sister Feng, listen to me.

624
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,520
Listen to me.

625
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,520
Sister Feng.

626
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,520
We bought a new car, right?

627
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,520
We have to protect the new car.

628
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,520
We don't need to steal it.

629
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,520
Now we have a way.

630
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,520
GPS.

631
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,520
It's in your car.

632
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,520
You can check the location of the car

633
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,520
through the phone.

634
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,520
The design is not good.

635
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,520
Even if someone dares to steal this car,

636
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,520
we can find it for you right away.

637
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,520
Maybe we can find the car

638
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,520
that you lost before.

639
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,520
Really?

640
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,520
Think about it.

641
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,520
Why don't we steal the car?

642
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,520
It's because the GPS chip is installed in the car.

643
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,520
The doctor can find it.

644
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,520
Okay, let me install it.

645
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,520
Okay.

646
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,520
Sister Feng.

647
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,520
You don't know that

648
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,520
there are more than 100 GPS codes.

649
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,520
Now,

650
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,520
we can just charge 200

651
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,520
in the power supply card.

652
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,520
I don't want any card.

653
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,520
I just want you to say something.

654
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,520
We have to say it well.

655
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,520
We have to charge it.

656
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,520
Then we can send it to you.

657
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,520
Xiao Yang.

658
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,520
I haven't found the electric car yet.

659
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,520
I don't even have the money.

660
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,520
You want me to spend money again?

661
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,520
You are so upset.

662
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,520
Are you okay with me?

663
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,520
Sister Feng.

664
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,520
There are 200 in the card.

665
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,520
There is a power supply.

666
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,520
You charge the car for half a year.

667
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,520
I charge it myself.

668
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,520
Half a year.

669
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,520
100 yuan.

670
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,520
You are charging it

671
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,520
with a wire.

672
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,520
It's actually very dangerous.

673
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,520
No, no.

674
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,520
It's too expensive.

675
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,520
Sister Feng.

676
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,520
You don't know that

677
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,520
I have already said that

678
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,520
the price of the mouth and the mouth

679
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,520
on the cost-effectiveness card

680
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,520
is more than 70 percent.

681
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,520
I can't do it anymore.

682
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,520
Xiao Yang.

683
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,520
How about this?

684
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,520
You are so strong.

685
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,520
What?

686
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,520
What about auntie?

687
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,520
No, no.

688
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,520
Sister Feng.

689
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,520
She should be the one who supports you.

690
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,520
Really?

691
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,520
You can pay me for free.

692
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,520
I'll call someone for you.

693
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,520
Free?

694
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,520
Yes.

695
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,520
Did anyone buy your card

696
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,520
after half a day?

697
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,520
Didn't you sell it for a whole account?

698
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,520
That's great.

699
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,520
Let me tell you again.

700
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,520
No one will let you

701
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,520
charge that little thing.

702
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,520
That's the charging device.

703
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,520
Yes, no one will let you charge it.

704
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,520
No, no.

705
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,520
You can't charge it inside the building.

706
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,520
It's very dangerous.

707
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,520
Xiao Yang.

708
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,520
Listen to me.

709
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,520
You said that you would go to the restaurant.

710
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,520
She is open-minded.

711
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,520
She is not a foodie.

712
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,520
I am a foodie.

713
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,520
I support you.

714
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,520
You are the first person.

715
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,520
You can't say that.

716
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,520
That's great.

717
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,520
Fine, sister Feng.

718
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,520
You are the first person.

719
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,520
I'll pay you for free.

720
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,520
But you have to help me.

721
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,520
You have to

722
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,520
give us the electric car

723
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,520
in this small village.

724
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,520
You should call me.

725
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,520
Call more people.

726
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,520
You can do this.

727
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,520
No problem.

728
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,520
It's on me.

729
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,520
Wait for me.

730
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,520
I'll go get you

731
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,520
the food.

732
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,520
I'll call more people.

733
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,520
Don't worry.

734
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,520
Okay.

735
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,520
Wait for me.

736
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,520
I'll be right there.

737
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,520
I'll be right there.

738
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,520
Wait for me.

739
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,520
Be careful, sister Feng.

740
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,520
Take care.

741
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,520
I'll be right there.

742
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,520
Thank you, sister Feng.

743
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,520
Master.

744
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,520
Are you sure

745
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,520
they are not the construction site?

746
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,520
No.

747
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,520
You can go in later.

748
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,520
Be careful.

749
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,520
Let's go.

750
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,520
Is Mr. Wang inside?

751
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,520
I don't know.

752
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,520
Master,

753
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,520
what are they stealing?

754
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,520
A hat.

755
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,520
A hat?

756
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,520
Stop looking.

757
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,520
Don't let them find out.

758
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,520
Let's go.

759
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,520
Mr. Wang,

760
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,520
how did you know

761
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,520
they were stealing from here?

762
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,520
I was

763
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,520
on the road

764
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,520
and they were eating together.

765
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,520
I was so anxious at that time.

766
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,520
I wondered

767
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,520
what was going on

768
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,520
and left a scar on my body.

769
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,520
I investigated then.

770
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,520
This guy

771
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,520
was the one who stole

772
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,520
this stolen gun from the construction site.

773
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,400
and then put it in the clothes and put it in the bag.

774
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,280
Think about it.

775
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,160
This guy is cold and strong.

776
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,360
He put it in the clothes and touched the friction.

777
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,120
He would leave such a wound.

778
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,760
But the funny thing is,

779
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,840
the two factories they come to often

780
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,560
don't know that they are already dead.

781
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,040
Master,

782
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,920
you have found so many evidence.

783
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,080
Why don't we catch them?

784
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,440
You fool.

785
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,800
They steal so many materials from the construction site every day.

786
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,960
There must be a few missing pieces.

787
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,560
I have already followed them.

788
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,560
Let's see if we can find the third one.

789
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,040
In your house?

790
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,440
See?

791
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,120
There is also the third one.

792
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,520
But the boss

793
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,640
knows what they are working on now.

794
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,240
Let's go.

795
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,400
Master, where are we going?

796
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,800
Go back.

797
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,960
I am spotted.

798
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,520
This time, we'll see how they change.

799
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,320
We already know where they live.

800
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,920
We also know where they work.

801
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,240
We also know where they're from.

802
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,400
Let's go back to the dorm.

803
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,960
See if we can get them out of here.

804
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,080
What if they run away?

805
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,320
What do you mean?

806
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,640
We didn't see them.

807
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,760
What do you mean?

808
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,760
Let's go. We can't.

809
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,960
Jiwei, have you noticed that

810
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,520
doing social work will make you more and more successful?

811
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,040
Don't think it's just a small thing.

812
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,240
But in this small thing,

813
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,400
you'll probably find it out.

814
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,600
Master,

815
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,320
why do you have a strange wound on your body

816
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,880
and break a case?

817
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,120
But I've taken a good look and got it fixed.

818
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,320
That's because you're too anxious.

819
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,200
You need to practice this.

820
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,440
How?

821
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,600
Look, you're still anxious.

822
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,600
Master, I'm not anxious.

823
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,040
Okay, that's good.

824
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:56,920
Master, don't blame me for asking you this.

825
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,720
What do I blame you for?

826
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:02,520
Master, Gao Tuo used to follow me.

827
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,720
Now Gao Tuo is the vice-president.

828
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,880
Don't you think that...

829
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,520
What do you think?

830
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,520
Do you think that I didn't go out?

831
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,080
No, I didn't think that way.

832
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,200
You don't really know this.

833
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,160
Gao Suo and I were in the same room.

834
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,880
The vice-president was looking after me.

835
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,280
He asked me and Gao Suo to be in the same room.

836
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:27,240
He asked me to learn something from Gao Suo.

837
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:30,360
I never dare to say that I'm Gao Suo's master.

838
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,600
Master,

839
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:36,080
there are two rooms in the same room with you.

840
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,680
I'm almost there next year.

841
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,800
It's still a bit late.

842
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,960
It's not that late.

843
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,120
You don't mind?

844
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,680
You don't mind either?

845
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,240
Your master is very kind.

846
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,480
He supports my work.

847
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,160
Master, you're really lucky.

848
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,360
I'm not lucky.

849
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,800
Your master was looking after me.

850
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:07,440
I think he's looking after me too.

851
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:17,440
It seems that you're a bit of a filial son in this job.

852
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,760
What are you doing?

853
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,160
What are you doing?

854
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,440
Sister Tong, I brought you people.

855
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,080
They're my sisters.

856
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,040
Thank you.

857
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,800
Come with me.

858
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,680
Sit here.

859
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,840
Let's have a look.

860
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,040
Tell us about what you're doing.

861
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:34,440
This little thing is called GPS.

862
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,800
It's not afraid to lose it in the electric car.

863
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,000
Look.

864
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,480
This is a power card.

865
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,440
It's easy to charge.

866
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,120
It's not that easy.

867
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,200
Sister Tong, please register first.

868
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,520
There's a book here.

869
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,920
Here's the book.

870
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,120
I can also register.

871
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:50,920
Aunt, aunt.

872
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,560
The book.

873
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,000
Aunt, you can watch the row.

874
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:53,920
Register.

875
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,800
I'm done.

876
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,400
Sister Tong, you can watch it.

877
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,760
Thank you.

878
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,560
I'm amazing.

879
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,200
You're amazing.

880
00:32:59,200 --> 00:32:59,880
So many people.

881
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,760
Thank you.

882
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,000
I'm done.

883
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,400
When will you sign up?

884
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,080
You're done.

885
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,440
I'll arrange people to sign up.

886
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,280
Okay.

887
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,560
Great.

888
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,240
Come on, everyone.

889
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,120
Come on.

890
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,440
The row is registered.

891
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,280
Sister, then...

892
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,120
How do you pay?

893
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:13,680
I'll scan it.

894
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,640
The cash is fine.

895
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,360
200 yuan.

896
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,320
Money?

897
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,760
What money?

898
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,960
It's free.

899
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,000
Free?

900
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,480
Didn't you say it was free?

901
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,520
Yes.

902
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,200
I...

903
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,440
You just told me.

904
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,400
No, no, no.

905
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,200
Well,

906
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:27,600
Sister,

907
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,240
there may be a misunderstanding.

908
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:29,920
Sister Tong.

909
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,920
Misunderstanding?

910
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,280
What misunderstanding?

911
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,080
Sister Tong.

912
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,960
You're the first one.

913
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,000
I gave you free money.

914
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,480
You asked so many people to come here.

915
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,840
We can't do it here.

916
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,920
You don't tell me who's free.

917
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,600
It's not possible.

918
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,360
If you only give it to him,

919
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,600
we won't do it.

920
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,280
No, no.

921
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:45,840
Sister, no, no.

922
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,480
Sister, no, no.

923
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,160
Don't go.

924
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:48,960
Don't go.

925
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,600
Don't go.

926
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:49,800
Don't go.

927
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,280
Come on, come on.

928
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,600
Let's discuss.

929
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,320
Let me explain.

930
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,320
Let me explain.

931
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,520
About the price of this 200 yuan,

932
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,800
we've discussed with the factory.

933
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,000
After the cost-effectiveness price,

934
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,840
we've hit the 7th.

935
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,000
It's very cheap.

936
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,840
Besides,

937
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,080
we've charged this 200 yuan card.

938
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:03,840
We can charge it again.

939
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,960
There's a GPS in the car.

940
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,080
We're not afraid of losing it.

941
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,200
It's a waste of money.

942
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,400
What waste of money?

943
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,320
We've been charging it at home.

944
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,240
We've been counting the money.

945
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,560
We've charged it for half a year.

946
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,200
You've got 200 yuan.

947
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,320
That's right.

948
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,080
Besides, we've charged it for a few more items.

949
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,760
We don't want to go to so many people.

950
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,320
Maybe we'll have to compensate.

951
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,440
It's not convenient at all.

952
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,240
Is it?

953
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,600
Sister, we'll definitely change it.

954
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,160
The key is that we can't charge the car in the corridor.

955
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,600
I'm doing this for your own good.

956
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,400
Who?

957
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,880
Come on, auntie, support you.

958
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,480
What do you mean, auntie?

959
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,360
What are you doing?

960
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:33,880
Thank you, sister Li.

961
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,360
Thank you, sister Li.

962
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,040
Wait a minute.

963
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,520
What are you doing?

964
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,520
I just want to understand.

965
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,240
It's really very smooth, right, sister Li?

966
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,320
Xiaoyang,

967
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,960
you've been here for a long time, right?

968
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,640
Not long.

969
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,480
I've been following you for a long time.

970
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,680
You look like a very learned person, right?

971
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,280
No, no, auntie.

972
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:48,920
You've overestimated me.

973
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,520
No, I understand.

974
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,760
You've overestimated me.

975
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,000
My sister

976
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,800
has a pretty girl.

977
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,720
And she's still a white girl.

978
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,000
She's very excellent.

979
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,760
She's a little bit younger now.

980
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,360
She's so ugly.

981
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,960
I've been asking you.

982
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,320
You don't have a girlfriend now, right?

983
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,840
I don't understand.

984
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,720
You're...

985
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,920
She's so selfish.

986
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,960
You're so selfish.

987
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,640
Look at her.

988
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,280
She's shy.

989
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,120
No, no, no.

990
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:10,840
She's shy.

991
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,720
She's shy.

992
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,360
She's shy.

993
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,040
I'm a good girl.

994
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,960
I'm like a girl who's been a fan of you.

995
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,000
You're a hot girl.

996
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,160
You're a hot girl.

997
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,760
Sister, let's just talk about the makeup.

998
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,280
This...

999
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,800
This is a very good product.

1000
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,480
I've seen a few girls.

1001
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,440
They're so good.

1002
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,360
Good girl.

1003
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,520
Really, good girl.

1004
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,280
Why didn't I think of that?

1005
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,040
Aunt.

1006
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,240
Xiaoyang,

1007
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,520
my niece

1008
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,280
is so pretty.

1009
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,760
I'm not here to see you.

1010
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,360
Come, come, come.

1011
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,240
I support you.

1012
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,360
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1013
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:43,480
This is a big blind date, right?

1014
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,680
I'll give you a receipt first.

1015
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,600
This is so good.

1016
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,320
Right?

1017
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,360
I'm so busy.

1018
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,080
Right.

1019
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,480
This is safe.

1020
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,120
Daochong,

1021
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,000
where did you lose your phone?

1022
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,400
Now,

1023
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,480
before we were in the community,

1024
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,280
there were a few cases of a traffic jam.

1025
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,640
So, the police and the police

1026
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,560
contacted the factory.

1027
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,320
Now, they've organized a charging station.

1028
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,560
They've sent a GPS.

1029
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,040
欸 诶

1030
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:19,720
You разjin?

1031
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,720
Exactly, 502 meters.

1032
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,360
Listen,

1033
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,680
I'm in the back.

1034
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,480
Just run now!

1035
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,840
Wu Yi, your enemy linemen have蛾 after you!

1036
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,920
You should head out!

1037
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,720
Coming!

1038
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,620
Let me sleep for real.

1039
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:12,920
Enjoy.

1040
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,420
Bye.

1041
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:22,760
Forget it!

1042
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,800
Go out.

1043
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,540
Thank you.

1044
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,660
Thanks, Elder Brother.

1045
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:47,960
You take it back.

1046
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:48,920
Take care.

1047
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,100
Jin,

1048
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,100
It's one whole day more.

1049
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:53,860
raum Festival.

1050
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:55,240
I can't run.

1051
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:56,420
Teacher.

1052
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:56,840
Okay.

1053
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,340
I want you to hold him down security.

1054
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,660
You go back first.

1055
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,360
I said we were free.

1056
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,380
We told you we'd do everything.

1057
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:03,780
We got long range operation,

1058
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:04,480
we campaigned hard.

1059
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:04,840
I heard he's outside.

1060
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,680
What an excuse.

1061
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,340
Don't change it by yourself.

1062
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:07,920
Just go with him.

1063
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,920
I'm enough.

1064
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,160
Jiwei, go with Gao Suo.

1065
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,360
No, no need.

1066
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,360
Take him with you.

1067
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,640
Gao Suo, take me with you.

1068
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,160
Take him with you.

1069
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,600
Take me with you.

1070
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,480
Okay, we're leaving.

1071
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,080
Okay.

1072
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:22,800
What?

1073
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,000
Take care.

1074
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,120
Take care.

1075
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,640
Take care.

1076
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,640
You called the police?

1077
00:38:59,320 --> 00:38:59,720
Yes.

1078
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,240
Police?

1079
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,040
What's wrong?

1080
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:01,680
It's like this.

1081
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,440
These kids hit my car.

1082
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,680
But maybe they're not.

1083
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,840
My dad threw him away alone.

1084
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,840
He's not willing to take care of you.

1085
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,280
Okay, I'll leave it to you.

1086
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,440
How about this?

1087
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,760
You fill in the police list.

1088
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,800
It'll be fine after tonight.

1089
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,280
Okay, okay.

1090
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:23,800
Dear,

1091
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,680
what's your name?

1092
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,680
You have to tell the police

1093
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,960
what's your name.

1094
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,480
Then I can help you find a home.

1095
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,240
I'm not going home.

1096
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,120
You're not going home?

1097
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,240
Who's home is so late?

1098
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,160
You're not going home?

1099
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,360
Did you have a fight with your parents?

1100
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,440
Or did you go home without writing last night?

1101
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,040
You didn't have dinner tonight, did you?

1102
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,120
Then I'll treat you to a delicious meal.

1103
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,560
Delicious.

1104
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,600
Okay, let's go.

1105
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:01,920
Okay, okay.

1106
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,800
Thank you.

1107
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,560
Thank you.

1108
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,360
Let's go.

1109
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,200
Okay, thank you.

1110
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,440
Thank you.

1111
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,520
Enjoy your meal.

1112
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,160
Thank you.

1113
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,680
What do you want to eat?

1114
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,720
Tell me.

1115
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,320
No, thanks.

1116
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,480
Thank you, Uncle Jiang.

1117
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,520
You're welcome.

1118
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,360
Are you hot?

1119
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,320
Take a small bowl for me.

1120
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,120
Thank you.

1121
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,520
Okay, thank you.

1122
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,160
I'll get you one.

1123
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,160
You're still fast.

1124
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,280
Drink some soup first.

1125
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,880
Here, put your tongue on the plate.

1126
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:12,520
Is it hot?

1127
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:13,960
Is it?

1128
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:14,960
Want to eat?

1129
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,680
What's wrong?

1130
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,720
Why are you crying after eating?

1131
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,200
I'm so hungry.

1132
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,480
You miss your mom?

1133
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,960
I thought you didn't miss your mom.

1134
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,600
But we have conditions to meet mom.

1135
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,960
We have to eat seven of these.

1136
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:40,720
Then,

1137
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,600
Uncle will take you to find your parents.

1138
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,920
But you have to tell me what you want to call them.

1139
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,160
Where do you live?

1140
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,120
How many mobile phones do you have?

1141
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,400
Mom, mom is gone.

1142
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,560
Mom, mom is gone.

1143
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,720
What do you mean?

1144
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:00,120
Mom, I'm going to the mother-in-law's house.

1145
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,800
Dad, mom, I'm going to the father-in-law's house.

1146
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:08,800
I really want to see my mom.

1147
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:13,840
I want to go to my mom's house and see my mom.

1148
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,280
I'm coming. I'm sad.

1149
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,360
I'm not sad.

1150
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,600
I'll see mom and mom.

1151
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,200
I'll go back.

1152
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,760
I'll take you there.

1153
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:28,720
Mom.

1154
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,960
But you came out today.

1155
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,240
You didn't tell dad.

1156
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,320
You think you did the right thing.

1157
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:40,240
And you think dad really wants to scold you?

1158
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,520
You're so obedient.

1159
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,160
Maybe dad wants to scold you too.

1160
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:45,760
Right?

1161
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,080
I'm sure dad will be worried about you.

1162
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,280
Let's eat quickly.

1163
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,320
After we finish eating,

1164
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,640
Uncle will take you to find your dad.

1165
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,160
Okay?

1166
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,200
Don't cry. Let's eat.

1167
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:58,600
Let's eat.

1168
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:16,920
Eat this. This is a Liang.

1169
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:17,720
This is Liang.

1170
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,320
Okay?

1171
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

1172
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

1173
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

1174
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

1175
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

1176
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

1177
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

1178
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

1179
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

1180
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,760

I'm not sure if I can do it.

1187
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

1188
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

1189
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

1190
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

1191
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,760

1192
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,760

I'm not sure if I can do it.

1195
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

1196
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

1197
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

1198
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

1199
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

1200
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

1201
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

1202
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

1203
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

1204

1213
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,760
I can do it.

1214
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,960
Let's skip this part.

1215
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,760
I don't want to end up doing a full-footed turn.

1216
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

1217
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,760
I'm not sure whether I can do it or not.

1218
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,760
I don't think there's anything I can do in this video.

1219
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,760
I really suck at this.

1220
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,760
Because when I play this video,

1221
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,760
I'm not sure that I can do it.

1222
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:34,760
I won't fall in love with you
