1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I

6
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We are so excited to catch a few

7
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
One is not enough

8
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
One

9
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Catch one person to the car, ten people

10
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Then you say to the couple

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
One to one, lonely hero

12
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Don't you think the police case is to play with life?

13
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
One to one is a little exaggerated

14
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Three to one is fine

15
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Go and shut up

16
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
No one can take you as a mute

17
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Comrade, let me say a few words

18
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
The suspect we are going to catch today is called Deng Da Yong

19
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
He has two lives in his body

20
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's a non-conference A and a non-conference B

21
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's a group of people

22
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
But the county people are very familiar with me

23
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Give us this report

24
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'll give you a chance to make a profit

25
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Remember

26
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
There is a weapon in this person

27
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Don't act rashly

28
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Listen to the command

29
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yes, sir

30
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
We heard Brother Chen on the way

31
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
He gave us a while

32
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Can be lost for a while

33
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's been a long time since we've seen this

34
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's not here yet

35
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
People are talking about it

36
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I said why do you talk so much

37
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I didn't see it

38
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I was a little bit tired

39
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I just want to talk to you

40
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm not a good person

41
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I don't know

42
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I don't know

43
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I don't know

44
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I don't know

45
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I don't know

46
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I don't know

47
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I don't know

48
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I don't know

49
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I don't know

50
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I don't know

51
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I don't know

52
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I didn't see it

53
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I was a little bit tired

54
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I didn't talk for an hour

55
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Besides

56
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I slept all night

57
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Someone should put on a light

58
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Just put on a light

59
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Why do you talk

60
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm sorry

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Chen Dingman

62
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Are you having any feelings for me

63
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You see

64
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Okay

65
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'll talk to you more

66
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Remember

67
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
If you have anything

68
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Nothing

69
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Shut up

70
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Stay behind

71
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You're making trouble

72
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'll take care of it

73
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
What do you mean if you have anything

74
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The police is just pretending to be bad

75
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Didn't you see him resting

76
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You're behind

77
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Don't you have any influence

78
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Rest

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
What else to catch later

80
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Catch

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I

82
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,560
Uh

83
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,560
Come here

84
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:40,100
.

85
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,100
Your son Ding Dayong has committed a crime.

86
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,100
He can't escape the sanctions of law.

87
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,100
But the law has a rule.

88
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,100
As long as he is in charge,

89
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,100
he can really get out of the law.

90
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,100
This is his last chance.

91
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,100
Uncle, let's go.

92
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,100
Stop talking.

93
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,100
I'll tell you something.

94
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,100
What's the point of talking now?

95
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,100
Listen to me. Let's go.

96
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,100
Let's go out and talk.

97
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,100
Let's go.

98
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,100
Tell me.

99
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,100
Do you have a bag of oil?

100
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,100
Just a moment.

101
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,100
Brother, he's at home.

102
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,100
At home? Where?

103
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,100
At the medical clinic behind the old man.

104
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,100
Brother,

105
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,100
when I was pulling you, you didn't react.

106
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,100
I slept in my bed and I was warm.

107
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,100
I didn't go anywhere.

108
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,100
The whole family is three and five meters away.

109
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,100
How can I hide in the hospital?

110
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,100
Is this the way to make sure he's in the hospital?

111
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,100
Of course not.

112
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,100
Think about it.

113
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,100
There are so many places in the whole family.

114
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,100
Why is the old man sitting in front of the medical clinic?

115
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,100
And,

116
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,100
don't you think those chairs are too big?

117
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,100
They're very comfortable to sit in front of the medical clinic.

118
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,100
That's good.

119
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,100
You're doing well in your first day.

120
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,100
What's your name?

121
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,100
Mr. Li.

122
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,100
Okay, I'll remember you.

123
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,100
I graduated from the police school.

124
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,100
I can't find anything about this observation.

125
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,100
It's normal.

126
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,100
I studied this.

127
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,100
The woman Xiao Yan

128
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,100
was told by the police.

129
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,100
It's normal to see such a dirty thing

130
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,100
for the first time.

131
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,100
She didn't study this.

132
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,100
After a few more years,

133
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,100
she can't find anything about this.

134
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,100
Mr. Gao,

135
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,100
let them go back now.

136
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,100
Brother,

137
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,100
I saw

138
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,100
that there was only one exit.

139
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,100
You can wait for them for two years.

140
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,100
We'll go back to Zhao's house.

141
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,100
Mr. Gao,

142
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,100
let me follow you.

143
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,100
To Zhihui.

144
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,100
Where are so many Zhihui's eyes?

145
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,100
Okay.

146
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,100
By the way,

147
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,100
you don't have to go in from the gate this time.

148
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,100
I opened the window of the room.

149
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,100
You can turn in directly.

150
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,100
What?

151
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,100
Zhang.

152
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,100
Be quick.

153
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,100
Go.

154
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,100
Go.

155
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,100
Let's go.

156
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,100
Go.

157
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,100
Go.

158
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,100
Are you really a coward?

159
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,100
Or what?

160
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,100
You think

161
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,100
I dare to lie to the police?

162
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,100
I'm a coward.

163
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,100
I'm a coward.

164
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,100
You have such good education.

165
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,100
Why did you take the toilet?

166
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,100
I got into an accident.

167
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,100
I just got the report.

168
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,100
I got a notification

169
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,100
and asked me to go to the airport.

170
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,100
I was training you.

171
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,100
I'll go to the airport for you.

172
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,100
Don't worry.

173
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,100
I have a job experience in the airport.

174
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,100
I can do anything.

175
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,100
Look at what you said.

176
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,100
You look like a leader.

177
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,100
I don't want to

178
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,100
study too much since I was a kid.

179
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,100
I've never written

180
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,100
the words of Northeastern people.

181
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,100
Then how did you

182
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,100
get into an accident

183
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,100
and graduate?

184
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,100
This is my nature.

185
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,100
It's different from yours.

186
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,100
I can always

187
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,100
write the words of Northeastern people.

188
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,100
I'm just a little bit of a fool.

189
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,100
What are you talking about?

190
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,100
Li Dazheng.

191
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,100
I bought you some melon seeds

192
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,100
and made you some tea.

193
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,100

00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,100

00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,100
Go.

207
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,100
Go.

208
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,100
Be careful.

209
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,100
Hurry up.

210
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,100
Go.

211
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,100
Hurry up.

212
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,100
Go.

213
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,100
Go.

214
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,100
Go.

215
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,100
Go.

216
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,100
Go.

217
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,100
Go.

218
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,100
Go.

219
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,100
Get in the car.

220
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,100
Hurry up.

221
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,100
Don't move.

222
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,100
Get in the car.

223
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,100
Go.

224
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,100
Go.

225
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,100
We can't get in the car.

226
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,100
Get in the car.

227
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,100
Hurry up.

228
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,100
Hurry up.

229
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,100
Hurry up.

230
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,100
Get in the car.

00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,100
Hurry up.

232
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,100
Get in the car.

233
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,100
Don't move.

234
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,100
Move.

235
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,100
Move.

236
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,100
The taxi is going.

237
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,100
Hurry up.

238
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,100
Hurry up.

239
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,100
Don't worry.

240
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,100
We're just a group of businessmen.

241
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,100
They're killing us!

242
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,100
They're killing us!

243
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,100
Let's go.

244
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,100
They're killing us!

245
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,100
Hurry up.

246
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,100
Let's go.

247
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,100
Get in the car.

248
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,100
Hurry up.

249
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,100
Go.

250
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,100
Hurry up.

251
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,100
Move.

252
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,100
Move.

253
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,100
Go.

254
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,100
How could you shoot us!

255
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:28,780
We will have to go do what we can for our children!

256
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:29,780
Make it fast!

257
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:30,780
Be fast!!

258
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,020
Please don't eliminate him,

259
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:38,420
use violence and security measures to protect especially theUkoshtari.

260
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:45,940
It's useless to record all that here!

261
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,860
I am just a pedestrian,

262
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,240
I hope all of you and our workers exercise properly.

263
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,940
We have no kills,

264
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,500
Да mà five, mathé wounded her

Yung Wang,一个�

269
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:14,740
Don't move!

270
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,380
My son is not alive!

271
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,620
My son is not alive!

272
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,740
My son is not alive!

273
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,900
Let go of the things!

274
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,300
Save my son!

275
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,140
My son is not alive!

276
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,980
Save my son!

277
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:45,940
Mr. Gao.

278
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,940
I'm sorry about what happened just now.

279
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:53,940
Are you okay?

280
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,940
I just think it's her who's going to turn the tables.

281
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,940
The old man is innocent.

282
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:01,940
We've taken her away like this.

283
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:02,940
It doesn't matter who the old man is.

284
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,940
It's too cruel.

285
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,940
You've experienced what happened just now.

286
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,940
If you want to be cruel to them,

287
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,940
then you must be careful.

288
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,940
Don't be cruel to your own people.

289
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,940
If they don't come to the village,

290
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,940
you know how many things they'll do.

291
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:24,940
I'm sorry to tell you.

292
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:25,940
I was too inexperienced.

293
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,940
I didn't take care of it well.

294
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,940
I'll be back soon.

295
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:45,940
Don't run away.

296
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,940
You can't run away.

297
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:48,940
I'll wear it for you.

298
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:52,940
I'm not going to interview you.

299
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,940
You're too bold.

300
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:55,940
What do you think about when you're in trouble?

301
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:56,940
You think the police can't catch you?

302
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:57,940
Don't talk.

303
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,940
Don't talk about the idle business.

304
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:01,940
What do you mean?

305
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,940
The idle person who's guilty of the interrogation

306
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:05,940
is on the way to school.

307
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:06,940
Don't you know?

308
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:08,940
After he's back,

309
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:09,940
he has to be handed over to the police.

310
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:10,940
I'm sorry.

311
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:13,940
He's a good person.

312
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:32,940
Morning.

313
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:33,940
Morning.

314
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:35,940
Do you need my help?

315
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,940
No, I'm done.

316
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,940
I don't know

317
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,940
what happened to the arrest yesterday.

318
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:45,940
Yes.

319
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:46,940
I'm really envious

320
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,940
that they came here for the first time.

321
00:15:58,940 --> 00:15:59,940
Xiao Jie.

322
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:01,940
So early?

323
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:03,940
Sir, you're even earlier.

324
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:05,940
I took a class in the morning

325
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:06,940
for the principal last night.

326
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:07,940
The principal said

327
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:08,940
he took a class with the principal.

328
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:09,940
The principal was sick.

329
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:11,940
Is it serious?

330
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:12,940
It's an old problem.

331
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:13,940
These years,

332
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:14,940
they've always been old and young.

333
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:17,940
Mr. Cheng.

334
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:18,940
Xiao Zheng.

335
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:19,940
You're so early.

336
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:20,940
No, Mr. Cheng.

337
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:23,940
Well, Xia Jie and I

338
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:24,940
are envious

339
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:25,940
that they can come out

340
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,940
on the first day of the report.

341
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:28,940
They?

342
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:33,940
Xia Jie,

343
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:34,940
you're envious too.

344
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,940
I was going to go there.

345
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,940
I'll take you out for a walk.

346
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:39,940
Is there a task?

347
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:40,940
It's a task.

348
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,940
Okay.

349
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:43,940
I'll get going then.

350
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:07,940
Follow me.

351
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:25,940
Xiao Zhao.

352
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:26,940
Sir.

353
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:27,940
Did I step on you?

354
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:28,940
No.

355
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:29,940
Do you hurt?

356
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,940
No.

357
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:31,940
You were more tougher

358
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:32,940
than I was.

359
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:33,940
Sir.

360
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:35,940
No.

361
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:36,860
What's wrong?

362
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,340
You want to see me?

363
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,020
No.

364
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:40,540
Come.

365
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,420
I have something to do.

366
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,100
Come.

367
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:45,980
Let me go.

368
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,460
Come.

369
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:50,980
Come.

370
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:52,860
Sit.

371
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,180
Sit.

372
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:56,740
Sit.

373
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,460
It's not bad.

374
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,060
Chief.

375
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,580
What do you want to see me for?

376
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,300
Chief.

377
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,580
I just want to ask you

378
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,420
that all the four of us

379
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,620
have a master.

380
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,380
Yes.

381
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,140
It's a tradition.

382
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,820
Can you be my master?

383
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,460
I'm your master.

384
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,220
Chief.

385
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,420
I've heard you have a lot of heroes.

386
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,020
I'm still proud of you.

387
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,660
I've been a machine-gun soldier for my whole life.

388
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,420
I've never even been a third-class worker.

389
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,580
How can I have such a great master?

390
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,420
You're so mean.

391
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,420
Here you are.

392
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:28,980
Jiang Xiaoyun.

393
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:30,660
What's the matter?

394
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,260
Nothing.

395
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,140
Is Gao Chao and Lao Cheng still not back?

396
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,220
He should be back soon.

397
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,060
You just came back from the hospital?

398
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,020
How is he?

399
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:43,900
He's fine.

400
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,980
You've got enough of these four.

401
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:49,460
I'm fine.

402
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:50,780
Fine.

403
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,700
Chief.

404
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,100
I'll go first.

405
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,620
Okay.

406
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,220
Go first.

407
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,020
Don't worry.

408
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,100
The master's matters

409
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,620
will be arranged in the same way.

410
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,140
We'll arrange the most suitable people

411
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,500
to be the best police officers.

412
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,420
Then I'll be at ease, Chief.

413
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:09,460
Okay.

414
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,260
Don't worry.

415
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,180
We'll arrange

416
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:14,140
every one of you a master.

417
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:14,580
Okay?

418
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:14,980
I'll go first.

419
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:15,860
Go ahead.

420
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,540
Go.

421
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:16,900
Let's go.

422
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,220
Xiaoyun.

423
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,340
You're his master.

424
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,740
Is this kid a progress?

425
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,420
The goal is big enough.

426
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,940
You should be more concerned.

427
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:34,540
Of course.

428
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,260
Chief.

429
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,580
Mr. Ou is back.

430
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,940
Hey, here he comes.

431
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,540
You know what?

432
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,140
You know what Zhang Yan is looking at.

433
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,100
He's a little bit...

434
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,860
I'll keep an eye on him.

435
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,780
Let Captain Luo do the work for us.

436
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,540
Let's not catch him, right?

437
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:52,860
Chief.

438
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,060
Can I sign the deal?

439
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:55,620
Who?

440
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,660
The deal?

441
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,700
My brain.

442
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,220
I can't.

443
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:00,780
Wait.

444
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,180
Here's the car.

445
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,780
Chief, you're back.

446
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,660
Chief, thank you for your hard work.

447
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,940
I know you've been working hard

448
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,740
all this time.

449
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,020
For the people's welfare.

450
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,100
Okay.

451
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:26,620
You...

452
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,740
Why did you catch one?

453
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,900
Chief, don't rush.

454
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,860
There's another car.

455
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,020
What's going on?

456
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,140
Two on one?

457
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,940
Your reputation changed.

458
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:55,860
These two even mock me with one of their

459
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,340
International aider.

460
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,460
I'm serious.

461
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:01,460
You can take your time and feel comfortable.

462
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,460
I'm off.

463
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,460
Go on.

464
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,460
Go on.

465
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,460
You're so important.

466
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,460
You're back.

467
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,460
Everyone is working hard.

468
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:28,460
Take your time and rest.

469
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,460
I'll tell everyone.

470
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:33,460
We'll leave this bed to the doctor.

471
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,460
No, the doctor.

472
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,460
The doctor came from the outside.

473
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,460
He hasn't rented a house yet.

474
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,460
No, the doctor doesn't need it.

475
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,460
Really, really.

476
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,460
What?

477
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,460
Why don't you need it?

478
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:44,460
You think this is a little bit of a problem?

479
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,460
It's a little bit of a problem?

480
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,460
No, that's not what I mean.

481
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,460
That's not what I mean.

482
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,460
Let's do it like this.

483
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,460
Now, young people, take your time and rest.

484
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,460
Comrades, come with me.

485
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,460
Get in, get in, get on the bed.

486
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,460
Get in, get on the bed.

487
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:00,460
Yang Shu, special guest.

488
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,460
I'll do it.

489
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,460
Come, come.

490
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,460
Our new person has been seen.

491
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:29,460
Come, talk about this impression.

492
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,460
Let me talk first.

493
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:35,460
I think this is a little bit of a problem.

494
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,460
We don't have enough brains.

495
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,460
It's a good example of a good company.

496
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:43,460
But what our director sent us is a good example.

497
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,460
Okay.

498
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,460
Director Xu, you dare to make a mess.

499
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:53,460
Don't be too much.

500
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:58,460
Gao Zong, you say that Li Dawei is not bad.

501
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,460
It's obvious.

502
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,460
I saw it when I was catching it yesterday.

503
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,460
Right, Brother Cheng?

504
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:06,460
When you catch it, it looks like this child is very easy.

505
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:09,460
But it's true that it's true.

506
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:12,460
I think it's not bad.

507
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,460
It's a little bit messy.

508
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,460
It's a little bit soft.

509
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:22,460
Just like what happened in the bus last night.

510
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:25,460
There is a sense of urgency and sensitivity.

511
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:28,460
It's really hard to understand the human affairs.

512
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,460
I also criticized him.

513
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,460
It's also for his own good.

514
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,460
As for Yang Shu,

515
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,460
he is a good boy.

516
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:39,460
Let's see how we treat him.

517
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:46,460
Director, I'm just being serious.

518
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,460
I can't do this about the child.

519
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,460
No, no, no.

520
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,460
You...

521
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,460
I'm young.

522
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,460
I'm not young.

523
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,460
Listen to me.

524
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:58,460
I haven't decided who to bring the child.

525
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,460
Let's discuss it.

526
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,460
Let's discuss it.

527
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,460
It's not a formal meeting.

528
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,460
I'll sleep.

529
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,460
I'm sleepy.

530
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,460
I haven't slept for a while.

531
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,460
Why did you take the cable car?

532
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,460
Let him go.

533
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,460
Yes.

534
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,460
He is not here.

535
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,460
He can't go.

536
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,460
I'm leaving.

537
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,460
You can go.

538
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,460
I'll talk to you later.

539
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,460
Zhijie.

540
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,460
Why are you still here?

541
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,460
I'm here because of you.

542
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,460
Go to bed.

543
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,460
Go back to sleep.

544
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,460
Today, the suspect

545
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,460
hid in their house.

546
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,460
I was the one who did it.

547
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,460
And I told them

548
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,460
that the dressing was also my dress.

549
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,460
You're amazing, Xiao Ge.

550
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,460
What am I called?

551
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,460
Do you know Li Dawei?

552
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,460
I'm so envious of you.

553
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,460
I really want to go to the scene to participate.

554
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,460
I have a chance.

555
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,460
I'm so envious of you.

556
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:41,460
I have a chance.

557
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,460
What's wrong?

558
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,460
You really think he's a big deal?

559
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,460
I'll talk to you later.

560
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,460
If you want to hide from them,

561
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,460
then you have to hide from your own people.

562
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,460
If they don't come from the office,

563
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:18,460
do you know how many things will happen?

564
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,460
I'll take you to the familiar situation

565
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,460
around here today.

566
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,460
The hospital is still very big.

567
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,460
This is the place.

568
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,460
I found the suspect with your father.

569
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,460
This is the square.

570
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,460
Your father is more than ten years older than me.

571
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,460
But I can't follow him

572
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,460
even if he runs away.

573
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,460
I can't follow him.

574
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,460
But I can't follow him

575
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,460
even if he runs away.

576
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,460
The suspect is five times bigger

577
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,460
and three times more.

578
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,460
He's bigger than us.

579
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,460
But your father is a spy.

580
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,460
So I've found him.

581
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,460
Xiao Nian.

582
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,460
Xiao Nian, Xiao Nian.

583
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,460
Xiao Nian.

584
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,460
Stop.

585
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,460
What's wrong with you?

586
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,460
Someone's in the car.

587
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,460
Get in the car.

588
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,460
Move.

589
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,460
Right in front of you.

590
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,460
Miss, wait here.

591
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,460
Watch the car.

592
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,460
Get down.

593
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,460
Jump over.

594
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,460
Jump over.

595
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,460
Jump over.

596
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,460
Wait there.

597
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,460
Master.

598
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,460
Jump over.

599
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,460
I told you.

600
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,460
I'll be there.

601
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:43,460
He's a human. Let's go.

602
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,460
Why didn't he find him?

603
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,460
He's a stray knife.

604
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,460
What?

605
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,460
Let's go.

606
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,460
Is he going to catch him?

607
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,460
He's been behind the door.

608
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,460
He's a little kid.

609
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,460
He's a lot of people.

610
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,460
He's not a good guy.

611
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,460
Miss.

612
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:08,460
Remember what I said.

613
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,460
Once you find out that a suspect has a weapon,

614
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,460
you can't go out without a reason.

615
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:16,460
And don't force the suspect to a private place.

616
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,460
Otherwise, he'll run away.

617
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,460
He'll definitely fight you.

618
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,460
Take him.

619
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,460
Did we catch him?

620
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,460
Do you have money in your bag?

621
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,460
Who else has money in their bag?

622
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,460
Of course, the phone is in the bag.

623
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,460
How much is the phone?

624
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,460
More than five thousand.

625
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,460
I don't know.

626
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,460
I don't know.

627
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,460
I don't know.

628
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,460
How much is the phone?

629
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,460
More than five thousand.

630
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,460
We're from the police station in Bali.

631
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,460
Xia Jie, fill in a police list for him.

632
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,460
And leave a contact number.

633
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,460
Write down the number.

634
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,460
What's your bag?

635
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,460
It's from the police.

636
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,460
Is it true?

637
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:50,460
To be honest,

638
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,460
this relationship is a set-up.

639
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,460
It's a high-end.

640
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,460
It seems that it's a good-end.

641
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,460
The thief must be the real one.

642
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,460
Hello?

643
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,460
Sir, you say.

644
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,460
Okay, I got it.

645
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,460
Xia Jie, finish the deal.

646
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,460
Go back to the office.

647
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,460
I have a task.

648
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,460
What about you?

649
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:16,460
I have other tasks.

650
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,460
The main safety.

651
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,460
I'm leaving.

652
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,460
Officer, where's my bag?

653
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,460
I found it. I'll tell you later.

654
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,460
Don't make any noise.

655
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,460
Don't make any noise.

656
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,460
We must do it

657
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,460
in the scene.

658
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,460
We must fight with our hands.

659
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,460
We must fight with our heads.

660
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,460
We must put the price on the first place.

661
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:37,460
We must put the price on the first place.

662
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,460
Please accept it.

663
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,460
Accept it.

664
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,460
Accept it.

665
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,460
Accept it.

666
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,460
Accept it.

667
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,460
Okay.

668
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,460
I think it's a small matter.

669
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,460
We've been on the scene for several times.

670
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,460
It's not solved.

671
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,460
We don't care about the lock.

672
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,460
We don't want the next round of the game.

673
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,460
We just let them make a mistake.

674
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,460
Maybe it's solved.

675
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:02,460
You don't want to wear your clothes, do you?

676
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,460
You're useless.

677
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,460
Get out of here.

678
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,460
What do you want?

679
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,460
We didn't eat your chicken.

680
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,460
You're the chicken.

681
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,460
I saw your chicken.

682
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,460
Don't talk to him.

683
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,460
There are many chickens in this yard.

684
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,460
Why are we here?

685
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,460
I'm telling you.

686
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,460
It's you.

687
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,460
Yes.

688
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,460
Who are you?

689
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,460
Who are you?

690
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,460
It's you.

691
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,460
It's you.

692
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,460
We're here.

693
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,460
We're here.

694
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,460
We're here.

695
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,460
We're here.

696
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,460
We're here.

697
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,460
You're a real man.

698
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,460
You're a real man.

699
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,460
You're a real man.

700
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,460
You're a real man.

701
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,460
You're a real man.

702
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,460
Don't call me.

703
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,460
Don't call me.

704
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,460
It's done.

705
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,460
It's done.

706
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,460
It's done.

707
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,460
It's done.

708
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,460
It's done.

709
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,460
Get the car.

710
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,460
Get the car.

711
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,460
Get in.

712
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,460
You should leave this village and stay here.

713
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,460
These villagers are so greedy.

714
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,460
They're old.

715
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,460
They'll hide when something happens.

716
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,460
I'm telling you, no matter if it's Qingyan or Tangyuan,

717
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,460
they'll come back.

718
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,460
They'll come back.

719
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,460
No problem.

720
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,460
Go.

721
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,460
Go!

722
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,460
Go!

723
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,460
Go!

724
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,460
Go!

725
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,460
Go!

726
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,460
Go!

727
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,460
Go!

728
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,460
Go!

729
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,460
Go!

730
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,460
Go!

731
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,460
Go!

732
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,460
Go!

733
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,460
Go!

734
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,460
Go!

735
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,460
Go!

736
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,460
Stop!

737
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,460
Stop!

738
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,460
Stop!

739
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,460
Stop!

740
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,460
Alright, alright, everyone.

741
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:27,460
I know the situation.

742
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,460
You used to be...

743
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,460
the village's village.

744
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:35,460
Now you're in the same neighborhood.

745
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:38,460
What can you do to solve it?

746
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:41,460
Don't you want to make this a break?

747
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,460
What can you do to solve it?

748
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,460
It's okay.

749
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,460
We'll talk about it.

750
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,460
We'll talk about it.

751
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,460
It's okay.

752
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,460
Stop!

753
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,460
Stop!

754
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,460
Stop!

755
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,460
Stop!

756
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,460
Well,

757
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,460
I know the situation.

758
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,460
Who lost the chicken?

759
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,460
I didn't come to pick you up.

760
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,460
I was scared to death.

761
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,460
How many did you lose?

762
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,460
One.

763
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,460
Okay.

764
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,460
This one.

765
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,460
Get in the car.

766
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:12,460
Get in the car.

767
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,460
Come on, come on, Chief.

768
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,460
Come on, come on.

769
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,460
Come on.

770
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,460
Here, the chicken is here.

771
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,460
Sister,

772
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,460
you lost one chicken, right?

773
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,460
I made you four.

774
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,460
I have a husband and a mother.

775
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,460
Can you do it?

776
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,460
I give you all of them.

777
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,460
This one?

778
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,460
This one.

779
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,460
Okay.

780
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,460
Thank you.

781
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,460
Thank you.

782
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,460
Thank you.

783
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,460
Thank you.

784
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,460
Thank you.

785
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,460
Enough.

786
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,460
I don't believe it.

787
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,460
This is not a chicken problem.

788
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,460
Yes.

789
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,460
This is not a chicken problem.

790
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,460
You lost two chickens.

791
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,460
You've solved the problem.

792
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,460
How can you...

793
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,460
You lost our family.

794
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,460
You lost your family.

795
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,460
You lost your family.

796
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,460
You lost your family.

797
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,460
You lost your family.

798
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,460
You lost your family.

799
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,460
We've told them to go back to their houses.

800
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,460
They'll go back to us.

801
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,460
We'll do something here.

802
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,460
Okay.

803
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,460
We lost this yesterday.

804
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,460
We lost that today.

805
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,460
Who lost it?

806
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,460
Who lost it?

807
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,460
You lost it yesterday.

808
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,460
You lost your chicken.

809
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,460
You lost your family.

810
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,460
Why are you here?

811
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:04,460
I don't talk much.

812
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,460
You're making trouble.

813
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,460
We want to be with you.

814
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,460
You're the kids.

815
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,460
You're going to do something

816
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,460
on our land.

817
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,460
Exactly.

818
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,460
Exactly.

819
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,460
Exactly.

820
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,460
We're going to do something.

821
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,460
Exactly.

822
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,460
Exactly.

823
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,460
Exactly.

824
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,460
Exactly.

825
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,460
Master is here.

826
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,460
Master is here.

827
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,460
Stop talking.

828
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,460
Master is here.

829
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,460
Master is here.

830
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,460
Master is here.

831
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,460
What's wrong?

832
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,460
What's the fun?

833
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,460
What's the fun?

834
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,460
What's the fun?

835
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,460
I was waiting for you.

836
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:31,460
What's the fun?

837
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,460
What's the fun?

838
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:33,460
What's the fun?

839
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,460
I know you have a problem.

840
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:35,460
There's a problem.

841
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,460
You're too old.

842
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,460
I've lost my family.

843
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,460
You're still here.

844
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,460
Don't talk.

845
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,460
What's the problem?

846
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,460
Look.

847
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,460
You don't care about the situation.

848
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,460
I'll go out first.

849
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,460
I'll go out first.

850
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,460
What's the problem?

851
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,460
No.

852
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,460
I'll finish this here.

853
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,460
Go.

854
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:55,460
No matter what, you two are all officials.

855
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,460
You're all the master.

856
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:59,460
Mr. Wang, what do I do as a master?

857
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,460
I've lived in the high-rise building.

858
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,460
I don't have a master.

859
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,460
How can I have a master?

860
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,460
That's right.

861
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,460
I've never thought about it.

862
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,460
When I was on that plane,

863
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:11,460
I was watching the waves.

864
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,460
You were not doing anything.

865
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,460
It was a whole day.

866
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,460
Why are you still watching the waves?

867
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,460
I can't say anything.

868
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,460
Mr. Wang, I...

869
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,460
I don't care about the mission.

870
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,460
One is worth two, three is money.

871
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,460
What's the point?

872
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,460
You're talking about the other one.

873
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,460
The other one is a gang of bandits.

874
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,460
That fat man took Dongquan and Xixu

875
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,460
and went there for a while.

876
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,460
It's not a matter of money.

877
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,460
It's a good thing.

878
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,460
We'll see Dongquan and Xixu

879
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,460
and get to the wall.

880
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:36,460
What are you talking about?

881
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,460
We need to find the planning bureau.

882
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,460
I'll go first.

883
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,460
That cop is right.

884
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:41,460
He's strong.

885
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,460
This is not a good idea.

886
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:44,460
It's a good idea.

887
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,460
What do you know?

888
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,460
He's my sister.

889
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,460
What about you?

890
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,460
Do you believe me?

891
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,460
Have you heard that?

892
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,460
That cop said

893
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:53,460
we should get a strong one.

894
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,460
We should get a government one.

895
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,460
We should get a strong one.

896
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,460
Everyone,

897
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,460
listen to the police.

898
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,460
They said we should get a planning bureau.

899
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,460
We should get a planning bureau.

900
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,460
A planning bureau.

901
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:06,460
Why are you so greedy?

902
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,460
Calm down.

903
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:09,460
I'll go first.

904
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,460
I'll go first.

905
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,460
I'll go first.

906
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,460
We'll get a strong one.

907
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,460
We'll get a strong one.

908
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,460
We'll get a strong one.

909
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,460
We'll get a strong one.

910
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:17,460
We'll get a strong one.

911
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,460
Sir, where are we?

912
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,460
We're at the city office.

913
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,460
Where are we?

914
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,460
The chief is coming.

915
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,460
What's going on?

916
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,460
What's going on?

917
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,460
You, you...

918
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,460
I can't.

919
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,460
You are...

920
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,460
You can't even tell

921
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,460
what's going on.

922
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,340
You can't even say it's over.

923
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,940
How can you be with a girl?

924
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,260
I really can't hear you.

925
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:46,500
It's okay.

926
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,020
You...

927
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,140
You can't ask everyone.

928
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:48,540
Okay?

929
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,140
Come on.

930
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:49,740
Come on.

931
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,460
Come on.

932
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,820
Come on.

933
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:52,500
Don't be angry.

934
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,060
Come on.

935
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:53,940
Come on.

936
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:54,940
Jiang Jingbao, Jiang Jingbao.

937
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:55,620
Don't be angry.

938
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:56,300
Don't be angry.

939
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:58,380
Don't be angry.

940
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,500
Well,

941
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,100
the leader of the planning bureau

942
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,260
is in a hurry.

943
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,020
So, Mr. Xu

944
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,460
came to see everyone in person.

945
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,020
If you have any questions,

946
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,380
just tell Mr. Xu.

947
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:11,820
Listen to Mr. Xu first.

948
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:12,460
Say something.

949
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,220
Dear friends,

950
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,220
I'm from the planning bureau.

951
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:17,580
My name is Xu.

952
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,220
You can call me Xu.

953
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:19,940
You know what?

954
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:20,660
I'll solve the problem.

955
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:21,300
You can solve the problem.

956
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,220
You can solve the problem.

957
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:23,420
Don't be angry.

958
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,380
Listen to Mr. Xu.

959
