1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I

5
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,420
Ah

6
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,400
Ah, learning how to

7
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,520
Meet pel officers

8
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,800
What are you going to do?

9
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,760
Runner naked

10
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'll get you some water.

11
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'll add some to your dog's stomach.

12
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'll let you drink water.

13
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
What are you talking about?

14
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Master, be careful.

15
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Master,

16
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
you can't wear a long sleeve like this.

17
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's summer.

18
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Can't you let me clean up?

19
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Stop it. I beg you.

20
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Let me bring this to you.

21
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Let's go.

22
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
There's a dance in the front.

23
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Stay there.

24
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Be careful.

25
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Why are you not here?

26
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Stop it.

27
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Stop it.

28
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Listen,

29
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I agree with you.

30
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
No one can talk.

31
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You two men.

32
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You're fighting each other.

33
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You're fighting.

34
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Is that the case?

35
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Comrade Jinran, he's not a guy.

36
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Who are you talking about?

37
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You're not a guy.

38
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You're so mean.

39
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
How can you talk?

40
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Can you respect me?

41
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Respect?

42
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You're right.

43
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Shut up.

44
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Shut up.

45
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
What did Chen Jingwen say?

46
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Did he let you talk?

47
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Did he let you talk?

48
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Yes, did he let you talk?

49
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Chengguan.

50
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
What's up?

51
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Sun Da had just called.

52
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
He said he was helping the two men.

53
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I told you not to fight.

54
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Calm down.

55
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Stop it.

56
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Stop it.

57
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Stop it.

58
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What's the name of the man?

59
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Is he here or not?

60
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Sun Da said he was a businessman.

61
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm not sure.

62
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
What's up, sir?

63
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Chen Jingwen, you'll be on the way.

64
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Take Li Dawei to see the situation.

65
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The main thing is to see the two people's address.

66
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
They didn't get any information before they got the address.

67
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Just take a look.

68
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's like looking for Luo.

69
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Remember, no matter the situation,

70
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
call me first.

71
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
No problem.

72
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Even if there's a situation,

73
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
don't act rashly.

74
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Do you hear me?

75
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Do you hear me?

76
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Okay.

77
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You just saw her.

78
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Okay, you go first.

79
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yes, sir.

80
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
What's the matter, sir?

81
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Someone's been here.

82
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You're a businessman.

83
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Yes, I'm a businessman.

84
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Where is this?

85
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
This is Luo's top.

86
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
He's been here for a long time.

87
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
He's a businessman.

88
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
He's a good student.

89
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
He's a businessman.

90
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Yes, he is.

91
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Come and have a look.

92
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Stop.

93
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Excuse me.

94
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Excuse me.

95
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Excuse me.

96
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Excuse me.

97
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Excuse me.

98
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Excuse me.

99
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
These people are all in this building?

100
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
No, they are.

101
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
They're all here.

102
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Let them all go.

103
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Okay.

104
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Keep this door open.

105
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Don't bring any people in.

106
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Okay.

107
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Sir.

108
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Should we wait for Xia Fang to arrive in the building?

109
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
We'll have to go there to see you.

110
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
But we should wait for...

111
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Have you ever seen this town?

112
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Or the airfield?

113
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
No.

114
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
But no.

115
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Remember.

116
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
When you're a cop,

117
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
you should be afraid of this.

118
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You should follow me.

119
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You're a nine-eighths-five graduate.

120
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
What kind of cop do you think you are?

121
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Isn't this a major?

122
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You're a cop.

123
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You have to be a civil servant.

124
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You've never been a cop.

125
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You should be a cop first.

126
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
No.

127
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Then there's a lot of traffic.

128
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
That's fine.

129
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's less than three thousand yuan a month.

130
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Less than three thousand?

131
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
How can you live?

132
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You're a cop.

133
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You're a cop.

134
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Then how can you live?

135
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
What do you want to do?

136
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I just want to be a cop.

137
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I've always wanted to be a cop.

138
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I want to be a cop.

139
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I want to die.

140
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Really.

141
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Don't say that.

142
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Are you a little stupid?

143
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
But I'm a little bit of a hero.

144
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm not stupid.

145
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I can do everything.

146
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Really.

147
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You said that the peace and prosperity

148
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
can be achieved by the dream of a career.

149
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Isn't that a cop?

150
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You also want to be a cop.

151
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
If you say that from my mouth,

152
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
it's a little bit ugly.

153
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I've been a cop since I was a kid.

154
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
But I can still be a cop.

155
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Do you know why?

156
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Teachers and students know that I'm good.

157
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I can be annoying and annoying.

158
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I can help.

159
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
My classmates are looking for me.

160
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I told you.

161
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I even gave you the award of courage.

162
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
When I got to the exam,

163
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
my mom saw this situation.

164
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
All right.

165
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Let's be a cop.

166
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
The teachers who are not good at cop can also teach me.

167
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Right?

168
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Sometimes I'm thinking about it.

169
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
If we can do our job in a day,

170
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
it's almost like the mother of society.

171
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Can we achieve a dream?

172
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm so thinking about it.

173
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'm going to be a little bit disappointed.

174
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
But it's okay.

175
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
We are young.

176
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
There is a chance.

177
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
The opportunity is for those who are prepared.

178
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Right?

179
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Yes.

180
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Don't look at me.

181
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Look at me.

182
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm used to it.

183
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'm going to pull you into it.

184
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
What do you want?

185
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm going to the Beijing University.

186
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I've been studying for a long time.

187
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Now,

188
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I can give you some requests.

189
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Right?

190
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
What do you want me to do?

191
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You're a cop.

192
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
How can you give me a job?

193
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Don't shout.

194
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Don't shout.

195
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Don't shout.

196
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You're kids.

197
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Don't shout.

198
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Listen to me.

199
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Come down.

200
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Don't shout.

201
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Don't shout.

202
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Don't shout.

203
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Don't shout.

204
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Why?

205
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Don't look.

206
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I don't know why.

207
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I went out to buy food.

208
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
He was so angry.

209
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
What happened between you two

210
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
before you went out to buy food?

211
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You have to tell me

212
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
that we can help you save your son.

213
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
We just quarreled.

214
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Why quarreled?

215
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
What can we quarrel?

216
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
We were always like this.

217
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
But I didn't expect

218
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
he would threaten me with death this time.

219
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You're a little bit more serious.

220
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Yunhao,

221
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
you just want to dance, right?

222
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Fine.

223
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'll dance with you.

224
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
At least we can die together.

225
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Don't come over.

226
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Don't come over.

227
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
We won't come over.

228
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Move.

229
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Don't move.

230
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Don't come over.

231
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Be careful.

232
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
We won't come over.

233
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
We won't come over.

234
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Calm down.

235
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Calm down.

236
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Calm down.

237
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Calm down.

238
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I won't come over.

239
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I won't come over either.

240
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Do you want to see your son die in front of you?

241
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Don't touch me.

242
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
If you don't want to see him die,

243
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
don't touch him again.

244
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
What's wrong?

245
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You can't say that again.

246
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Yunhao.

247
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Take him away.

248
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Yunhao.

249
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Yunhao.

250
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Don't move.

251
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Don't come over.

252
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
We won't come over.

253
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
What's this police car doing?

254
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
What's this?

255
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
This way.

256
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Every time I come here,

257
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I'm lost.

258
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Brother, you're here.

259
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Sister Ming.

260
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Is it Yunhao?

261
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I heard your mother say

262
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
you just came back from Beijing.

263
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Don't come over.

264
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I won't come over.

265
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I won't come over.

266
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
But I'm a police car.

267
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I have something to protect your life.

268
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You go.

269
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You don't have to protect my life.

270
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
No one has to protect my life.

271
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I have the responsibility

272
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
to protect anyone's life.

273
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You go and protect someone

274
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
who is valuable.

275
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You're just a life

276
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
worth living.

277
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
No.

278
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm not a life.

279
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm just a puppet.

280
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Yunhao.

281
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You're almost graduate.

282
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
How long do you think your mother can manage?

283
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
How can I do after graduation?

284
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
She won't let me go.

285
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
How can she?

286
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
My mother loves to manage me.

287
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
But I've never heard of her.

288
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I haven't contacted her for years.

289
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Really?

290
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Yes.

291
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Not only you,

292
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
but my disciple.

293
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Yunhao.

294
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It's true.

295
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Not only my master,

296
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
but also me.

297
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm also a book in Beijing.

298
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I'm also a master at the university.

299
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
But since I was a kid,

300
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I've been scolded

301
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
by my mother

302
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
by my second mother.

303
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I've been to the North.

304
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I've been scolded by my mother

305
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
by my master.

306
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Yunhao.

307
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Yunhao.

308
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I really understand.

309
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Really.

310
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Don't move!

311
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Later,

312
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I closed my eyes.

313
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I left Beijing.

314
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I left home.

315
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I came here

316
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
to be a police officer.

317
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Did you hear that?

318
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
He's also a scholar.

319
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Yunhao.

320
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
A man

321
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
needs to be controlled by his parents.

322
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
There are many ways.

323
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
You can find

324
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
a job he doesn't like.

325
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Or get

326
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
a wife he doesn't like.

327
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It's okay.

328
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
We've done it.

329
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
You can do it, too.

330
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I can't.

331
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I can't do it.

332
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I can't do it.

333
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You all heard it.

334
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
He's willing to die with me.

335
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
He won't let me go.

336
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Don't think like that.

337
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Only death

338
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
can heal my pain.

339
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Yunhao.

340
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Wait!

341
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Yes.

342
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Yes.

343
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Yunhao.

344
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Who's that?

345
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
You're the one who called.

346
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
You're the one who called.

347
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
We're both here.

348
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I'm sorry.

349
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
You called to call me?

350
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Sun Jianzhuang,

351
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
what's up?

352
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
They're both here.

353
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
What?

354
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
They're in the same room.

355
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
What?

356
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
They're in the same room.

357
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
What do you mean?

358
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
They're in the same room.

359
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
What?

360
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
What's going on?

361
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
What's going on?

362
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
What?

363
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
You're stopping him?

364
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
He's in a hurry.

365
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Hurry up.

366
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Come on.

367
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Take him away.

368
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I'll be back later.

369
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Okay.

370
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
You're holding a knife.

371
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Leave it to me.

372
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Jianzhuang, stop!

373
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Jianzhuang!

374
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Stop!

375
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Don't run!

376
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Don't run!

377
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Don't run!

378
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Don't run!

379
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Don't run!

380
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Stop!

381
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Don't run!

382
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Brother, hold your hand.

383
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Mr. Sun,

384
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
what did I say?

385
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
The opportunity is for someone who has the opportunity.

386
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Call my master.

387
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
The mission is over.

388
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Don't run!

389
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Don't run!

390
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Don't run!

391
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Don't run!

392
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Don't run!

393
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Don't run!

394
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
There are so many people down there.

395
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Who will you go down to now?

396
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Don't run!

397
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
But the injured are innocent.

398
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Don't run!

399
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Don't run!

400
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Don't run!

401
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Don't run!

402
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Don't run!

403
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Let them hide, okay?

404
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Okay.

405
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I'll let them go.

406
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Don't come over.

407
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I'm not going.

408
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
But

409
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I'm telling them

410
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
not to be hurt by you.

411
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Okay?

412
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Get out of the way!

413
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Get out of the way!

414
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Be careful!

415
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Move back!

416
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Yes, get out of the way!

417
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Don't run!

418
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Get out of the way!

419
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Get out of the way!

420
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Get out of the way!

421
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Get out of the way!

422
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Get out of the way!

423
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Get out of the way!

424
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Get out of the way!

425
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Miss, don't move.

426
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Wait here.

427
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Stand up.

428
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Remember, don't move.

429
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Okay.

430
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Move.

431
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Don't move!

432
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Don't run!

433
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Don't run!

434
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Don't run!

435
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Don't be so anxious.

436
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Stand up!

437
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Stand up!

438
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Stop!

439
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Move back!

440
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Move back!

441
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
The biggest problem is that

442
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
the money is being sold.

443
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
When you get in,

444
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
they'll press a button.

445
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
When you get to the back,

446
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
there's nothing else.

447
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
That's all.

448
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
They can't run this time.

449
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Thank you for your hard work.

450
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Thank you.

451
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Thank you.

452
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Thank you.

453
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Thank you.

454
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Thank you.

455
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
It's all right, it's all right.

456
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Thank you, guys.

457
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Thank you, Mr. He.

458
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Thank you, Mr. He.

459
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
It's all right, it's what we should do.

460
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Thank you.

461
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
You're welcome.

462
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Thank you.

463
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Thank you.

464
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I'll give you a hand.

465
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Here you go.

466
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Thank you, Mr. He.

467
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Thank you, guys.

468
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Thank you.

469
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
It's all right,

470
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
we should do this.

471
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Thank you.

472
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Come on.

473
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Get up.

474
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Thank you.

475
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
No problem.

476
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Thank you.

477
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Brother,

478
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
hand.

479
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
It's okay.

480
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Let me wrap it.

481
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
This is the school of the Qin-Nagg-Dou.

482
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It's the basic skill.

483
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
These two little cats.

484
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I admire you.

485
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I'll sit here.

486
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Just have a look.

487
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Let's go.

488
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Let's go.

489
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Get in.

490
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Get in.

491
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Don't move.

492
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Master,

493
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I'm in a hurry.

494
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Dongyuan.

495
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Dongyuan.

496
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Stop.

497
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Stop.

498
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Stop.

499
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Stop.

500
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Get in.

501
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
What are you doing?

502
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I'm in a hurry.

503
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I'm in a hurry.

504
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I'm in a hurry.

505
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
What are you doing?

506
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Don't move.

507
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Get in.

508
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Don't move.

509
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Don't move.

510
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Get in.

511
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I'm in a hurry.

512
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Get in.

513
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Don't move.

514
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Don't move.

515
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Get in.

516
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Get in.

517
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Get in.

518
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
No, the police.

519
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Get in.

520
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Get in.

521
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
The police is not my business.

522
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I'm a worker.

523
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Go back to the dorm.

524
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I'm a kid.

525
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Please come.

526
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
The kids are here.

527
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Ask the family to contact the house.

528
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Ask the family to take him.

529
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Chen Su.

530
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I can do this.

531
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
You decide.

532
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Okay.

533
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Ask them.

534
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Help the family.

535
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Help the family.

536
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Don't cry.

537
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
What's your name?

538
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Mr. Wen.

539
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
The police told me to call Xiang Cui Huan.

540
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I'm a worker.

541
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I know nothing.

542
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I'm innocent.

543
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Put your hand away.

544
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Call your family.

545
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Come to pick up the kids.

546
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Let's go.

547
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
You're right.

548
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
The workers are not in a good place.

549
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Is this place for kids?

550
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Yes.

551
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Look, the police.

552
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
My kid is so small.

553
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I can't take him anywhere.

554
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I can't earn money in the village.

555
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
The family can wait for dinner.

556
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I can't do anything.

557
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Give me a way, okay?

558
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I can't do anything.

559
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Let's go.

560
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Come.

561
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Okay.

562
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
We won't be wronged.

563
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
But you have to go back with us.

564
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
It shows the situation.

565
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
You can cooperate with the investigation.

566
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
As long as the investigation is proved to you,

567
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
you'll be fine.

568
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
You can come back.

569
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
No.

570
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Look, the police.

571
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I'm so small.

572
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
What if I go in?

573
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
What will he do?

574
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Okay, don't look.

575
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Do you have anyone else in the school?

576
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Let them come to pick up the kids.

577
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Don't worry.

578
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
If you're really innocent,

579
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
you can come out right away.

580
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
But you have to tell me now.

581
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I'll take care of him these days.

582
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I...

583
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I have a husband.

584
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
But...

585
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I'm so small.

586
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I can't leave my mom.

587
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I can't let the kid come with you.

588
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Tell me your husband's phone number.

589
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Xiaoxi, do you have a problem?

590
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
No problem.

591
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I'll contact his husband now

592
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
to pick up the kid.

593
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Take him here.

594
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Okay.

595
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
We'll sit down and go back.

596
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Xiaoxi, Zhige.

597
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
You two stay here.

598
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
We'll go with Xiajie.

599
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I'll go home after I'm done.

600
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Okay.

601
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Take care.

602
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
One, two, three, five.

603
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
One, two, three, five.

604
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Okay, stop crying.

605
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Just tell the police about the situation.

606
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Okay.

607
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I'll go.

608
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Okay.

609
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I'll go.

610
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Just tell the police about the situation.

611
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Sister,

612
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I saw you as a good person.

613
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
You don't know that.

614
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Shut up.

615
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Brother Zhigang, let him talk.

616
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I haven't been in the car for three years.

617
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I've been in the car for several times.

618
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
When I was in the first year,

619
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I...

620
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I did it well for a year.

621
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I didn't even have a chance to go home.

622
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I really wanted to jump off the river.

623
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Don't tell the story.

624
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I'm telling the truth.

625
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I went to the palace to make a boat.

626
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
The boat can only make five cents.

627
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I must make a thousand.

628
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I've broken both my hands.

629
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I wanted to make a little money.

630
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
But when I was in the car,

631
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
the public loan was deducted half of my money.

632
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
They said you could pay the money

633
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
with your daughter.

634
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I'm so thirsty.

635
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
If the family knew that I went to the palace,

636
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I wouldn't have survived.

637
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I really had no choice.

638
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I didn't want to go anywhere else.

639
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Come down.

640
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Come down.

641
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Sun,

642
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
buy them some new clothes.

643
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Okay.

644
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Thank you.

645
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
It's okay, brother.

646
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Master,

647
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I'll give Brother Sun a hand.

648
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
He can't deal with it.

649
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
You're dead!

650
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I'm going to kill you!

651
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
What's wrong with me?

652
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
What's wrong with you?

653
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
What's wrong with you?

654
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
You just made a decision with me, right?

655
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
You listened to me.

656
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
You have something to do.

657
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
You should report it to the master first, right?

658
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
How did I tell you before you left the palace?

659
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
You should tell your master.

660
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
You should emphasize it.

661
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Right?

662
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Let you go first.

663
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
You should know the situation.

664
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
No matter what the situation is,

665
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
don't move your hands.

666
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Call me.

667
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
All the things you said

668
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
are all taken by Xie Beitong, right?

669
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
No,

670
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
the thing is

671
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
they were in the same box

672
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
and were about to escape.

673
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
It's too late if you don't catch them.

674
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Xiangtang is a hero.

675
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Xiang Di is a bowler.

676
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

677
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Xiang Di is a bowler.

678
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Why did you do this to me?

679
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
What's the problem?

680
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
He's holding a knife in his hand.

681
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Do you know that?

682
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
He has a knife in his hand.

683
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
He's in your room.

684
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
He can't understand you.

685
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
What are you afraid of?

686
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Tell me.

687
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Li Dawei,

688
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
get out of here!

689
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
And you!

690
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Get out of here!

691
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Who are you calling?

692
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
If you say so,

693
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
how can I get out of here?

694
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Why are you going?

695
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
What's the point of you getting out?

696
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Get out of here!

697
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Get out of here!

698
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Uncle Yang,

699
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
what's the matter?

700
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I don't know.

701
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
My master and I just saved one person.

702
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
What a coincidence.

703
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
We just caught one person.

704
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
You said that

705
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
it's not good to save people

706
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
and to catch people.

707
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
What should the police do?

708
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Get out of here!

709
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Get out of here!

710
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Go over there!

711
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Don't be so rude.

712
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Go to the top!

713
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I don't want to see you getting in the way.

714
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I don't want to see you

715
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
getting my blood pressure higher.

716
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Your master...

717
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Who's master?

718
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Your master!

719
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
You're the only one who talks a lot.

720
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Who's master?

721
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
You don't know him.

722
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
You're so kind.

723
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
You want to be a hero, right?

724
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Let me tell you.

725
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Your master was much more

726
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
a hero than you.

727
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Lin Lin,

728
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
there was a girl

729
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
who wanted to jump into the building.

730
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
She made your master catch her.

731
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
She was in danger.

732
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
She caught the girl

733
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
desperately.

734
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
But the girl

735
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
was so desperate.

736
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
She was in a fight

737
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
with her life.

738
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
But your master

739
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
was so desperate to catch her.

740
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Her arm was so weak

741
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
that it was so hard to

742
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
touch the building.

743
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
She was holding on for 20 minutes.

744
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
She couldn't hold on anymore.

745
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
The girl

746
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
slipped down

747
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
from your master's hand

748
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
and died.

749
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
What happened?

750
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
The girl's family said

751
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
your master was a savior.

752
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
She caused the girl's death.

753
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
She was so desperate.

754
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
In the end,

755
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
she gave her master

756
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
a punishment

757
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
and a big sum

758
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
of money

759
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
in the girl's family.

760
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
That's how it ended.

761
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Your master was

762
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
more passionate

763
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
than you.

764
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
He was more impulsive

765
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
than you.

766
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Now,

767
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
he's so cold-hearted.

768
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
He hasn't returned

769
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
to the world.

770
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Li Dawei,

771
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
why

772
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
didn't you listen to your master?

773
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Why didn't you

774
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
listen to your master?

775
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Chief,

776
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
the situation was too urgent.

777
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
No matter how urgent,

778
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
you should have

779
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
a way to deal with it.

780
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Your master told you

781
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
to call someone in advance.

782
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
You should protect

783
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
them.

784
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Do you know that?

785
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Catch them.

786
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
At least,

787
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
four teams are one.

788
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
At least, three teams are one.

789
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
If you don't see them,

790
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
two teams are one.

791
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
You're so good.

792
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
You're going to

793
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
kill them all.

794
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Who is the other team?

795
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
You're a criminal.

796
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
You can't do anything about it.

797
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
If he's a knife,

798
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
he'll kill you.

799
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
What if he's a sword?

800
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Why do you

801
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
make people worry?

802
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Chief,

803
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
if I die,

804
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I won't bother you.

805
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Are you

806
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
your own life?

807
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
If you die,

808
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
what about your parents?

809
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
What if I die

810
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
and become a cop?

811
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Besides,

812
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I'm fine.

813
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
You're fine?

814
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
You've taken my life.

815
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Why did you take my life?

816
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
You're not alone.

817
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
You're carrying Sun Qian Cheng.

818
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
If he's going to deal with

819
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
that person,

820
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I'll have a knife in my hand.

821
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
What should I do?

822
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
He's a cop.

823
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
He's got

824
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
more than 2,000 yuan a month.

825
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
You want to

826
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
make him die?

827
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Do you know

828
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
why I'm going to

829
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
play a role in your life?

830
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I just want to teach you

831
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
how to be a cop

832
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
and protect yourself.

833
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
You can't even protect yourself.

834
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Can you protect the people?

835
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
A hero is a hero.

836
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Not a hero.

837
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
It's a dog.

838
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
It's a dog.

839
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Uncle Yang,

840
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I know

841
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
that waiting for the fire to come

842
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
and then start the operation

843
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
is what your master means.

844
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Chief,

845
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
the situation at the moment...

846
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Okay.

847
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I know

848
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
your master better.

849
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
It's just like

850
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
when I told you

851
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
about the division of the master and the disciple.

852
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
It's just like

853
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
when I told you

854
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
about the division of the master and the disciple.

855
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
It's just like

856
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
when I told you about the division of the master

857
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
and the disciple.

858
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
You want to learn from the disciple?

859
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Uncle Yang,

860
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
you're the senior student of the law school.

861
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
You're here

862
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
to attend our

863
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Paris Heurents.

864
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
You want to

865
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
use your theory

866
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
as a trial?

867
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
So I hope

868
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
you two

869
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
can learn

870
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
from the disciple

871
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
in real time.

872
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
In the future,

873
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
if you don't believe me,

874
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
you can say that

875
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I'm the one who's going to kill you.

876
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Okay.

877
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I've been a police officer

878
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
for over 30 years.

879
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I may not be a good police officer,

880
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
but I'm sure

881
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
I'm a good cook.

882
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I've always told my master

883
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
that

884
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
you can send me

885
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
to the police station

886
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
every day.

887
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I don't want to

888
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
go to the police station

889
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
every year.

890
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
You made a mistake.

891
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
There's still a chance.

892
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
If you lose your life,

893
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
you'll lose everything.

894
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Understand?

895
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Yes.

896
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
What if you meet

897
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
a non-reliant person?

898
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Non-reliant person?

899
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Xia Jie.

900
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Xia Jie's father

901
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
met a non-reliant person

902
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
and he was in a hurry.

903
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
He was in a hurry.

904
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
He left.

905
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
How hard

906
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Xia Jie and his mother

907
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
are living?

908
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Remember,

909
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
not only do you have to

910
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
work hard,

911
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
but also live a life of love.

912
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Understand?

913
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Yes.

914
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Yes.

915
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Your master

916
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
is really a disciple of yours.

917
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
He's gone.

918
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Wait.

919
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Where's my phone?

920
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
It's in my bag.

921
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Here.

922
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Look.

923
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
This is a small house.

924
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
How cute.

925
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
We're

926
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
a family of the non-reliant.

927
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
So,

928
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
it's not a big deal to go to work.

929
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Look.

930
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Master.

931
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
This is a big deal.

932
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
It's a big deal?

933
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
It's too high, right?

934
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Okay.

935
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Then tell me.

936
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Whose window

937
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
is going to break a glass?

938
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Do you think it's a big deal or a small deal?

939
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Master,

940
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
you're too high.

941
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
This glass is broken.

942
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
It must be a small deal.

943
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Yes.

944
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
It's a small deal.

945
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
But it will eventually

946
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
cause a big fire

947
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
if you don't pay attention.

948
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
A few years ago,

949
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
we had this kind of situation.

950
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
One of them

951
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
broke a glass

952
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
in their toilet window.

953
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I've reminded them

954
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
that this family has been lazy

955
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
for several times.

956
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
They've been lazy for a long time.

957
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
One night,

958
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
they entered a person

959
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
from this window

960
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
and stole something.

961
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
In the end,

962
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
they forced the owner of the house.

963
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Do you think it's a big deal or a small deal?

964
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
It's so serious.

965
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Don't think

966
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
that our society is not important.

967
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
We only need to

968
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
work in the front.

969
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
We need to help the people

970
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
to find out what's wrong.

971
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Then we can do the housework.

972
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Okay?

973
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
What's going on?

974
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
We can't drink

975
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
the two of them this time.

976
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
What?

977
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
We're in a hurry.

978
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Don't you know that

979
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
we're taking these people

980
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
as our treasure?

981
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Who are you talking about?

982
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
This is a new guy.

983
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Dr. Li and Dr. Xia.

984
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Don't say that.

985
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
These two guys

986
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
are really capable.

987
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
One caught one.

988
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
The other saved one.

989
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
This is a letter from the chief.

990
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Jie,

991
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
let's go first.

992
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Okay.

993
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Master.

994
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Didn't they

995
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
do the housework?

996
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
How could they do that?

997
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
They must have been

998
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
doing it on purpose.

999
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
They're threatening us.

1000
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Master.

1001
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I'll take care of it.

1002
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Okay, okay.

1003
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Okay.

1004
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Don't talk.

1005
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Don't be anxious.

1006
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
This is a new guy.

1007
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
He's a girl.

1008
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
He's a girl.

1009
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
My daughter is only seven years old.

1010
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
My husband never brought a child.

1011
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Can you let me call him?

1012
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I can't help you.

1013
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I'm just a girl.

1014
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
You can't talk to anyone

1015
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
before he's seven years old.

1016
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I can't help you.

1017
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Don't worry.

1018
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Or you can help me.

1019
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Get off.

1020
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
My daughter is too young.

1021
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
He's too young.

1022
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
I don't want to help you.

1023
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
It's a rule.

1024
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Please.

1025
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Let's go.

1026
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
You can call my husband.

1027
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Okay?

1028
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Please.

1029
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Please call my husband.

1030
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Okay?

1031
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
You...

1032
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Please.

1033
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Call my husband.

1034
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Go.

1035
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
What are you doing?

1036
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Let go of my hand.

1037
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Go.

1038
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Do you hear me?

1039
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
They're pretending to be old.

1040
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
They're selling their lives.

1041
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Don't trust them.

1042
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
How long have you been here?

1043
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
A long time.

1044
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
What did he say to you?

1045
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Master,

1046
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
are we too biased to the suspect?

1047
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I'm not biased.

1048
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I'm experienced.

1049
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
You'll know what's going on

1050
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
when you see more people like him.

1051
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
The suspect needs a female agent.

1052
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
You go to the royal family.

1053
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I'll wait for you at the funeral.

1054
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
I didn't expect my master to be so pitiful.

1055
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Where's your master?

1056
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
He's not home.

1057
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
By the way,

1058
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
what happened to the rent you mentioned?

1059
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
What's the problem?

1060
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I was thinking about the dormitory.

1061
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
The only thing I could do was to move.

1062
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I was so nervous.

1063
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I'm sure I could rent a house.

1064
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I can imagine.

1065
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I was separated into ten houses

1066
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
and my father rented a house there.

1067
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Now that I'm in Paris,

1068
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
the house is gone.

1069
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I don't have time to look for a house.

1070
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I'll just stay here.

1071
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
The friend from Beijing is a cook.

1072
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
I'm looking for a house.

1073
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
I'll move it in as soon as I find a suitable one.

1074
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Then don't look for it.

1075
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
I have a house.

1076
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
You can stay with me.

1077
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
I'll stay with you.

1078
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
What house do you live in?

1079
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Isn't your home here?

1080
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
A sentence changes the situation.

1081
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
My mom is worried about me

1082
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
working too hard.

1083
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
She's too tired.

1084
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
She's the one who's the boss.

1085
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
She's the one who's the boss.

1086
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
She's the one who's the boss.

1087
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
She's the one who's the boss.

1088
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
She's the one who's the boss.

1089
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Let's just leave it to her.

1090
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,000
My mom is a rich man.

1091
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
But she's not a rich man.

1092
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
She's a hard worker.

1093
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I'm just thinking of finding a suitable one

1094
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
to separate the house

1095
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
and reduce her stress.

1096
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Is that settled?

1097
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I'm a little impressed

1098
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
with her.

1099
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Where are you from?

1100
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
I've been impressed by you.

1101
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
I don't know.

1102
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I just think

1103
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
you're a good person.

1104
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Are you saying I'm not a good person?

1105
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
I'm not saying you're not a good person.

1106
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I'm saying

1107
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
you're optimistic.

1108
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
We

1109
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
have different education.

1110
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I grew up in a good way.

1111
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I'm used to it.

1112
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Actually, what you said

1113
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
is true.

1114
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
I've heard it.

1115
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Did you say you want to get her

1116
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
in the contract?

1117
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Yes.

1118
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Go ahead.

1119
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Do you want to buy a house together?

1120
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
What house?

1121
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Money?

1122
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Nonsense.

1123
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Why don't you spend money on the house?

1124
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
I don't.

1125
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
I...

1126
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I have relatives in the city.

1127
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I heard

1128
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
you two have a divorce.

1129
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
What's wrong with your hand?

1130
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Why are you injured?

1131
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
What's wrong with your hand?

1132
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
I don't know why you called me

1133
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
but you scolded me

1134
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
and scolded me.

1135
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
You even scolded Uncle Yang?

1136
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
I heard from the police

1137
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
that

1138
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
he was scolded

1139
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
by the person who looked at him.

1140
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Are you serious?

1141
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Why don't I believe you?

1142
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
You're like that.

1143
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
You're like that.

1144
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
You're like that.

1145
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
No way.

1146
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
If I really can't see you,

1147
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I won't ask you

1148
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
to do this crime.

1149
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Look at me.

1150
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I've been in the police department for a long time.

1151
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I've been in the police department

1152
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
every day except for the monitoring.

1153
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Today,

1154
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
it's not easy to get into the police department

1155
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
and I've done a big thing.

1156
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
What's the matter?

1157
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Two young girls

1158
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
sent a pregnant cat

1159
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
to the hospital.

1160
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
My master also

1161
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
paid 200 yuan for the check.

1162
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Besides the cat,

1163
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
it's the cat.

1164
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
It can't even be seen for the whole life.

1165
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
How can it be so easy to get into the police department?

1166
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
I'm sorry.

1167
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
I'm sorry.

1168
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I'm sorry.

1169
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
I'm sorry.

1170
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
I'm sorry.

1171
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I'm sorry.
