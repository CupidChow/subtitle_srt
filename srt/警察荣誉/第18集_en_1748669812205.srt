00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:01:00,000
sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure

3
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,260
Now, with those

4
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,080
Ladies and Gentlemen,

5
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:14,940
We à la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la

6
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It's none of your business.

7
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
What are you doing?

8
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It has nothing to do with you.

9
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Say it again!

10
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's my fault.

11
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It has nothing to do with you.

12
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Don't care about me!

13
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm your dad!

14
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It has nothing to do with me!

15
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Is this where the real boy came from?

16
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It has nothing to do with me.

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Why?

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Why do you care about me?

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It has nothing to do with me!

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's because I'm your dad!

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Don't you understand?

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You're my dad.

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You think you're my dad now?

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You're my dad.

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
What have you done for me?

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Where are you when I'm most afraid?

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I can't sleep.

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm hiding in my bed all night.

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Where are you?

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm begging you.

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Don't divorce me.

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Why don't you think of me?

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
What?

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I feel ashamed of you now.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Come here and get dressed and get married.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And you're going to teach me a lesson.

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's late!

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Chief!

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Chief!

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Chief!

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Chief!

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yes, you're right.

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You're right.

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Listen to me.

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
After you finish,

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
you can do whatever you want.

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Listen to me.

48
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You're right.

49
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's my fault.

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm not good.

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
If you're willing to do anything,

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
you can do it.

53
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Come on.

54
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You can beat me.

55
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Okay?

56
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
But dad, you're the only daughter.

57
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm not your only family.

58
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
We used to be good friends.

59
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
When we were kids,

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
you'd play with your dad.

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You'd take your dad to the streets.

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You'd ride a horse.

63
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
What are we going to do now?

64
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You can go to work.

65
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
No problem.

66
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
But this is where you're going to be.

67
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You'll ruin it

68
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
when you get in.

69
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You know?

70
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You like drawing, right?

71
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Isn't it good?

72
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You go.

73
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
If we don't have enough water bottles,

74
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
you can go to Beijing.

75
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You can go to foreign countries.

76
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Dad has no money.

77
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
He just wants food.

78
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I just sell my waist.

79
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I just sell my body.

80
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I just sell my body.

81
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I just sell my body.

82
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I support you, okay?

83
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm grown up now.

84
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I don't need anyone else.

85
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I want to learn.

86
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Don't care what I rely on.

87
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'll make money anyway.

88
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You can go.

89
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's not good to have a police officer here.

90
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Chen Jiajia, are you there?

91
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Chen Jiajia, I'm telling you.

92
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
If you go to Beijing,

93
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'll beat you up.

94
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Are you okay?

95
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Go ahead.

96
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Go for a try.

97
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Go ahead.

98
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You think I don't know

99
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
what happened

100
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
in this kind of place?

101
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Isn't it the thing

102
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
that Zheng Jia should do?

103
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
But do I have other options?

104
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Do I have other options?

105
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Tell me.

106
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Do I have a home?

107
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I don't have one.

108
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Jiajia!

109
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm sorry, dad.

110
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,200
Why taking so long?

111
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,500
She won't go to Guang��ing.

112
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
He has to go to my 석ala tomorrow morning.

113
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I want to take her to go to her dressing room.

114
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You need to go to the office tomorrow.

115
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
My neighbor uses the bakery

116
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
to cook prepare vegetables.

117
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
My boyfriend from Guangdess

118
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
comes every so many times.

119
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,160
But I need my travel

120
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
when it gets though the country.

121
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You know?

122
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I've taught you.

123
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
For this kind of thing,

124
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
we can't control the police.

125
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's not like we can control the police.

126
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Otherwise, we can't solve the case.

127
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Right?

128
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Chief, why are you here?

129
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Chief.

130
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Yes?

131
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What's the matter?

132
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Did you stay with your master today?

133
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Yes.

134
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Did he have any abnormal actions?

135
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Chief, what happened to my master?

136
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I can't contact him now.

137
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
He called me.

138
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
He didn't answer my calls.

139
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
He sent me a message.

140
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
He didn't reply.

141
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
When he came this afternoon,

142
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
he came home to ask for leave.

143
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm a little worried.

144
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Before he went to the lock,

145
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
he received a call from someone he didn't know.

146
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
He was not in the right mood.

147
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Don't look at me.

148
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Chief, it's not my fault.

149
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Chen is a good guy.

150
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
He's a good guy.

151
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
If I get involved in this,

152
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I won't be suitable.

153
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'll do it.

154
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Chief, I'm his apprentice.

155
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
If there's any problem,

156
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
it's okay if he's guilty.

157
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Well,

158
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I can find your master's only clue.

159
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
He's his ex-wife and his daughter.

160
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I guess that

161
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
he can't get along

162
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
with them.

163
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Especially his ex-wife.

164
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
She's far away from our colleagues

165
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
after she divorced.

166
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
She's not in the mood to do this with me.

167
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
She's never seen me.

168
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I can do this.

169
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Coming.

170
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Is Auntie Shang here?

171
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
She's looking for her wife.

172
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Wait a minute.

173
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Come in.

174
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Who are you looking for?

175
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Auntie Shang,

176
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm from the Paris Bar.

177
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm Chen Jincheng's apprentice.

178
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'd like to meet Jiajia's sister.

179
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
She's not at home?

180
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Didn't your master go to look for Jiajia?

181
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
My master went to look for Jiajia?

182
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Yes.

183
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
But she's lost her connection

184
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
with us.

185
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
We can't contact her now.

186
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Has Jiajia's sister come back?

187
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
No.

188
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I thought Jiajia was with your master.

189
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Who?

190
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
She's looking for Jiajia.

191
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Let's go.

192
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I can't tell you all the details.

193
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Shang,

194
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
we're in a tight spot.

195
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
We need to contact her.

196
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
But I really don't know where she is.

197
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Let's go.

198
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Master,

199
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
please answer the phone.

200
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Answer the phone.

201
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Answer the phone.

202
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Answer the phone.

203
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Hello?

204
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Hello, master?

205
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Master?

206
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Tell me.

207
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Where are you?

208
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm at the bar.

209
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Hello?

210
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Hello?

211
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Hello?

212
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Please, please, please.

213
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Hello, master?

214
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm Dawei.

215
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Where are you?

216
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm here to see you.

217
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
What?

218
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Bumpung Street?

219
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,360
Wo o of

220
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Brother,

221
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
go home to sleep.

222
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Close the door now.

223
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Brother, brother.

224
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Big brother!

225
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Big brother!

226
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Master! Master!

227
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Big brother, you know him?

228
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Yes, yes, yes.

229
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Please take care of him.

230
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
What?

231
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
We haven't finished yet.

232
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'll do it.

233
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
56.

234
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Okay.

235
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Is it a small number?

236
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It's enough.

237
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Okay, okay.

238
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Please help yourself.

239
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'll take you there.

240
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Master,

241
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Master, you're up.

242
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
He's off work.

243
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Master,

244
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
this is for me.

245
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Come, come, come.

246
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Come here again.

247
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
No, no, no.

248
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
We're not coming.

249
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Let's go home.

250
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Li Ta-min.

251
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You...

252
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Why are you here?

253
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm here to pick you up.

254
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Come, come, come.

255
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Just come.

256
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Come on, come on.

257
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Okay, okay.

258
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Sit down.

259
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Master, have a drink.

260
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Master, you're already here.

261
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Let's go back first.

262
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Go back, go back.

263
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I...

264
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm here to give you some information.

265
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's okay.

266
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Who told me?

267
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's okay.

268
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Okay, okay.

269
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I have money.

270
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I can afford it.

271
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You, you, you,

272
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
please help me with the drink.

273
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It's okay, it's okay.

274
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It's okay.

275
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
What's wrong?

276
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Zhao Diwei, you go to bed.

277
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Okay, okay.

278
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Go to bed.

279
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Don't leave.

280
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Don't block the door.

281
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Come on.

282
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Let me see.

283
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It's okay.

284
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
What's wrong?

285
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It's so bitter.

286
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I'll go get it for you.

287
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It's okay, it's okay.

288
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It's okay.

289
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It's okay.

290
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Water.

291
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Water is coming.

292
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Be careful, be careful.

293
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Be careful, don't get sick.

294
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Water.

295
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Water.

296
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Water.

297
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Dawei,

298
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
is your master okay?

299
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
He's drunk.

300
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Is he,

301
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
why did he drink so much?

302
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Dawei, look.

303
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Can we help him?

304
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I don't know.

305
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I just think

306
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
the master doesn't know

307
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
what to do with those dirty things.

308
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
The whole family is dirty.

309
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It's not easy.

310
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
It's okay, you go to bed.

311
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Dawei, thank you for your work.

312
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Okay.

313
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Dawei,

314
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
what's wrong with you?

315
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
We haven't come home yet.

316
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Aunt,

317
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I'm Li Dawei,

318
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
the disciple of Zhen Xingzheng.

319
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
We just met.

320
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Where's Chen Qingcheng?

321
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
My master is not available

322
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
to answer the phone.

323
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Then ask him,

324
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
if his daughter is dying,

325
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
whether he's going to take care of it or not.

326
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Of course, he's going to take care of it.

327
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Then ask him to answer the phone.

328
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Aunt, what's wrong?

329
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
What's the matter?

330
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Tell me first.

331
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I can't find my sister.

332
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
What's wrong?

333
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
What are you doing?

334
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I'll go.

335
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Li Dawei,

336
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
you're here, too.

337
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Drink some more.

338
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
You came to drink with me?

339
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
No, I'm here to spend money.

340
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Hurry up.

341
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
There's a guest over there.

342
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Hurry up.

343
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Hurry up.

344
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I'm sorry.

345
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I've made an appointment with this girl.

346
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
You've made an appointment?

347
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Handsome boy,

348
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
you're so good-looking.

349
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
This is the girl

350
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
who just came here.

351
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
But this single-seater

352
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
will take another charge.

353
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I know. You can go.

354
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Okay.

355
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
This is my name card.

356
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Come again.

357
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Call my phone number.

358
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Okay, don't be afraid.

359
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Hello, Li Dawei.

360
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Don't be afraid.

361
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
My name is Li Dawei.

362
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Your father is the top.

363
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
What are you doing?

364
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I'm calling you.

365
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
You're calling?

366
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Let your boss know.

367
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
You've called the police.

368
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Li Dawei.

369
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Li Dawei.

370
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Jiajia.

371
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I've been your father's disciple

372
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
for months.

373
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I've never seen him

374
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
feel so empty tonight.

375
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
But what does that have to do with you?

376
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
But what does that have to do with me?

377
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Didn't I tell you

378
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
that my master was your father?

379
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,640
Even dad can't do it.

380
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,640
He can still be a master.

381
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,000
Why are you so harsh when you're young?

382
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,840
No matter what, that's your dad.

383
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,640
If you only offer a golden character called dad,

384
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,400
then he is.

385
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,840
If you say that again, I'll beat you.

386
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,720
You beat me?

387
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,800
If you don't, I'll keep saying it.

388
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,640
He doesn't deserve to be a dad.

389
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,320
Jiajia, you've grown up.

390
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,040
If you think your dad is not a good father,

391
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,920
then you're done with it.

392
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,160
Why do you torture him in this way?

393
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,640
That's why I'm here.

394
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,200
What do you want?

395
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,480
What do I want?

396
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,880
I have a dad like that.

397
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,360
I can't blame anyone else.

398
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,360
Since he can't protect me,

399
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,880
I can only rely on myself.

400
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,880
Do you have something to do?

401
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,440
No.

402
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,120
What's your age?

403
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,480
I don't care.

404
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,920
18?

405
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,120
19?

406
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,520
If you're so young, why can't you do it?

407
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,720
Just to be with your dad,

408
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,840
do you have to do this?

409
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,560
Then you're here to hit me.

410
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,640
Don't you want to beat me?

411
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,320
Come on.

412
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,320
How can you do that?

413
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,360
Fine.

414
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,440
I'm not angry with you.

415
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,000
Who calls me your brother?

416
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,840
Who?

417
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,880
You.

418
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,960
Your dad is my master,

419
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,640
and you're the daughter of the bride.

420
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,040
I'm not your brother, who is?

421
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,800
Let's go.

422
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,640
I'll take you home.

423
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,440
You can go back.

424
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,240
Yes.

425
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,520
Wait.

426
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,200
No one is abroad.

427
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,400
You also see this car

428
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,320
before you see it at all.

429
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,200
姪 né.

430
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,080
Don't I eeny?

431
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,360
Weiwei, don't do this!

432
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,800
Weiwei, give me this mic.

433
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,960
Give me a fix for safety program.

434
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,600
Come on, it's okay.

435
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,400
Don't joke with me.

436
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,600
I'm a police officer.

437
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,000
This is a police officer.

438
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,600
Is this the jail?

439
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,000
Is there any yellow?

440
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Is there any poison?

441
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,200
Is there any illegal activity

442
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,600
in the police station?

443
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,600
This is the police's order.

444
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,600
Da Mei,

445
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,600
you're making me think of a plan.

446
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,800
If this person reports to me,

447
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,800
I'm not a police officer.

448
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,800
I'm asking you,

449
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,800
is this important?

450
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,000
Or is our brother's name important?

451
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,600
This is important.

452
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,000
What's the point of joking?

453
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,600
I'm a police officer.

454
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,000
Okay,

455
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,800
you and Qian Cheng don't have to make any decisions.

456
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,000
You just stay here

457
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
and look for your old friends.

458
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,200
Is this okay, brother?

459
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,600
Okay.

460
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,600
I'll do it myself.

461
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,400
What's the problem?

462
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,000
How about this?

463
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
You just kick the bar and leave.

464
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
No, I'm not allowed to leave.

465
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
No, come on.

466
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,000
You can't go in today.

467
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,800
None of your business.

468
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,600
I'm your brother.

469
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,000
Of course I care about you.

470
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,400
You're so thick-skinned.

471
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,200
If you go in,

472
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,000
I'll go find your boss.

473
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,200
What do you want?

474
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,800
You have to ask yourself this.

475
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,600
What's the problem?

476
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,600
What's the problem?

477
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,600
I don't allow you to use this song

478
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,800
to torture my master.

479
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,200
What's your relationship with you?

480
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,600
You said that was my master.

481
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,000
I don't allow anyone to do this to you.

482
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,200
Jia Jia.

483
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,400
You're here.

484
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,000
Why can't I go in?

485
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,400
I'm not going in today.

486
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,200
He's a police officer.

487
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,400
I won't let him in.

488
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,800
No, you don't have to do this.

489
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,600
I'm almost done.

490
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,400
Stop it.

491
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,400
Police officer.

492
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,400
I'm the police officer.

493
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,800
That's the police officer.

494
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,600
Let's call the police.

495
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,400
We'll handle it if there's any police officer.

496
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,800
Where are you?

497
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,000
Boss, you see that?

498
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Jia Jia.

499
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,800
You're the boss here, right?

500
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,600
Who are you?

501
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,400
I'm the police officer from Paris He.

502
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,400
This is my sister.

503
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,800
Do you understand?

504
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,400
Is there any misunderstanding?

505
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,600
You guys keep talking.

506
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,400
Are you crazy?

507
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,800
You're not my brother.

508
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,200
It has nothing to do with me.

509
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,000
He can't control me.

510
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,400
You can't control me.

511
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,400
Sorry, I'm going to work.

512
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,800
We're legal agents.

513
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,000
What's so scary?

514
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,400
I know what you're thinking.

515
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,800
It's not like we're being checked by the police.

516
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,400
I said we're legal agents.

517
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,600
We're going to be filial.

518
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,600
Filial, filial.

519
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,200
Okay.

520
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,400
You guys go down and do your work.

521
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,400
Hurry up.

522
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,800
Move up.

523
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,800
Jia Jia, look.

524
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,400
Look at what happened today.

525
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,400
Come on.

526
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,400
So annoying.

527
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,400
Why do I look so familiar?

528
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,400
Isn't he the one who gave you the table?

529
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,400
You're so mean.

530
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,400
How about this?

531
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,400
Today is your day off.

532
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,400
I'll give you 200 yuan.

533
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,400
I'll call your phone number later.

534
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,400
Go to the backstage and pack up.

535
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,400
You can go back now.

536
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,400
From tomorrow on,

537
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,400
you don't have to come to work.

538
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,400
Boss, what do you want?

539
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,400
What do you mean?

540
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,400
Nothing.

541
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,400
I mean, I don't need you anymore.

542
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,400
I just knew that you were a police officer.

543
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,400
Why didn't you tell me when you came?

544
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,400
He's not my brother.

545
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,400
Boss, sign here.

546
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,400
Is it number three?

547
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,400
It's number six.

548
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,400
Give him the table.

549
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,400
Okay.

550
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,400
He's not my brother.

551
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,400
It's nothing to do with him.

552
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,400
You're so interesting.

553
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,400
He's looking for you.

554
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,400
You still say it's nothing to do with you.

555
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,400
You're taking me to the three-year-old.

556
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,400
Really?

557
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,400
Is the three-year-old's house on the back of the bar?

558
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,400
Where are you going?

559
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,400
I'll drive you there.

560
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,400
Don't follow me.

561
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,400
I'm busy with the car.

562
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,400
Okay, okay.

563
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,400
The police are here.

564
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,400
Call the police.

565
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,400
Get in the car.

566
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,400
Who are you?

567
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,400
Don't bother me.

568
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,400
Listen to me.

569
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,400
I can't control you.

570
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,400
If you're sad about my master,

571
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,400
I'll have to control you.

572
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,400
Do you know that's my master?

573
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,400
I don't allow anyone to do this.

574
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,400
Even if you can't do it,

575
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,400
get in the car.

576
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,400
Mom.

577
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,400
Dad.

578
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,400
I've been busy these days.

579
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,400
I didn't call you.

580
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,400
Are you okay?

581
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,400
I went to Lijiang with your uncle Liang today.

582
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,400
It's your uncle Liang's car.

583
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,400
Your aunt and aunt's uncle went there too.

584
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,400
It's good.

585
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,400
Aunt and aunt are with you.

586
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,400
I'm relieved.

587
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:09,400
Your aunt and aunt are going to the west side.

588
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,400
Your aunt and aunt are going to the west side.

589
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,400
I'm worried about you.

590
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,400
I'm worried about you.

591
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,400
I'm worried about you.

592
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,400
Your aunt and your uncle Liang

593
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,400
are going to make me stay longer.

594
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,400
By the way,

595
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,400
I hit you with a little bit of cash yesterday.

596
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,400
You should spend it.

597
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,400
Don't be angry.

598
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,400
I'll get you a month's rent.

599
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,400
You can have a good time with your aunt.

600
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,400
Rent?

601
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,400
Your uncle Liang said

602
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,400
he could arrange a house for you.

603
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,400
Mom,

604
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,400
I'll get you a month's rent.

605
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,400
I'll get you a month's rent.

606
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,400
It's convenient to live our own house.

607
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,400
You can make money.

608
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,400
You just sent the salary yesterday.

609
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,400
I didn't get the salary.

610
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,400
Don't worry.

611
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,400
We can get it back

612
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,400
when the year comes.

613
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,400
Let me go.

614
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,400
Let me go.

615
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,400
You can't do that.

616
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,400
I have to protect your safety.

617
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,400
Do you know that?

618
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,400
What's going on?

619
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,400
Xia Jie.

620
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,400
I knew you were here.

621
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,400
This is...

622
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,400
Xia Jie.

623
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,400
Jia Jia.

624
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,400
You've grown up so much.

625
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,400
I almost didn't recognize you.

626
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,400
You know each other?

627
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,400
I'll stop talking.

628
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,400
Xia Jie is like me.

629
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,400
She's also a police officer

630
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,400
in the police department of Paris.

631
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,400
Xia Jie.

632
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,400
You're a police officer.

633
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,400
Yes.

634
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,400
You think I'm not like a police officer?

635
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,400
Yes.

636
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,400
You are...

637
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,400
Xia Jie.

638
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,400
Tell David to leave.

639
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,400
Don't follow me all day.

640
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,400
Okay.

641
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,400
I can't follow you.

642
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,400
Then you can tell Xia Jie.

643
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,400
Tell her well.

644
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,400
Why don't you go to the department office?

645
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,400
Why do you want to go to the bar?

646
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,400
Why do you want me to be sad?

647
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,400
I'm doing my job.

648
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,400
It has nothing to do with my dad.

649
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,400
Okay.

650
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,400
I'll go to the office.

651
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,400
Jia Jia.

652
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,400
Go to my room and sit for a while.

653
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,400
Okay.

654
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,400
Remember to call your mom.

655
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,400
Don't make her worry.

656
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,400
Okay.

657
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,400
And you.

658
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,400
Hello?

659
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,400
What's up?

660
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,400
Where are you going?

661
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,400
I'm in the supermarket.

662
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,400
I'll buy some snacks for you.

663
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,400
What do you want to eat and drink?

664
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,400
That's great.

665
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,400
Jia Jia said she wanted to make a drawing.

666
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,400
We wanted you to go out

667
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,400
and buy some drawing products for her.

668
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,400
Okay.

669
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,400
What do you need?

670
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,400
She said she wanted to draw a plastic bottle.

671
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,400
She wants 3H, HB,

672
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,400
2B, 4B, and 1000B.

673
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,400
Oh, right.

674
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,400
And the plastic bottle.

675
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,400
Whatever you want.

676
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,400
Okay.

677
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,400
I'll go to the office.

678
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,400
I'll go to the office.

679
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,400
I'll buy whatever you want.

680
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,400
Okay.

681
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,400
I'll buy whatever you want.

682
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,400
Okay.

683
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,400
You're back.

684
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,400
Yes.

685
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,400
Look at what Jia Jia drew for me.

686
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,400
Okay?

687
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,400
That's great, Jia Jia.

688
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,400
And this is so good.

689
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,400
Draw one for me too.

690
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,400
It'll look better with professional pen.

691
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,400
That's not necessary.

692
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,400
Jia Jia drew a beautiful one.

693
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,400
She's so ugly.

694
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,400
It'll be hard to draw.

695
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,400
What are you talking about?

696
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,400
That kid.

697
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,400
I bought professional pen for you.

698
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,400
Come on.

699
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,400
Let's see if it fits.

700
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,400
This one is fine, right?

701
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,400
This pen, right?

702
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,400
The blue one is here.

703
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,400
I think both hands are good.

704
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,400
But the finger is too sharp.

705
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,400
Don't move.

706
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,400
Is there a little bit of impact?

707
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,400
Or this?

708
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,400
Don't move.

709
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,400
The more you move, the more you get annoyed.

710
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,400
You're talking to the kid.

711
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,400
You're so disobedient.

712
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,400
Jia Jia,

713
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,400
can you see my clothes?

714
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,400
Do you want to make it?

715
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,400
Don't talk nonsense.

716
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,400
Let her draw it.

717
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,400
Or you can give me a book.

718
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,400
I'll be more cultured.

719
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,400
Hurry up and draw it, Jia Jia.

720
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,400
Draw it the uglier the better.

721
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,400
Okay, you can move.

722
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,400
Let me see.

723
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,400
No.

724
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,400
You drew it for me.

725
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,400
You won't let me see.

726
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,400
I won't.

727
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,400
What did you draw?

728
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,400
Sister, I...

729
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,400
You're so funny.

730
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,400
I won't.

731
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,400
Be careful not to get hit.

732
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,400
Give it to me.

733
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,400
You're so naughty.

734
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,400
Look how I'm cleaning it.

735
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,400
I'll wait.

736
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,400
Why are you here?

737
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,400
Jia Jia,

738
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,400
can you relax for me?

739
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,400
Mom,

740
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,400
didn't you promise me

741
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,400
to sleep with Sister Jia tonight?

742
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,400
Jia Jia,

743
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,400
it's so small in the house.

744
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,400
I'm afraid you won't sleep well tonight.

745
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,400
I'm worried about your mom.

746
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,400
I'll take you back.

747
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,400
Mr. Yu,

748
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,400
if you say so,

749
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,400
I'm afraid I'll have to reflect on it.

750
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,400
Although we're small,

751
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,400
Jia Jia is with us.

752
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,400
She's having fun.

753
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,400
And she's released today.

754
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,400
She has the right to decide

755
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,400
where to stay tonight.

756
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,400
Am I right, Auntie Shang?

757
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,400
Yes.

758
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,400
Jia Jia,

759
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,400
I think

760
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,400
you should go home with your mom.

761
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,400
You're not at home.

762
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,400
I'm worried about you.

763
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,400
Auntie Shang,

764
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,400
I'm Xia Jie.

765
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,400
You still remember me, right?

766
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,400
Jia Jia often played with me when we were kids.

767
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,400
Don't worry.

768
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,400
We'll take care of her.

769
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,400
Yes, we're all police.

770
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,400
We're the safest

771
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,400
with the police.

772
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,400
Am I right?

773
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,400
Then...

774
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,400
stay here.

775
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,400
Listen to me.

776
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,400
Don't make trouble for others.

777
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,400
Got it?

778
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,400
Yes.

779
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,400
Let's go.

780
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,400
Goodbye.

781
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,400
Sorry to bother you.

782
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,400
It's okay.

783
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,400
Goodbye.

784
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,400
Goodbye.

785
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,400
Goodbye.

786
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,400
Xia Jie.

787
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,400
No.

788
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,400
Don't touch me.

789
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,400
Jia Jia.

790
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,400
Wake up.

791
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,400
Jia Jia.

792
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,400
Jia Jia.

793
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,400
I'm so sorry.

794
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,400
I can't believe you.

795
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,400
I'm just worried that

796
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,400
your mom will forgive you.

797
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,400
No, I'm not.

798
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,400
It's all right.

799
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,400
I'm worried about you.

800
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,400
I don't care if you're going to do that.

801
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,400
I'm sorry.

802
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,400
I'm sorry.

803
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,400
I'm worried about you.

804
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,400
I'm sorry.

805
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,400
I'm sorry.

806
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,400
Don't be scared.

807
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,400
Don't be scared.

808
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,400
Sister.

809
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,400
What's wrong?

810
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,400
Don't cry. You're at my house.

811
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,400
What's wrong? It's only 5 o'clock.

812
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,400
What are you two doing?

813
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,400
Go, go, go.

814
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,400
Go to the bathroom.

815
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,400
Go, go.

816
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,400
What's wrong?

817
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,400
What's wrong?

818
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,400
Tell me.

819
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,400
It's Jia Jia.

820
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,400
Jia Jia?

821
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,400
What's wrong?

822
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,400
Promise me.

823
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,400
Calm down.

824
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,400
Tell me. I've never seen you before.

825
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,400
Then you must be sure.

826
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,400
You must be calm and listen to me.

827
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,400
I promise.

828
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,400
When it's midnight, Jia Jia will wake up.

829
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,400
She will watch her phone.

830
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,400
You're not going to work?

831
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,400
Yes.

832
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,400
You're really good.

833
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,400
You seem to have improved.

834
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,400
It's so good.

835
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,400
Are you cold?

836
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,400
What's wrong?

837
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,400
Don't touch me.

838
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,400
I'm not cold.

839
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,400
You're so stupid.

840
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,400
You promised me to be calm.

841
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,400
Shut up.

842
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,400
Shut up.

843
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,400
What are you going to do?

844
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,400
I'll tell you what I'll do.

845
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,400
You want the whole world to know?

846
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,400
Do you have any other ideas?

847
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,400
What's wrong with you?

848
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,400
Li Dawei.

849
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,400
Calm down.

850
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,400
Okay?

851
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,400
I'll go back to my room.

852
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,400
What's the matter?

853
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,400
What's wrong?

854
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,400
Don't make her touch me.

855
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,400
What's wrong?

856
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,400
I have something to do.

857
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,400
I'll sleep with you.

858
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,400
Is this... Is this okay?

859
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,400
You sleep.

860
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,400
I'll sleep a little longer.

861
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,400
I'll sleep a little longer.

862
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,400
What's going on?

863
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,400
Dawei. Dawei.

864
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,400
Xiaqian, Dawei is out.

865
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,400
What's going on?

866
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,400
What's going on? Let's go with him.

867
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,400
Xiaqian.

868
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,400
What's going on?

869
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,400
Look at my car. I'll go get it.

870
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,400
I have to ask you. What's going on?

871
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,400
Li Dawei is wrong. He's hitting people.

872
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,400
Who is he hitting?

873
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,400
You guys, hurry up and get him back.

874
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,400
I'll talk to him when he comes back.

875
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,400
Let's go.

876
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,400
Haicheng, come out.

877
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,400
How much is the door?

878
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,400
Okay, I'll contact you.

879
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,400
Hello.

880
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,400
We are the police from Paris He.

881
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,400
May I ask if Mr. Yu is at home?

882
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,400
He went to the coffee shop to run.

883
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,400
Thank you.

884
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,400
What are you doing?

885
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,400
You didn't bring...

886
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,400
You?

887
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,400
We've met before.

888
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,400
My name is Li Dawei.

889
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,400
I'm Chen Jiajia.

890
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,400
He's Chen Jiajia's brother.

891
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,400
Yes, I know.

892
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,400
There, there.

893
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,400
What's going on?

894
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,400
What's going on?

895
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,400
I'm asking you to teach me.

896
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,400
What are you doing?

897
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,400
I'll go get him.

898
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,400
What are you doing?

899
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,400
You know what you're doing.

900
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,400
What are you doing?

901
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,400
Li Dawei, what's going on?

902
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,400
What's going on?

903
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,400
Do you know what you're doing?

904
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,400
What's going on?

905
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,400
Let go of Jiajia.

906
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,400
I'm asking you.

907
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,400
Don't kill us.

908
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,400
You're not going to kill us.

909
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,400
You're not going to kill us.

910
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,400
What are you doing?

911
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,400
What are you doing?

912
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,400
He didn't hit you.

913
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,400
You hit me.

914
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,400
Li Dawei, you're going to kill us.

915
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,400
Don't hit him.

916
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,400
Hello, this is the laundry.

917
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,400
Please check it.

918
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,400
Thank you.

919
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,400
Sister, why did you get up so early?

920
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,400
Did you fall asleep because of me?

921
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,400
No, Jiajia.

922
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,400
I was going to work early in the morning.

923
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,400
Okay.

924
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,400
That's good.

925
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,400
Sister, don't worry about me.

926
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,400
I'm fine.

927
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,400
How can you be fine?

928
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,400
Since I know,

929
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,400
I'll help you find a way.

930
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,400
Jiajia,

931
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,400
do you know what happened to your mother?

932
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,400
I dare not tell her.

933
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,400
I'm afraid she'll worry.

934
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,400
And even if she knows what's the use,

935
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:55,400
she'll only be able to bear the pain of her life.

936
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,400
Even if that's the case,

937
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,400
she'll always humiliate her.

938
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,400
Then why do you still want to be with her?

939
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,400
I don't know.

940
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,400
Every time I ask her this question,

941
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,400
she'll only cry.

942
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,400
I'm sorry.

943
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,400
I'm sorry.

944
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,400
I'm sorry.

945
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,400
I'm sorry.

946
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,400
I'm sorry.

947
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,400
Love is you.
