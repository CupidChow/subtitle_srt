1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I

4
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,120
I

5
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,520
Don't you think I'm correct?

6
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,880
I'm just in the Ruyi

7
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,020
I don't need him any more

8
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,540
But I think there's another way

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,260
the special exciting Consort!

10
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'll go.

11
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm going to go to the hospital.

12
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'll be back.

13
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Okay.

14
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Okay.

15
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Okay.

16
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Okay.

17
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Okay.

18
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Okay.

19
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Okay.

20
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Okay.

21
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Okay.

22
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Okay.

23
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Okay.

24
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I thought you and Zhou Mu wanted to fight each other.

25
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
He's the one.

26
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm the one.

27
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's okay if I'm with him.

28
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Where's Li Xiaowei?

29
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
She's not feeling well.

30
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'll go see her.

31
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Uncle.

32
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm going to see her.

33
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm going to see her.

34
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm going to see her.

35
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm going to see her.

36
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm going to see her.

37
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm going to see her.

38
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Uncle.

39
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Don't go.

40
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Let her take care of herself.

41
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Okay.

42
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Okay.

43
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Okay.

44
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Okay.

45
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Okay.

46
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Okay.

47
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Just go.

48
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
What's going on?

49
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I should be caught and punished.

50
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The doctor Li...

51
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Is she pregnant?

52
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
She's pregnant.

53
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
The people who come here need to pay for the slot.

54
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
We found out that Dr. Li didn't have this transfer record.

55
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Then would he use cash?

56
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
The boss is in trouble. He doesn't receive cash.

57
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And the doctor has a monitoring system.

58
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
We also transferred it to see.

59
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And a few people can prove that he really didn't participate.

60
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Why did he not participate?

61
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
He has an old friend who is a writer.

62
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
He is also a long-term classmate of this doctor.

63
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It is said that he has something to press on his friend.

64
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
He went to find him and asked for money.

65
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
But his friend knew that he was short of money.

66
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So he encouraged him to join the family.

67
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Did he join the family?

68
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
No. He didn't have the money.

69
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Chief.

70
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
This time, Dr. Li performed his best.

71
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
He has been successful.

72
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So...

73
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
This...

74
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Dr. Li...

75
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Is it...

76
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Let me think about it.

77
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Okay.

78
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Come, chef.

79
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Come.

80
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Come.

81
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Come with me.

82
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You should have more.

83
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
The old master can still treat you.

84
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Master.

85
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You think David has something to do with him?

86
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
In theory,

87
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
it has no big impact on him.

88
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
His father's situation has been very clear.

89
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
That's good.

90
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Xiaoman.

91
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You and David have a good relationship.

92
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
We are colleagues.

93
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You are also friends.

94
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
That's good.

95
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Master.

96
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I have something to ask you.

97
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
No.

98
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
They are on the scene.

99
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Why didn't you see that bar?

100
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You are stupid.

101
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
He can be there.

102
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Okay.

103
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You are afraid that your present identity will be exposed.

104
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
So you don't want to be the one to show off, right?

105
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
No, I don't want to be the one to show off.

106
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I am willing to let go of my identity.

107
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
We have to help each other.

108
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
They will naturally be able to take care of me.

109
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I will do my best.

110
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
They will be like us.

111
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
What's wrong?

112
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
How delicious is it?

113
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's delicious, Master.

114
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
What are you looking at?

115
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Master.

116
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You said that I...

117
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I can't make any progress.

118
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You just have to think about working hard.

119
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You will surely make it.

120
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I am anxious, Master.

121
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You said that our community is always

122
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
a small thing.

123
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Even if I try hard,

124
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
it won't be possible.

125
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
David.

126
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You can't do anything for the sake of success.

127
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You can't make it even if you can't do something good.

128
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I know, Master.

129
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I will do my best.

130
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Mr. Cheng, I have something to report to you.

131
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Okay.

132
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
What's wrong?

133
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Sister Wu is here again.

134
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
She said that the children of Xia Jie's group

135
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
must be seen in person.

136
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
What?

137
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Is she too difficult to find out?

138
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Why don't you go and see her?

139
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Dr. Wu, hello.

140
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Hello.

141
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Hello, I just know that

142
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
you are our second-in-command hospital.

143
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Look at sister world.

144
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
My wife and sister's second-in-command hospital

145
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
are really small.

146
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Is she your second-in-command hospital?

147
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Yes, I am.

148
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You can't even say that.

149
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You can't even imagine

150
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
that she is the second-in-command hospital.

151
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
We are so close to each other.

152
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You don't have to worry about her.

153
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
We are all friends.

154
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,600
My wife's sister, Ergu, is also from this hospital.

155
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,200
What's her name?

156
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,200
I said you must know her.

157
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,200
Look at my brain.

158
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,800
I'll take a walk and have a meal with you.

159
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,200
Let's have a warm meal.

160
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,600
The child is back home.

161
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,800
It's better to go home.

162
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,400
There's nothing more important than peace.

163
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,600
Look, the age of our child.

164
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,400
Is it the child or the daughter?

165
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,200
You're right.

166
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,600
Your child and my child are almost two days apart.

167
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,800
If we're going to sit together and chat,

168
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,800
the common people won't be able to handle it.

169
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,200
President Chen, right?

170
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,600
Yes.

171
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,200
I want to see that woman you guys saw yesterday.

172
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,600
Why are you looking for her?

173
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,800
Tell me if you have something to say.

174
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,000
She's calling my daughter to die.

175
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,200
I came here today to apologize to her.

176
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,200
Miss Wu, it's serious.

177
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,800
How could she say such a thing?

178
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,200
She's working on her work schedule.

179
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,800
She asked me to smoke.

180
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,600
Isn't that what my child is?

181
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,000
Let me tell you.

182
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,200
It doesn't matter if she smokes.

183
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,400
I don't care.

184
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,000
But she won't do it if she smokes.

185
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,400
Miss Wu, you really think too much.

186
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,800
Although Xia Jinzhen is young,

187
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,200
she may not be very attentive in terms of her words.

188
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,000
But her work is not wrong.

189
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,200
The case is a must-have procedure.

190
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,400
You're covering her up?

191
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,200
No.

192
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,200
Your attitude is covering her up.

193
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,600
Why would she smoke my enemy?

194
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,200
What do you mean? Don't you understand?

195
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,800
I made it clear.

196
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:14,200
I came here today to apologize to her.

197
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,400
Miss Wu, Miss Wu.

198
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,000
You said you were looking for a child.

199
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,200
The child is looking for her.

200
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,400
It must be a big joy.

201
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,800
What's more important than this?

202
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,400
You're wrong.

203
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,000
To you, looking for a child is the most important.

204
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,600
To me, dignity is the most important.

205
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,000
How about you let her come out? Hurry up and come out.

206
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,400
Miss Wu, Miss Wu.

207
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,400
Let's go.

208
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,800
I'm coming.

209
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,200
Xia Jinzhen, have you completed the task I set for you?

210
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,800
Hurry up and go back to the clinic.

211
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,800
You dare to come?

212
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,800
You even have the face to see me?

213
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,800
I didn't do anything wrong. Why didn't I have the face to see you?

214
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,200
You reported the case and I took the scene.

215
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,600
Did I take the wrong one?

216
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,800
Xia Jinzhen, don't say anything.

217
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,600
I'll go.

218
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:00,200
Dr. Wu, look at this, okay?

219
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,800
I'm Xia Jinzhen's teacher.

220
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,000
I'm also the vice-captain.

221
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,600
I'll apologize to her for her.

222
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,800
Teacher, you don't have to protect me like this.

223
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,600
I'm not apologizing because I didn't do anything wrong.

224
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,000
You don't have to apologize for me either.

225
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,800
You're not apologizing, right?

226
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,800
Are you not apologizing?

227
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,000
Come, let me apologize.

228
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,200
Miss, what's going on?

229
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,600
Why did you help find the child and find the problem?

230
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,200
And you fought Xia Jie yesterday, didn't you?

231
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,800
What's the concept of this?

232
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,600
How about I remind you?

233
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,200
What's going on?

234
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,200
Who are you scaring?

235
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,000
What's Xi Jing?

236
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,400
I'm teaching my own daughter.

237
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,000
She was the one who came up with this.

238
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,400
I hit her because of her accident.

239
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,200
You're blaming me?

240
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,000
You're scaring me.

241
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Xia Wei.

242
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,400
Are you still laughing?

243
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,400
Don't laugh.

244
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,400
Don't laugh.

245
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,400
Let's go back.

246
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,400
Let's go back.

247
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,400
Well, Dr. Wu.

248
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,200
Look, she said it for a long time.

249
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,400
But I'm thirsty.

250
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,000
Go to the bathroom to get her some water.

251
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I'm not here to drink water.

252
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I'm here to apologize to her.

253
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,800
I'll ask her if she's still not here.

254
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,200
I didn't do anything wrong.

255
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,200
I didn't do anything wrong.

256
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,200
Well, Dr. Wu.

257
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,000
Sit down.

258
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,800
Sit down.

259
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,600
Come on.

260
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,600
Drink some water.

261
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,600
Don't be so sad.

262
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,200
I said Xia Jingjuan is still in the gym.

263
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,400
If she doesn't come here,

264
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,600
then my teacher will be in trouble.

265
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,000
I sincerely apologize to her.

266
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I'll give you a job.

267
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,600
Okay?

268
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,600
Teacher.

269
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,000
What's the use of your job?

270
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:29,600
I...

271
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,200
Can you represent her?

272
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,200
Dr. Wu, why?

273
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:34,800
Come on.

274
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,000
Dr. Wu.

275
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,800
You're not here, are you?

276
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,200
Let me tell you.

277
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,200
I'll give you a chance today.

278
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,800
Now that you think about it,

279
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,200
I won't accept it.

280
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,600
You'd better be so strong.

281
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,000
Don't apologize to me.

282
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,200
Dr. Wu.

283
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,400
Dr. Wu.

284
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,400
Don't go.

285
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,600
Dr. Wu.

286
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,400
Dr. Wu.

287
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,600
Don't go in a hurry.

288
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,400
Let's sit down and have a good talk.

289
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,600
Why?

290
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,800
You're so angry.

291
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,400
What's going on?

292
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,600
We can solve the child's problem.

293
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,600
Dr. Wu.

294
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Dr. Wu.

295
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,600
Dr. Wu.

296
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,600
Dr. Wu.

297
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,200
Miss, tell me.

298
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,800
Don't you have to face this kind of conflict?

299
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,600
I told you to avoid

300
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,000
the ability to avoid conflicts and plan.

301
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,800
And protect you from my harm.

302
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,800
You said that we shouldn't listen to you.

303
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,800
I didn't do anything wrong.

304
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,600
Why should I apologize?

305
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,600
As a police officer,

306
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,600
not only should I be a concubine,

307
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,800
but also a respected officer.

308
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,400
Teacher, you shouldn't have apologized to me just now.

309
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,000
You said that you're a child...

310
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,200
I'm not a child.

311
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,000
I'm a police officer.

312
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,200
I'm sorry.

313
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,200
I know you're a kind person.

314
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,600
You want to protect me everywhere.

315
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,200
You can do anything for me.

316
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,200
But do you understand?

317
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,200
A protection like yours

318
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,200
is like my mom's.

319
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,200
She will let me have some other trouble.

320
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,200
When I open the house, it looks like it's been finished.

321
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:07,220
Let's go Varle with my own friends.

322
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:18,020
Ok

323
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,200
I'm going to see Dr. Li.

324
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,200
Da Lei, come to see your dad.

325
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,200
Okay.

326
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,200
Okay, then you can sign here.

327
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,200
And this one, you can sign here.

328
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,200
Okay.

329
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,200
Okay.

330
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,200
Okay.

331
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,200
Okay.

332
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,200
Okay.

333
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,200
Okay.

334
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,200
Okay.

335
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,200
Okay.

336
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,200
Okay.

337
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,200
Da Lei.

338
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,200
Da Lei.

339
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,200
What's wrong?

340
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,200
I'm the one who signed this.

341
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,200
I'm the one who signed this.

342
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,200
Da Lei.

343
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,200
Da Lei.

344
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,200
Da Lei.

345
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,200
Da Lei.

346
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,200
I'll do it.

347
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,200
Did you sign it?

348
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,200
I've signed it.

349
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,200
Da Lei.

350
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,200
I'm the one who signed this.

351
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,200
Come with me.

352
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,200
Da Lei.

353
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,200
I'm your dad's brother.

354
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,200
Da Lei.

355
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,200
I'm your friend.

356
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,200
Da Lei.

357
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,200
Don't ask.

358
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,200
Officer.

359
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,200
Officer.

360
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,200
Officer.

361
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,200
Officer.

362
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,200
Officer.

363
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,200
Officer.

364
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,200
Officer.

365
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,200
Officer.

366
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,200
I'm Dr. Li's master.

367
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,200
Okay.

368
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,200
Da Lei.

369
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,200
Drive the car over.

370
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,200
I'll send your dad home later.

371
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,200
Okay.

372
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,200
What do you want to say?

373
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,200
Chen Jian Gui.

374
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,200
Will you be affected by me?

375
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,200
What do you think?

376
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,200
You just thought about this.

377
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,200
Your son is a cop.

378
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,200
You're going to participate in a illegal activity.

379
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,200
Do you think it will affect him?

380
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,200
It's not intentional.

381
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,200
What's intentional?

382
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,200
Let's not talk about it.

383
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,200
Ordinary people can't participate in this activity.

384
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,200
For example, you're a cop's family.

385
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,200
Shouldn't you be more self-confident?

386
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,200
Yes.

387
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,200
I was wrong.

388
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,200
Officer.

389
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,200
You're the one who's in charge.

390
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,200
You should teach him more.

391
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,200
The child is wrong.

392
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,200
You should teach him more.

393
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,200
What about you?

394
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,200
As a father of a child.

395
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,200
What's your responsibility?

396
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,200
I've missed the time to take care of him.

397
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,200
I'm the one who's responsible.

398
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,200
He doesn't accept me now.

399
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,200
Officer Chen.

400
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,200
You must have a child.

401
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,200
I'll be careful about my eyes.

402
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,200
I'll never come back

403
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,200
with those unreliable friends.

404
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,200
Since we can't help the child.

405
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,200
We can't be a black-faced person.

406
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,200
Really.

407
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,200
Officer Chen.

408
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,200
I'm sorry.

409
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,200
I'm sorry.

410
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,200
I'm sorry.

411
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,200
Hello.

412
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,200
Song Jie.

413
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,200
What about Li Dawei?

414
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,200
He's...

415
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,200
He's...

416
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,200
He's...

417
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,200
He's...

418
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,200
He's...

419
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,200
He's...

420
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,200
He's...

421
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,200
He's...

422
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,200
He's...

423
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,200
He's...

424
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,200
He's...

425
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,200
He's...

426
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,200
He's...

427
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,200
He's...

428
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,200
He's...

429
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,200
What?

430
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,200
Down to level.

431
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,200
Song Jie.

432
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,200
Yesterday,

433
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,200
Chen Hao reported to me

434
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,200
about this.

435
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,200
I also know

436
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,200
we didn't make any mistakes.

437
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,200
You didn't do anything wrong.

438
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,320
Song Ju, don't listen to the rain

439
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,920
after hearing the rain, okay?

440
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,200
You have to protect the top of the list.

441
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,320
Or else, what should we do?

442
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,000
Song Xu, Xia Xiajie

443
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,400
did it according to the normal procedure.

444
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,000
It's also necessary to let her learn.

445
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,920
You said it was wrong.

446
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,640
You said it was wrong to let Xiajie learn.

447
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,600
Master, are you living in the real world?

448
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,560
Don't you know what's going on?

449
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,000
Then, I don't want to apologize.

450
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,800
I only want you to solve the problem of the group's sympathy.

451
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,440
I want the group to be satisfied.

452
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,000
That's it.

453
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,520
Hey!

454
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,800
I haven't finished yet.

455
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,520
Here.

456
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,200
Here.

457
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,200
I'm back.

458
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,760
Hello?

459
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,620
Xia Xiajie,I've beenilla´sayeon

460
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,520
Military Police.

461
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:24,360
They are bodyguards, organizations with common common knowledge

462
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,720
and strict annual rules of the gåion,

463
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,600
including social and public supervision.

464
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,600
I know they might have used these to get you.

465
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,600
But you are in accordance with the rules.

466
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,600
You have no violation of these rules.

467
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,600
So, if you don't apologize,

468
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,600
even if they get the court,

469
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,600
they won't get support.

470
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,600
Thank you, Uncle Niu.

471
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,600
And you and your teacher.

472
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,600
Did I hear it?

473
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,600
Did they say I'm not allowed to marry?

474
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,600
That's it.

475
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,600
I don't want to lie to you.

476
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,600
Xia Jian, you know,

477
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,600
my teacher and I are not happy.

478
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,600
They have their own opinions.

479
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,600
But I know

480
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,600
I'm not like they said.

481
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,600
It's not as simple as they think.

482
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,600
You are the same.

483
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,600
Xia Jian,

484
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,600
sometimes,

485
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,600
it's hard to understand between people.

486
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,600
Because of the growth environment,

487
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,600
it's the same.

488
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,600
So, there's a difference in the position.

489
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,600
So, don't affect your mood

490
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,600
because of others' opinions.

491
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,600
I'm back.

492
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,600
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

493
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,600
Thank you, Uncle Yang.

494
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,600
I just think

495
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,600
I'm right.

496
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,600
My teacher has to apologize to me.

497
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,600
I'm really confident in my future.

498
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,600
I know my teacher is doing this for my own good.

499
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,600
But if he does this,

500
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,600
I'll make everyone, including myself,

501
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,600
think I'm not sensible.

502
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,600
I can understand your feelings.

503
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,600
Try to understand.

504
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,600
I'll try to understand.

505
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,600
Xia Jian,

506
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,600
I asked you to go to the office.

507
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,600
I'm looking for you.

508
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,600
What's wrong?

509
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,600
Why are you sighing again?

510
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,600
I just got a call about Li Davei.

511
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,600
Xia Jie was hurt.

512
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:51,600
I think Li Davei is more worried about Xia Jie.

513
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,600
She's a good girl.

514
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,600
She's just like her father.

515
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,600
She doesn't have much to worry about.

516
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,600
But she has a positive attitude.

517
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,600
I don't understand.

518
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,600
What's wrong with Xia Jie?

519
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,600
Ye Bing, you're the principal.

520
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,600
We're talking about principle, right?

521
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,600
But Dr. Wu,

522
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,600
he's the one who's been doing this for a long time.

523
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,600
Because of this, you're using law to punish him.

524
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,600
You want them to get rid of him?

525
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,600
You want to take his wealth?

526
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,600
Ye Bing,

527
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,600
no matter what happens,

528
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,600
you must take that...

529
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,600
and stand on the same line with me.

530
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,600
And persuade him.

531
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,600
I'm like you now.

532
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,600
I'm being mad.

533
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,600
I'm thinking about why people get old.

534
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,600
Why do I have to be so cold-hearted?

535
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,600
Stop it. You're not old.

536
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,600
You're still young.

537
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,600
What do you mean?

538
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,600
I'm not afraid of being old.

539
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,600
I'm afraid of being old.

540
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,600
Listen, I'm not old yet.

541
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,600
I'll go to school after I retire.

542
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:12,600
I'll teach a professional how to become a parent.

543
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,600
I'll teach him how to become a parent.

544
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,600
This...

545
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,600
Here's the report.

546
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,600
Xia Jie is here. Come on.

547
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,600
Sit down.

548
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,600
Sit down.

549
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,600
Sit down.

550
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,600
Did your mother hear you?

551
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,600
Chief, you've asked me before.

552
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,600
You little brat.

553
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,600
You're so quiet.

554
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,600
Chief, I'm just an ordinary police officer.

555
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,600
What's your problem? Just tell me.

556
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,600
Dr. Wu is still the same.

557
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,600
Why do you have to be so serious with him?

558
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,600
Just for an apology.

559
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,600
Xia Jie, you're not a big man.

560
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,600
Just apologize.

561
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,600
Chief, if you want me to apologize,

562
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,600
then you have to tell me where I was wrong.

563
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,600
You...

564
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,600
Look at this kid.

565
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,600
He's like his father.

566
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,600
He's so evil.

567
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,600
Xia Jie,

568
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,600
to be honest,

569
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,600
your job is not to be underestimated.

570
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,600
When you were looking for a kid,

571
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,600
you must have been very anxious.

572
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,600
Of course, you were very excited.

573
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:26,600
Your words really stimulated his sense of sense.

574
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,600
If you had told him,

575
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,600
okay, I'll help you find a kid.

576
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,600
That way, you'll be better.

577
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,600
Really?

578
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,600
I've been with him all the time.

579
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,600
I asked him on the spot.

580
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,600
I didn't expect him to suddenly make a statement.

581
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,600
I don't know why.

582
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,600
So,

583
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,600
I don't know where I was wrong.

584
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,600
I don't know why I should apologize.

585
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,600
Why should I apologize?

586
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,600
We're the police.

587
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,600
We should help the people.

588
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,600
We should help them to solve the problem.

589
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,600
We should help them to balance

590
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,600
the unresolved factors.

591
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,600
We should help them to calm down.

592
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,600
Xia Jie,

593
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,600
you young people

594
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,600
think that Yuan Ze is Yuan Ze.

595
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,600
But Yuan Ze is in the hands of people.

596
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,600
If others think that Yuan Ze is Yuan Ze,

597
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,600
that's Yuan Ze.

598
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,600
Chief Su,

599
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,600
I'm young,

600
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,600
so I can't understand you.

601
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,600
Tell me where I was wrong.

602
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,600
You're not wrong.

603
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,600
But this girl is so noisy.

604
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,600
She's so noisy.

605
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,600
She can't work properly.

606
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,600
Think about it.

607
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,600
If we can

608
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,600
go to a police station

609
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,600
to report a flat,

610
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,600
we can't

611
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,600
do normal work

612
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,600
in our office or office.

613
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,600
So, you mean

614
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,600
I'm affected by the distance from the police station?

615
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,600
Sister,

616
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,600
I didn't mean that.

617
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,600
I mean,

618
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,600
we should be the police.

619
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,600
We should meet

620
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,600
every day.

621
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,600
Right?

622
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,600
We meet so many people every day.

623
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,600
We can't meet

624
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,600
all the people, right?

625
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,600
So, you mean

626
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,600
we should meet every day?

627
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,600
Miss,

628
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,600
you're going to kill me.

629
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,600
Well,

630
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,600
can we

631
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,600
go to the police

632
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,600
or the office

633
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,600
to apologize

634
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,600
in a big way?

635
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,600
I don't know.

636
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,600
I'm not wrong.

637
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,600
What's wrong?

638
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,600
Chief,

639
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,600
I have some

640
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,600
blind spots.

641
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,600
Wait a minute.

642
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,600
What if

643
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,600
you're going to

644
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,600
apologize in the office?

645
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,600
I'm not wrong.

646
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,600
Don't forget

647
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,600
your heart.

648
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,600
Chief,

649
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,600
if you think

650
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,600
I violated the distance from the police station

651
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,600
and the work,

652
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,600
you can punish me.

653
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,600
You can continue your work.

654
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,600
I'm leaving.

655
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,600
Now,

656
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,600
the kid is not a kid.

657
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,600
He's not a kid.

658
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,600
He's not a kid.

659
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,600
The kid's temper

660
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,600
is the same as his father's.

661
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,600
I'm just saying that

662
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,600
his father is a hero.

663
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,600
Chief,

664
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,600
you can't say that.

665
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,600
You can't think that way.

666
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,600
Because of his father's sacrifice,

667
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,600
we have to

668
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,600
protect the police.

669
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,600
You can say that.

670
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,600
We are all

671
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,600
his father's sacrifice.

672
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,600
You...

673
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,600
Besides,

674
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,600
he didn't make any mistakes.

675
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,600
Then let's just

676
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,600
talk about it.

677
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,600
His father is his father.

678
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,600
His father is his father.

679
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,600
Do you think

680
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,600
I'm funny?

681
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,600
When did I

682
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,600
beat you?

683
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,600
You just...

684
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,600
I came to discuss

685
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,600
the case.

686
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,600
I beat you.

687
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,600
Fine, fine, fine.

688
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,600
Tell me.

689
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,600
I'm sorry.

690
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,600
I'm sorry.

691
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,600
Can I sit here for a while?

692
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,600
You can go.

693
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,600
I can't speak well.

694
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,600
Xia Jie,

695
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,600
don't care too much.

696
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,600
I just listen

697
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,600
when others talk.

698
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,600
I just

699
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,600
feel sorry for myself.

700
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,600
I just say

701
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,600
Xia Jie is not his father.

702
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,600
He doesn't want to be his father.

703
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,600
But he is more and more

704
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,600
hard-working.

705
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,600
Everyone will think

706
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,600
he is the one who

707
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,600
is responsible for his father.

708
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,600
It's okay

709
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,600
to say anything to me.

710
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,600
Now

711
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,600
it's not about you

712
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,600
and Dr. Wu.

713
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,600
It's about

714
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,600
your father.

715
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,600
My father has sacrificed himself.

716
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,600
He's gone.

717
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,600
Besides,

718
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,600
my father is my father.

719
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,600
I'm my father.

720
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,600
I thought so.

721
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,600
But everyone thinks so.

722
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,600
They...

723
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,600
I was going to comfort you.

724
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,600
This...

725
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,600
This makes you more uncomfortable.

726
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,600
Then I'll stop talking.

727
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,600
I'm not good at talking.

728
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,600
Anyway,

729
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,600
no matter what,

730
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,600
we're just listening.

731
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,600
We're just listening.

732
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,600
You can go home.

733
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,600
I'll go home.

734
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,600
Why?

735
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,600
I'm going home.

736
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,600
You don't have to wait for me.

737
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,600
I'll be back.

738
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,600
I'll be back.

739
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,600
Why?

740
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,600
I'll be back.

741
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,600
I'll be back.

742
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,600
I'll be back.

743
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,600
I'll see you tomorrow.

744
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,600
I'll be back.

745
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,600
I'll be back.

746
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,600
I'll be back.

747
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,600
I'll see you tomorrow.

748
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,720
There are some broken levels in the water at the moment.

749
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,520
At least they barely let us out,

750
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,800
which is quite normal.

751
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,200
They signed an appointment...

752
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:41,760
successfully or not?

753
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,800
Right after the meeting with photography company,

754
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:53,140
temper

755
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,720
I'm in the dyestable with her

756
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,080
this evening.

757
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:58,820
What do you say?

758
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,980
After meeting with the photographer.

759
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,280
I need to meet her.

760
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:02,060
You should be released by the night before.

761
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:02,560
No.

762
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,540
Section 1.

763
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,400
Double Survey

764
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,300
Again.

765
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,460
Conduct the batches.

766
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,080
Okay.

767
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:15,160
You all don't know until Shi Ren Ke became a member of the water pantry.

768
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,560
How do you know that?

769
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,480
I enrolled Er Teng.

770
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,820
Do you want to give me the waterív.

771
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:25,240
Really?

772
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:31,760
I was wrong because of yourelling.

773
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,000
Is it at home?

774
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,120
No.

775
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,780
I worked for a company in Guna.

776
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,840
Where have you been?

777
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:41,640
I was at the kitchen.

778
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:47,400
You're not alone this time.

779
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,680
Dong Xiaomao,

780
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,680
I don't know.

781
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,520
I don't know.

782
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,520
I never thought about it.

783
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,880
Never?

784
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,960
I never thought about it.

785
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:15,000
Except for the police, I don't do anything.

786
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,160
What are you doing?

787
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:21,920
Nothing.

788
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,000
I heard your dad has gone home.

789
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Your mom came to pick him up.

790
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,440
Yes.

791
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,680
Then go home and have a look.

792
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,680
I'm back.

793
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,680
But I don't want to see my mom.

794
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,680
I don't even have a room.

795
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,680
And...

796
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,680
I sent my dad to the police.

797
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,680
You're quite a boss.

798
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,680
We both have experience in this.

799
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,680
Okay, Dazhi, come and have breakfast.

800
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,680
Okay.

801
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,680
What are you doing?

802
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,680
I'm changing my clothes.

803
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,680
Dad,

804
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,680
I'm going to change.

805
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,680
Your dad didn't find out about it.

806
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,680
Really?

807
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:45,680
Can you believe it?

808
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,680
He didn't find out about it.

809
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,680
Besides,

810
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,680
your dad is your dad.

811
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:53,680
You are your dad.

812
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,680
You're my dad.

813
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:57,680
You're my dad.

814
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:58,680
You're my dad.

815
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,680
You're my dad.

816
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:01,680
What are you doing?

817
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:19,680
Thank you, master.

818
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:21,680
Thank you?

819
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,680
Change your clothes.

820
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,680
I'm going to change.

821
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:30,680
I'm going to change.

822
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:00,680
I'm back.

823
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,680
I'm back.

824
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:00,680
I'm back.
