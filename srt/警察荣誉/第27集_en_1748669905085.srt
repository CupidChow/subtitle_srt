00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,920

00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,920

23
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,920
that little

24
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,920
then

25
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,920

00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,880
I'm from Huaxiao.

29
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,360
And come and find me.

30
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,760
Okay.

31
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,960
Hello, My love.

32
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,760
Welcome to my home.

33
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,400
Let's talk outside.

34
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,280
village commander, please help Jianjun to finish his statement.

35
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,360
Old酬.

36
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,860
Jian스튬, he's not just係uying.

37
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,100
Helpか?

38
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,220
We'll do the cleaning.

39
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,440
Emergency頭 is on TV any minute.

40
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,700
I always hope he gets some sense

41
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,680
he's been sent in.

42
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,380
Headmaster,

43
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,540
he just got into an accident.

44
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,180
He's the criminal that got arrested.

45
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,580
Movement has beenscale.

46
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,400
No.

47
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,600
Come in.

48
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,600
Su Shuang,

49
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,600
I heard...

50
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,600
What do you want to say?

51
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,600
What's wrong?

52
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,200
I don't like to be in the team.

53
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,200
He's a good fighter.

54
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,600
He's not good looking.

55
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,800
But this matter

56
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,000
doesn't matter.

57
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,200
We have to protect him.

58
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,800
President,

59
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,400
the military has been in the army for 16 years.

60
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,200
It's been so many times.

61
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,800
Because of personal problems,

62
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,600
we should have given him

63
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,600
a good reputation and honor.

64
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,400
But look at his work.

65
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,800
We have a lot of things to do.

66
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,800
I know it's serious.

67
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,600
But it's a good thing to say.

68
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,200
All the people in our office

69
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,200
are watching us.

70
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,200
We have to protect them.

71
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,800
Everyone is working hard.

72
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,800
Who can work like Jian Que?

73
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,600
Think about it, Su Shuang.

74
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,800
President,

75
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,400
tell the bureau

76
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,400
to open the page and

77
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,800
give a memory card.

78
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,000
If you think you're not right,

79
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,600
we'll write a report

80
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,400
with the name of Su Shuang.

81
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,800
We'll be responsible for...

82
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:16,800
Ahora l잖아요 twiste.

83
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,800
Now,

84
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,600
please have a rest.

85
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,200
The people have solved many problems for us.

86
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,200
We are in the same boat.

87
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,200
If we start,

88
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,200
will we be too unkind?

89
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,200
Yes.

90
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,200
Who can take care of us?

91
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,200
Right.

92
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,200
We are against the suspects.

93
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,200
We will do it.

94
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,200
We will do it.

95
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,200
We will do it.

96
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,200
We will do it.

97
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,200
We will do it.

98
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,200
We will do it.

99
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,200
Those people are being exposed.

100
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,200
We are also people.

101
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,200
What do you think of the police?

102
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,200
Is there any special power?

103
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,200
Police is also...

104
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,200
Who is the police?

105
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,200
The police is the one who holds the power of the law.

106
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,200
The one who is the law is the criminal.

107
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,200
You are demanding to face him.

108
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,200
Who will be punished in the future?

109
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,200
Today,

110
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,200
I remind you.

111
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,200
About the case of Cao Jianjun,

112
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,200
no one should say a word in the future.

113
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,200
How to deal with it?

114
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,200
The law is legal.

115
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,200
It has nothing to do with us.

116
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,200
I told you a few things.

117
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,200
I will catch Xu Tianban.

118
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,200
The fourth quarter's work

119
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,200
can't be delayed.

120
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,200
Don't let everyone

121
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,200
look down on us.

122
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,200
Third committee.

123
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,200
Chief.

124
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,200
The law is legal.

125
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,200
But we have to help.

126
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,200
Jianjun is our witness.

127
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,200
Xiao Hui.

128
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,200
Why are you here?

129
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,200
Who are we not here for?

130
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,200
Let's go in first.

131
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,200
What's the time?

132
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,200
Today,

133
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,200
I am officially a family informant.

134
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,200
Then they can't

135
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,200
tell us the truth in the police station?

136
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,200
He can't tell us the truth.

137
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,200
Then,

138
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,200
how many girls can you find out?

139
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,200
I don't know.

140
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,200
At least one.

141
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,200
Maybe a few months.

142
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,200
It's not long.

143
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,200
What if we go out

144
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,200
and buy food and let people know?

145
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,200
What can we do?

146
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,200
I don't know.

147
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,200
Cheng Tianzhen.

148
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,200
He is a police officer.

149
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,200
Why didn't he help

150
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,200
the police

151
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,200
when something happened?

152
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,200
Xiao Hui.

153
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,200
You married such a person.

154
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,200
What did you get?

155
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,200
You are a family.

156
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,200
He is your father.

157
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,200
He can drink and drink.

158
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,200
What?

159
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,200
He has

160
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,200
no money

161
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,200
or money.

162
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,200
What does he have?

163
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,200
He is not like your brother-in-law.

164
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,200
By the way,

165
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,200
your brother-in-law

166
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,200
has come down from the blacklist.

167
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,200
He has 3 million.

168
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,200
He has returned

169
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,200
your 1,000.

170
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,200
Mom,

171
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,200
let's see Xiao Hui.

172
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,200
Why do you mention him?

173
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,200
I tell your sister

174
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,200
to reflect on his marriage.

175
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,200
Hui Hui,

176
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,200
look at you.

177
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,200
Your sister is wearing it.

178
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,200
You are wearing it.

179
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,200
Now,

180
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,200
you are marrying a rich man.

181
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,200
Mom.

182
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,200
What should we do?

183
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,200
What should we do?

184
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,200
Have you thought about it?

185
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,200
You should keep your child

186
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,200
and watch her.

187
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,200
Look at your sister.

188
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,200
Don't talk.

189
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,200
Mom, what are you doing today?

190
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,200
I am here to see you.

191
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,200
I am here to see my brother-in-law.

192
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,200
My brother-in-law is so capable.

193
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,200
He can return the 3 million.

194
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,200
Why does he have a blacklist?

195
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,200
Why is he pretending to be dead?

196
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,200
I am willing to marry Cao Xuan Jin.

197
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,200
No matter how troublesome he is,

198
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,200
he treats me as his wife.

199
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,200
He is a good husband.

200
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,200
He is a good father.

201
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,200
My sister

202
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,200
is rich.

203
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,200
She is a good woman.

204
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,200
She is a good woman.

205
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,200
She knows the house is open.

206
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,200
What is wrong with my sister?

207
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,200
She is so kind and kind.

208
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,200
Are you happy?

209
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,200
I am not.

210
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,200
I have to say it.

211
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,200
Mom, you can't see Cao Xuan Jin.

212
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,200
Now,

213
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,200
she is happy.

214
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,200
She is satisfied.

215
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,200
But you are wrong.

216
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,200
You are a daughter.

217
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,200
I like Cao Xuan Jin.

218
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,200
I am going to change the place.

219
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,200
No matter how long she stays inside,

220
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,200
no matter how hard our journey will be,

221
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,200
I will accept her.

222
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,200
I like her.

223
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,200
I will follow her all my life.

224
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,200
It's okay if you don't like her.

225
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,200
I won't force her.

226
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,200
But don't come to this house.

227
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,200
Don't go to your house.

228
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,200
Don't talk to her in the house.

229
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,200
Let me pick up the child.

230
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,200
You can go.

231
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,200
Cong Cong,

232
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,200
she won't let me talk.

233
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,200
I am a god.

234
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,200
I am a god.

235
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,200
I am good for you.

236
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,200
I don't like her.

237
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,200
Okay, take her away.

238
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,200
Please.

239
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,200
You are good.

240
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,200
You are good.

241
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,200
Okay?

242
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,200
I tell you, you are good.

243
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,200
You have a life.

244
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,200
Don't ask for help from your parents.

245
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,200
Get out of here.

246
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,200
I am leaving.

247
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,200
I am leaving.

248
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,200
I am leaving.

249
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,200
I am leaving.

250
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,200
I am leaving.

251
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,200
Mr. Wang,

252
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,200
the chairman said that our meeting at noon is 10 years long.

253
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,200
He wants you to go back.

254
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,200
He knows what you mean.

255
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,200
Xiaoli,

256
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,200
the meeting at noon is over.

257
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,200
I will go back.

258
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,200
I will go back.

259
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,200
I will go back.

260
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,200
I will go back.

261
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,200
I will go back.

262
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,200
I will go back.

263
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,200
I will go back.

264
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,200
I will go back.

265
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,200
I will go back.

266
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,200
I will go back.

267
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,200
I have nothing to do.

268
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,200
I will wait here.

269
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,200
Okay, you sit first.

270
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,200
Sit.

271
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,200
Thank you.

272
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,200
Mr. Wang,

273
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,200
please don't do this.

274
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,200
We heard about the meeting at noon.

275
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,200
The chairman is also very upset.

276
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,200
It's all because of the meeting.

277
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,200
Thank you.

278
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,200
It's a big trouble for everyone.

279
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,200
I will take it.

280
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,200
You sit first.

281
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,200
I will go back.

282
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,200
I think everyone knows

283
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,200
about this document.

284
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,200
We must do our best

285
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,200
to stop the crime.

286
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,200
For a relatively remote place,

287
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,200
we must strengthen the education of the law.

288
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,200
We must not miss any corners.

289
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,200
Don't tell him that

290
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,200
he will meet you if he doesn't come.

291
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,200
The chairman is still here.

292
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,200
Song Jie.

293
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,200
Don't call me Song Jie.

294
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,200
You are my master.

295
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,200
Since I was in the police,

296
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,200
you taught me everything.

297
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,200
About the police,

298
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,200
except for the new words

299
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,200
you said in my house last night,

300
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,200
did you tell me

301
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,200
that you will meet me?

302
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,200
What else can I say?

303
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,200
I was in a hurry.

304
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,200
I even asked a old man to come to you.

305
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,200
I was still scared to say it.

306
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,200
I understand the truth.

307
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,200
I understand.

308
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,200
But I can't come.

309
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,200
I have to give Jianjun

310
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,200
the last hope.

311
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,200
Song,

312
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,200
Jianjun is your brother.

313
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,200
You are Li Haojie's mother to him.

314
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,200
They all think of a way

315
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,200
to stop him from being a good man.

316
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,200
Song.

317
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,200
Master.

318
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,200
I can't say it.

319
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,200
We have to see the law.

320
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,200
But I can say the law

321
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,200
is to be taken away from the court.

322
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,200
If you don't mind,

323
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,200
it has been decided long ago.

324
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,200
I know.

325
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,200
I know.

326
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,200
I know.

327
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,200
I know.

328
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,200
I just know

329
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,200
that Jianjun is very close to me.

330
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,200
I don't know.

331
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,200
But he is the police.

332
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,200
I am sure he won't do it.

333
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,200
I'm sorry.

334
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,200
I'm sorry.

335
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,200
I can only say that.

336
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,200
It's...

337
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,200
I'm sorry.

338
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:42,200
I know that you all have your own opinions about the punishment of the Cao Jian army.

339
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,200
Yes.

340
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,200
Cao Jian army is better than the second rank.

341
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,200
I'll be the one to decide the second rank.

342
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,200
So what?

343
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,200
Everyone is equal in the law.

344
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,200
It's all right.

345
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,200
If there's something wrong with the law,

346
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,200
then the punishment of the law will be more severe.

347
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,200
I'm sorry.

348
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,200
The judge of Cao Jian army,

349
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:20,200
to my magnanimity,

350
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,960
We can already confirm that

351
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:36,940
By pigs, we become reversal

352
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,200
I'm sorry.

353
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,200
Here you are.

354
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,200
Uncle Yang.

355
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,200
Uncle Yang.

356
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,200
What are you looking at?

357
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,200
You're out of the police.

358
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,200
Brother Cheng.

359
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,200
You're out of the police.

360
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,200
Okay.

361
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,200
Dawei, let's go.

362
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,200
Okay.

363
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,200
Xiaojie.

364
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,200
Yes.

365
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,200
Come to the office.

366
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,200
I'm sorry.

367
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,200
Qiwei.

368
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,200
Uncle Yang.

369
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,200
It's been half a day.

370
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,200
Where are you going?

371
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,200
Come with me.

372
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,200
I'm going to some community today.

373
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,200
Ding's family is running a business.

374
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,200
He's been talking about it for half a day.

375
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,200
Uncle Yang.

376
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,200
I'm fine.

377
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,200
You're fine too.

378
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,200
Come back and talk to me.

379
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,200
Mr. Xie.

380
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,200
Mr. Xie and his friends are going to the meeting.

381
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,200
Mr. Xie.

382
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,200
Come.

383
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,200
Let's go to the meeting.

384
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,200
What's that smell?

385
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,200
Let me close my eyes.

386
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,200
It's cold, isn't it?

387
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,200
Do you think

388
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,200
this is a good thing?

389
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,200
Where's Uncle Yang?

390
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,200
He's in the house.

391
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,200
Let's talk to him.

392
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,200
Dawei.

393
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,200
Why don't you leave some private space for him?

394
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,200
I'm not sure.

395
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,200
I'm not sure.

396
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,200
I'm not sure.

397
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,200
I'm not sure.

398
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,200
Why don't you leave some private space for him?

399
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,200
Why are you hiding?

400
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,200
Just let him stay here.

401
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,200
Let him stay here for a while.

402
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,200
Thank you.

403
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,200
How is it?

404
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,200
It's good, right?

405
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,200
It's good.

406
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,200
I didn't expect

407
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,200
you said you'd stay here and eat pig's face.

408
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,200
I knew it.

409
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,200
You said you'd meet him.

410
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,200
I didn't expect you to come.

411
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,200
Let's go.

412
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,200
Why are you staring at me?

413
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,200
I'm not going to drink.

414
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,200
I'll drink some tea.

415
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,200
I'm not going to drink.

416
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,200
You're still so strict

417
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,200
about yourself when you're off work.

418
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,200
We have a business equity.

419
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,200
We're going to kill you.

420
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,200
The price is

421
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,200
not only for the police,

422
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,200
but also for the police.

423
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,200
He's not the real price.

424
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,200
He's...

425
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,200
He's just a matter of fact.

426
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,200
He's just a matter of fact.

427
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,200
He's just a matter of fact.

428
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,200
It's not a big deal.

429
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,200
Yes, it's not a big deal.

430
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,200
The hospital is more like this.

431
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,200
He's always sick.

432
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,200
So, we have to be careful.

433
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,200
I just think

434
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,200
he's a good cop.

435
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,200
He's just a matter of fact.

436
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,200
Why is he...

437
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,200
He's just...

438
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,200
He's just a matter of fact.

439
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,200
It's not a matter of fact.

440
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,200
He's just a matter of fact.

441
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,200
Yes, yes.

442
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,200
He's just a matter of fact.

443
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,200
I'm telling you.

444
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,200
I told you that

445
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,200
the police in the police station

446
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,200
was the one who caused the accident.

447
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,200
I told him all the time.

448
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,200
I told him that

449
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,200
he should be changed

450
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,200
if he's not changed.

451
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,200
If you don't change,

452
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,200
you'll be in trouble

453
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,200
one day.

454
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,200
I'm sorry.

455
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,200
I haven't changed in over ten years.

456
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,200
I'm sorry.

457
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,200
I just haven't changed.

458
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,200
If you can change your personality,

459
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,200
you can change your life.

460
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,200
But if you can change your life,

461
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,200
you'll have no life.

462
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,200
Old Huaji,

463
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,200
I just like to talk to you.

464
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,200
You're so mean.

465
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,200
You're so mean.

466
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,200
Enough.

467
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,200
It's not easy to have a meal

468
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,200
with your brother.

469
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,200
Don't say that.

470
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,200
Just say something happy.

471
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,200
I really have nothing to say.

472
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,200
I can't find someone to say.

473
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,200
Then say it.

474
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,200
Say it.

475
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,200
I'll listen.

476
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,200
Listen.

477
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,200
I'll say it.

478
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,200
I told you before

479
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,200
that the police station

480
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,200
was the one who caused the accident.

481
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,200
There was a Northeastern high-ranking officer.

482
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,200
He followed the police

483
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,200
and caused the accident.

484
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,200
The master was in trouble.

485
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,200
In the police station,

486
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,200
there was an important investigation.

487
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,200
A good Wenbi was needed.

488
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,200
He came to the police station to get people.

489
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,200
He asked me if I agreed.

490
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,200
Then do you agree?

491
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,200
I...

492
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,200
In the police station,

493
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,200
he said it well.

494
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,200
Actually, I know what he meant.

495
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,200
He was worried that

496
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,200
the big baby would

497
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,200
be in our lock

498
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,200
and he would be in trouble.

499
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,200
You're a little anxious.

500
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,200
You must be thinking too much.

501
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,200
I'm anxious.

502
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,200
Old man,

503
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,200
do you want to help me?

504
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,200
Do you think I agreed

505
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,200
or I'm against the fate?

506
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,200
Can you fight the fate?

507
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,200
I can't say that.

508
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,200
But

509
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,200
the chief is my former disciple.

510
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,200
I can find him to touch.

511
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,200
Old man,

512
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,200
what you said in the police station

513
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,200
is what you're talking about.

514
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,200
Usually,

515
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,200
you're lying.

516
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,200
You don't dare to have dinner with me.

517
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,200
I can only say that it's my feeling.

518
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,200
We just said

519
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,200
that the life and death of an old soldier

520
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,200
is always the same.

521
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,200
After watching it,

522
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,200
I finally understand.

523
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,200
This is

524
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,200
when you're in danger,

525
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,200
try to work hard.

526
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,200
When you're not in danger,

527
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,200
you must be in a good mood.

528
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,200
Invincible.

529
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,200
Invincible.

530
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,200
Invincible.

531
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,200
Chief, what's the matter?

532
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,200
Chief.

533
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,200
Chief.

534
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,200
Chief.

535
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,200
Chief.

536
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,200
It's a meeting.

537
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,200
What's the...

538
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,200
Sit.

539
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,200
Sit.

540
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,200
Sit.

541
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,200
Sit.

542
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,200
Chief, Chief.

543
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,200
Chief.

544
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,200
Chief Chen.

545
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,200
Chief.

546
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,200
Uncle Yang.

547
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,200
Uncle Yang.

548
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,200
I want to announce

549
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,200
a good news.

550
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,200
We have to open

551
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,200
an important special training

552
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,200
to find the right person

553
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,200
to take the right person

554
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,200
from each派.

555
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,200
We have a meeting.

556
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,200
We have to order Uncle Yang's name directly.

557
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,200
Uncle Yang has a good background in law.

558
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,200
He's good at literature.

559
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,200
He's very good at acting.

560
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,200
The meeting

561
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,200
was specially organized

562
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,200
by our opinions.

563
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,200
We asked if we could take Uncle Yang away.

564
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,200
I said yes.

565
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,200
It's a good thing.

566
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,200
It's a good thing, right?

567
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,200
First,

568
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,200
it's a good thing.

569
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,200
Uncle Yang is a capable man.

570
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,200
He's a talented man.

571
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,200
Second,

572
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,200
we, the派 department,

573
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,200
we must

574
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,200
make this public service.

575
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,200
Right?

576
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,200
Uncle Yang,

577
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,200
you should

578
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,200
take the time

579
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,200
to take the training.

580
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,200
Then,

581
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,200
go to the police station to report.

582
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,200
It's a good thing.

583
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,200
I'll ask you two

584
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,200
to help Uncle Yang

585
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,200
to take the training.

586
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,200
After that,

587
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,200
we'll take the train

588
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,200
and send it to the police station.

589
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,200
The meeting is over.

590
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,200
Listen,

591
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,200
Uncle Yang is going to the police station

592
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,200
to take the training.

593
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,200
What's the point of this?

594
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,200
It's just a matter of time.

595
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,200
I think

596
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,200
the police station

597
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,200
is worried about us.

598
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,200
Don't say that.

599
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,200
I'm the one

600
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,200
who likes him more and more.

601
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,200
It's a bit awkward.

602
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,200
The guy is a good guy.

603
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,200
Yes.

604
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,200
Come out.

605
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,200
You want to talk about Uncle Yang, right?

606
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,200
You heard it.

607
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,200
I didn't just hear it.

608
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,200
I also confirmed it with my master.

609
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,200
I also confirmed it with my master.

610
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,200
What are they doing here?

611
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,200
They said it was a bureau

612
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,200
and they personally called the people.

613
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,200
Where is Uncle Yang?

614
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,200
I didn't see him when I came back.

615
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,200
I heard the news

616
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,200
and I didn't see him.

617
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,200
I was still in the WeChat group this afternoon.

618
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,200
Where is Uncle Yang?

619
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,200
You didn't come back alone.

620
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,200
How can I know what you're doing?

621
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,200
I guess that's what the company is thinking.

622
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,200
He's not close to his master.

623
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,200
I guess he's not on his own.

624
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,200
What should we do?

625
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,200
What can we do?

626
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,200
It's not a bad thing.

627
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,200
Let's go back at night.

628
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,200
We'll tell Uncle Yang about it.

629
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,200
We'll do a long-term job.

630
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,200
Then you should tell him about it in the group.

631
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,200
Let him come back early.

632
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,200
Okay.

633
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,200
Let's go.

634
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,200
Just go.

635
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,200
Uncle Yang.

636
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,200
Why did you buy so many things?

637
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,200
It's not a gift.

638
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,200
It's a paper for the summer festival and the Zhao Juewei.

639
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,200
I bought some dishes.

640
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,200
I'll cook for Uncle Yang tonight.

641
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,200
Uncle Yang will do it.

642
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,200
Uncle Yang will do it?

643
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,200
He's gone.

644
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,200
He's gone?

645
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,200
He came back in the room

646
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,200
and cleaned up a while.

647
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,200
He told me that

648
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,200
he was going to work in the bureau

649
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,200
for a while.

650
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,200
It's not convenient for him to come back.

651
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,200
He's not going to work in the bureau.

652
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,200
It's convenient.

653
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,200
I thought you knew it.

654
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,200
Xia Jie is a big suspect.

655
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,200
I'm going to the bureau.

656
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,200
I want to make a new job first.

657
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,200
I won't go there today.

658
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,200
I'll come back often.

659
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,600
He's been in the world.

660
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,200
He did something wrong with me

661
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,200
for many years.

662
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,200
Let's have a friendly talk at a organic party.

663
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,200
We should deliver the books.

664
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,200
I hate podr Audiences on afar.

665
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,200
You all can do the stupid ones.

666
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,200
How were theING?

667
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:27,280
vorbere

668
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,640
Mom!

669
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,160
Did you pick up the plane?

670
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,800
I took a bag of bread.

671
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,340
JT遊白

672
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,740
Interesting

673
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,920
Didn't you always think it was wonderful?

674
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,880
When did I say this?

675
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:51,200
Okay, okay, I'm back. I won't talk.

676
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,200
It's boring to be back.

677
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,200
You work so hard every day.

678
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,200
You can't even accompany me.

679
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,200
Why didn't you send a beautiful car to pick me up?

680
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,200
We have a car ourselves. Why bother with the car?

681
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,200
The car is parked in the parking lot. Let's go.

682
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,200
Mom

683
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,200
I'm sleeping.

684
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,200
I'll try something first.

685
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,200
Mom, I'm sleeping.

686
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,200
I'm going to go to bed.

687
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,200
I'm going to bed.

688
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,200
I'm going to bed.

689
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,200
I'm going to bed.

690
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,200
I'm going to bed.

691
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,200
I'm going to bed.

692
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,040
Hi, miss.

693
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,220
Mom got back-

694
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,660
and most of it wasn't your?

695
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:52,680
That's right.

696
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:54,960
If I hadn't gotten myself into debt,

697
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,720
I would have been all City Starting Association relocation.

698
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,020
Auntie.

699
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:02,320
Could you do me a favor?

700
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,300
I'll ask Auntie about the fortune-telling classie.

701
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,500
You can tell Auntie as well.

702
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,880
I'll talk to Auntie tomorrow at home.

703
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,880
Okay.

704
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,680
Hello uncle.

705
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,200
Hello.

706
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,600
Oh, thanks for talking to us today.

707
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,500
May I come in?

708
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:16,980
Yes.

709
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,120
Did something happen to him?

710
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:22,560
Xiao Jie, it's you, Uncle Liang.

711
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,720
I think their business is a bit off.

712
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,680
What? Why?

713
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,680
You seem to have someone else.

714
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,400
That's right.

715
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,000
It's not his fault.

716
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,960
At first, I saw that they were very friendly.

717
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,800
Your mother was always quiet.

718
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,280
Later, you went to find someone else.

719
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:48,200
I went back to finish my work here.

720
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,920
Okay. Thank you, Uncle Liang. I understand.

721
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,320
Here.

722
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,880
Xiao Jie.

723
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,200
Uncle Liang.

724
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,200
Xiao Jie, why are you here?

725
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,080
Come, let's talk in a place. It's hot.

726
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:29,480
I just picked my mother from the big house yesterday.

727
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,280
She went there this time. Thanks to your care.

728
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,680
I came to thank you.

729
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,280
I'm really grateful for your help.

730
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,280
I'm really grateful for your help.

731
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:43,280
I'm really grateful for your help.

732
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,480
I'm grateful.

733
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,080
Your mother is back?

734
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,480
Didn't she say she was going to the east?

735
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,280
I planned this, but I don't know why.

736
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,680
I came back suddenly.

737
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:56,080
I also came back after my mother came back.

738
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:03,280
Uncle Liang, how is your relationship with that new aunt?

739
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,480
It's also someone else who just introduced me.

740
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,680
I didn't make up my mind.

741
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,480
I said it myself.

742
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,480
My mother is in this world, she can't find someone better than you.

743
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,080
If she missed it, it's not your regret.

744
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,080
It's her regret.

745
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:25,880
I know. Your mother rejected me.

746
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,680
But in fact, she rely on me in her relationship.

747
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,480
I can't let her go.

748
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:37,280
At first, I was to repay your father's kindness to me.

749
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:41,080
Later, I just felt sorry for your mother.

750
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:47,880
Miss Nan Meizhen, if your mother agrees, I have nothing to say.

751
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,880
It's just...

752
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,280
I understand.

753
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,880
Uncle Liang, I will let my mother answer you as soon as possible.

754
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,680
Okay.

755
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,280
Mom, you just came back. Have some fruit.

756
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,680
We don't need to be so formal.

757
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,680
I don't even have a show to watch.

758
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,280
Then we won't watch it anymore.

759
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,480
What are you doing?

760
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:27,480
Mom, you've been away for so long. I miss you too.

761
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,680
Let's not watch TV today. Talk to each other.

762
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,680
Are you going to tell me about that bride?

763
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,680
Mom, Uncle Liang is quite nice.

764
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,880
Why do you call him a bride?

765
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,880
He is quite nice.

766
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,880
Xiao Jie.

767
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:04,080
Do you really hate your mother?

768
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,880
You really want to get your mother married off?

769
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,280
I don't have one.

770
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:13,680
I always think for you and protect you.

771
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,080
I sacrificed everything for you.

772
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:21,880
But in the end, you are not a family.

773
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,880
You are just a match for me and that bride.

774
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:31,480
Tell me, do you really want to throw away my treasure?

775
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,480
Where do you want to go?

776
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,480
We have been together for so many years.

777
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,480
How could I throw you away?

778
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,080
Mom, I'm afraid that you will be lonely all by yourself.

779
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,480
But I've been lonely for so many years.

780
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,080
Besides, I still have you.

781
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:58,480
Mom, I'm getting busier and busier at work.

782
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,480
And I'm already 22 years old.

783
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:07,480
Mom, I'm getting busier and busier at work.

784
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,480
I'm already 22 years old.

785
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,480
I'm already 22 years old.

786
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,480
I'm already 22 years old.

787
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:19,480
Do you want to say that you want to get married and have a good relationship?

788
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:26,480
I just want to say that I also want my own life.

789
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,480
What do you want your own life for?

790
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,480
Then you and mom will live together.

791
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,480
That's not your own life.

792
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:50,480
Why is my life so hard?

793
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,480
Your dad abandoned me and I don't care anymore.

794
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,480
Now you are abandoning me and I don't care anymore.

795
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,480
What else do I have to live for?

796
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:36,480
The shadow of the wind in your warm hands

797
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,480
The long-lasting night

798
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:46,480
The choice to compromise

799
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:50,480
The hug of love

800
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,480
Love

801
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,480
From the moment I was young

802
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:04,480
Love

803
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:10,480
I want to be big

804
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:21,480
I want to meet you

805
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:30,480
The eyes of the eyes engages

806
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:40,480
Divide into half

807
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:50,480
I belong to theesti

808
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:56,480
I want you

809
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:05,480
I want you

810
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:10,480
I want you

811
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:15,480
I want you

812
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:20,480
I want you

813
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:25,480
I want you

814
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:29,480
I don't know

815
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:33,480
what's going on
