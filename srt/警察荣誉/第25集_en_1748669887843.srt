1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I

6
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I

7
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:28,280
It's a FIRST

8
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Look, there's a gap.

9
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
If you want to cut the fabric or color,

10
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
or do something bad,

11
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
what will you choose?

12
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Stop the car.

13
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
What's wrong?

14
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
The road is so narrow.

15
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The normal people will feel something is wrong and look back.

16
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It's not far.

17
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
If something really happened,

18
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
it must be here.

19
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Take it back.

20
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Don't worry.

21
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Are you scared?

22
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm scared.

23
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
What's wrong?

24
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's so dark.

25
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Sit here for a while.

26
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Wait a minute. I'll get some water.

27
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'll get some water.

28
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Come.

29
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'll get some water.

30
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Is it him?

31
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
No.

32
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Stop!

33
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Stop!

34
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Don't move.

35
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Stop!

36
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Be careful.

37
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
This one.

38
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Stop!

39
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Thank you.

40
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Thank you.

41
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
This is the last block of a block.

42
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
He owed a hundred dollars.

43
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
He went to the wrong place.

44
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
He thought he'd die after seeing his mother.

45
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
He borrowed a car and went back to his home.

46
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
He met a car driver.

47
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
He knew this girl

48
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
could sell more than 20 million

49
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
for a year.

50
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
He moved to the other side.

51
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
He took the car and went to Lianhua Mountain.

52
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
He used a搬 hand to get his daughter's hand.

53
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
He went into a crazy state.

54
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
If it wasn't for our police,

55
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
he would have pushed her to the door.

56
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It was very dangerous.

57
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You're saying it's not easy.

58
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's easy.

59
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
When he committed the crime for the first time,

60
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
he was sure to predict the next action.

61
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It was more than a loss for the lives of the people.

62
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It's not bad.

63
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Who found out this first?

64
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Mr. Cao.

65
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Mr. Cao?

66
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I heard he was the one who caught him.

67
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Yes.

68
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
He's a good cop.

69
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Here.

70
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I remember

71
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
he mentioned Li Gong several times.

72
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
But he didn't officially mention him.

73
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I have to show him this time.

74
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Here.

75
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Xu Yang, he's a man.

76
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Miss Xiao Yang,

77
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I've sent him to see you.

78
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Don't touch him, Miss Xiao Yang.

79
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
How is it?

80
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Is it better?

81
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Much better.

82
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Come on, let's have more interviews.

83
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Hurry up and bring the monitor over.

84
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Bring the monitor over.

85
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
The monitor.

86
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Come here.

87
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Come here.

88
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Let's have a look.

89
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Hurry up.

90
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Come on.

91
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Come on.

92
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Come on.

93
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Come on.

94
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Come on.

95
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Come on.

96
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Hurry up.

97
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Come on.

98
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Good.

99
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Good.

100
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Good.

101
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Good.

102
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Come on.

103
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Come on.

104
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Come on.

105
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Come on.

106
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Come on.

107
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Come on.

108
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Come on.

109
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Come on.

110
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Come on.

111
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Good.

112
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Congratulations.

113
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Congratulations.

114
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You sent the police.

115
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You're going to kill us.

116
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
We're done.

117
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You're going to kill us

118
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
because you're a man.

119
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I've transferred

120
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
the witness documents

121
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
of your brothers.

122
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You're so unreasonable.

123
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You're more reasonable

124
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
than my captain.

125
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You're more reasonable.

126
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm more reasonable than you.

127
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Mr. Wang.

128
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's time for you to go out.

129
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Enjoy.

130
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Enjoy.

131
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
What do you mean?

132
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Let's go.

133
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm leaving.

134
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Let's go.

135
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
What do you want to say to us?

136
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Well,

137
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
we should do everything for the people's welfare.

138
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Good.

139
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Good.

140
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Good.

141
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Good.

142
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Good.

143
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Good.

144
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Good.

145
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Good.

146
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
What's going on?

147
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Look over here.

148
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Look over there.

149
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Look over there.

150
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Look over there.

151
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Come on.

152
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Look.

153
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Listen to me.

154
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
We'll shout one, two, three.

155
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
We'll shout on the ground.

156
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Be nice.

157
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Right.

158
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Right, right.

159
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
OK, let's go.

160
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
One, two, three.

161
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Let's go.

162
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Let's serve the people.

163
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
OK.

164
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
One, two, three.

165
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Let's serve the people.

166
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
OK, let's go.

167
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
We'll go back first.

168
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Okay.

169
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Thank you.

170
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Thank you.

171
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I'll give you a hand.

172
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It's all arranged.

173
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Okay.

174
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Yes, yes, yes.

175
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
This time, I'm here to thank the receptionist

176
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
and our group for their support.

177
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Uncle Jiang,

178
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I want to introduce you to...

179
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Don't call me.

180
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You called Li Dawei and Xia Jie

181
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
to my place.

182
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Did you call them?

183
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'm looking for him.

184
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Yes.

185
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
He's capable.

186
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And as I mentioned,

187
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
as a police officer,

188
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I'm very honored.

189
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm a disciple of the police officer.

190
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's my pride to be able to learn

191
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
such excellent police officers.

192
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Sir.

193
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Sir.

194
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Sir.

195
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You found out that the first victim

196
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
was saved.

197
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
He must be very happy.

198
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Are you excited?

199
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
No, sir.

200
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
He's really great.

201
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
We just made a police officer.

202
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
We should do it.

203
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
But why didn't you send Jin Qi?

204
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Should I give you a gift?

205
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
No, no, no.

206
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
We're far from him.

207
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
The first one in the police station.

208
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
What did you write?

209
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Everything.

210
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
How many times did I say it?

211
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Did you forget?

212
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Sir.

213
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Didn't you ask us

214
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
to participate in the election?

215
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I also said

216
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
all the actions and high-ranking

217
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
will be the same.

218
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Can you hear me?

219
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Don't make a fool of me.

220
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
You're doing it on your own.

221
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Do you know

222
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
if you have the organization

223
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
or the discipline?

224
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Sir.

225
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I thought

226
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
there were many victims in the car.

227
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
The victim

228
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
might have life problems.

229
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
We went there in a minute.

230
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
We had a minute of hope.

231
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
That's why I went there earlier.

232
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Li Dawei.

233
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Put your hand on the chest.

234
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You're talking to yourself.

235
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
You went there in such a hurry.

236
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Do you have the idea

237
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
of taking the credit?

238
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Do you?

239
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Sir. I do.

240
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You're quite a light-hearted person.

241
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Didn't you ask me

242
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
if I wanted to save my life?

243
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Then I'll ask you

244
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
if you want to save your life.

245
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Sir. I do.

246
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You two.

247
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
If you two are not police,

248
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I'll give you a solution

249
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
to be a brave man.

250
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
But you two are police.

251
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You two are wearing police uniform.

252
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It's the first time

253
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
you're serving the order.

254
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
What are you doing?

255
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Although the result

256
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
of this matter is good,

257
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
it can't be changed.

258
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
You're doing it

259
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
in a way

260
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
that reflects the discipline.

261
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Sir.

262
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I accept the criticism.

263
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Sir.

264
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I accept the criticism too.

265
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You're right.

266
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You two

267
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
write a deep check for me.

268
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Yes, sir.

269
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Yes.

270
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Sir.

271
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
How much did you write?

272
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
20,000.

273
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
20,000?

274
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Yes, 20,000.

275
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
This is for you.

276
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
This is for you.

277
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
This is a mistake.

278
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
This attitude is good.

279
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
And you, Li Dawei,

280
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
are more famous.

281
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I'll give you 20,000.

282
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
18,000.

283
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Sir,

284
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
you only paid me 18,000 last time.

285
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You're a bargain to me, right?

286
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
No, no, no.

287
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
18,000.

288
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
We're in a hurry.

289
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Next time.

290
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Sir.

291
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I'll give you 18,000.

292
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I don't need to be taken care of.

293
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I didn't mean

294
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
to take care of you.

295
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I mean,

296
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
were you scared at that time?

297
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
No.

298
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Okay.

299
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
But don't tell your mother

300
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
about this.

301
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Yes.

302
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Okay, go back.

303
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Let's go, sir.

304
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Hello, sir.

305
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Hello, sir.

306
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
What are you doing

307
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
at the door of my house?

308
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Just got off work.

309
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
But I heard that

310
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
you didn't

311
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
do your job well, right?

312
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Who do I do that for?

313
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I do the cleaning.

314
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
The police have already announced

315
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
what I can say.

316
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Besides,

317
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
he's a murderer

318
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
who's been caught personally.

319
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
But he's not young.

320
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Li Dawei and Xia Jie

321
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
just became police.

322
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
They had this bad idea

323
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
of losing money

324
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
and working hard.

325
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
If we don't

326
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
kill this bad idea

327
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,640
in this

328
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
blind-eyed way,

329
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
the more we go back,

330
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
the more we'll be in trouble.

331
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
You're right.

332
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
So,

333
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
this time,

334
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Cao Jianjun has done his job well.

335
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
We have to report him, right?

336
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I don't know

337
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
if he's done his job well.

338
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
You think it's good

339
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
to give him a good job

340
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
after he's done his job?

341
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
God knows

342
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
what will happen

343
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
if he's done his job well.

344
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Maybe

345
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
he's done his job well.

346
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
He's proved

347
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
that his wife

348
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
is in front of his wife

349
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
and his wife.

350
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
He's been relieved

351
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
by his heart this time.

352
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
In the future,

353
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
there's nothing

354
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
to be done.

355
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It's not that simple.

356
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Is he the kind of person

357
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
who needs to

358
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
prove himself

359
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
in front of others?

360
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
But

361
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
no matter what,

362
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
he's done such a great job this time.

363
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
If we don't report him,

364
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
we can't go there.

365
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
If I don't report him,

366
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
there's a way.

367
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I said

368
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
we must obey

369
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
the unified arrangement

370
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
and the unified action.

371
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
He went to the female master's house

372
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
many times.

373
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
He's been there

374
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
for a long time.

375
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
He's been there

376
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
for a long time.

377
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
He's afraid that

378
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
the workers will be robbed.

379
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
He's been there for a long time.

380
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I can't

381
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
report him.

382
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Mr. Su,

383
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
if you're just...

384
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I think

385
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
it's not fair

386
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
for you to report him.

387
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
In our department,

388
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
who's the one

389
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
who's the one who's been sent there?

390
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Chen Xingcheng, right?

391
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
But Chen has been a little arrogant these years.

392
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Then,

393
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Cao Jianjun,

394
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
he's the most outstanding.

395
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
You must admit that.

396
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Actually,

397
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
we all know that.

398
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Cao Jianjun,

399
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
you're the one who likes him the most.

400
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
But you like him the most,

401
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
he's the most outstanding.

402
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Otherwise,

403
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
he's in another department.

404
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I'm afraid

405
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
there are many second-class workers.

406
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
But he's

407
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
in our department,

408
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
he's in the third-class.

409
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
You think...

410
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
So,

411
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
we must be fair.

412
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
We must show our...

413
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Okay, okay.

414
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
You go and get the

415
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
salary package.

416
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You must pay for it.

417
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
You must be a good boy.

418
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Don't be angry.

419
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Drink some water.

420
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
My mom.

421
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Hello,

422
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
new bricks.

423
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Go and get them.

424
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Good morning, Jiejun.

425
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Brother Zhi.

426
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
You're so fresh.

427
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Brother Cao.

428
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Good morning.

429
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Good morning.

430
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Brother Jianjun.

431
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Report.

432
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Jianjun.

433
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Come in.

434
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Come in.

435
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Come on.

436
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Come on.

437
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Sit down.

438
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Sit down.

439
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Come on.

440
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Have some red tea.

441
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I'll do it.

442
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
No, no. Sit down.

443
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Sit down.

444
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
My tea is good.

445
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Come in.

446
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Jianjun.

447
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
You've done a great job.

448
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Are you waiting for me to show you?

449
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Are you waiting for me to show you?

450
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
What are you talking about?

451
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I'm not waiting for you to show me.

452
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Jianjun.

453
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I said I'd go to the main area

454
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
to investigate

455
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
and prevent the sudden accident.

456
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
How did you get into the house

457
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
of the female owner?

458
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I suddenly thought of this clue.

459
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Suddenly?

460
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
And I knew his address.

461
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
The report and the layout.

462
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
It must be a medical record.

463
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
You're afraid of your medical record, right?

464
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
You're afraid of your colleagues' power?

465
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I've got the title.

466
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Isn't it from our company?

467
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Jianjun.

468
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I've been telling you

469
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
that Cao Jianjun is a good cop.

470
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
He's always been.

471
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
No matter if others admit it or not,

472
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
you're always there.

473
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Some people,

474
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
they're blind to see people low.

475
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
If you're going to go to the main area

476
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
to investigate with them,

477
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
then you should be the one to be silent.

478
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Chief Su, I know.

479
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I've never looked down on myself.

480
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Never.

481
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
And I've never looked down on myself.

482
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I know that.

483
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I've never looked down on myself.

484
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I know that I have to keep on raising myself.

485
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Prove myself.

486
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
You really don't understand

487
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
what I mean?

488
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I do, Chief Su.

489
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Chief Su is doing this for my own good.

490
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
That's why Yan asked me to do it.

491
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
That's to make me

492
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
a better person in the future.

493
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Okay, okay.

494
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
We'll stop here.

495
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
You can go down first.

496
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I'm leaving, Chief Su.

497
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
By the way,

498
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I have a report for you in the office.

499
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Thank you, Chief Su.

500
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
You're so stubborn.

501
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
You're so stubborn.

502
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Okay, okay, okay.

503
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Thank you.

504
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Thank you.

505
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Chief Su,

506
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
come here.

507
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
This is good.

508
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Chief Su,

509
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
good news.

510
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
What good news?

511
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Chief Su, what good news?

512
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
The police just informed

513
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
that the second-class worker of the armed forces

514
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
is here.

515
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Chief Su.

516
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Chief Su.

517
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Chief Su.

518
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
The police said

519
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
he would personally

520
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
give the military a speech.

521
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Okay.

522
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Isn't this a good news?

523
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
The military.

524
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
The military.

525
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
The military.

526
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
The military is here.

527
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
The military.

528
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
What's going on?

529
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
What's going on?

530
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
What's going on?

531
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Second-class worker, you.

532
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Second-class worker, you're here.

533
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
You're here.

534
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Awesome.

535
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Thank you, Chief.

536
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Thank you, Chief Snake.

537
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Thank you so much!

538
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,040
That's exactly what

539
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
worth on me.

540
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Thank you, Chief!

541
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Thank you!

542
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Second-class worker,

543
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
second-class worker,

544
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
thank you!

545
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

546
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Chief!

547
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Chief!

548
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Chief!

549
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Just now,

550
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,700
while working under the question

551
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:37,380
They also said that they would report the Cao Jianjun to the police

552
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:40,180
with the help of the ten excellent people.

553
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,380
I think the second-class workers are doing well.

554
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:48,260
The ten police officers, let them go.

555
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,620
Let's talk about it later.

556
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,060
No, Chief.

557
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:54,980
We never had the ten excellent people in our office.

558
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,220
The work of the派出所 all know that

559
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:00,340
it's not easy to get a ten-faceted police officer.

560
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,260
If it's necessary this time,

561
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,500
we will not know that it's the Monkey Year.

562
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,580
Monkey Year is the Monkey Year.

563
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,820
We should be careful.

564
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,540
We can't let him go.

565
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,700
He will fall and fall.

566
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,300
We can't let him go.

567
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,740
We can't.

568
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,580
Understand?

569
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,580
Okay.

570
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:21,780
But...

571
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,780
You should think about it later.

572
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:30,740
The second-class workers,

573
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,980
don't be so brazen.

574
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,100
Don't talk about that.

575
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,340
You made him a balloon.

576
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,460
You think too much.

577
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,860
I'm still young.

578
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,540
No, you...

579
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,660
You listen to me.

580
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,340
No, I'm not.

581
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,260
Second-class workers.

582
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,460
Let me see.

583
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,100
This is the second-class new one.

584
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,500
I have this one.

585
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:19,700
I think you should have a first-class worker.

586
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,220
You don't understand, do you?

587
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,460
Today is the second-class new one.

588
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,180
I have this one.

589
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,660
I think you should have a first-class worker.

590
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,340
I don't understand.

591
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:29,940
You don't understand, do you?

592
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,740
The second-class worker can be a first-class worker.

593
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:33,700
It's not easy.

594
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,220
You're right.

595
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,100
Anyway, this is a good thing.

596
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:38,820
Right?

597
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,940
Of course.

598
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,660
I'm not going to work tomorrow.

599
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,820
Let's go to his old house.

600
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:48,820
Don't be so serious.

601
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,700
I'm not doing it for others.

602
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,780
You're doing it for them.

603
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:57,140
I'm angry when I think about my mom's face.

604
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,740
What's wrong with you?

605
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,500
You're just a little bit of a jerk.

606
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,580
Why is he looking for a woman outside?

607
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,260
You're the one who's being punished.

608
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,860
What else can he say?

609
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,500
You'll change into a new one later.

610
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,500
Let's put this suit on.

611
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,460
I'll take the duck and come back.

612
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,180
Let's go.

613
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,740
You're wearing a new one?

614
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,620
At home?

615
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:18,580
What's wrong?

616
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,020
I want you to be in front of them.

617
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:20,980
You're so witty.

618
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,620
No one can see you outside.

619
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,460
Is that okay?

620
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,220
You're not afraid of me?

621
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:28,980
Hurry up.

622
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,380
You really think it through.

623
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:34,580
Hurry up.

624
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,020
Got it.

625
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,940
Dad.

626
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:40,740
We're back.

627
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,020
Jianjuan is here.

628
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:45,940
Dad.

629
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:46,660
Come, have a meal.

630
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:48,660
Come.

631
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:50,820
Mom.

632
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:51,540
Dad.

633
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,580
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

634
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,060
No.

635
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,700
I called the meeting to say you're coming.

636
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,980
The whole family is waiting here.

637
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,660
The chef is here, too.

638
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,460
We're cooking.

639
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,100
He's got the ability to watch the house.

640
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:02,500
Really?

641
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,300
Come, I'll do it.

642
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:05,860
Come.

643
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:06,980
Hello, grandma.

644
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:08,980
Good girl.

645
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:11,620
Grandma.

646
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:15,940
Come, I'll do it.

647
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:18,580
Come.

648
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,220
Look.

649
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:22,660
Look.

650
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,780
So many things.

651
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,940
Jianjun, don't be busy.

652
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:26,820
Take off your clothes first.

653
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:28,580
Look.

654
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:28,980
Look.

655
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,260
Come, sit here.

656
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:32,980
Sit.

657
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:37,940
Come, sit.

658
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:38,500
Sit.

659
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,060
What's this?

660
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:42,580
Mom.

661
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,900
Jianjun made a second-class work.

662
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,460
This is the second-class work's suit.

663
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,140
Do you know the business case

664
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,500
that happened a while ago?

665
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,500
It's the car of the boss of the seafood company.

666
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,540
He went to do the work.

667
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,740
Within a day,

668
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,420
he hurt two people.

669
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,300
That case

670
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,500
was done by your aunt.

671
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,580
If it wasn't for Jianjun,

672
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,420
he might have to kill the third person.

673
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,700
Youguang, what did I say?

674
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,340
Don't think you're making a lot of money.

675
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:15,860
You're far from it.

676
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,780
You're not like the one you saw in the light.

677
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,740
Yes, yes.

678
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:19,460
Congratulations.

679
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:25,460
We have both rich and famous sons.

680
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,340
We have nothing.

681
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,140
We have no money.

682
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:28,980
Mom,

683
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,300
which side of the sun is the sun coming out today?

684
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,940
It's not the time for you to

685
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,780
get rid of Jianjun.

686
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:36,740
Youguang,

687
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:38,580
just admit your money.

688
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,140
The price is short.

689
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:44,820
Hello.

690
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,340
You're capable.

691
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,380
We have both better sons than you.

692
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:51,780
Sit down.

693
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:52,340
Sit down.

694
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,420
I'm just a mouthful.

695
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:57,940
Look,

696
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,980
when you went to the sea,

697
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:03,140
your dad and I discussed it, right?

698
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:05,460
We have someone to make money for.

699
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,220
If you go to Jianjun,

700
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,340
we'll say no.

701
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,260
We don't agree.

702
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:10,900
Look,

703
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,820
after we have something to do

704
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,180
with the money, the law,

705
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,620
and the family,

706
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,700
we'll have to work hard.

707
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,820
Right, Jianjun?

708
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:19,380
Yes, yes.

709
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,740
Mom, you're right.

710
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:22,740
Mom,

711
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,580
what's the matter?

712
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:26,980
I have something to do.

713
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,060
Youguang,

714
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:30,900
tell me.

715
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,020
Mom, just tell me.

716
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,820
Look at you.

717
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:42,580
Who are you?

718
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,260
You're my own son.

719
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:44,900
You're still...

720
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:47,540
Mom,

721
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,380
what's the matter?

722
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:52,740
Jianjun,

723
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:56,180
I'm working with an outsider company.

724
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,020
I owe them some money.

725
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,540
They're very generous.

726
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:01,700
I don't have much money.

727
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,220
Last year,

728
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,140
I didn't care much.

729
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,300
Then suddenly,

730
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,820
they asked the court to force it.

731
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,220
They're so clever that I'm not paid.

732
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,260
I'll just take the house and the car

733
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,260
and give it to Cha Feng.

734
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:19,780
And they even sent me

735
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:20,900
the list of the lost people.

736
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,660
Sister-in-law,

737
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,420
you're done with the money.

738
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:25,700
No,

739
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,140
I can't transfer it now.

740
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,740
It's not about money.

741
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,340
Fine, fine.

742
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,220
Just continue.

743
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:33,140
What's the relationship between Jianjun and us?

744
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,900
The main thing is the lost people.

745
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,820
I can't make a plane,

746
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,620
or a plane,

747
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,340
or even go out.

748
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:42,100
I even contacted your sister and granddaughter.

749
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,500
They're making fun of me all the time.

750
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,540
You must have a income in the court.

751
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,860
Can you help me

752
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,500
take the list of the lost people

753
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,220
and pay me back as soon as possible?

754
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,260
Isn't that settled?

755
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,780
Actually, your brother-in-law didn't think of you at the beginning.

756
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,260
He knows a lot of people in business.

757
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:05,780
Later, I said I wouldn't find anyone else but Jianjun.

758
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:06,900
Right?

759
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,260
Look,

760
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,940
now your brother-in-law

761
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,500
has given you a chance to help your family.

762
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,100
Mom,

763
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,780
about the lost people,

764
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,660
it's about the court.

765
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:21,620
I know.

766
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,220
It has nothing to do with us.

767
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,420
So you've made a lot of trouble.

768
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:24,980
Yes,

769
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,420
it's about the court.

770
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,180
It's not about the court.

771
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,780
You're family.

772
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,860
Just say it.

773
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:32,820
Mom,

774
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:36,180
those are the misunderstandings of the people.

775
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:40,020
How could the court be a family?

776
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,600
I thought we were couldn't help you.

777
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:46,580
It means we have both still badJeanjun and him.

778
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:51,940
But it is uses is just the word

779
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:58,580
drawings

780
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,620
by your brother-in-law.

781
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,420
So I am thinking

782
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:09,700
that when you take the gold government

783
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,300
You have no right.

784
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,540
Why should we raise a police officer?

785
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,660
You're right.

786
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:18,980
You raised him today.

787
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:22,180
I mean, he...

788
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,980
He's been working all day.

789
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:26,420
What contribution did you make to your family?

790
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:28,660
You're busy with your business.

791
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,180
You can't earn much money.

792
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:33,540
You're working hard for your family.

793
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,780
You're busy with such a small thing.

794
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,780
You're not capable of such a small thing.

795
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,220
Mom.

796
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,620
I don't want to help you.

797
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,220
But...

798
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,460
But I really...

799
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,100
Jianjun.

800
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:53,540
Are you a man with a cold tongue?

801
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,140
Why did you meet my mom?

802
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,620
You can't even speak properly.

803
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,780
What do you mean?

804
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:02,740
You want to make Jianjun a criminal?

805
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,900
Didn't you see that he didn't let Jianjun come?

806
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:07,140
Why did he come to the wedding?

807
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,340
Brother-in-law.

808
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,420
Didn't you make the card for Lan Tian?

809
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,380
It's worth 1.2 million yuan.

810
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:12,100
That's a lot.

811
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:12,580
No, no.

812
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:13,620
Why did you come here?

813
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,380
What's so pitiful?

814
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,860
I'll put the money here.

815
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:21,060
Jianjun is a normal police officer.

816
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,340
He's not capable.

817
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,820
Even if he is, I won't let him help.

818
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:27,300
The money he owes is the best.

819
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,860
If you owe him money, you'll be late.

820
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,740
Don't come here to make Jianjun a criminal.

821
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,020
I'm not a criminal.

822
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,220
Just say it.

823
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,220
Wait.

824
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,700
Who told you that Jianjun is a family member?

825
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,540
He's a family member.

826
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,540
Who doesn't help? Tell me.

827
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,860
We'll help if we can.

828
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,340
The problem is, he shouldn't.

829
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:51,540
Is it only brother-in-law's fault?

830
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,020
Jianjun's money is not a problem.

831
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:57,700
Jianjun is punished for his illegal activities.

832
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:58,820
Are you responsible?

833
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:02,260
You're saying that I'm not capable.

834
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,100
I can't help you.

835
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,220
I can't help you.

836
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,780
Jianjun, we're not capable.

837
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:10,820
We're not capable of saving money.

838
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:14,420
How capable can we be?

839
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,700
I'm so bad.

840
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:16,980
How can we be so capable?

841
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,260
How can we be paid?

842
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,420
How can we be sued?

843
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,380
Stop it.

844
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,380
What do you mean?

845
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:26,100
We shouldn't come back.

846
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,540
Yaya.

847
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:30,420
Yaya, he's back.

848
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,460
He's gone.

849
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,100
He's gone.

850
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:32,980
What?

851
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:34,180
Didn't you see?

852
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:36,100
We're not welcome here.

853
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:36,900
Let's go.

854
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,180
I can't say anything.

855
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:41,540
You can say something useful.

856
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,460
Dad, we're leaving.

857
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:51,460
Dad, mom, Jianjun.

858
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:55,460
I'm sorry for being so stubborn.

859
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:06,900
Er criminally cuid sinner mother.

860
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:13,380
Dad, mom father ladies work all week.

861
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,140
So you can tell sister-in-law

862
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:18,900
How can I tell dad and mom?

863
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:26,500
So that's the end of your whistle.

864
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:31,300
Go and drink wine at your Argh, dare to Där.

865
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,300
What?

866
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,300
There's something on your face.

867
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,300
What?

868
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,300
No, no, no.

869
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,300
Let me see.

870
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,300
Where?

871
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,300
What are you doing?

872
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,300
The child is still here.

873
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,300
Why are you still looking?

874
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,300
I'm not looking.

875
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:54,300
I married the best woman in the world.

876
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,300
I really need a husband.

877
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,300
I'm not looking.

878
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,300
Go home.

879
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,300
Go home.

880
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,300
Go home.

881
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,300
Say it.

882
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,300
What?

883
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,300
I'm busy.

884
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,300
Jingjiu.

885
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,300
Let's go.

886
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,300
Let's go out for dinner.

887
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,300
Jingjiu, why are you back?

888
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,300
Listen, no one is eating today.

889
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,300
I'll invite the big guy to have dinner.

890
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,300
Brother Cao.

891
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,300
Brother Cao.

892
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,300
Brother Cao, I invited everyone to have a big meal.

893
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,300
Big meal? Where to eat?

894
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,300
Brother Cao,

895
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:01,300
the second-class meal is not enough to eat.

896
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,300
Listen,

897
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,300
you can eat whatever you want.

898
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,300
Let's go.

899
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,300
Let's go.

900
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,300
Brother, don't be angry.

901
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,300
We have a good tea at the restaurant.

902
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,300
Change the day.

903
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,300
Actually, it's not good.

904
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,300
We're on duty.

905
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,300
Yes, yes, yes.

906
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,300
We're on duty.

907
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,300
No.

908
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,300
What?

909
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,300
Just keep the money.

910
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,300
We'll pay the price later.

911
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,300
Yes, brother Cao.

912
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,300
The second-class meal is coming.

913
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,300
Are you still a member of the first-class meal?

914
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,300
When you get a first-class meal,

915
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,300
you'll be a big piece of money.

916
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,300
Okay?

917
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,300
What are you doing here?

918
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,300
The rules of the first-class meal.

919
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,300
Here,

920
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,300
we don't go far.

921
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,300
We're just around the corner, okay?

922
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,300
Okay?

923
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,300
Let's go.

924
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,300
We're on duty.

925
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,300
We can't leave.

926
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,300
We can't leave.

927
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,300
No, Ding.

928
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,300
We can't leave.

929
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,300
We're on duty.

930
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,300
What do you mean?

931
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,300
I'm not allergic.

932
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,300
I'm not qualified to invite you to dinner.

933
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,300
Jingjing,

934
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,300
that's not what I meant.

935
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,300
You're on duty.

936
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,300
Can you leave?

937
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,300
Yes.

938
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,300
You know the rules.

939
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,300
You know it.

940
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,300
Okay.

941
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,300
改天,

942
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,300
we'll invite you

943
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,300
to dinner.

944
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,300
Okay?

945
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,300
Yes.

946
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,300
We'll invite you to dinner.

947
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,300
Okay?

948
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,300
Let's go.

949
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,300
Ding.

950
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,300
Okay?

951
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,300
Okay?

952
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,300
Okay?

953
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,300
We can do it another day.

954
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,300
But we've decided

955
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,300
to help them

956
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,300
to refuse.

957
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,300
No, no.

958
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,300
No problem.

959
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,300
No problem.

960
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,300
I'm going to meet Jingjing

961
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,300
to get the bottle.

962
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,300
We'll meet at the Wudang case.

963
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,300
We'll sort it out.

964
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,300
Look,

965
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,300
it's time to talk.

966
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,300
Okay?

967
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,300
改天.

968
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,300
Okay?

969
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,300
Xiaoli.

970
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,300
Jingjing,

971
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,300
you two go out with me.

972
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,300
Okay?

973
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,300
Cao.

974
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,300
Go back to the building.

975
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,300
Okay.

976
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,300
Ding.

977
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,300
Come out for dinner tonight.

978
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,300
The business is not like

979
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,300
the one in the neighborhood.

980
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,300
You can't make money

981
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,300
if you come out.

982
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,300
Yes, yes.

983
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,300
Don't just drink.

984
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,300
Buy me some white wine.

985
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,300
Okay?

986
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,300
Okay?

987
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,300
I'll buy it too.

988
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,300
Buy me some more.

989
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,300
Buy me some more.

990
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,300
Buy me some more.

991
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,300
Come on.

992
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,300
Come on.

993
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,300
Come on.

994
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,300
Come on.

995
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,300
Come on.

996
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,300
Let's go.

997
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,300
Come on.

998
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,300
Come on.

999
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:54,300
Come on.

1000
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,300
Come on.

1001
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,300
Please.

1002
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,300
Please.

1003
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,300
Let's go.

1004
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,300
Come on.

1005
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,300
Come on.

1006
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,300
Let's go.

1007
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,300
Let's go.

1008
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,300
Let's go.

1009
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,300
Let's go.

1010
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,300
I'm asking you.

1011
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,300
You think

1012
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,300
men

1013
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,300
and adults

1014
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,300
should live a life of painting?

1015
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,300
I'm asking you.

1016
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,300
The painting is not a painting.

1017
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,300
I'm asking you.

1018
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,300
Xiaoliang,

1019
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,300
in fact,

1020
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,860
Actually, the rich are respected by the people.

1021
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:22,700
You say that the rich have the right to be respected by the people.

1022
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:23,700
It's not interesting.

1023
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:25,500
Hui He,

1024
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,860
you heard me, right?

1025
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:27,700
Yes.

1026
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:32,020
Then we have to be respected by the construction workers.

1027
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,620
That's what's meaningful.

1028
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:34,220
Right?

1029
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,500
Yes.

1030
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,100
What are you doing?

1031
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,300
I'm making tea for you.

1032
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,740
Yaorou, you're here.

1033
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:40,180
Come here and sit.

1034
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,660
I'll move you.

1035
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:49,740
Wait, wait.

1036
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:52,900
How many times have I been with you?

1037
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,060
I've been in the office for three days and I don't drink.

1038
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:57,100
You said it's the first half of the day.

1039
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,300
Now it's the second half.

1040
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:59,100
No.

1041
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:01,220
When the manager opened the shop, he said it was special.

1042
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:02,420
The task in the office is too heavy.

1043
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:03,900
I can't drink when I get off work.

1044
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:05,500
I know what he said.

1045
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,900
I can't drink.

1046
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,300
I'm sorry.

1047
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:11,420
Today, I'm sorry.

1048
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:14,900
So this is a non-drink.

1049
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:15,820
Come, come, come.

1050
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:16,220
Sit.

1051
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:17,740
Sit.

1052
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:18,460
Come.

1053
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:19,340
Put your hands up.

1054
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:20,940
Put your hands up.

1055
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:21,860
Put your hands up.

1056
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:24,180
If you can't see me, you can sit down.

1057
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:25,180
Put your hands up.

1058
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:26,580
Come.

1059
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:27,340
Come.

1060
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:28,140
Come.

1061
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:18,220
I've been thinking about you.

1062
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:23,580
I've been thinking about you.

1063
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,980
I've been thinking about you.

1064
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:39,980
I've been thinking about you.

1065
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:49,260
I've been thinking about you.

1066
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:59,180
I've been thinking about you.

1067
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:08,980
I've been thinking about you.

1068
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:14,980
I've been thinking about you.

1069
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:29,980
I've been thinking about you.

1070
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:39,980
I've been thinking about you.

1071
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:51,980
I've been thinking about you.
