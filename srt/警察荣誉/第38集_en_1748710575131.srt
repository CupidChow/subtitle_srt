1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Yo Deswegen friends, considering the fact now that it's night but it's the next Ю manera

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door on my way back.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I don't know.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,160
so

13
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,220
admire

14
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,880
now

15
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,240
URBAN

16
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,480
The new show will start soon.

17
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,160
Chen.

18
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,520
Hello.

19
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,720
I just called you.

20
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,160
I have two cases.

21
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,280
Sit down.

22
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,880
One of them is dead.

23
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,320
Why is the crime more and more violent?

24
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,640
So we need to investigate.

25
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,480
Okay.

26
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,320
Let's talk about our business.

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,240
A female missing case happened again.

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,720
We can confirm it.

29
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,040
This time it has direct connection with Yue Wei.

30
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,200
What do you mean?

31
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,200
Come, take a look.

32
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,800
This is the girl.

33
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,760
She was the monitor at the night club.

34
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,080
Look at this car.

35
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,200
I put it there.

36
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,520
Look at this car.

37
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,200
Yue Wei's car?

38
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,800
I'll show you.

39
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,080
This girl came out of the night club.

40
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,760
Two minutes later,

41
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,080
Yue Wei's car went up.

42
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,080
We didn't find this girl

43
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,520
in the next surveillance.

44
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,280
It's obvious that

45
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,680
the girl must have gone to Yue Wei's car.

46
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,000
Director Luo,

47
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,040
you said you found another case.

48
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,560
Did you have another case before?

49
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,440
In fact,

50
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,240
in May,

51
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,760
we received a report.

52
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,520
We can't confirm it.

53
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,440
So we didn't know you.

54
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,720
This girl works in the entertainment center.

55
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,200
She didn't go back home during the New Year.

56
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,480
Where is the entertainment center?

57
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,400
We thought she wouldn't come back

58
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,200
after the New Year.

59
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,040
So,

60
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,480
no one reported it.

61
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,720
Until May,

62
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,760
the family couldn't contact her.

63
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,960
They found the entertainment center.

64
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,320
That's why they found

65
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,840
this person missing.

66
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,240
This thing

67
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,880
happened for more than three months.

68
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,040
We couldn't find the monitoring at that time.

69
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,400
We couldn't

70
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,880
contact Yue Wei

71
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,000
about this.

72
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,720
We didn't even know

73
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,760
if this girl was really missing.

74
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,120
So,

75
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,720
we didn't report you.

76
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:29,960
Director Luo,

77
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,200
you said that

78
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,160
in May...

79
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,240
Yes.

80
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,960
When we were watching her in May,

81
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,960
she wouldn't be in the car

82
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,120
with that girl, right?

83
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,920
So she went to the mountain to

84
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,520
deal with the body.

85
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,240
Didn't you two go to her hometown

86
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,960
and find out anything?

87
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,520
Yes.

88
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,400
We didn't find out

89
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,120
what happened at that time.

90
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,440
Now,

91
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,040
we might have missed something.

92
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,560
But,

93
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,000
we can make sure

94
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,800
that if it's really Yue Wei,

95
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,800
we can face

96
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,480
a very difficult opponent.

97
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,760
She worked in our PR department.

98
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,520
She was very good at the field.

99
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,440
So,

100
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,000
we could continue

101
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,160
to do this for so many years.

102
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,440
We didn't find out.

103
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,000
I'll invite you two this time.

104
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,760
Come.

105
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,240
First,

106
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,200
we need to inform

107
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,120
the latest progress of the case.

108
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:42,800
Second,

109
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,960
I want to ask you

110
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,520
about the monitoring

111
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,720
at the door of Yue Wei's house.

112
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,240
Are you still paying attention?

113
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,040
Yes.

114
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,160
Is there any problem with her?

115
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,840
No.

116
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,840
She still came back

117
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,840
in the morning

118
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,760
and the same as before.

119
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,440
Right.

120
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,520
She didn't find anyone else in the car.

121
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,240
I didn't think so.

122
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,920
We can go back to the law.

123
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,360
We've been watching her for a long time.

124
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,440
If we do,

125
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,240
we'll find her.

126
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,320
But, I'll take it back.

127
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,920
She's very good at the field.

128
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,280
She's in the house.

129
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,200
She's in the monitoring room.

130
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,680
She won't be in the police station

131
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,840
and take such a risk.

132
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,480
This is not her style.

133
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,080
Then,

134
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,400
where will she be in the police station?

135
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,160
In her car.

136
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,720
In her car.

137
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,960
She should be in her car.

138
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,360
We've been watching her for a long time.

139
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,360
We found her car

140
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,920
was just her real home.

141
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,160
Except for the car.

142
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,160
She was in the car.

143
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,120
That's all.

144
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,200
She can't sit in the car

145
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,120
with her car.

146
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,360
So,

147
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:54,960
I think

148
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,920
the car is the most familiar

149
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,720
and the safest place for her.

150
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,040
Well,

151
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,480
I'll search the evidence

152
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,920
and find out the car.

153
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,920
Captain Luo,

154
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,720
this is not good.

155
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:10,920
Look at her.

156
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,240
Look at her.

157
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,400
Except for

158
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,640
the surveillance video of her,

159
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,920
there's no other evidence.

160
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,960
If she's so serious,

161
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,440
will she be in the police station?

162
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,840
Old Zhizhen,

163
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,280
what do you mean?

164
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,760
Yueyue can't leave the entertainment industry.

165
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,720
Where has she been recently?

166
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,080
We have a business.

167
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,800
Yueyue is in the field.

168
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,320
She doesn't mind Momo's unidadainment.

169
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,480
Thief?

170
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,720
I'm notIGH right now.

171
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,600
The things with the virus

172
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,280
carry the least chances of being taken.

173
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,640
Yueyue,

174
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,800
are you OK?

175
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,040
I thought you're not good.

176
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,240
What are you talking about?

177
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,240
I'll go to the back.

178
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,240
Hey, buddy.

179
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,240
What's the situation?

180
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,240
We can't stop here.

181
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,240
Where should we stop?

182
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
Right side, Lidiao, Dasha, Di's house, Dingzhou.

183
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,240
Brother Wei is here.

184
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,240
What's wrong, Brother Wei?

185
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,240
We can't stop here.

186
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,240
Right.

187
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,240
We're on the road.

188
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,240
It's too far from the hill.

189
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,240
We have to go around.

190
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,240
Sir,

191
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,240
can I help you to park the car?

192
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,240
No, you can drive.

193
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,240
Don't park the car.

194
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,240
I've been helping people.

195
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,240
Okay.

196
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,240
No problem.

197
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,240
Let's go, brother.

198
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,240
Come.

199
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,240
Come.

200
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,240
Remember to not put the things in the middle.

201
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,240
That way.

202
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,240
Be careful.

203
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,240
Don't worry.

204
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,240
Okay, brother.

205
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:56,240
Sir,

206
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,240
Sir,

207
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,240
Captain Lu,

208
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,240
Sir,

209
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,240
Sir,

210
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,240
We have to catch them.

211
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,240
I'm worried that they'll be here soon.

212
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,240
Okay.

213
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,240
Sir,

214
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,240
Sir,

215
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,240
Sir,

216
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,240
It's been a long time.

217
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,240
You can go back now.

218
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,240
I'll let you take them back later.

219
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,240
We'll wait for you.

220
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,240
Okay.

221
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,240
I'll go first.

222
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,240
Okay.

223
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,240
Wait there.

224
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,240
Let's go.

225
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,240
Brother Wei,

226
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,240
sit here for a while.

227
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,240
I'll get you some water.

228
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,240
Call me if you need anything.

229
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,240
Okay.

230
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,240
Brother Wei,

231
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,240
Here, have some water.

232
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,240
Okay.

233
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,240
Call me if you need anything.

234
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,240
Okay.

235
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,240
No water, please!

236
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,240
Okay,

237
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,240
Kill him,

238
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,240
Kill him.

239
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,240
Now!

240
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,240
Come!

241
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,240
Hello.

242
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,240
Are you...

243
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,240
Sorry?

244
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,240
We're completely authenticity.

245
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,240
What is this?

246
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,240
If you think me as a security guard,

247
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,520
So desta

248
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,960
one with tight

249
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,080
then a little bit of darkness

250
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:40,580
Sir

251
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,400
He is afraid of我也

252
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:49,820
Look carefully

253
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:50,800
Don't let him go

254
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,240
Brother, what else?

255
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,240
Where did you take this?

256
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,240
The underground parking lot of the underground building.

257
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,240
I'll drive it back for you.

258
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,240
No need.

259
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,240
I'm leaving.

260
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,240
Take me there.

261
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,240
You go this way.

262
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,240
Let's go.

263
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,240
The third floor.

264
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,240
Why the third floor?

265
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,240
It's like this.

266
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,240
We're borrowing from the parking lot.

267
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,240
They only let us park in the parking lot.

268
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,240
Or...

269
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,240
I'll drive it back for you.

270
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,240
No need.

271
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,240
He's in the elevator.

272
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,240
We'll park in the parking lot.

273
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,240
No way.

274
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,240
The elevator is in the parking lot.

275
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,240
We can't do it.

276
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,240
Let's go to the stairs.

277
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,240
Hurry up.

278
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,240
Hurry up.

279
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,240
Hurry up.

280
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,240
Hurry up.

281
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,240
Hurry up.

282
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,240
Hurry up.

283
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,240
Hurry up.

284
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,240
Hurry up.

285
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,240
Hurry up.

286
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,240
Hurry up.

287
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,240
Hurry up.

288
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,240
Hurry up.

289
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,240
Hurry up.

290
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,240
Hurry up.

291
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,240
Why are you back?

292
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,240
We're not.

293
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,240
We're coming back.

294
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,240
Are you happy?

295
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,240
Where did you park the car?

296
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,240
This way, sir.

297
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,240
Hurry up.

298
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,240
How far?

299
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,240
I'm still here.

300
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,240
We're here.

301
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,240
Is that your car?

302
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,240
I'm sorry.

303
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,240
What?

304
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,240
Slow down.

305
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,240
Slow down.

306
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,240
Slow down.

307
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,240
Sir.

308
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,240
Oh, no.

309
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,240
Thank you.

310
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,240
Thank you.

311
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,240
Captain Lu,

312
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,240
this guy is very alert.

313
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,240
We need to catch him.

314
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,240
Don't worry.

315
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,240
If it's really him,

316
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,240
he won't be able to run away this time.

317
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,240
Captain Lu,

318
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,240
we'll go back and wait for the results.

319
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,240
You two have to catch him first.

320
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,240
Okay.

321
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,240
We'll do the test later.

322
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,240
Okay.

323
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,240
Captain Lu, thank you.

324
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,240
Let's go.

325
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,240
Captain Lu,

326
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,240
that's good.

327
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,240
You should go back earlier.

328
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,240
Brother Cheng,

329
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,240
when you're in action,

330
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,240
let me join you.

331
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,240
Let me join this meeting.

332
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,240
Brother Cheng,

333
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,240
I have experience in dealing with this kind of fight.

334
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,240
Please tell them that.

335
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,240
Are you still here?

336
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,240
Didn't you say that

337
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,240
the DNA test results are very fast?

338
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,240
Okay, okay.

339
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,240
Anyway, we'll wait here.

340
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,240
Call us immediately if you have any results.

341
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,240
Okay.

342
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,240
Why are you still here?

343
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,240
I'm sorry.

344
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,240
I'm sorry.

345
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,240
I'm sorry.

346
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,240
I'm sorry.

347
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,240
I'm sorry.

348
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,240
I'm sorry.

349
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,240
I'm sorry.

350
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,240
I'm sorry.

351
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,240
I'm sorry.

352
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,240
I'm sorry.

353
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,240
Why haven't you got the result?

354
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,240
It's really slow.

355
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,240
What?

356
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,240
But

357
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,240
I have a feeling

358
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,240
that I can't run this time.

359
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,240
Go to the doctor.

360
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,240
Captain.

361
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,240
No.

362
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,240
Captain,

363
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,240
you know everything, right?

364
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,240
You just don't agree.

365
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,240
The police can't leave our group,

366
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,240
right?

367
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,240
You just wait for him, okay?

368
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,240
Besides, we can't meet

369
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,240
and leave the place.

370
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,240
Right?

371
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,240
I said no action.

372
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,240
If it's normal action,

373
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,240
it's okay.

374
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,240
What kind of action is this?

375
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,240
You don't know

376
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,240
what kind of person is Jin Jun.

377
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,240
Chen Cheng,

378
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,240
I'm warning you.

379
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,240
If you mention this again,

380
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,240
you and Li Davei

381
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,240
will not participate in this action.

382
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,240
I...

383
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,240
Okay, go down.

384
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,240
Okay.

385
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,240
Davei, hurry up.

386
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,240
Captain Luo.

387
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,240
Yes.

388
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,240
From the blood and muscle in his car,

389
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,240
we have mentioned

390
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,240
three people's DNA.

391
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,240
One of them

392
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,240
has been

393
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,240
compared with the last missing girl.

394
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,240
It's completely wrong.

395
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,240
We can say for sure

396
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,240
that this girl has been in his car

397
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,240
and left blood on his car.

398
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,240
The other two people

399
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,240
need us to continue to investigate.

400
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,240
But I believe

401
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,240
there will be no fourth person.

402
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,240
Thank you, Captain Luo.

403
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,240
Mind your business.

404
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,240
I apologize on this occasion,

405
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,240
based on your son's opinion,

406
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,240
I didn't set him up necessarily.

407
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,040
So

408
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,240
I'm sure

409
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,240
you succeeded on time.

410
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,240
Yes, we have committed these crimes

411
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,240
among the current victims.

412
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,240
It's okay, it's okay.

413
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,240
The result of your checkup is not out yet.

414
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,240
What should I do?

415
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,240
Me?

416
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,240
I'm going to work soon.

417
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,240
You're going to work too?

418
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,240
Go home. The child is waiting.

419
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,240
Okay, let's sit down together.

420
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,240
Chen Jun.

421
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,240
Listen, I have to go back.

422
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,240
Xin Zhen, you must be careful.

423
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,240
Okay.

424
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,240
Ge Chang, can we send more people?

425
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,240
We've been in a deep relationship with Luo Du.

426
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,240
She said it, do you think about it?

427
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,240
People are thinking about Chen and Da Wei.

428
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,240
They've been working on this case.

429
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,240
It's a reward for them to go.

430
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,240
Other people don't think about it.

431
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,240
It's okay, I'll think about it.

432
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,240
Take it with you.

433
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,240
Don't worry.

434
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,240
Don't worry.

435
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,240
I'll go back to work.

436
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,240
I'm going back to work.

437
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,240
I'm going back to work.

438
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,240
Building idag Kaomans

439
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,860
For real.

440
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,840
Hi!

441
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:30,140
The duh-duhs.

442
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,280
The duh-duhs.

443
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:41,360
A.

444
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,020
Hi!

445
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,940
The duh-duhs are over there.

446
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,940
Brother Cheng!

447
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,940
Jianzhen, what are you doing?

448
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,940
Do you know we have a mission?

449
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,940
From a few days ago, I was here every day.

450
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:03,940
Brother Cheng, don't you let me join?

451
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,940
Brother Cheng, I beg you.

452
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:12,940
Luo Zui.

453
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:13,940
Luo Zui.

454
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,940
Luo Zui, take me to the police station.

455
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:19,940
Okay?

456
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:20,940
Okay.

457
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,940
Okay, it's time.

458
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,940
The army is not an outsider. Let him follow us.

459
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:49,940
I'm telling you, this guy is a bastard.

460
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,940
You have no weapons. Just follow him and don't go to the police station.

461
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,940
I know. I promise.

462
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,940
Luo Zui, go over there.

463
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,940
Brother Cheng, what's wrong?

464
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:35,940
Brother Cheng, you are not happy because of me.

465
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,940
I thought you were a coward.

466
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,940
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

467
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,940
You can't be like this.

468
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:42,940
I'm sorry.

469
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:43,940
I'm sorry.

470
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,940
You can't be like this.

471
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:46,940
I'm sorry.

472
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:47,940
I'm sorry.

473
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:48,940
I'm sorry.

474
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:49,940
I'm sorry.

475
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:50,940
I'm sorry.

476
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:51,940
I'm sorry.

477
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:52,940
I'm sorry.

478
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:53,940
I'm sorry.

479
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,940
I was thinking about something.

480
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,940
I'll call you right away.

481
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:58,940
I'm telling you.

482
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,940
Why didn't you say anything?

483
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:05,940
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

484
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:07,940
I'm sorry.

485
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,940
Uncle, we're catching the gun now.

486
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:12,940
I'll call you back later.

487
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,940
Let's talk in the court.

488
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,940
Let's go.

489
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,940
Didn't I tell you?

490
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:47,940
I was a murderer.

491
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,940
It's because of something happened in the police station.

492
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:52,940
Stop.

493
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:53,940
Stop.

494
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,940
Don't move.

495
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,940
The gun was shot down by a 50-seater.

496
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:09,940
What did you say?

497
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,940
The police station is closed.

498
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,940
The police station is closed.

499
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,940

The police station is closed.

512
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,940
Uncle.

513
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:24,940
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

514
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:29,940
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

515
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:34,940
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

520
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:59,940
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

521
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:04,940
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

522
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:09,940
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

523
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:14,940
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

524
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:19,940
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

525
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:24,940
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

526
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:29,940

I want to say that to my son.

536
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:15,940
I want to say that to my son.

537
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:19,940
Then you can ask him.

538
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:24,940
Then he'll answer it.

539
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,420
What is that letter?

540
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,980
Do not be afraid.

541
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,300
Right.

542
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,880
Wake up

It is a blessing for all three of you.

554
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,260
Feng decision.

555
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:05,760
I feel哇 you're gonna destroy my soul.

556
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,800
You should go task error.

557
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,800

One year ago, today,

706
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,800
these four young people

707
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,800
came to our Barley River Resort

708
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,800
and became members of our Barley River community

709
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,800
and also members of the police team.

710
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,800
One year has passed

711
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,800
and the children have grown up.

712
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,800
They've grown up

713
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,800
as a public police.

714
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,800

721
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,800

Congratulations.

724
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,800
From today on,

725
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,800
you officially become

726
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,800
a public police.

727
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,800
Recently,

728
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,800
we've been talking about

729
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,800
the honor of being a police.

730
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,800
Yes.

731
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,800
In the Barley River Resort,

732
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,800
the duty of a police

733
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,800
is to bring the honor of nature

734
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,800
to the center of the party and the people.

735
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,800
But when you officially become

736
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,800
a public police,

737
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,800
you can't just

738
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,800
remember the honor

739
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,800
and keep the mission and the promise

740
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,800
of a police.

741
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,800
Today,

742
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,800
when you officially become

743
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,800
a public police,

744
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,800
I want to ask you a question.

745
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,800
Are you ready?

746
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,800
Yes.

747
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,800
Okay.

748
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,800
Okay.

749
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,800
Remember,

750
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,800
from the day you entered the city,

751
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,800
you've been

752
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,800
a public police for your whole life.

753
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,800
Even when you retire,

754
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,800
you must remember

755
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,800
what is the honor of a police.

756
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,800
What is the mission of a police.

757
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:34,800
The honor of the police

758
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,800
will always shine on you.

759
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,800
I'm a young brother.

760
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,800
For the honor of the party,

761
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,800
for the honor of the city,

762
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,800
let's do our best.

763
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,800
Let's do our best.

764
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:50,800
Chief,

765
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,800
I'm a police officer.

766
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,800
What's the situation?

767
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:54,800
The 110 turned over.

768
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,800
It said that the machine of the Star Village,

769
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,800
Liu's family,

770
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,800
flew into the roof.

771
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,800
It broke the roof of the next-door,

772
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,800
the house of the Vice-President.

773
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,800
The Vice-President didn't do it.

774
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,800
Two pieces of it broke.

775
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,800
The machine broke the roof.

776
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,800
What kind of machine is this?

777
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:06,800

778
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,800
Who's the chief?

779
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:08,800
I'm the chief.

780
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,800

782
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,800
we went tolin't show up back in days.

783
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,800
We would film the military band.

784
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:19,800
Our staff

785
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,080

786
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:24,800
cover the oligarchy.

787
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,000
They committed a lot of crime and

788
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,680
opened a series of

789
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:29,800
police officers behind us.

790
