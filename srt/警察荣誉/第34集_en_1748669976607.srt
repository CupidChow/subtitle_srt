00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:43,240
We found out that this person has committed a crime.

51
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,240
He's the one we've been looking for.

52
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,240
We're going to tell him that this person is a ghost.

53
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,240
No way.

54
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,240
We're really sorry.

55
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,240
But our chief told us this.

56
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,240
We were supposed to be here.

57
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,240
He was here.

58
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,240
We'll stay here.

Nothing.

00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,240
Just tell me.

64
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,240
What?

65
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,240
We've done the case like this.

66
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,240
They're here to get rid of me.

67
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,240
If Qi Bei stays,

68
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,240
how can we take him?

69
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,240
We're here to get rid of him.

Chief, they're not letting us go.

74
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,240
Qi Bei wants to keep him.

75
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,240
Then, give them the case.

76
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,240
What do you mean?

77
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,240
We're sorry for the mistake.

78
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,240
We're here to get rid of him.

79
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,240

Okay.

83
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,240
Tell them we agree to keep him.

84
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,240
We're not just keeping him.

85
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,240
We're also going to transfer

86
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,240
all the cases in the bottle.

87
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,240
We'll transfer them to him.

88
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,240
You guys just wait and see.

89
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,240
Come back after you've done.

90
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,240
Okay, okay.

91

It's so boring.

92
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,240
You're still so annoying.

93
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,240
What do you mean?

94
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,240
I'll give you another tip.

95
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,240
Call the police.

96
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,240
If you miss a chance, you'll be in trouble.

97
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,240
What's trouble?

98
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,240
Look at the situation.

Looks like we're on our way.

You're so cheap.

108
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,240
You're not going to pay today.

109
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,240

Sing it.

120
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,240
Sing it faster.

We'll have to wait for you at the left lane.

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,240
The woman in the lock is recording.

197
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,240
President, I'll do it myself.

198
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,240
I'll do it myself.

199
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,240
Do you want to see our regular woman?

200
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,240
President, I'll do it.

201
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,240
Okay.

202
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,240
Come on, President.

203
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,240
I'll do it myself.

204
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,240
I'll do it myself.

205
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,240
I'll leave you behind.

206
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:52,240
Long live the country.

207
00:08:52,240 --> 00:09:03,240
Long live the country.

208
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:10,240
Long live the country.

209
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,240
You can go.

210
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,240
I'm going to celebrate the New Year.

211
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,240
I want to play with your classmates and friends.

212
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,240
Jia Jia,

213
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,240
I think I can go home tonight.

214
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,240
No, you can wait for me.

215
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,240
Why wait for me?

216
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,240
Have fun.

217
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,240
Come out and play with me.

218
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,240
I'll play with you.

219
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,240
Hello?

220
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,240
Don't talk.

221
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,240
Jia Jia, how's the New Year?

222
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,240
She's married to Xia Jie.

223
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,240
She's married to Xia Jie.

224
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,240
She's a long-time sister.

225
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,240
She's so hot-headed.

226
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,240
Xia Jie likes her.

227
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,240
Yes.

228
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,240
Xia Jie is a good girl.

229
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,240
I think she's grown up.

230
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,240
She's a good girl.

231
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,240
What do you mean?

232
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,240
Am I not good?

233
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,240
What does it have to do with you?

234
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,240
You're so hot-headed.

235
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,240
Do you think Xia Jie is interesting?

236
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,240
Do I?

237
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,240
Do others have it or not?

238
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,240
I'm telling you,

239
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,240
if you really have it,

240
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,240
you must tell her.

241
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,240
Do you hear me?

242
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,240
You can't hide it.

243
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,240
I'm just...

244
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,240
I'm just trying to understand

245
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,240
what's going on with Jia Jia's divorce.

246
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,240
I don't know what's going on.

247
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,240
What's going on?

248
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,240
Let me see.

249
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,240
I think it's here.

250
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,240
Sir.

251
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,240
This should be...

252
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,240
the place where I came to practice

253
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,240
and the way I live.

254
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,240
Let's go.

255
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,240
Let's go.

256
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,240
Let's go.

257
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,240
Let's go.

258
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,240
Let's go.

259
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,240
This moon...

260
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,240
will definitely not be flat.

261
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,240
It's like the red leaves in the three-leafed forest.

262
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,240
It's just the right time to celebrate.

263
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,240
There must be something wrong.

264
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,240
Come.

265
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,240
Come.

266
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,240
Come.

267
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,240
Come.

268
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,240
Come.

269
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,240
Come.

270
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,240
Come.

271
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,240
Remember this place.

272
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,240
We'll see if he comes again.

273
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,240
Okay.

274
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,240
Let's go.

275
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,240
Come.

276
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,240
You're here.

277
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,240
The electronic frauds and the special effects

278
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,240
are about to start.

279
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,240
This time,

280
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,240
Jin Zhen knows that we are also

281
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,240
organizing the special effects team.

282
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,240
The chief of the high-ranking general,

283
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,240
he's the soldier.

284
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,240
What's the situation?

285
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,240
We are reporting to the special effects team.

286
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,240
I'll be the soldier.

287
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,240
I want two young people this time.

288
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,240
Li Dawei.

289
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,240
Yes.

290
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,240
Zhao Jubei.

291
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,240
Yes.

292
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,240
Master.

293
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,240
Chen Gengni.

294
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,240
I'm not trying to be your disciple.

295
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,240
You are the disciples.

296
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,240
But this time,

297
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,240
I want two young people.

298
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,240
By the way,

299
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,240
I want two old people

300
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,240
to help me with the magic.

301
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,240
Wait a minute.

302
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,240
What's old?

303
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,240
You are old.

304
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,240
Sister, you are the disciple.

305
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,240
That's right.

306
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,240
The chief is old.

307
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,240
Why do you ask me to do that?

308
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,240
But I'm really a little emotional.

309
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,240
This time,

310
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,240
the change is really fast.

311
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,240
You can't even catch up with your shoes.

312
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,240
You know what?

313
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,240
When I was a police officer,

314
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,240
I taught the group

315
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,240
how to use this fraud.

316
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,240
At that time,

317
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,240
I was just warning the police.

318
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,240
Don't believe in others' words.

319
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,240
Now,

320
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,240
the money has been cheated.

321
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,240
You don't know where the money is.

322
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,240
But,

323
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,240
the high is the high.

324
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,240
So, everyone must work hard.

325
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,240
Work hard.

326
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,240
Okay, the meeting.

327
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,240
Master.

328
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,240
Go to the new police team with me.

329
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,240
Wait for me downstairs.

330
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,240
I'll come down right away.

331
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,240
Let's go.

332
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,240
Hello, chief.

333
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,240
Hello, chief.

334
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,240
Hello, chief.

335
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,240
Hello, chief.

336
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,240
Hello, chief.

337
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,240
I heard you went to Northeast.

338
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,240
Did you find anything?

339
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,240
Cold.

340
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,240
I'm so angry.

341
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,240
What's wrong, chief?

342
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,240
You are so kind to us.

343
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,240
What?

344
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,240
You didn't give up on the date of the crime?

345
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,240
This boy

346
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,240
came back from Northeast

347
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,240
when he was in his first year.

348
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,240
But,

349
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,240
it's a little bit.

350
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,240
You see,

351
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,240
he hasn't been home for so many years.

352
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,240
If he had been home for a year,

353
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,240
why would he go back to his first year

354
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,240
in a hurry?

355
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,240
If he hadn't been home for a year,

356
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,240
why would he go back

357
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,240
to his first year in a hurry?

358
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,240
Is it possible

359
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,240
that he would go back to his first year

360
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,240
to pay for the high?

361
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,240
Is it possible that he would drive a car?

362
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,240
It's possible.

363
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,240
We have collected

364
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,240
his surveillance video.

365
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,240
You can have a look.

366
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,240
Okay.

367
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,240
He always drives a black car

368
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,240
in his old age.

369
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,240
When he's free,

370
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,240
he goes to the entertainment mall

371
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,240
to take a break.

372
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,240
He didn't find any common phenomenon.

373
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,240
Chief Luo,

374
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,240
no one has reported

375
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,240
that we were missing before.

376
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,240
Really?

377
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,240
But,

378
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,240
this doesn't mean

379
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,240
no one is missing.

380
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,240
You know that

381
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,240
women in the mall

382
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,240
are very active.

383
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,240
They are also over a year old.

384
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,240
Many people

385
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,240
leave without even saying

386
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,240
a word

387
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,240
for a year.

388
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,240
The boss only knows

389
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,240
that they are not coming back

390
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,240
after a year.

391
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,240
As long as the boss

392
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,240
and the family

393
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,240
don't report a case,

394
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,240
even if

395
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,240
someone is missing,

396
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,240
we can't confirm it.

397
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,240
We can only know.

398
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,240
Chief Luo,

399
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,240
although we have

400
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,240
a valuable

401
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,240
clue in the East America,

402
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,240
we haven't found anything.

403
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,240
But I think

404
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,240
this person's suspicion

405
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,240
is more important.

406
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,240
He must be involved.

407
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,240
Let's take care of it.

408
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,240
Don't worry.

409
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,240
We will find a case

410
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,240
that needs patience.

411
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,240
Right.

412
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,240
Chief Luo,

413
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,240
it's interesting.

414
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,240
Chief Luo

415
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,240
used a word

416
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,240
to explain it.

417
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,240
Look,

418
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,240
from the earliest

419
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,240
we found a clue

420
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,240
and then we found

421
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,240
a suspect.

422
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,240
Through this suspect,

423
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,240
we found more clues.

424
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,240
We found the suspect,

425
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,240
the suspect,

426
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,240
and finally

427
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,240
we saw the whole case.

428
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,240
Then we found

429
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,240
the criminal and the criminal.

430
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,240
The suspect

431
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,240
and the suspect

432
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,240
were in the same case.

433
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,240
This case

434
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,240
was a case.

435
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,240
Finally,

436
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,240
we found a case.

437
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,240
Some people

438
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,240
consider it

439
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,240
a case

440
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,240
that they were in.

441
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,240
But

442
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,240
I don't like this word.

443
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,240
I'm afraid that

444
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,240
I'll forget it when I'm used to it.

445
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,240
The case

446
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,240
we're facing

447
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,240
is not just

448
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,240
a cold case.

449
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,240
It's a person

450
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,240
who lives a life.

451
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,240
Chief Luo,

452
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,240
I remember.

453
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,240
I don't need this word in the future.

454
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,240
Come in.

455
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,240
Hello,

456
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,240
Chief Luo.

457
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,240
I'm here to tell you

458
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,240
about your case.

459
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,240
Okay, tell me.

460
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,240
The electric chip we received

461
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,240
is 32th in total.

462
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,240
The current is only 2nd.

463
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,240
The money we received

464
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,240
was transferred.

465
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,240
No one was caught.

466
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,240
The rest

467
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,240
was either found

468
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,240
or found.

469
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,240
The suspect was also abroad.

470
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,240
Hello.

471
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,240
David,

472
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,240
tell me your opinion.

473
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,240
There's a common point

474
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,240
in this case.

475
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,240
It's all

476
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,240
to deceive people with high-tech.

477
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,240
To deceive people with high-tech

478
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,240
is

479
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,240
to be honest,

480
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,240
it's a big problem.

481
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,240
It's a big problem.

482
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,240
It's not a big deal.

483
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,240
If people don't want to be caught,

484
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,240
they won't be deceived.

485
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,240
You said

486
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,240
it's a matter of future education.

487
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,240
I'm asking you now.

488
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,240
Tell me.

489
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,240
I think

490
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,240
we should

491
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,240
break this case from the beginning.

492
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,240
It's not easy.

493
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,240
Which one is easy?

494
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,240
Tell me.

495
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,240
110 just found a police.

496
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,240
Someone called from abroad

497
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,240
and said it's possible

498
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,240
that someone would

499
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,240
be live-streamed

500
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,240
in our area.

501
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,240
We're live-streamed?

502
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,240
Yes.

503
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,240
How did he know

504
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,240
he was abroad?

505
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,240
The police called from the US.

506
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,240
They said they saw

507
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,240
this girl on Weibo

508
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,240
and they even posted a selfie.

509
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,240
He told the police

510
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,240
to tell the girl

511
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,240
that it's possible

512
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,240
that we're live-streamed.

513
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,240
He's still talking to the girl.

514
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,240
He's taking the time.

515
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,240
He wants us to

516
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,240
find this girl as soon as possible.

517
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,240
How about this?

518
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,240
Send the photo to each group.

519
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,240
Then tell the netizen

520
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,240
to find a way

521
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,240
to get this girl's phone number.

522
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,240
Okay.

523
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,240
Go.

524
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,240
It's important to be in the area.

525
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,240
Search for the group

526
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,240
and the live-streamed area.

527
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,240
I'm Dong Sanba.

528
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,240
I'm Dong Sanba.

529
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,240
Please contact the netizen

530
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,240
who just reported the police.

531
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:24,720
Because the suicide

532
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,240
has already established

533
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,240
a new trust with him.

534
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,240
Let him keep talking to the suicide

535
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,240
continuously.

536
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,240
Try to delay the time.

537
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,240
Okay?

538
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,240
Sir,

539
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,240
what's going on here?

540
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,240
We can't find the photo

541
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,240
of this half-dried duck.

542
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,240
Now there's a building.

543
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,240
They're not even there.

544
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,240
It could be dangerous right now.

545
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,340
Sir,

546
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,740
were we looking for this area recently?

547
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,240
Sir,

548
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,240
Sir,

549
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:24,760
there's some stuff

550
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,440
from yesterday that was

551
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,640
They called me yesterday.

552
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,040
They contacted me on the Internet.

553
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,440
They sent this girl to Weibo.

554
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,440
She's really a suicide.

555
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,240
Newspaper.

556
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,440
What?

557
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,240
Newspaper.

558
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,040
How do you know?

559
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,640
The report of the Dong Sanba.

560
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,840
The place where the killer is,

561
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,120
should be between the 22nd and 25th

562
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,640
of the Newspaper Garden.

563
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,040
It's at the top.

564
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,840
We'll give the missing location as soon as possible.

565
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,840
That's it.

566
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,640
How do you know so well?

567
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,840
This is not the place.

568
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,840
Yes.

569
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,640
It's there.

570
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,640
Look.

571
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,640
There's a TV station next to this building.

572
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,840
This is the lock.

573
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,440
Hello?

574
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,440
Newspaper Garden.

575
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,440
Manager Yuan.

576
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,640
I'm Chen Xincheng,

577
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,640
the newspaper.

578
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,440
Please inform the security team

579
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,840
of our neighborhood,

580
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,040
and the security team.

581
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,640
You're also in the security department.

582
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,240
Wait for me at the west gate of our neighborhood.

583
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,240
We'll be there soon.

584
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,440
Master, do you want to inform the cell?

585
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,440
Yes.

586
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,240
But we can't

587
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,440
make sure the killer is still there.

588
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,440
But we must keep in touch with the cell.

589
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,640
Boss.

590
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,440
This Newspaper Garden is an old neighborhood.

591
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,040
It's not easy to get into the small room.

592
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,440
By then,

593
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,040
we'll have to rely on our mother.

594
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,440
Don't 38, don't 38.

595
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,040
Can we make sure the target is Newspaper Garden?

596
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,640
We'll make sure as soon as possible.

597
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,040
Don't 38, don't 38.

598
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,040
Other people are approaching you.

599
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,640
Please be careful.

600
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,240
Don't 38, understand.

601
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,640
Don't 38, don't 38.

602
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,640
Don't 38, don't 38.

603
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,640
Don't 38, don't 38.

604
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,640
Don't 38, don't 38.

605
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,640
Hello, sir.

606
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,640
Hello.

607
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,640
What's the matter?

608
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,640
This way.

609
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,640
Master,

610
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,640
is there really anyone in the building?

611
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,640
Where is the umbrella?

612
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,640
It's so high.

613
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,640
Master, what should we do?

614
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,640
Dai Lei,

615
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,640
report to the command center right away.

616
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,640
Tell them to come over right away.

617
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,640
Okay.

618
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,640
You guys,

619
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,640
immediately contact this road.

620
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,640
The people are scattered.

621
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,640
Especially the elderly and the children.

622
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,640
And the ones we came over just now,

623
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,640
the small businessmen,

624
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,640
immediately distribute the umbrella.

625
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,640
We'll send them to the hospital.

626
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,640
We'll send them to the small businessmen.

627
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,640
And they'll be there immediately.

628
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,640
We'll guarantee the road is smooth.

629
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,640
The small businessmen will be here soon.

630
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,640
We'll guarantee them

631
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,640
to be able to survive smoothly.

632
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,640
Okay, go, go, go.

633
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,640
Master,

634
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,640
Xiao Fang is leaving.

635
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,640
Okay.

636
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,640
Dai Wei,

637
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,640
come with me.

638
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,640
I'll go upstairs and have a look.

639
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,640
Okay.

640
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,640
Just a moment.

641
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,640
We sent the umbrella to Wei Bo again.

642
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,640
We distributed it to her parents,

643
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,640
her nephew and her cat.

644
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,640
Master,

645
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,640
I think she's a liar.

646
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,640
She's a liar.

647
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,640
She's a liar.

648
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,640
Let go of me!

649
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,640
Don't move!

650
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,640
You're alive!

651
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,640
Let go of me!

652
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,640
She's a liar.

653
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,640
She's a liar.

654
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,640
We'll catch her.

655
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,640
Master,

656
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,640
the police is coming soon.

657
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,640
We'll wait for them.

658
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,640
The girl is looking at me.

659
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,640
Don't talk.

660
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,640
Don't come over!

661
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,640
If you come over,

662
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,640
I'll jump down right now!

663
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,640
Don't, girl.

664
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,640
We won't go over.

665
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,640
Girl,

666
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,640
can you tell us

667
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,640
what happened?

668
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,640
Why did you do that?

669
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,640
Tell us.

670
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,640
We can help you.

671
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,640
We can't help.

672
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,640
No one can help.

673
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,640
I'm saying goodbye to this ugly world.

674
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,640
Don't disturb me!

675
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,640
Okay, okay.

676
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,640
We won't talk.

677
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,640
But,

678
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,640
I want to remind you,

679
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,640
right now, don't jump.

680
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,640
Look,

681
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,640
there are many old people and children downstairs.

682
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,640
If you jump down now,

683
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,640
you'll probably hit them.

684
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,640
Many innocent people

685
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,640
will go to the Internet.

686
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,640
If you choose to do this,

687
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,640
you'll be hurt.

688
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,640
So,

689
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,640
you don't want to hurt other people, do you?

690
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,640
It seems

691
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,640
he's still giving you the news.

692
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,640
So ugly.

693
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,640
I thought I could believe

694
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,640
the last person

695
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,640
before I left the world.

696
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,640
But I didn't think I was cheated again.

697
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,640
You're saying that

698
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,640
you're the friend of the American.

699
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,640
Sister,

700
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,640
he's trying to save you to call the police.

701
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,640
You can't treat others as a lie.

702
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,640
I don't want to hear you guys talk.

703
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,640
I'm tired.

704
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,640
Just let me enjoy the last love.

705
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,640
Okay, okay.

706
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,640
Of course, of course.

707
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,640
As long as you can promise us,

708
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,640
don't jump with me now.

709
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,640
Let's start the group.

710
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,640
Dafei,

711
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,640
call them.

712
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,640
Tell them to start the group.

713
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,640
Don't be ridiculous.

714
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,640
I'll call them.

715
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,640
Where's Xiaofang?

716
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,640
Two people with my master.

717
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,640
Yes, yes.

718
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,640
The situation is not optimistic.

719
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,640
Let's hurry up.

720
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,640
Okay, okay.

721
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,640
Thank you, thank you.

722
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,640
I see it.

723
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,640
The police is here.

724
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,640
Where's the man?

725
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,640
He's on the special team.

726
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,640
Brother Qian has already gone up.

727
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,640
Okay.

728
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,640
Xiaofang is on the ground.

729
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,640
There are still a few minutes left.

730
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,640
Master,

731
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,640
did you see that?

732
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,640
Did you see that?

733
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,640
It won't jump.

734
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,640
The more emotional he is,

735
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,640
the more he's been doing it.

736
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,640
There won't be any excessive actions.

737
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,640
Look at his performance now.

738
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,640
It's a little bit of a decision.

739
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,640
It might jump anytime.

740
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,640
Master,

741
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,640
our people are here.

742
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,640
I think he's in danger.

743
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,640
That means

744
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,640
he knows

745
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,640
if he jumps now,

746
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,640
will he hurt the others?

747
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,640
Thank you.

748
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,640
Thank you.

749
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,640
To be honest,

750
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,640
I was a little scared just now.

751
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,640
But now I'm not scared at all.

752
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,640
Why don't you remember me?

753
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,640
I've seen your Weibo.

754
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,640
Miss,

755
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,640
I've seen your recent Weibo.

756
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,640
I think there's a problem.

757
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,640
Listen to me.

758
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,640
You seem to be thinking very well.

759
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,640
Your parents,

760
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,640
your nephew,

761
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,640
and even your little cat

762
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,640
have already said goodbye.

763
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,640
But you forgot

764
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,640
the key details.

765
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,640
You didn't tell them

766
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,640
the reason why you're leaving this step.

767
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,640
Have you ever thought about your parents?

768
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,640
I'm also a father.

769
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,640
I have a daughter.

770
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,640
I'm a few years younger than you.

771
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,640
My parents want to take you 20 years.

772
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,640
In the end,

773
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,640
they choose to end their lives

774
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,640
in this way.

775
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,640
They want to send them to the black magicians.

776
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,640
No.

777
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,640
I don't want to explain.

778
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,640
I can't explain to them.

779
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,640
You don't have to explain.

780
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,640
You don't have to explain, silly girl.

781
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,640
What do you mean?

782
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,640
You just have to give your parents

783
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,640
an explanation.

784
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,640
You have an explanation.

785
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,640
Beijing has been adopted for more than 20 years.

786
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,640
Shouldn't you do this?

787
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,640
They shouldn't know.

788
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,640
Dawei,

789
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,640
give your phone to this sister first.

790
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,640
Come on.

791
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,640
Call them.

792
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,640
Tell them the reason.

793
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,640
We won't go

794
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,640
to the three sentences.

795
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,640
Come and get it yourself.

796
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,640
Right.

797
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,640
Don't look at the ears.

798
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,640
Don't look at the ears.

799
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,640
If you don't look at the ears,

800
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,640
they will never live

801
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,640
in the next half of their lives

802
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,640
and be in the next half of their lives.

803
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,640
Dad.

804
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,640
Dad.

805
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,640
Dad.

806
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,640
Dad.

807
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,640
Dad.

808
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,640
Dad.

809
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,640
Dad.

810
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,640
Dawei.

811
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,640
Dawei, stop.

812
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,780
Jesus' Moses

813
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,940
Myief

814
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,620
Review

815
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:39,480
During my

816
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,480
Tell me.

817
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,480
Tell me.

818
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,480
What if he takes us to the hospital?

819
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,480
What will we do?

820
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,480
No way.

821
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,480
No way.

822
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,480
I'll take you up.

823
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,480
I'll take you up.

824
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,480
This girl is a typical

825
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,480
movie theater.

826
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,480
These are a theater.

827
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,480
They call the movie theater

828
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,480
called the pig.

829
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,480
They have enough time to raise pigs.

830
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,480
They kill them after they feed them.

831
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,480
This is the pig's plate.

832
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,480
This girl is called Wu Yu.

833
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,480
She looks like a normal person.

834
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,480
She is quite confident.

835
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,480
She has never found a ideal boyfriend.

836
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,480
Her father left her

837
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,480
more than 100 million medical products and two properties.

838
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,480
After her father passed away,

839
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,480
a 30-year-old man

840
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,480
entered his life and became friends with him.

841
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,480
And he is a father's official.

842
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,480
When his medical products were on his boyfriend,

843
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,480
they were almost the same size.

844
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,480
He suddenly changed his face.

845
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,480
After he was humiliated,

846
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,480
he disappeared.

847
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,480
Wu Yu was injured and his spirit was in a trance.

848
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,480
Later, he registered

849
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,480
a personal information on a thousand-mile-long exchange website.

850
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,480
He wanted to find another boyfriend.

851
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,480
Soon, someone replied,

852
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,480
According to the registration information,

853
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,480
this man is called Tian Gaoping.

854
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,480
He is a man of the sea.

855
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,480
He said he is a soldier.

856
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,480
He worked hard to find a phone repair shop.

857
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,480
Wu Yu is not confident enough

858
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,480
about her appearance.

859
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,480
He is also hurt by her feelings.

860
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,480
So, he is not very demanding of her boyfriend.

861
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,480
So, this little man is in line with his expectations.

862
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,480
The most important thing is that

863
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,480
he shows a little bit of love for Wu Yu.

864
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,480
He is gentle and considerate.

865
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,480
And he is very friendly to Wu Yu.

866
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,480
He often says to Wu Yu,

867
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,480
You are suffering.

868
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,480
When we are together,

869
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,480
I will protect you.

870
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,480
I will not let anyone hurt you.

871
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,480
Wu Yu is very moved.

872
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,480
The little boss also told Wu Yu

873
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,480
that he has no money.

874
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,480
He can't give him a better life.

875
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,480
Wu Yu told him that he has money and a house.

876
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,480
He told his family directly to you.

877
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,480
The little boss said,

878
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,480
How can you tell your family

879
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,480
to others?

880
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,480
Your money and your house are yours.

881
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,480
Don't tell anyone, including me.

882
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,480
Wu Yu thinks he is

883
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,480
the right person.

884
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,480
Then, the two of them start dating.

885
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,480
Have they ever met before?

886
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,480
No way.

887
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,480
The characteristic of this sand house is

888
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,480
that the two of them will not meet at all.

889
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,480
What's going on now?

890
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,480
The two of them are not seeing each other.

891
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,480
They are dating.

892
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,480
Boss, you don't understand this.

893
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,480
What is love?

894
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,480
What is alliance?

895
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,480
It is not easy to meet, so you have to meet.

896
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,480
You know it.

897
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,480
You are so blind.

898
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,480
You want to make this trick, right?

899
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,480
No way.

900
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,480
They have never met before.

901
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,480
They have never talked in the video.

902
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,480
They just left a KQ account.

903
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,480
This man is communicating with him

904
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,480
through KQ Yu.

905
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,480
He sometimes makes videos.

906
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,480
But they are all the scenes

907
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,480
of his life.

908
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,480
He didn't show up in this picture.

909
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,480
According to him,

910
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,480
he wants to create a mysterious feeling

911
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,480
that will make him really blind.

912
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,480
Because he is so fat and innocent.

913
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,480
He doesn't want his boyfriend to see

914
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,480
his face in this picture.

915
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,480
After they have met for four months,

916
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,480
Wu Yu thinks he has fallen in love with him deeply.

917
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,480
But for those who are on the sand house,

918
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,480
the pig has been raised almost.

919
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,480
It is good to start a business.

920
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,480
You think

921
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,480
this kind of probability

922
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,480
is too low?

923
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,480
But he has an internal relationship.

924
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,480
What kind of relationship?

925
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,480
He said

926
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,480
that his uncle

927
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,480
is the person who works in the website.

928
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,480
He can get the information.

929
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,480
But this

930
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,480
is illegal.

931
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,480
He didn't tell anyone.

932
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,480
We had a chat

933
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,480
and we were happy.

934
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,480
He accidentally said it.

935
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,480
It seems that

936
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,480
he was really

937
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,480
careless.

938
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,480
Then,

939
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,480
he asked you to buy it.

940
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,480
He didn't let me buy it.

941
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,480
I am willing to.

942
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,480
He always pays attention to the price.

943
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,480
He will buy me some small gifts

944
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,480
when he pays attention to the price.

945
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,480
I am very touched.

946
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,480
Then?

947
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,480
This girl

948
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,480
didn't hold back.

949
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,480
She wanted to buy

950
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,480
some big gifts

951
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,480
and the first time she invested 100,000.

952
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,480
She spent a lot of money

953
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,480
and got back 120,000.

954
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,480
She thought

955
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,480
she was more reliable than the bank.

956
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,480
She kept buying it.

957
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,480
But she said

958
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,480
we should have your money

959
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,480
and you should have it.

960
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,480
She believed

961
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,480
that this man

962
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,480
could give her a second-hand.

963
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,480
She could

964
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,480
register the website.

965
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,480
She tried to

966
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,480
invest a few coins

967
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,480
according to the instructions

968
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,480
of this man.

969
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,480
But

970
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,480
the small money

971
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,480
slowly became bigger.

972
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,480
99% invested all the money.

973
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,480
This man knew

974
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,480
he had two houses.

975
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,480
Did this kid really sell this house?

976
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,480
Actually, I didn't want to sell it

977
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,480
at first.

978
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,480
To be honest,

979
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,480
when he told me

980
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,480
he was suspicious of this house

981
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,480
when he was thinking about selling it,

982
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,480
I told him

983
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,480
that when we get married

984
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,480
in the future,

985
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,480
we can get a wedding house.

986
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,480
I don't want him

987
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,480
to suffer

988
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,480
because of me.

989
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,480
But he told me

990
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,480
he must give me a house.

991
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,480
This is his promise to me.

992
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,480
So the wedding house

993
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,480
must be bought by him.

994
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,480
I was so touched.

995
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,480
I even

996
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,480
I even felt ashamed

997
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,480
because I suspected him.

998
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,480
Plus, he told me

999
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,480
that it's hard to get a chance

1000
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,480
because of me.

1001
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,480
So I

1002
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,480
betrayed my mother

1003
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,480
and sold the house

1004
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,480
that my father left me.

1005
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,480
What chance?

1006
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,480
Tian Kaoping said that the website needs repair.

1007
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,480
He can do some hand-shaking

1008
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,480
during the repair website.

1009
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,480
And make a big profit.

1010
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,480
He also told Wu Yu

1011
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,480
that you should invest the 300 million in the house.

1012
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,480
I promise you.

1013
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,480
Plus, the 300 million in the house

1014
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,480
will help him buy the lottery tickets.

1015
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,480
You can invest it all.

1016
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,480
And then?

1017
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,480
He told me

1018
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,480
that the repair time is two days.

1019
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,480
I haven't

1020
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,480
talked to him in two days.

1021
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,480
But I haven't

1022
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,480
brought any news in two days.

1023
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,480
I sent him a gift.

1024
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,480
I gave him a black one.

1025
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,480
I found that I couldn't

1026
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,480
get the money on the website.

1027
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,480
I'm really going to eat it.

1028
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,480
I didn't give him the money.

1029
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,480
This girl was cheated

1030
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,480
in the world.

1031
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,480
She chose to trade for the money

1032
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,480
for the sake of the world.

1033
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,480
She was cheated in the first time.

1034
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,480
So she lost her confidence

1035
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,480
in the world.

1036
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,480
You have money, right?

1037
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,480
Why did you borrow the high-end loan?

1038
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,480
It wasn't my loan.

1039
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,480
It was her loan.

1040
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,480
She borrowed it?

1041
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,480
What does she have to do with you?

1042
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,480
But we are his girlfriend.

1043
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,480
She told me

1044
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,480
that she had

1045
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,480
some problems in the company.

1046
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,480
She couldn't make money.

1047
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,480
I said I could lend you money.

1048
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,480
But she said

1049
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,480
she couldn't have money

1050
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,480
from her friend.

1051
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,480
She had to lend money

1052
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,480
to her own father.

1053
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,480
She just wanted me to help her.

1054
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,480
What help?

1055
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,480
Help her.

1056
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,480
Help her.

1057
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,480
I'm sorry.

1058
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,480
I'm sorry.

1059
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,480
I'm sorry.

1060
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,480
I'm sorry.

1061
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,480
I'm sorry.

1062
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,480
I'm sorry.

1063
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,480
I'm sorry.

1064
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,480
I'm sorry.

1065
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,480
I'm sorry.

1066
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,480
I'm sorry.

1067
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,480
I'm sorry.

1068
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:21,480
I'm sorry.

1069
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,480
I'm sorry.

1070
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,480
I'm sorry.

1071
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,480
I'm sorry.

1072
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,480
I'm sorry.

1073
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,480
I'm sorry.

1074
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,480
I'm sorry.

1075
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,480
I'm sorry.

1076
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,480
I'm sorry.

1077
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,480
I'm sorry.

1078
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,480
I'm sorry.

1079
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,480
I'm sorry.

1080
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,480
I'm sorry.

1081
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,480
I'm sorry.

1082
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,480
I'm sorry.

1083
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,480
I'm sorry.

1084
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,480
I'm sorry.

1085
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,480
I'm sorry.

1086
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,480
I'm sorry.
