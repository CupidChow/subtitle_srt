1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I

4
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,420
I

5
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:40,580
I

6
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,460
I

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Don't worry.

9
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Don't worry.

10
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's over.

11
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
What's the use of looking for him?

12
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I don't know who I'm looking for.

13
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Calm down.

14
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Okay, police.

15
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You're the police.

16
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You're the boss.

17
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
He's trying to scare me.

18
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Do you care about him?

19
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Listen to me.

20
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Listen to me.

21
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
He's the boss.

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
He's in the hospital.

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
What? He beat my wife and child?

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
He's still in the hospital?

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
He's in the hospital?

26
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Don't touch him.

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
But the child is still in hospital.

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Let's go see the child.

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
We need to find him.

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Don't disturb us.

31
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I need to find him.

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I need to find him.

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
How can he be like this?

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
We need to find him.

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
What's the matter?

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Go and see the uncle.

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Call his family as soon as possible.

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Okay, I'll go.

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Okay, I'll go.

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Uncle Yang, we're in a fight.

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What fight?

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I don't know what he said.

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Water.

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Water.

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Hello, what's the matter?

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
He's been lying down.

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
He's sleeping.

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What's the matter?

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
We need to find him.

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
He's in the hospital.

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
He's in the hospital.

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Listen to me.

53
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
He's in the hospital.

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Don't touch him.

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
He's in the hospital.

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
He's in the hospital.

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Calm down.

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You're talking about the good news.

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You're talking about them, right?

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
How can I say?

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The doctor hasn't seen the patient.

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Why should I lie to him?

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
What do you want?

64
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Besides, you're here.

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Don't look down on the elderly.

66
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
What are you arguing with the doctor?

67
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Don't look down on the doctor.

68
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Don't touch Dongqiao.

69
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
There's no other way.

70
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You're only going to get them out.

71
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You're going to get them out.

72
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Right?

73
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Listen to me.

74
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
This is your wife's fault.

75
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
We all know

76
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
she has nothing to do with the other person.

77
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You think it's okay?

78
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I think

79
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
you're going to put her in this way.

80
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You're going to put her in this way.

81
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
We have all the video records.

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
We have all the video records.

83
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
We can prove

84
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
that your wife is really a good doctor.

85
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Besides,

86
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
she has a dog that can cure her.

87
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
She's the one who's the best dog.

88
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
What kind of a joke is that?

89
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You're talking nonsense.

90
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm not talking nonsense.

91
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You're talking nonsense.

92
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You're talking nonsense.

93
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You're talking nonsense.

94
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Calm down.

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
What are you shouting?

96
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
This is a hospital, you know?

97
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Your old man is not sick.

98
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You're arguing here.

99
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
This is a new disease.

100
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
This is a new disease.

101
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Let me warn you.

102
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
If you're here, I'll take the power to do it.

103
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
What are you looking at?

104
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I...

105
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Clean it up.

106
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Don't touch me.

107
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Who are you looking at?

108
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Don't touch me.

109
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Are you okay?

110
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm fine, everyone.

111
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Don't touch me.

112
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Don't touch me.

113
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I just went out to buy a dish.

114
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I found out that there's no key.

115
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
If I remember correctly,

116
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
you must be in the 18th floor.

117
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yes, yes.

118
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Look at the top floor.

119
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And the one next to the windmill.

120
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Officer Zhang, you're so good.

121
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Come on, let's go to the hospital.

122
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Officer Zhang, you told me

123
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
to install a security door.

124
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
But my security door is too safe.

125
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
There's no key. He can't open it.

126
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Where's your lover?

127
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
He doesn't have a key.

128
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm out of work. I'll be back in a few days.

129
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I can't sleep on the corridor these days.

130
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
So you mean...

131
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Officer Zhang, please help me get the key.

132
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Get it?

133
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
How can we get it?

134
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Look,

135
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
there's no windmill next to me, right?

136
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You just pull the wall and sell it.

137
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I don't care about the windows.

138
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Have you watched a lot of American movies?

139
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You think we're the police?

140
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
No, Officer Zhang,

141
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
who's this little guy?

142
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
How can we talk?

143
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
We're the police.

144
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
We just want you to serve us.

145
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Don't be so excited.

146
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
We just got here.

147
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
How can we talk?

148
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
He's just kidding.

149
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
No, Officer Zhang,

150
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
you just say that you're helping or not.

151
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Look,

152
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
you're in a dangerous situation.

153
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
We're going upstairs.

154
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
If you don't be careful,

155
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
we'll fall here.

156
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You'll have to keep

157
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
thinking about us.

158
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
How about this?

159
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You can ask a driver

160
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
to pay us 200 yuan.

161
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's not money.

162
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's not easy to make money now.

163
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
How about this?

164
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You ask the driver.

165
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'll pay you this.

166
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Okay?

167
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
This...

168
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
This is not right.

169
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's right.

170
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'll pay 200 yuan.

171
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It's not right to buy two lives.

172
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Don't hesitate.

173
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Call me.

174
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'll call you.

175
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Officer Li,

176
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
you're not a family anymore?

177
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You're still working on your phone?

178
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Can you not be so biased to me?

179
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Do I have to be biased to you?

180
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Is it like this?

181
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
We're not related to each other.

182
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
We know a name.

183
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's Wang Jian Guo.

184
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
What's the matter?

185
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Do you know how many Wang Jian Guo

186
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
are in the police station?

187
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You don't know how to record?

188
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Do you know

189
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
how many Wang Jian Guo

190
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
are in the 70s?

191
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Why are you talking nonsense?

192
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Say something serious.

193
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Say something serious.

194
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
After my investigation and investigation,

195
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I just locked 16 police stations.

196
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I sent them the photos of Wang Jian Guo.

197
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
The police station just called.

198
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Say something serious.

199
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Say something serious.

200
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
But I can't confirm it.

201
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
One is because the number of the police station

202
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
is too small.

203
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
The other is because the number of the police station

204
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
is too small.

205
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Our police station

206
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
is closed for the film.

207
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Can't you take a real film?

208
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I have to let people take a real film first.

209
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
What are you talking about?

210
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'm not awake yet.

211
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Master,

212
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
tell me.

213
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Tell me.

214
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
The police station said

215
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
that our country

216
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
and their country

217
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
might not be as good as theirs.

218
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Their country

219
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
is under the influence of family.

220
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
People don't care.

221
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
The police station has been locked for several times.

222
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
The police station is

223
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
under the influence of the police station.

224
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Master,

225
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
you won.

226
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
The doctor said

227
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
he was a liver surgeon.

228
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
He was a liver surgeon.

229
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
He was a liver surgeon.

230
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
He was a liver surgeon.

231
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You said

232
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
he was a liver surgeon.

233
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Master,

234
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
are you awake?

235
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I ran away from your mother.

236
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
She had to give me money to treat her.

237
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Master,

238
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
you are sick

239
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
with her.

240
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You are sick with her.

241
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It has nothing to do with her.

242
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It has nothing to do with her.

243
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
She was the one

244
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
who gave me this disease.

245
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
The doctor said

246
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
you were a liver surgeon.

247
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You have been liver surgeon for several years.

248
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
She caught your face.

249
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
She caught your liver.

250
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
She caught your liver.

251
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Master.

252
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I am not hungry.

253
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
If she doesn't answer me,

254
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I can't come here.

255
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Master,

256
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
don't be so excited.

257
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Now, I am not feeling well.

258
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
We came here

259
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
to talk about

260
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
how to contact your family.

261
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I don't have a family.

262
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Wang Tianguo,

263
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
you are in the back of the village, right?

264
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Your calligraphy shows

265
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
that you don't only have a wife,

266
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
but also a son.

267
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Even you are her sister...

268
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
The family...

269
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Exhausted.....

270
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Especially me.

271
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,080
When did I marry the

272
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
ál imposter?

273
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,480
Wherever I am in the capital,

274
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I wait in jail

275
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
for you and your family.

276
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,120
You should be Ive

277
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:48,960
your family.

278
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I'm dying.

279
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I'm really dying.

280
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Don't think I'm wrong.

281
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I really can't.

282
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I really can't.

283
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
How can I live?

284
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
What do you mean?

285
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'm dying.

286
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Come on.

287
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'll do it.

288
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Don't worry.

289
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
That old man is not a good dog.

290
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
He's just pretending.

291
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I think it's reasonable to let him go.

292
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I knew you'd say that.

293
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
He's so young.

294
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
If he's really sick, what should we do?

295
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Look at Li Dawei.

296
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
He's been in the hospital for so long.

297
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
How many cases can he take?

298
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
But he's just a normal person.

299
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
He's more law-abiding.

300
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Uncle,

301
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
the reality is the theory.

302
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Our reality is to solve the problem.

303
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It's not about who's right or wrong.

304
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
If we solve the problem,

305
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
then it's true.

306
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
But we're police.

307
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
We're criminals.

308
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
We're wrong.

309
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
We don't know who's right.

310
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
We don't know who's wrong.

311
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It's not a word.

312
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
The reality is to fool us.

313
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Just now,

314
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
you said you didn't fool us.

315
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You're talking nonsense.

316
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Can they leave?

317
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Can the hospital be quiet and normal?

318
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Which one is right?

319
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You have to learn to be smart.

320
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Right?

321
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Master,

322
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
last time we saw that eight-faced man in the big library,

323
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
should we pay attention to him?

324
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Jinwei,

325
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
should you stay here?

326
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You're always so busy in the office.

327
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It's not a big deal.

328
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I have a place to stay, master.

329
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I have a relative in the city.

330
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Besides,

331
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I just got here.

332
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I want to get familiar with everyone.

333
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
There are big cases every day.

334
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I'm busy.

335
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I can't get over it.

336
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I'm so busy.

337
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I'm really out of money, master.

338
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Let's go.

339
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I heard you left home.

340
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Who did my mom call?

341
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
She and Zolidai are not close.

342
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
If that's the case,

343
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I won't go back.

344
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I've rented a house anyway.

345
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
It's not easy.

346
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Really.

347
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It's not easy for her either.

348
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I think you should have a good chat with her.

349
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Even if you want to move out,

350
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
it can't be because of gambling.

351
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
It's really for convenience.

352
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
When you say it,

353
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
she should understand.

354
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I'm not sure.

355
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I'm not sure.

356
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I'm not sure.

357
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I'm not sure.

358
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I'm not sure.

359
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I'm not sure.

360
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
She should understand.

361
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I hope she can do something

362
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
and let her change.

363
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I'll send you back later.

364
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I'll send you back later.

365
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I'll send you back later.

366
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
What's up?

367
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I just called

368
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
the club leader.

369
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
The club leader said...

370
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
What's his name?

371
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Wang Jianguo.

372
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Right.

373
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Wang Jianguo.

374
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
He said

375
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Wang Jianguo has been

376
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
missing for two years.

377
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
The club leader is very busy.

378
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
He should have a meeting

379
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
and a meeting.

380
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
As long as he can pay the debt,

381
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
he can't do anything.

382
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
As long as he can pay the debt,

383
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
he can use the medical insurance.

384
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
You're talking nonsense.

385
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
He's in their house now.

386
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
He can't keep the money.

387
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
If he has the medical insurance,

388
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
how can he pay the debt?

389
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
You can't say that.

390
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
After all,

391
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
people are busy

392
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
with our business.

393
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Can we push him?

394
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
No.

395
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Chief,

396
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
the situation is like this.

397
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Even if the medical insurance is guaranteed,

398
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
we can't give you 100% insurance.

399
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Wang Jianguo is now

400
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
a liver transplant.

401
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
When will you be able to get the money?

402
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I don't know.

403
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
There's more.

404
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
When we came back from the hospital,

405
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
the hospital said

406
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
we would have to pay the hospital bills

407
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
tomorrow.

408
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
They took Wang Jianguo to our clinic.

409
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
That's not enough.

410
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
That's not enough.

411
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Okay.

412
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Let's send the paper to the hospital.

413
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Our clinic is a hard paper.

414
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Then wait.

415
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I'm too crowded here.

416
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Didn't I tell you that

417
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
the urgent matter

418
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
is to find the family?

419
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
We're looking for them.

420
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
If you call them,

421
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I'll come back

422
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
and report to them.

423
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
We'll discuss it.

424
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Yes.

425
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I was thinking like this.

426
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I was thinking about it.

427
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
We'll discuss it.

428
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Forget it.

429
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
It's late.

430
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
You should go back and rest.

431
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Tomorrow morning,

432
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
you should go to the family.

433
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
What about the hospital's hospital bills?

434
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I don't understand

435
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
why we have to deal with this.

436
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Shut up.

437
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Okay.

438
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Let's go back.

439
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I'll do it.

440
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Can you hear me?

441
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
No problem.

442
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
What do you mean?

443
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Can you figure out the law?

444
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It's about time.

445
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I'll go back to the clinic

446
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
to make it clear.

447
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
You can go back to the clinic.

448
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I'll wait for you in the car.

449
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
What?

450
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
You're here today?

451
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Do you think this matter

452
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
can be done tomorrow?

453
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
No.

454
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Then what are you going to do?

455
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I'm going to the hospital.

456
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I'm going to the hospital.

457
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I'm going to the hospital.

458
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I'm going to the hospital.

459
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I'm going to the hospital.

460
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I'm going to the hospital.

461
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I'm going to the hospital.

462
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Okay.

463
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Are you sleeping in the emergency room?

464
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
No.

465
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Don't be nervous.

466
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I heard that you're renting a house nearby.

467
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
What kind of house?

468
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Can't you bring Xiao Zhao with you?

469
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I told him.

470
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
He told him the first time.

471
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
He said he has relatives at home.

472
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
No need to rent a house.

473
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Dawei.

474
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I don't really know

475
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
how to communicate with young people.

476
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
But I think

477
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
it's not easy to stay at home

478
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
for a long time,

479
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
even if it's a relative.

480
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It's not easy to stay at home for a long time.

481
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Yes.

482
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Besides,

483
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
you can keep the income of the surveillance police

484
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
and leave it to your family.

485
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
You can rent a house

486
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
before you take it out.

487
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
You'll be nervous

488
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
when you steal it.

489
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Yes.

490
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Dawei, you're a cook.

491
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Do you have a parent's house?

492
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I'm also sleepy.

493
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I'm old.

494
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
So I want to

495
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
stay with them

496
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
until I get married.

497
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
What do you think

498
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Xiao Zhao won't want to

499
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
stay with you?

500
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
What's the reason?

501
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
She's expensive.

502
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
It's one of the reasons.

503
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I understand, Dawei.

504
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I understand.

505
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Leave it to me.

506
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I'm waiting outside.

507
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I'll go first.

508
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
What do you understand?

509
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
What do you understand?

510
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I really understand.

511
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Zhao Liyuan.

512
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
The surveillance police is in action.

513
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
There are many people in the restaurant.

514
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
The situation is urgent.

515
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Leave the two people to the police.

516
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
The others.

517
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
You guys, follow me.

518
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Brother.

519
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Dongyi is in a hurry.

520
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I've got everything ready.

521
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Zhao Liyuan.

522
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Someone's fighting in the second street.

523
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
He's got a knife.

524
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
What's going on tonight?

525
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Xiaomao, Xiaolin.

526
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Take the two of you

527
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
to the second street.

528
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
There's a knife.

529
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Be careful.

530
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Go.

531
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Instructor,

532
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
the security guard is a thief.

533
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
It's not good to be in the crowd.

534
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Instructor.

535
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Take me with you.

536
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
You've worked hard.

537
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Follow him.

538
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Okay.

539
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Listen to me.

540
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I'll drive him down.

541
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Get on.

542
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Get on.

543
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Hurry.

544
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Get on.

545
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Hurry.

546
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Get on.

547
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Get on.

548
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Hurry.

549
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
There's no one else.

550
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Okay.

551
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Instructor.

552
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Is everyone ready?

553
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Yes.

554
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Where's the other one?

555
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Up there.

556
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Follow me.

557
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Instructor.

558
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Let's go.

559
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Zhijie,

560
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
when did you get on the car?

561
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I didn't get on the car.

562
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
You didn't get on the car?

563
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
You didn't get on the car?

564
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
The apprentice is here.

565
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I'm afraid he's not here.

566
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Zhou Jiuwei,

567
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
what's the matter?

568
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Tell me.

569
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I'm going to the training center

570
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
with Instructor.

571
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I'm going to the training center.

572
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Okay.

573
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
The first time I got on the car,

574
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I was in a hurry.

575
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
It's okay.

576
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
You can tell me now.

577
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I'm on my way.

578
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I told you about the contract.

579
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
The car is 800 yuan.

580
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
It's a little bit expensive.

581
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I'll pay 400 yuan.

582
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I'll pay 400 yuan.

583
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I'll pay 500 yuan.

584
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Stop.

585
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Don't move.

586
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Let me go.

587
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
The other guys are in the car.

588
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
No.

589
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Let me go.

590
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Let me go.

591
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
We're late.

592
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
300 yuan.

593
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I'm free.

594
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Don't just go.

595
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
It's convenient.

596
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,600
Let's go.

597
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I don't want to help.

598
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,000
Okay.

599
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,600
I'll help you.

600
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,800
Then 400.

601
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,800
I can get the doctor.

602
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,800
I can eat.

603
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,600
Okay.

604
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,400
Then 200 for rent.

605
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,800
You think I'm a poor person?

606
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Then 400.

607
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I believe the shadow will always be full of darkness.

608
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:16,000
One day, there will be a secret.

609
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,400
What's the matter?

610
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,400
Fine. As long as you think it's appropriate.

611
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,200
What's the matter?

612
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,000
Nothing.

613
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,000
This is the stuff.

614
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,000
I'm off.

615
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,400
Where's the work?

616
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Hello.

617
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,400
Hello.

618
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,400
We're from the bar.

619
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,000
Are you Wang Gang, Wang Jian's son?

620
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,400
No, we're in the wrong place.

621
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,000
Are you in the wrong place again?

622
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,000
No way.

623
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:01,800
That's right.

624
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,200
What's the matter?

625
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,200
I told you, what's the matter?

626
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,400
I said I'm not.

627
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
The family is a child.

628
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,400
You're disturbing us.

629
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,600
Are you Wang Gang, Wang Jian?

630
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,600
No.

631
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Can you read your ID?

632
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,200
What's the matter?

633
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,400
How can you read my ID?

634
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:35,800
Every citizen has a duty to cooperate with the police.

635
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,400
Do you know that?

636
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,600
This is the law.

637
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,800
Let's talk downstairs.

638
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,200
Wait a minute.

639
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,000
This way.

640
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,000
This way.

641
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,600
I'm Qi, Qi Gang.

642
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,200
You said Wang Jian is a child.

643
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,200
I don't know him.

644
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,200
What do you mean?

645
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,800
I don't know him. Why do you want me to know him?

646
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,600
That's it.

647
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:19,800
Mr. Qi.

648
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,800
We've checked your materials.

649
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,600
No matter what you say,

650
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,000
you're originally from Wang Gang,

651
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,000
the original residence,

652
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,400
in the back of the village.

653
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,000
You moved here because of family dispute.

654
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,000
Well, Mr. Wang,

655
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,000
or Mr. Qi,

656
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,400
it's like this.

657
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,200
No matter where you move to,

658
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,400
or what you change,

659
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,000
you're related to Wang Jian.

660
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,200
This is not possible.

661
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,200
I'm in a relationship with Wang Jian.

662
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,400
Please don't.

663
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,200
Mr. Wang, you're a good person.

664
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,400
You can't be so ungrateful

665
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,600
if you get the certificate.

666
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,400
What did you say?

667
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:08,800
That's interesting.

668
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,600
Yes, yes.

669
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,800
You're talking nonsense.

670
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,200
I don't understand.

671
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,800
Mr. Wang, we shouldn't

672
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,800
judge who's right or wrong.

673
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Actually, if we do something wrong,

674
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,200
it's all because of

675
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,800
the dirty work of the city.

676
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,400
Right?

677
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
But, you see,

678
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,600
I think he's back.

679
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,400
He's your father after all.

680
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,200
Now, he's willing to live in the hospital.

681
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,800
As a son, you have a duty.

682
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,400
You have to do something.

683
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,000
He wrote this letter, right?

684
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,800
He broke the relationship.

685
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,600
My mom and his divorcee are in the hair salon.

686
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,000
He didn't sign it.

687
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,400
He didn't go to get his stuff.

688
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
And I tell you,

689
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,400
I don't want to listen to his stuff.

690
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,400
I don't want to care about it.

691
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,800
He can say whatever he wants.

692
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
He doesn't care about the old man.

693
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,200
He doesn't have the conscience.

694
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,600
He's a good person.

695
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,800
It doesn't matter.

696
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,400
He doesn't care about what he says.

697
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,200
I want to put my words here.

698
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,200
You should be kind to the old man.

699
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,800
Yes, yes.

700
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,200
It's all a plan.

701
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,200
Mr. Wang,

702
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,800
he's the one who's willing to live.

703
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,600
We're in the same boat after all.

704
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,000
Enough. Don't talk about the truth.

705
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,200
It's meaningless.

706
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,600
You say I'm not into the medical business, right?

707
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,200
Fine.

708
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,800
I'm not into the medical business.

709
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,000
What's wrong?

710
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,000
What's wrong?

711
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
You want to catch me?

712
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,400
It's not like that.

713
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,600
Actually, there's a problem between the father and son.

714
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,800
We can solve it through a medical business.

715
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,400
Right?

716
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,600
The current situation is,

717
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,400
you see,

718
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,800
the old man is staying at the hospital.

719
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,200
Fine, fine. You go.

720
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,400
You don't go, right?

721
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,200
I'll go back.

722
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,200
Don't knock on my door.

723
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,400
My boss is a little boy.

724
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,400
I'll sneak into your house and make you famous.

725
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,600
Mr. Wang.

726
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,600
Mr. Wang.

727
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,200
Master.

728
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,000
I think

729
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,600
the father is indeed in some trouble.

730
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,800
Who's in trouble?

731
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,200
You're in trouble.

732
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,000
If there's trouble, you don't care about the life or death, right?

733
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,800
The father of the world is all about who's in trouble.

734
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,800
Who's in trouble?

735
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,000
Okay, master.

736
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,400
You take me as your driver.

737
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,600
Who's in trouble?

738
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,200
Okay, okay.

739
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,200
Mom, what are you doing?

740
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,400
I'm just going to clean up.

741
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,800
Don't make trouble in front of others.

742
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,400
Mom,

743
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,200
I'm sorry.

744
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,600
I was so terrible yesterday.

745
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,000
I've thought about it, too.

746
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,400
What aunt said is right.

747
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,000
These years,

748
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:58,200
you've been struggling at home alone.

749
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,000
You've grown up now.

750
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,600
You have your own plan.

751
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,200
You said I always follow my thoughts to control you.

752
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,400
You're happy when you're happy.

753
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,200
If you're not happy, I'm unhappy.

754
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,600
I can't solve anything.

755
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,200
So,

756
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,800
I'll go to the beach and clean up.

757
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:21,600
Okay.

758
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,600
I'll clean up.

759
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,400
Mom,

760
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,400
I've prepared for you.

761
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,000
I've prepared a high-heeled medicine for you.

762
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,000
If you have a stomachache, remember to apply it.

763
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,400
This is anti-inflammatory water.

764
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,000
Aunt lives on the beach after all.

765
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,000
It might have mosquitoes.

766
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,400
And I also prepared a cold-caught medicine for you.

767
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,200
You must take care of yourself over there.

768
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,400
Oh, right.

769
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I'll give you the money first.

770
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,200
I can't spend any money on your aunt.

771
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,600
Yes, there's an aunt.

772
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,600
But don't trouble her.

773
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,600
She hasn't been worried about our house for so many years.

774
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,600
She's worried about our house.

775
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,400
Okay.

776
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,400
You just got off work.

777
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,200
Why do you have so much money?

778
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,800
I've sent you the salary.

779
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,800
I don't have any money to spend.

780
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,600
I don't want money to eat at the toilet.

781
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,000
I sent you the money.

782
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,400
I'm a rich man.

783
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,600
Just keep it.

784
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,400
Don't let your aunt spend money on you.

785
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,200
If your dad is still alive...

786
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,400
Okay, mom.

787
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,400
Here you are.

788
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,000
You two are good friends.

789
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,600
You have me, right?

790
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,600
It's because of you.

791
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,000
So I always think...

792
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,800
being a police officer...

793
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,400
is not a big deal.

794
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,200
It's not safe.

795
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,800
I was always afraid.

796
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,600
You said you were a police officer...

797
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,600
and followed your dad's will.

798
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I can't stop you.

799
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,400
I can't stop you either.

800
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,200
But we can talk to the police...

801
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,800
and you can do a job...

802
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,600
that's not a job for you.

803
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Okay, mom.

804
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,200
Let's not talk about this.

805
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,000
We need to clean up and rest.

806
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,600
We need to work on the next day.

807
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,800
Actually,

808
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,800
I'm also confused.

809
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,200
I haven't worked for years.

810
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,200
If you don't work as a police officer,

811
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,400
we'll be out of the situation.

812
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,800
So,

813
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,800
we can't be a police officer.

814
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,400
We can work in a different job.

815
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,800
Okay, mom.

816
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,800
Go to sleep.

817
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,600
Okay?

818
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,800
I'll help you clean up.

819
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
You can leave tomorrow.

820
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,200
Let's go.

821
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,800
Go to sleep.

822
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,800
Is everything okay?

823
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,000
What should I do now?

824
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,000
What should I do?

825
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,000
What should I do?

826
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,200
I'm only doing my job.

827
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,200
What should I do?

828
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,200
Zhang Juewei, you're out of the station.

829
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,000
Wake up. Wake up.

830
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,800
Wake up.

831
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,800
Zhang Juewei.

832
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,200
Uncle.

833
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,200
You didn't sleep?

834
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,200
He's sleeping in the room.

835
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:59,200
He's sleeping in the room.

836
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,200
What's he doing?

837
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,600
He's sleeping in the room.

838
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,800
What's he doing?

839
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,200
He's sleeping in the room.

840
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,400
Zhang Juewei, wake up.

841
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,800
Zhang Juewei.

842
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,800
Zhang Juewei.

843
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,800
Hurry.

844
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,800
Get him.

845
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,800
Zhang Juewei.

846
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,000
Zhang Juewei.

847
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,200
You too.

848
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Zhang Juewei, wake up.

849
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,000
Zhang Juewei.

850
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,000
It's time.

851
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,400
I beg you.

852
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,200
Don't call me anymore.

853
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
You're so mean.

854
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Zhang Juewei.

855
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,200
Wake up.

856
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,800
You can't do this.

857
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,200
Zhang Juewei.

858
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,200
Zhang Juewei.

859
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Wake up.

860
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,200
You can't do this.

861
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,200
Go.

862
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,800
Xiao Wei.

863
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,800
You have to be responsible for what you did.

864
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
How can I be responsible?

865
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,800
You just put him in your room.

866
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,400
Put the door and window on it.

867
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,200
What did you say?

868
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,200
I won.

869
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,000
He didn't sleep for long.

870
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,600
So he was like this.

871
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Let him rest in your room for a few days.

872
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,400
That's it.

873
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,200
Uncle Yang.

874
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:18,800
Uncle Yang.

875
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:19,800
Help me.

876
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,800
I'm sleeping.

877
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,800
What's wrong?

878
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,400
What's wrong?

879
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,800
I'm sorry.

880
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,800
I'm sorry.

881
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,800
I'm sorry.

882
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,800
I'm sorry.

883
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,400
Rangers.

884
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,200
You can't touch him again.

885
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,400
Who removed him?

886
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,400
I didn't do it.

887
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,800
Did you do it on purpose?

888
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,000
For what?

889
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:02,600
Yes.

890
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,400
Uncle Yang.

891
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,600
How is it going?

892
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,800
We lost a lot of electric cars.

893
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,800
What about the police?

894
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,800
We only have the lights.

895
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,800
We know we lost the electric cars.

896
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,800
We have to wait for the car to get to work.

897
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,800
I can't take it.

898
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,800
We have to use it every day.

899
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,800
Don't worry.

900
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,800
We don't need to worry.

901
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,800
We are here.

902
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,800
We are here for the people.

903
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,800
We are here for the people.

904
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,800
So please don't worry.

905
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,800
We are here for the electric cars.

906
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,800
We have made a special plan.

907
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,800
I am responsible for it.

908
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,800
I hope you can give us some time.

909
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,800
We are here for the people.

910
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,800
We know how to work.

911
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,800
Yes, but we have to be careful.

912
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,800
We have to make a plan.

913
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,800
Don't you know the plan?

914
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,800
We will cooperate with you.

915
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,800
We are here for the people.

916
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,800
Okay.

917
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,800
We are here for the electric cars.

918
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,800
We are here for the people.

919
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,800
We have to go.

920
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,800
Go, go.

921
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,800
We are here for the people.

922
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,800
Don't worry.

923
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,800
Don't worry.

924
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,800
Get up.

925
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,800
We are here for the people.

926
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,800
We are here for the people.

927
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,800
We have to be careful.

928
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,800
We have to be careful.

929
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,800
Why are we here?

930
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,800
Why are you here?

931
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,800
If you are not feeling well,

932
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,520
Don't get sick.

933
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,720
This is not a hospital.

934
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,240
Okay?

935
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,160
Don't delay.

936
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:34,720
Hurry up.

937
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,040
Come on.

938
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,040
Take the old man to the hospital.

939
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,240
Go, go, go, go.

940
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,440
Wait a minute.

941
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,320
Mom,

942
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,240
say something.

943
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,840
You guys,

944
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,120
stay calm.

945
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,440
Be good.

946
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,480
Give the police comrades

947
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,440
a response to the problem.

948
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,720
Okay, okay.

949
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,920
Just put me here.

950
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,720
I'll be here waiting for you to come back.

951
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,520
Okay, okay.

952
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,160
Come on, come on.

953
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:58,640
How about

954
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,320
taking the kids here

955
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,360
and taking them in?

956
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,680
The 70s are the most popular.

957
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,960
Who do you think you are?

958
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,480
Go, go, go.

959
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,360
Sister,

960
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,680
sister,

961
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,320
give me a chance to

962
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,120
find a doctor

963
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,240
and a nurse.

964
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,000
I'm waiting for you.

965
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:11,400
Okay?

966
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:11,920
Hurry up.

967
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,200
Okay.

968
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:12,720
I'll tell you,

969
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,680
stay calm.

970
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,280
Okay, okay.

971
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,280
This way, this way, this way.

972
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:15,920
This way, this way.

973
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,040
This way, this way.

974
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:17,520
No, no, no.

975
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,200
I can't go in there.

976
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:18,880
Go, go, go.

977
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,520
I can't go in there.

978
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,640
You can't go in there.

979
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,160
Come on, put me here.

980
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,360
Put me here.

981
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,160
Put me here.

982
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,040
Put me here.

983
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,120
Put me here.

984
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:26,880
Put me here.

985
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,680
Put me here.

986
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,600
Put me here.

987
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:28,840
Put me here.

988
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,520
Don't move.

989
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,080
Put me here.

990
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,800
Slow down please.

991
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:41,800
Okay.

992
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,520
Where are you going?

993
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,840
Put me here

994
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,840
to resultsill I see you

995
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,000
pass.

996
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:47,800
It's okay.

997
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,640
Is it okay?

998
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,320
Slow down please.

999
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,240
Cover yourself.

1000
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:51,800
Where are you going?

1001
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,880
Cover yourself as well.

1002
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,240
Come on, Co getting Intelligent for what?

1003
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,320
Cover yourself.

1004
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,840
I'm not comfortable.

1005
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,840
I'm not comfortable at all.

1006
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,840
I'm not comfortable at all.

1007
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,840
Have you seen it?

1008
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:12,840
This is a video we took on the street.

1009
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,840
The two of them were carrying the child and walking well.

1010
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,840
Suddenly, your dog came out.

1011
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,840
Look.

1012
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,840
It's a little bit scary.

1013
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,840
It's a little bit scary.

1014
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,840
It's a little bit scary.

1015
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,840
Your dog came out.

1016
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,840
After it came out, it chased the child and ran away.

1017
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:34,840
The child fell down and was injured.

1018
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,840
You can see it here.

1019
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,840
Our neighborhood police

1020
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,840
accompanied the child's father to ask for

1021
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,840
a cooperation with you.

1022
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:46,840
Your father was very excited.

1023
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,840
He fell down.

1024
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,840
Moreover, your dog

1025
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,840
didn't have a dog's tail.

1026
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,840
It belongs to the illegal dog.

1027
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,840
It's illegal.

1028
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,840
The city management is determined.

1029
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,840
So in this matter,

1030
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,840
the other person is not wrong.

1031
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,840
Your father is also my father.

1032
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,840
You can't say that.

1033
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,840
No.

1034
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,840
How do you know they came back to catch the child?

1035
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,840
It's because they came back to fix the child.

1036
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,840
The child is still sick.

1037
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,840
Tell me.

1038
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,840
The video of the illegal record-breaking should be downloaded.

1039
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,840
That's it.

1040
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,840
But we have to accompany us in the time.

1041
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,840
Let's make a deal.

1042
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,840
I'll accompany you.

1043
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:23,840
You're not even in a good mood.

1044
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,840
Don't move your hands.

1045
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,840
Don't move your hands.

1046
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,840
Don't move your hands.

1047
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,840
Don't move your hands.

1048
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:28,840
What are you talking about?

1049
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,840
I can't believe you.

1050
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,840
You're telling the truth.

1051
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,840
Who are you?

1052
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,840
Who are you?

1053
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:33,840
How is it?

1054
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,840
That man's son-in-law

1055
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,840
has been a bastard for eight years.

1056
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,840
He's been a bastard for eight years.

1057
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,840
Chief, listen to me.

1058
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,840
Zhehua said that

1059
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,840
he was so mad at me.

1060
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,840
Is this

1061
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,840
your father's fault?

1062
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,840
He was a dog and didn't have a tail.

1063
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,840
He scared the child.

1064
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,840
His father was so angry.

1065
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,840
He was so mad.

1066
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,840
As for his emotional anger,

1067
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,840
it caused your father to get sick.

1068
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,840
He had so many responsibilities.

1069
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,840
He needed the law to make a deal.

1070
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:01,840
But I think

1071
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,840
your father's brother-in-law

1072
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,840
is mainly because

1073
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,840
he's mentally ill.

1074
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,840
Chief Wang,

1075
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:09,840
don't you know

1076
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:10,840
what they're talking about?

1077
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:11,840
That's right.

1078
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:12,840
What are you talking about?

1079
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,840
Say it again.

1080
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:23,840
I'm sorry.

1081
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:53,840
I'm sorry.

1082
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:23,840
I'm sorry.

1083
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:53,840
I'm sorry.

1084
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:23,840
I'm sorry.
