1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I

5
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I

6
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Master, when we went to the police station, we talked about this case.

7
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
When we were in the crime scene, we all liked to leave a mark.

8
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
This is very likely to be his mark.

9
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
He's in the bedroom and has the bed cabinet turned upside down.

10
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
He's in such a big risk that he might carry a chest.

11
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
As for the knife on the table, I think it's a habit.

12
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It makes sense.

13
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Look, it's here.

14
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Is it this one?

15
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Yes.

16
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
He's in the manor.

17
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
He lives in the manor.

18
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Look at this.

19
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's here.

20
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
This is Liu Hangzhen.

21
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
His home is in Liu Hang.

22
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Then this is better.

23
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

24
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Sorry, we're in trouble again.

25
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You said it.

26
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's your turn to give us a chance to give Li Gong a chance.

27
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Let's make it clear.

28
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
If we catch him, who's the person?

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Of course, it's us.

30
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
We found out who's the criminal in our case.

31
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's not us.

32
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Mr. Zhang, we have a hundred-day road to the crime scene.

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
We're not going to let you go.

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
We're not going to let you go.

35
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
We have a hundred-day road to the crime scene.

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
How about this?

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
We'll help you find someone.

38
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
But there's a condition.

39
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
If someone catches you, stay.

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
We'll take care of it.

41
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Let's catch him first.

42
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Okay, okay, okay.

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Let's see.

44
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
After entering a surveillance area,

45
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
we've never been out.

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Could it be that his house is over there?

47
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
What's that?

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's a residential area.

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
But according to us,

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
most of the residents here

51
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
have not come back to the city for work.

52
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
There are very few people who are aware of it.

53
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Do you think

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
he's been working in the city?

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And then he's almost over a year old.

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
He's been working hard to get a good life.

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
If you really introduce yourself like this,

58
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
this person must be an old man.

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
But we've seen him in the police station.

60
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I don't think that one has one.

61
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
How about we go and take a look at it?

62
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Let's go.

63
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Get ready.

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Let's go.

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Master, I'm feeling a little bit unwell.

66
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Why don't you go with your brother?

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'll continue to watch the street.

68
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Okay.

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Then stay at home.

70
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Let's go.

71
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Mr. Zhang,

72
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
you first find a place to sit.

73
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Okay.

74
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Mr. Zhang,

75
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
you first sit over there and rest.

76
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'll tell you later.

77
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Let's go.

78
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Officer Xia,

79
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
what are you going to do about this?

80
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
What's the matter?

81
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Don't talk.

82
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Your old lady has been here for several times.

83
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Her name is Zhang.

84
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
We call her Mrs. Zhang.

85
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
She's my daughter.

86
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
She's just a little girl.

87
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
She's like a little girl.

88
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
That little girl was a gasp when she was in sixth grade.

89
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
She raised this girl to the middle of the school.

90
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Now she's in school in September.

91
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
She's here to give the child a lesson.

92
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's not appropriate for her to do this.

93
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It is.

94
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
She didn't get a birth certificate.

95
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And they haven't taken the official pregnancy test.

96
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Besides,

97
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
she's in seventh grade this year.

98
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
She's just 70 years old.

99
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's not appropriate for her to raise her children.

100
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
She's going to school.

101
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
She's not taking the official pregnancy test.

102
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Officer Xia,

103
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
what do you think we should do?

104
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Look.

105
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Here you are.

106
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Grandma, smile.

107
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Grandma.

108
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Officer Xia,

109
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm here to see if you can give me a chance to talk to you.

110
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Grandma,

111
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
this child called you...

112
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It was called Grandma.

113
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
But our comrades said

114
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
that it was necessary to have a relationship with Lin Liang

115
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
to talk to you.

116
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So we changed the subject.

117
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
We called her Mom.

118
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
This child.

119
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Come on, Ba'er.

120
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Call her Mom.

121
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
This child.

122
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You don't want to talk to me.

123
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Why are you so stubborn?

124
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
What should we do?

125
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Is this Ba'er?

126
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Ba'er, here you are.

127
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Ba'er,

128
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
hurry up.

129
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Let's go to the police station.

130
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Hurry up.

131
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Thank you, Officer Xia.

132
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Thank you, Sister.

133
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You're welcome.

134
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
When you're in school,

135
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
you should go to school.

136
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Grandma,

137
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
your situation is rather complicated.

138
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You can't be here this time.

139
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Take the child back first.

140
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You don't have to go here anymore.

141
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I promise you

142
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I will find a way to help you

143
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
find the most appropriate solution.

144
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
This child is going to school?

145
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
If he asks for a leave,

146
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
he won't be able to take me to school.

147
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
No, I promise.

148
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Grandma,

149
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
you've worked hard.

150
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Don't waste your time

151
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
and send me to the police station.

152
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You go back first.

153
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'll find a way for you.

154
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Okay, thank you.

155
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Thank you.

156
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Thank you.

157
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Thank you.

158
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'll see you off.

159
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Ba'er, let's go.

160
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Let's go.

161
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Great.

162
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Ba'er,

163
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
you're six years old.

164
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Can you take care of Grandma?

165
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Hello, listen to me.

166
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Grandma, I'm hungry.

167
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Okay, let's go home and eat.

168
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'll see you later.

169
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'll be back in a while.

170
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Grandma,

171
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
can you buy me a chicken drumstick?

172
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Sure.

173
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Sure.

174
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Do you know the number?

175
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Yes.

176
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Then you can fill this up

177
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
and then you can sign

178
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
the number

179
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
and then you can fill it up.

180
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Officer Xia,

181
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
why did you bring the trash?

182
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Grandma said she'll bring it later.

183
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I don't think it's appropriate to put it in the book.

184
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'm afraid I'll lose it.

185
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
So I brought it in.

186
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
She's so funny.

187
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
She brought the trash with her.

188
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And she's here again.

189
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Is this good?

190
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Yes.

191
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Okay, wait a minute.

192
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Okay.

193
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Officer Xia,

194
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
can you take the trash?

195
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Sure.

196
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Go ahead.

197
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Okay.

198
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Okay.

199
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'll take it.

200
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'll take it.

201
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Okay.

202
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Okay.

203
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'll take it.

204
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Okay.

205
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Okay.

206
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Go.

207
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Okay.

208
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Okay.

209
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Okay.

210
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Okay.

211
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Okay.

212
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Okay.

213
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Okay.

214
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Okay.

215
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Okay.

216
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Okay.

217
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Okay.

218
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Okay.

219
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Okay.

220
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Okay.

221
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Okay.

222
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Okay.

223
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Okay.

224
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Officer Xia,

225
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Guan Tze,

226
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
you need me to pick up the belongs in the更.

227
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Let him be.

228
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Fang,

229
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
pretty lady,

230
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
give it toonent if it's okay.

231
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Time is кор przedstaw cairn.

232
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I can do it.

233
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
What should we do now?

234
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Send her to the welfare hospital.

235
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
The welfare hospital? Xia Jie,

236
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
it's from the long distance.

237
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
From the health growth of children

238
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
and the education level.

239
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
The welfare hospital is the most advantageous.

240
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Yes.

241
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
We'll go to the meeting first.

242
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Then we'll go to the welfare hospital to see her.

243
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Okay?

244
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Go.

245
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
The welfare hospital

246
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
This is weird.

247
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Weird?

248
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
We saw her going in.

249
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
But we couldn't find her.

250
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Yes.

251
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Don't worry.

252
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
How big is Liu Hang?

253
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
As long as she's our person,

254
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'll have a way to catch her.

255
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Master.

256
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
What's wrong?

257
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
What's the matter?

258
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Let's go.

259
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I've been watching Liu Hang's secret in the city.

260
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
He's always wearing this hat when he's done.

261
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Aren't you afraid that he can't catch up

262
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
with his car?

263
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So I pushed him back.

264
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
He came to Liu Hang and made a circle.

265
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It's possible that he's a man of his word.

266
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'm so surprised.

267
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Look.

268
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
This is his car.

269
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
He changed a car brand.

270
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
But master, you've reminded me.

271
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
There's a very obvious crack on his glass.

272
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
When the crack passes through the street,

273
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
there's a very obvious reflection.

274
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
So he thought that he could change us.

275
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
But he didn't wear this hat when he went back.

276
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Look.

277
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
The surveillance camera is very obvious.

278
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
He can catch up with his mask.

279
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Good boy.

280
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You're really good.

281
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
He's really good.

282
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
OK, master.

283
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
He's a strong man.

284
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm not a strong man.

285
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
He's much better than my young man.

286
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
He's a top student in the police academy.

287
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
He's good.

288
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
He's really good.

289
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Don't listen to the rumors.

290
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
The country is now in the hands of the welfare service.

291
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
The benefits of the welfare service are getting better.

292
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
They need not only food and clothing.

293
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Go in.

294
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Go in and have a look.

295
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
They also hope that mother's care and mother's company

296
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
will be a good thing for us.

297
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
There are many children on the street.

298
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Mom, mom, mom.

299
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
The children here call their mother.

300
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Come on.

301
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
They don't need anything.

302
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
They need mother's care.

303
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Do you hear what they say?

304
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Yes.

305
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
OK, beautiful.

306
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Go play.

307
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
We can go to the street.

308
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
The protective mask is here.

309
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
We'll send him to school.

310
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It's our responsibility.

311
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
President Xu.

312
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
What's up?

313
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Something's wrong.

314
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I need you to clean up.

315
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You go ahead.

316
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'll go to the police station.

317
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Bye.

318
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
OK.

319
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I'll report to you about the case.

320
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
We've contacted the front-line police station.

321
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
The same person

322
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
went to the theft of two houses in their neighborhood.

323
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
The next night,

324
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
he entered the Yinfeng neighborhood in our neighborhood.

325
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
The two night was passed.

326
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
The total value of the theft of the property was above 80,000 yuan.

327
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
The case was a huge amount.

328
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
After he left,

329
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
he went to Liuhang Town, the capital of Chengnan.

330
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
He was in the surveillance area of Liuhang.

331
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
He changed his car plate and came back.

332
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
He went to Nanrao City High Street.

333
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
He went to the city and went to the north.

334
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
He went to the north and north,

335
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
and entered the Qibao City.

336
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
He disappeared in a residential area.

337
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
We decided that the theft was from the Qibao people.

338
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
According to the situation,

339
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
he should stay in Qibao for more than a year.

340
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
So, if we go there now,

341
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
we should be able to catch him.

342
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Captain Chu.

343
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Look, the case has been designed for more than 80,000 yuan.

344
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It's a big deal.

345
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Your team will come to the capital.

346
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
80,000 yuan is a big deal for you.

347
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
But for us, it's not a big deal.

348
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
President Wang, I didn't push you.

349
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
A few days ago,

350
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
there were two murder cases.

351
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
One of them hasn't been solved yet.

352
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
All the cases are in the top and bottom.

353
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I haven't been in the police for 48 hours.

354
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I agree with the decision.

355
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
This person is currently in Qibao.

356
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I suggest we contact the police in Qibao.

357
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Let them help us.

358
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Lu,

359
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
the Qibao is 200 kilometers away from us.

360
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
But he's not in the same province.

361
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
It's hard to say that he's big or small.

362
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
It's hard to say that he's a big or small person.

363
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
It's not convenient to coordinate.

364
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Why don't we go there and catch him?

365
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Then...

366
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'll leave it to you.

367
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
He's from Qibao.

368
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
He can't run.

369
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
If we can get the money,

370
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I can't get the money.

371
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Captain Luo,

372
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
if we want to solve this case,

373
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
we'll have to take our lives.

374
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Look at what you look like.

375
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
By the way,

376
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
if we don't get the money,

377
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
we'll be in a hurry.

378
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
What hurry?

379
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
If we get the money,

380
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
we'll be in a hurry.

381
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
If we don't,

382
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
we'll be in a hurry.

383
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Let's go.

384
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Let's go find a car to drive.

385
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Okay, don't worry.

386
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Let's go.

387
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Captain,

388
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I think

389
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
we should just decide the situation.

390
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Captain,

391
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I think there's a big problem.

392
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Captain,

393
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
what should we do?

394
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
What do you think we should do?

395
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Captain,

396
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I think we can't wait.

397
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Look,

398
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
the white action

399
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
will be over by the end of the year.

400
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
If we can't catch him,

401
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
it means we have a problem.

402
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
We can't catch him.

403
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
We can't catch him.

404
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
We can't catch him.

405
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
We can't catch him.

406
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
We can't catch him.

407
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
There's a big problem.

408
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Captain,

409
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I think

410
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,240
we should

411
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,000
go find the car.

412
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Maybe we can't save our car.

413
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I don't think we can.

414
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
We can't go.

415
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Let's go.

416
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Captain,

417
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I think

418
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
we can't catch him.

419
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Captain,

420
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I think

421
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
we can't take him.

422
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Captain,

423
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I think

424
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
we can't take him.

425
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I think

426
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
we should go and ask Captain.

427
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
We can't take him.

428
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Captain,

429
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,960
We'll go to the underground.

430
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,160
Then let's go to the public.

431
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,440
Who's going?

432
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:43,640
Sir.

433
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,280
Come in.

434
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:46,800
Hello, Mr. Cheng.

435
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,600
Mr. Cheng.

436
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,320
Mr. Cheng.

437
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,360
Can you come out for a while?

438
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,920
I have something to ask you.

439
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:00,680
Mr. Cheng.

440
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:01,560
It's cold outside.

441
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,880
I'll go to the long-sleeved.

442
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,200
Is it the New Year's Eve soon?

443
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,800
I want to celebrate my New Year's Eve

444
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,240
in the country.

445
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,480
I want to go to the Northeast.

446
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,560
Why are you going to the Northeast?

447
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,040
It's not about the moon.

448
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,920
Look, I watched his surveillance video with Li Dabai every day.

449
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,200
I didn't find anything.

450
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,440
Maybe he really has nothing.

451
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,480
Yes.

452
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,440
But...

453
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,680
I always think something is wrong.

454
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,760
So I want to

455
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,680
go to my hometown to see it in the New Year.

456
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,920
Then I'll go to the police station.

457
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,720
Then I'll know if there's anything new.

458
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,520
You have a good idea.

459
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,040
Really?

460
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,720
But don't use your own age.

461
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,120
Just go out.

462
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:48,760
No.

463
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,720
I'm not sure if I can find anything new.

464
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,800
I'll go with Dabai.

465
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,040
We'll go to the travel agency.

466
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,320
But, Mr. Cheng.

467
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,760
This time we'll go to the Northeast.

468
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,960
You can show us your secret.

469
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:00,920
Okay.

470
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,520
Okay.

471
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,160
I know.

472
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:02,640
Okay.

473
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,400
See you.

474
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:33,560
Hello.

475
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,720
Where is Master Zhang's life?

476
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,960
I'm heading off to the Maid's place.

477
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,240
Thank you.

478
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:39,880
Have a seat.

479
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:00,360
Master Zhang?

480
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:38,980
And this you need to continue revival.

481
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:50,680
All the heroes will go to the ends.

482
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,160
žĠ主安不过氟是为致上的sellingADL practice

483
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,060
那点イベント会比较完整Mom Worker Mei, see what I think about it next.

484
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:00,060
Can you help me?

485
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,060
And I'm gonna jump this morning.

486
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:05,060
Uncle Xi, you can't come today.

487
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,060
Look, it's so beautiful.

488
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,060
Grandma, I didn't buy anything.

489
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,060
These fruits and snacks, take them and eat them.

490
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,060
I'll put them here first.

491
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,060
And I also bought a bag.

492
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:21,060
There's a set of documents inside.

493
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,060
I'm gonna go to school next summer.

494
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,060
Dad, look at sister.

495
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,060
What did she give you?

496
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,060
Take it.

497
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:30,060
You didn't say thank you.

498
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,060
How did mom teach you?

499
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:33,060
Thank you, sister.

500
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,060
You're welcome.

501
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,060
Open it.

502
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:38,060
Miss, come to the room.

503
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,060
Come to the room.

504
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,060
I'm not going in.

505
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,060
I'm not going in.

506
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,060
Well,

507
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,060
Grandma,

508
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,060
I'm here to tell you.

509
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,060
I know.

510
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,060
I know.

511
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,060
Can you help me?

512
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,060
When are we going to fall?

513
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,060
Well,

514
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,060
Grandma.

515
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,060
How beautiful is her bag.

516
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,060
She called you mom.

517
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,060
You didn't call her mom.

518
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,060
Look, she didn't even give us a call.

519
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,060
When can we go?

520
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,060
Well,

521
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,060
it's like this,

522
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:22,060
I'm afraid you can't wait.

523
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,060
I'll tell you first.

524
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,060
We're having fun.

525
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,060
We're inviting you.

526
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,060
Please believe me.

527
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:29,060
There will be a good result.

528
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,060
Miss,

529
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:43,060
we really can't just look at you.

530
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,060
Think about it.

531
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,060
Grandma is 76 this year.

532
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,060
If she leaves that day,

533
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:53,060
the child will be a orphan.

534
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,060
What should I do then?

535
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,060
So,

536
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,060
from this long distance,

537
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,060
it's the best way

538
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:03,060
to send her to the social welfare hospital.

539
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,060
Chief,

540
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,060
you should go to the old lady's house.

541
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:09,060
If you take the girl away from their house,

542
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,060
it's a double harm to them.

543
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:14,060
After sending the child to the social welfare hospital,

544
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,060
can the old lady

545
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:18,060
often go to see her?

546
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,060
Chief,

547
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,060
you're also a Bodhisattva.

548
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,060
Look at Grandma and Bao Er together.

549
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:27,060
They look like a whole.

550
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:29,060
We have to take them away.

551
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,060
It's so cruel.

552
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:33,060
It's not our cruelness.

553
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,060
There's no policy.

554
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,060
But the policy is dead.

555
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,060
People are alive.

556
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,060
So we have to think of a way.

557
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,060
By the way,

558
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,060
the nurse team

559
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,060
is in charge of the principal's office.

560
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,060
You go to her.

561
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,060
Let her think of a way.

562
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,060
Go.

563
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,060
Go.

564
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:10,060
Aunt, we're home.

565
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,060
We're home.

566
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,060
We're home.

567
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,060
On July 7th,

568
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,060
we'll go to the house.

569
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,060
Every three months,

570
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,060
you'll bring her home

571
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,060
and do a physical checkup.

572
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:20,060
If anything happens,

573
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,060
you can contact us anytime.

574
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,060
Okay.

575
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,060
Aunt,

576
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,060
we're home.

577
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,060
Are you happy?

578
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,060
I'm not happy.

579
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,060
You're not happy?

580
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,060
Aunt, are you okay?

581
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,060
I'm fine.

582
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,060
Okay.

583
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,060
Take care.

584
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,060
Okay.

585
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,060
Thank you.

586
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,060
You're welcome.

587
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,060
Take care.

588
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,060
Bye.

589
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,060
Hello.

590
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,060
Did the principal come back?

591
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,060
No.

592
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,060
I just wanted to ask

593
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,060
about that.

594
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,060
We just found

595
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,060
a adopted mother for a child.

596
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,060
A adopted mother?

597
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,060
Yes.

598
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,060
We signed a contract

599
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,060
with the welfare center.

600
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,060
We'll give our child

601
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:00,060
to their parents.

602
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,060
They have a condition

603
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,060
for the child.

604
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,060
We'll pay

605
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,060
the adoptive fee

606
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,060
every month.

607
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,060
But the adoptive fee

608
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,060
needs a certain condition.

609
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,060
That's great.

610
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,060
Thank you.

611
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,060
It's okay.

612
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,060
Sit inside.

613
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,060
No need.

614
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,060
I'll sit outside.

615
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,060
Okay.

616
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,060
You can go now.

617
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,060
Okay.

618
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,060
Goodbye.

619
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,060
Goodbye.

620
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,060
Okay.

621
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,060
Grandma.

622
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,060
Here you are.

623
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,060
Grandma.

624
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,060
Where's the bowl?

625
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,060
I'll give it to her.

626
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,060
She's going to buy

627
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,060
the soup.

628
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,060
Zuiwei.

629
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,060
Grandma.

630
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,060
Let's go inside.

631
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,060
Yes.

632
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,060
Be careful.

633
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,060
Come.

634
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,060
Be careful.

635
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,060
Let's go inside.

636
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,060
Let's go inside.

637
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,060
Come.

638
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,060
Thank you.

639
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,060
Grandma.

640
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,060
I'll put it on the table.

641
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,060
Grandma.

642
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,060
Grandma.

643
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,060
Only three yuan.

644
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,060
Great.

645
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,060
Grandma.

646
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,060
You want a bite?

647
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,060
It's sweet.

648
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,060
I don't want it.

649
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,060
Look at the baby.

650
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,060
She's always thinking about me.

651
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,060
I don't want it.

652
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,060
You eat it.

653
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,060
Grandma.

654
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,060
I want a bite.

655
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,060
It's sweet.

656
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:45,060
Look at the old lady's

657
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,060
mortgage.

658
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,060
How much does it cost?

659
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:49,060
A child is six hundred and eight months old.

660
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,060
She's over sixty years old.

661
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,060
She's over thirty percent.

662
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,060
Two people are together.

663
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,060
One month is about

664
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:56,060
one thousand and six hundred and seventy-seven.

665
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:00,060
Our loan is one month and a thousand yuan.

666
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,060
Although it's not three thousand,

667
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,060
it can help a little.

668
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,060
President.

669
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,060
You mean

670
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,060
you agree?

671
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,060
Thank you so much, President.

672
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:14,060
The group is divided.

673
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,060
As long as there's a little happiness,

674
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,060
they're satisfied.

675
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,060
Thank you so much.

676
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,060
You're welcome.

677
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,060
Come on.

678
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,060
Two drinks.

679
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,060
Grandma.

680
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,060
Grandma, stop it.

681
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:27,060
Grandma, I want another bite.

682
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,060
No, no.

683
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,060
You eat it yourself.

684
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,060
Be good.

685
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,060
Just eat it yourself.

686
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,060
Eat it yourself.

687
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,060
Big bite.

688
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,060
Come on.

689
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,060
Jia Jia, don't put it all on me.

690
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:59,060
You're just doing it for the New Year.

691
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,060
I have.

692
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:02,060
I'll just buy it.

693
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,060
Jia Jia.

694
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,060
Your mom called.

695
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:08,060
She said it was Spring Festival.

696
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,060
She came to accompany you.

697
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:12,060
I can do it myself.

698
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,060
Jia Jia.

699
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:19,060
Your mom is not easy.

700
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,060
I can hear it.

701
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,060
She really misses you.

702
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,060
I know.

703
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,060
But she...

704
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,060
She's back to the ice.

705
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,060
Jia Jia.

706
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,060
Brother David.

707
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,060
Jia Jia.

708
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,060
I heard you were chosen

709
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:37,060
by the youth exhibition, right?

710
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:39,060
Xia Mao is dead.

711
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,060
Where are so many Xia Mao?

712
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,060
Let me introduce one to you.

713
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,060
Listen.

714
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,060
I asked you to give it to me.

715
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,060
I'm sorry.

716
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,060
How did it go?

717
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,060
Two gifts.

718
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,060
One.

719
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:49,060
I was chosen by the youth exhibition.

720
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,060
I was in the exhibition.

721
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,060
And one gift.

722
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,060
I sent it to the gallery.

723
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,060
Dad, are you okay?

724
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,060
Uncle.

725
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,060
You said we had a business trip

726
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,060
in Jia Jia.

727
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,060
Isn't that a great success

728
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,060
for the Chinese family?

729
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,060
David.

730
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,060
Come on.

731
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,060
Okay.

732
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,060
Don't be so formal.

733
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,060
David.

734
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:09,060
You can't accompany your mom

735
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,060
during the Spring Festival.

736
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,060
Is that okay?

737
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,060
It's okay.

738
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,060
You don't know.

739
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,060
Xia Jie's mom and my mom

740
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,060
are about to break up

741
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,060
and go to the river.

742
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,060
We are together every day.

743
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,060
We quarrel every day.

744
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,060
No one leaves.

745
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:21,060
We must spend the New Year together.

746
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,060
Xia Jie.

747
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,060
What about you?

748
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:27,060
Xia Jie must spend the New Year with them.

749
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,060
Do you want to be with them?

750
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,060
Okay.

751
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,060
I'll spend the New Year with Xia Jie.

752
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,060
I'll spend the New Year with Xia Jie.

753
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,060
Okay.

754
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,060
My mom has another daughter.

755
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,060
This is my daughter.

756
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,060
Give it to me.

757
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,060
Okay.

758
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,060
You don't have enough, right?

759
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,060
Yes, it's enough.

760
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,060
You can do it.

761
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,060
Okay.

762
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,060
By the way,

763
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:47,060
you must close the door every night.

764
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:48,060
Okay.

765
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,060
I know.

766
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,060
If you have time,

767
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,060
call your mom.

768
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,060
It's New Year.

769
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,060
Okay.

770
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,060
Don't go out.

771
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,060
If you want to eat,

772
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,060
I'll take you out from the waiting room.

773
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,060
Okay.

774
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,060
Don't worry.

775
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,060
I'll be there.

776
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,060
Bye.

777
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,060
Bye.

778
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,060
Take care.

779
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,060
You should cooperate with the police

780
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,060
in the northwest.

781
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,060
Okay.

782
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,060
We'll support them.

783
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,060
I'll help you.

784
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:13,060
You must have enough police force.

785
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,060
Don't be rash.

786
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:17,060
Du, be careful.

787
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,060
Okay.

788
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,060
Be careful.

789
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,060
Okay.

790
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,060
Be careful.

791
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,060
Be careful.

792
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,060
Here.

793
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,060
Okay.

794
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,060
Here.

795
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,060
Okay.

796
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,060
Thank you.

797
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,060
You two, rest here.

798
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,060
I'll go find the chief.

799
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,060
Okay.

800
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,060
Sit here.

801
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,060
Master,

802
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,060
this place is really close.

803
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:15,060
There are so many rooms.

804
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,060
Dawei,

805
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,060
tell me,

806
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,060
the moon is so beautiful.

807
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:25,060
You were in your age.

808
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:28,060
If you had lived in this place,

809
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,060
you would have missed someone.

810
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,060
Then we'll have to see

811
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,060
if we can go out.

812
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,060
We'll meet outside.

813
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,060
If we don't,

814
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,060
it's a good job to meet

815
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,060
in a place like this.

816
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,060
But if we meet,

817
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,060
we can't do it.

818
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,060
Officer Qian,

819
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,060
this is our chief,

820
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,060
Chief Niu.

821
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,060
Hello, chief Niu.

822
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,060
Hello, chief Gu.

823
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,060
Hello, chief Gu.

824
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,060
Hello, chief Gu.

825
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,060
Chief Gu went to the meeting room.

826
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,060
He said it's going to be a big day.

827
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,060
I think he'll be back tomorrow.

828
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,060
Chief Niu,

829
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,060
you really have to go through a lot

830
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:05,060
to make trouble for you.

831
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,060
If you don't,

832
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,060
you'll have to work hard

833
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,060
for me in the coming years.

834
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,060
But it's just that

835
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:12,060
I can't help you.

836
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,060
What do you mean?

837
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,060
We checked the person

838
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,060
you mentioned.

839
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,060
It was three years before we worked.

840
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:20,060
But it's been 15 or 16 years.

841
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,060
It's too long.

842
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,060
We almost didn't know him.

843
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,060
It's impossible.

844
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,060
We were the police

845
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,060
15 or 16 years ago.

846
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,060
Now he's just

847
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,060
over 40.

848
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,060
You don't know that.

849
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,060
We're talking about the police.

850
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,060
We're only 56.

851
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,060
If you see our condition,

852
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,060
especially after the fire

853
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:35,060
was fired,

854
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,060
people were still working.

855
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,060
The workload was not big.

856
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,060
You even hired a head nurse.

857
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,060
The old comrade

858
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,060
was still in the city.

859
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:42,060
He was very busy.

860
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,060
He was working for 15 or 16 years.

861
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,060
Now he can't find

862
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,060
a new one.

863
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,060
Is that so?

864
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,060
But our chief

865
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,060
even retired.

866
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,060
When we talked,

867
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,060
he asked this person

868
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,060
if he was happy

869
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,060
with him.

870
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:00,060
Yes, yes.

871
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,060
Can you see him?

872
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,060
Xiaoman,

873
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,060
contact Chief Zhou.

874
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,060
Okay.

875
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,060
Thank you, Chief Niu.

876
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,060
Thank you.

877
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,060
Thank you.

878
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,060
Thank you.

879
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,060
The residential area

880
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,060
is a bit complicated.

881
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,060
Tell me.

882
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,060
The main component of the residential area

883
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,060
is the three-storey farmland

884
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,060
and farm-saving area.

885
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,060
It's a small area

886
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,060
that has been changed.

887
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,060
Two months ago,

888
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,060
they were making

889
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,060
a lot of bloodshed.

890
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,060
We also

891
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,060
worked hard

892
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,060
to get the benefits.

893
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:36,060
Today is the 29th.

894
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,060
Tomorrow is the 30th.

895
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:40,060
When we are in this sensitive situation,

896
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,060
the police

897
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,060
will have to go in

898
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,060
and find people.

899
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,060
I'm afraid

900
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,060
there will be unnecessary misunderstandings.

901
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,060
If

902
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,060
something happens,

903
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,060
even this year

904
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,060
will be bad.

905
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,060
So, we have

906
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,060
discussed it.

907
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,060
I hope

908
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,060
we can solve it

909
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,060
in the next few years.

910
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,060
First of all, thank you, Chief Niu,

911
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,060
for giving us

912
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,060
such detailed explanations.

913
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,060
What you just said,

914
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,060
we can understand.

915
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,060
But look,

916
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,060
we are so far away.

917
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,060
Look,

918
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,060
how about this?

919
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,060
We will change the clothes.

920
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,060
Then,

921
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,060
Qiao Meishan

922
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,060
will go in and take a look.

923
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,060
Because we have

924
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,060
his photo.

925
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,060
The car's characteristics

926
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,060
are also very obvious.

927
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,060
It's not difficult to find.

928
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,060
Zhang,

929
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,060
if it's normal,

930
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,060
you can go in

931
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,060
and find it.

932
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,060
When is it?

933
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,060
It's New Year's Eve.

934
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:40,060
Everyone is going back to New Year's Eve.

935
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,060
In this neighborhood,

936
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,060
there are some people

937
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,060
who come to the city to change clothes.

938
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:46,060
It's hard to attract people's attention.

939
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,060
So,

940
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,060
our opinions

941
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:51,060
can be said in New Year's Eve.

942
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,060
Brother,

943
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,060
your work conditions

944
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,060
are really hard.

945
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,060
Hard?

946
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,060
You are a strong person.

947
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,060
If we can be police,

948
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,060
we will be limited.

949
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,060
Are you a police graduate?

950
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,060
No.

951
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,060
I am a police officer.

952
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,060
My father is a police officer.

953
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,060
He was injured later.

954
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,060
I was taken care of.

955
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:23,060
But I am a police officer.

956
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,060
So,

957
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,060
you are not going to

958
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,060
continue your work in this neighborhood?

959
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,060
I am just going to stay here

960
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,060
and die.

961
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,060
There are fewer people here.

962
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,060
Sometimes,

963
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,060
I am afraid of

964
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,060
working alone at night.

965
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,060
Xiaoma,

966
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,060
you are always

967
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,060
so cold-hearted.

968
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,060
How can that be?

969
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,060
It turns out that

970
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:39,060
our neighborhood is so lively.

971
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,060
We come to cut trees,

972
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,060
to develop wood,

973
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,060
to plant wood.

974
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,060
But later,

975
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,060
we are not allowed to cut

976
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:46,060
the mountains.

977
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,060
People in the forest

978
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,060
become a household worker.

979
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,060
People use so much.

980
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,060
It's getting colder and colder.

981
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,060
In this situation,

982
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,060
it's so cold.

983
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,060
When I was a kid,

984
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,060
it was still lively.

985
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,060
Later,

986
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,060
I went to school.

987
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,060
I was slowly dying.

988
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,060
It's time.

989
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,060
There is a tunnel ahead.

990
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,060
Xiaoma,

991
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,060
if you pass through

992
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,060
the supermarket,

993
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,060
the small shop,

994
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,060
help me to stop.

995
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,060
Okay.

996
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,060
Master,

997
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,060
we are going back.

998
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,060
Where can we go?

999
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,060
It's so hard to get here.

1000
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,060
When it's over,

1001
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,060
he will run away.

1002
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,060
We can go somewhere.

1003
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,060
Let's find a place to stay.

1004
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,060
Du,

1005
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,060
check if there is a tourist attraction.

1006
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,060
Okay.

1007
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,060
Chief Zhou,

1008
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,060
Chief Zhou.

1009
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,060
Hey.

1010
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,060
Hey.

1011
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,060
Hey.

1012
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,060
Hey.

1013
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,060
Hey.

1014
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,060
Hey.

1015
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:03,900
Yes.

1016
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:06,860
All right.

1017
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,020
I'm off.

1018
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,380
I have a call for you.

1019
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,100
Two comrades are coming.

1020
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,540
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

1021
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,860
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

1022
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:14,580
My name is Chen.

1023
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:15,500
I'm from Xincheng.

1024
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,780
Oh, okay.

1025
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,580
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

1026
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:19,380
My name is Li Dawei.

1027
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,100
I'm a apprentice.

1028
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,420
An apprentice.

1029
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:23,180
What do you get from this?

1030
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:23,860
For years.

1031
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:24,420
Hurry up.

1032
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,020
I'm so cold.

1033
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,060
Okay, okay.

1034
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,020
Mr. Zhou, you guys talk first.

1035
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:27,740
I'm not going in.

1036
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:28,300
Okay?

1037
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,300
I'll be right there.

1038
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,140
Okay, okay.

1039
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,140
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

1040
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,020
Thank you.

1041
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,580
You guys talk first.

1042
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,340
We have something to do.

1043
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:34,780
You guys go in.

1044
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,380
Okay.

1045
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,460
Come on.

1046
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,660
I can't do this.

1047
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,500
I can't do this.

1048
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,500
I can't do this.

1049
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,860
I can't do this.

1050
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:44,100
I can't do this.

1051
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,020
Come on, kid.

1052
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:45,780
Go back and have a drink.

1053
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:46,380
Have a look.

1054
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,060
Okay.

1055
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,060
Mr. Zhou.

1056
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:51,180
You guys are so interesting.

1057
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,940
It's four o'clock in the afternoon.

1058
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,380
It's dark.

1059
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:55,460
We're like this.

1060
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,220
It's really dark.

1061
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,100
It's bright.

1062
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,020
Yeah.

1063
00:39:59,020 --> 00:39:59,980
I'm here to study.

1064
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:00,740
You're so cold.

1065
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:01,700
Come in.

1066
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,660
Go.

1067
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,700
Here we come.

1068
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,500
Here.

1069
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,660
Mr. Zhou, here we come.

1070
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:08,500
Here, a hot pot.

1071
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,380
Thank you.

1072
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:10,020
There's more.

1073
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:10,740
Come on, guys.

1074
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:11,220
You guys go first.

1075
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,140
Let's go, let's go.

1076
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:13,100
Okay.

1077
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:13,900
Okay.

1078
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:14,740
Here.

1079
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,860
Here, a hot pot for me.

1080
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,060
A fish hot pot.

1081
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:17,780
Here, a beer.

1082
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:18,500
Thank you.

1083
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,100
A piece of chicken.

1084
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:19,900
A piece of meat.

1085
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:20,060
Here.

1086
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,100
You two go first.

1087
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:21,660
You two go first.

1088
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:22,140
Here.

1089
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:22,860
Hurry up.

1090
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:23,460
Here.

1091
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:33,500
Brother, I will see you off again.

1092
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,220
A break of time,

1093
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:37,420
it feels really good.

1094
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:38,660
I always think food looks delicious.

1095
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:39,620
berry, you'd better eat well.

1096
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:40,780
I don't want it instead.

1097
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,660
chords, we should leave now.

1098
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,580
Luckily, the fluent rates are missing.

1099
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,860
I don't want to marry.

1100
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,860
I'm alone in the room anyway.

1101
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:58,860
I can't get married.

1102
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:01,860
I can't do it anyway.

1103
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:02,860
If I don't get married,

1104
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,860
I'll be in the house of my mother-in-law.

1105
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,860
My wife and uncle are not at home.

1106
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,860
I can't take care of their family.

1107
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,860
It's hard to get married for many years.

1108
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:13,860
I have to do well.

1109
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:15,860
I don't want to.

1110
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:17,860
My mother-in-law is not stable.

1111
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:18,860
I don't want to marry.

1112
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:20,860
But I've been cleaning the house

1113
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:21,860
for many years.

1114
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:23,860
I can't run.

1115
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:24,860
My wife and I

1116
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,860
said that we should be the soldiers.

1117
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:29,860
Look at you.

1118
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:31,860
You're the police.

1119
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:32,860
You're the poison.

1120
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:34,860
You only know that there are families.

1121
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:36,860
I'm different from you.

1122
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:37,860
I want to get married.

1123
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,860
I want to get married quickly.

1124
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,860
I want to go home and take care of my wife and children.

1125
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:42,860
Eat quickly.

1126
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,860
We'll go for a walk after eating.

1127
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:46,860
If we meet someone or a car,

1128
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:48,860
we can finish the task in advance.

1129
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:49,860
We can keep him in the house for a year.

1130
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:51,860
Eat quickly.

1131
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:52,860
Eat more.

1132
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:53,860
Eat quickly.

1133
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:54,860
Come on.

1134
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:55,860
Eat quickly.

1135
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:56,860
You can sit down and eat together.

1136
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:57,860
Eat first.

1137
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:58,860
Eat first.

1138
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:02,860
Zhou Zetan.

1139
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:04,860
I heard you say

1140
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:08,860
that you were so angry with Yuewei.

1141
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,860
If she continues to do this in the police station,

1142
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:13,860
the money should be quite good.

1143
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,860
Then why did you do it well?

1144
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:17,860
I don't know.

1145
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:20,860
That kid is not like you.

1146
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:23,860
He is a person who can't see the bottom of his eyes.

1147
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:26,860
Because of the case,

1148
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:29,860
I took him to the bottom of the house several times.

1149
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:30,860
My wife

1150
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,860
thought that she was

1151
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:36,860
a detective.

1152
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:38,860
She was a detective.

1153
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,860
She wanted to go out and steal.

1154
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:41,860
That's why.

1155
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:43,860
Before she left,

1156
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:45,860
I was retired.

1157
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,860
Chief, you are

1158
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:53,860
Mr. Qi.

1159
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:56,860
Chief Zhou.

1160
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:58,860
You are 70 years old.

1161
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:01,860
You should have retired 15 years ago.

1162
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:07,860
At that time,

1163
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:11,860
something happened in the police station.

1164
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:13,860
I retired early.

1165
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:15,860
What happened?

1166
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:17,860
Well,

1167
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:18,860
I'll eat.

1168
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:19,860
Eat while it's hot.

1169
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:20,860
Eat while it's hot.

1170
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:46,860
Love

1171
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:49,860
is

1172
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:54,860
falling into the water

1173
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:04,860
I want you

1174
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:14,860
I want you

1175
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:17,860
I want you

1176
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:19,860
I want you

1177
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:24,860
I want you

1178
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:29,860
I want you

1179
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:35,860
I want you

1180
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,860
I don't know

1181
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:43,860
I want you
