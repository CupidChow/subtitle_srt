1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I

4
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,320
You

5
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:41,240
China covering worlds

6
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,980
extend

7
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,480
We

8
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,080
Don't

9
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,040
have

10
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,740
many

11
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,300
years

12
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,640
are

13
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,460
changed

14
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,340
innocent

15
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:01,940
The 1999 PNP will remind you of the exciting beginning.

16
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,340
Mr. Cheng.

17
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,140
This is it.

18
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:17,740
Sorry.

19
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,140
Come on.

20
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:18,740
It's okay.

21
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,540
Don't touch it.

22
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,540
No, it's not.

23
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:20,740
Come on.

24
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,340
Sit down.

25
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:21,940
Come on.

26
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,340
It's a little bit better.

27
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:25,940
It's a little bit better.

28
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:26,340
Come on.

29
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:26,940
Wait a minute.

30
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,540
Come on.

31
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,140
One by one.

32
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:28,940
Wipe it. Wipe it.

33
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:30,940
You took it.

34
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:31,540
What time is it?

35
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,140
When you go back, you have to check if it's useful.

36
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,940
We should have refused it long ago.

37
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,740
I remember when I just got in the police station,

38
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,740
we had a meeting.

39
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,540
How long was it?

40
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,340
You're not objective.

41
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,540
Isn't that Spring Festival?

42
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,340
Isn't it a beauty show?

43
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,740
Mr. Cheng, you're so good.

44
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,340
I said it was us.

45
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,540
You weren't the president at that time.

46
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,940
Gao Chao and I just got here.

47
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,740
Yes.

48
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,540
We didn't know what we were doing in the summer.

49
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,940
Maybe we couldn't spend time together.

50
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:04,540
Right?

51
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,940
It's not easy to gather.

52
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:08,540
It's...

53
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,140
President Cheng.

54
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,340
What do you want to say?

55
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,140
Just say it.

56
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,940
What can I say?

57
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,140
The military just said

58
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,740
that we haven't gathered for a long time.

59
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,340
And we have a common identity now.

60
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:27,940
We're all masters.

61
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:41,540
Xia Jia.

62
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:45,940
Xia Jia.

63
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:46,540
Xia Jia.

64
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,940
Why are you so sad?

65
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,740
I heard from my master that

66
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,540
Cheng Suo invited us to have a meal together.

67
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,940
Why are you so sad?

68
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,540
Is it because my master and Officer Chen

69
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,540
sang together today?

70
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,540
Why didn't you sing?

71
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,540
Why did you sing?

72
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,540
Why did you sing?

73
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,940
I was just saying the first one.

74
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:05,340
Why?

75
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,940
Officer Chen is protecting David.

76
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:08,940
My master...

77
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,940
is doing it for me.

78
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:19,940
It's different.

79
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,940
He's been a master of two people.

80
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,540
He's been a master of the high court.

81
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,740
What do you mean?

82
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,940
I'm an old master, right?

83
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,140
Of course.

84
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:27,940
I'm a master of one day.

85
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,140
I'm a father of the middle.

86
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,940
Look, Chen and Officer Chen.

87
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,540
You've all been in the same place, right?

88
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,540
And that...

89
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,540
The one who left a few years ago.

90
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:36,940
That...

91
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,740
It's Liu Wei.

92
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,940
It's no use to remember.

93
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,140
Anyway, I'm the master of the first time.

94
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,340
You said we were doing this.

95
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,340
We were busy.

96
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,540
It seems that we meet every day in a place.

97
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,540
It's really hard to be together.

98
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,340
Let's gather.

99
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:52,740
Come on.

100
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,740
You can have some tea.

101
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:54,740
Let's have a seat.

102
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:55,540
Come on.

103
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,340
Chen.

104
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,140
What should we do now?

105
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,740
What should we do?

106
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,940
I've thought about it before.

107
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,540
One person is a master of one day.

108
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,340
I won't talk to you.

109
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,940
What are you talking about?

110
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,340
We didn't say it ourselves.

111
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,940
Now we're talking about the master.

112
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,340
It's a different question.

113
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,140
What's your answer?

114
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,540
I...

115
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:15,740
David...

116
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,740
Zhao Jiwei.

117
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,740
We've all been taken.

118
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,740
If we really ask for the blame,

119
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,940
no one can escape.

120
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,140
It seems that my transfer

121
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,740
is completely wrong.

122
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,140
Then I should

123
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,740
roll you in first.

124
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,740
The problem now is the master.

125
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,140
Chen.

126
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:42,940
Come on.

127
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,940
You can ask the theme yourself.

128
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,540
Come on.

129
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,140
This one.

130
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,340
It's good. Try it.

131
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,340
It's good, Chen.

132
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,540
You haven't had a meal together for so many years.

133
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,140
Do you still remember

134
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,740
my favorite pork fillet?

135
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,540
It seems that you don't remember.

136
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,940
I'm a social worker.

137
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,140
I have to pay attention to the point of life.

138
00:05:59,140 --> 00:05:59,740
I don't only remember

139
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,940
my favorite pork fillet.

140
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:01,940
You don't eat chicken.

141
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:02,940
I also remember

142
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,340
my brother loves to eat beef.

143
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,540
Right?

144
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,940
You're really good.

145
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:09,940
Speaking of which,

146
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,940
that's also when I just got the office.

147
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,740
Why am I so into drinking?

148
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,740
That time, we were together.

149
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,140
Deng Shun caught a poisonous one.

150
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,740
It was 16 or 17 hours.

151
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:22,940
He didn't eat or sleep.

152
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,340
There was a restaurant next door.

153
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,740
The smell was so good.

154
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,540
I was so annoyed.

155
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,740
When the mission was over,

156
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,940
my master bought me this piece.

157
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,340
I tried it.

158
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:36,940
I was so happy.

159
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,340
I can't even remember the taste now.

160
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,340
From then on,

161
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,340
as long as someone tells me

162
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,740
about the three words of beef,

163
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,740
I can't even remember the taste.

164
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,340
Really?

165
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:50,540
Here,

166
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,340
pour the beef out.

167
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:54,940
You really dare to do that?

168
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,740
You're so mean.

169
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,340
No, no.

170
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,340
I'm really young now.

171
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:01,580
I've been

172
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,540
always in the past.

173
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:03,540
Really?

174
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,540
I've been in the social community

175
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,140
with Zhao Jiwei recently.

176
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,540
I think of him

177
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,740
when I was young.

178
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,340
He was so considerate.

179
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,940
He was like me.

180
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:17,740
Mr. Lan, Mr. Xu.

181
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,540
You all know that

182
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,140
I came from the countryside.

183
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,940
I went to the army first

184
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,140
and became a police officer.

185
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,340
Jiwei got a job at the police station.

186
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:26,540
Anyway,

187
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,740
it's not easy to get from the countryside to the city.

188
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,540
So he cherishes the work

189
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,540
he's done in front of him.

190
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,540
It's like

191
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,740
the one in the film,

192
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,140
Lin Meimei.

193
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,140
No,

194
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,140
the fake one.

195
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,940
He's so afraid of himself.

196
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,140
He lost the restaurant.

197
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,540
So he has to be careful.

198
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,740
I understand.

199
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,340
Jiwei is a very thoughtful guy.

200
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,540
He can understand the people's difficulties.

201
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,740
Look, it's been only a few months.

202
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,340
He's already slowly getting there.

203
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,340
Jiwei's progress

204
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,540
is really impressive.

205
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,340
That's right.

206
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,140
I think of him as progress.

207
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,540
I think

208
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,940
I was also

209
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,140
a little bit of progress.

210
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,940
Yang Zhong is different.

211
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,140
Look at him.

212
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,740
He's been working with me all day.

213
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,540
He's been working with me all day.

214
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,340
But his heart

215
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,540
is really good.

216
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,340
He really wants to

217
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,340
solve the problem

218
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,740
of the people in the city.

219
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,540
You know, it's weird.

220
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,540
I don't believe it.

221
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,540
We're just arguing like this.

222
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,340
I don't know how it's like

223
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,540
to really argue like that.

224
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,740
It's all emotional.

225
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,940
You're a couple.

226
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,340
You're fighting with me.

227
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:41,940
Chen.

228
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,540
Eat some.

229
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,140
Eat.

230
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:44,740
Come on.

231
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:51,740
Jiwei,

232
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,540
we had already pulled him out

233
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,540
when we arrived.

234
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,140
We didn't do it first.

235
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,540
He did it first.

236
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,340
It's true.

237
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,940
But we don't have the evidence

238
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,340
to prove that we're in the right position.

239
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,140
Check the head.

240
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:07,540
Yes.

241
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,140
I'll go to the neighborhood to see if there's any surveillance.

242
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,140
If there's any,

243
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,340
it'll prove that

244
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,740
we're not the ones who did it first.

245
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,540
The head is a protective item.

246
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,340
No.

247
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:18,740
Think about it.

248
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,340
He's a bad person.

249
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,140
He posted the video

250
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:22,940
that he had been editing in advance.

251
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,340
He's a bad person.

252
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:24,940
He's not clear about it.

253
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,740
He's just a master.

254
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,740
If this happens,

255
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,940
who cares about details?

256
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,540
Then you're saying

257
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,940
we don't have any hope?

258
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,340
I've been in my heart for so long.

259
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,740
I'm not used to it.

260
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,740
I'm not used to it.

261
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,140
We're giving up on using the law.

262
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,340
We've already lost

263
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,140
the moment we used the whole team.

264
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,340
We lost the police law

265
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,540
because we were the ones

266
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,140
who should be the police.

267
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,340
Yang Shu,

268
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,140
don't you think

269
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,140
you're making a mess now?

270
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,340
On the one hand,

271
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,540
we didn't do it first.

272
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,340
On the other hand,

273
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,340
we put the law down.

274
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,740
We're not the ones who did it first.

275
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,740
We're the ones who did it first.

276
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,740
We're the ones who did it first.

277
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,340
On the one hand,

278
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,340
we've already lost the law

279
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,340
because we put the law down.

280
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,740
This is a matter of different aspects.

281
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,940
It's a matter of real life.

282
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:11,740
Second,

283
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,340
No,

284
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,140
when are we going to

285
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,740
talk about these things?

286
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,540
The law.

287
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:18,940
That's all.

288
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,140
How long have the law been in the court?

289
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,140
The key is how big

290
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,740
the public's heart is.

291
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,340
We're not the ones who have no principles.

292
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,740
We have no choice.

293
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,340
This is a normal man's job.

294
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,140
Why can't we do it

295
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:31,940
by the police?

296
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,940
I don't believe it.

297
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,140
We're the ones who are brave.

298
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,740
We can't fight the old shameless man.

299
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:39,940
Jia Jia,

300
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:40,740
don't think too much.

301
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,540
I'm fine.

302
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:42,940
What do you think?

303
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:44,540
Nothing.

304
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,940
I want to drink more coke.

305
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,140
I'll buy it for you.

306
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,340
Xia Jie,

307
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,340
why don't you ask the chief

308
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,340
if the transfer

309
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,140
has anything to do with this?

310
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,540
Actually,

311
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,540
I've heard

312
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,940
a few of the old men say

313
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,740
that.

314
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,540
The worry about this child

315
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,540
is really a big deal.

316
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,140
It's Yang Shu.

317
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,740
Yang Shu is indeed a good boy.

318
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,540
Xia Jie said it more than anyone else.

319
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,140
If I say this,

320
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,740
the one who has the most troubles

321
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,340
is the one who is in the big trouble.

322
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,540
Maybe his master

323
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,140
has more troubles.

324
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,740
Chen, you're overthinking.

325
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,940
Isn't this the place

326
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:03,940
where the words are spoken?

327
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,340
Yes, yes, yes, Chen.

328
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,540
We just said

329
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,940
nothing else.

330
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,940
I just took Ji Wei to the community

331
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,340
in the afternoon.

332
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,740
I saw he was a little bit more advanced.

333
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,540
I just had a little bit of a rush.

334
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,340
Just talking about this,

335
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,940
I just said it in a flash.

336
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,140
Yes, yes, Chen.

337
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:20,940
I was just

338
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:21,940
a little bit like Yang Shu

339
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,940
two days ago.

340
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,140
Suddenly, you were there.

341
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,340
I don't know how.

342
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,140
Just a little bit of

343
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,740
a little bit of a sense of humor.

344
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,940
Just say it.

345
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:32,740
Yes, yes, yes.

346
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,740
It doesn't mean anything else.

347
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,340
Today is mainly a little talk.

348
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,740
Don't think too much.

349
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,740
You just said Li Dawei.

350
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,540
Everyone can see the ability of this child.

351
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:44,540
Yes.

352
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:45,940
You think it's like that

353
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,940
old-fashioned person.

354
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,940
Actually, I almost think

355
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,340
in the heart of the chief,

356
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,540
this child should be the most important.

357
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:52,540
Yes.

358
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,340
Really.

359
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:53,940
No, no.

360
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,340
Actually, I don't mean anything else.

361
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,340
I just...

362
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,140
I'm just very touched.

363
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,940
I just want to be sad.

364
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,340
Actually,

365
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,740
at first, I thought

366
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,340
just you and me

367
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,340
we were in love all the time.

368
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,940
But when I saw her,

369
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,140
it was all the same.

370
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,740
I'm really in love with her.

371
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:29,940
But

372
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,740
that thing

373
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,340
is all about peace.

374
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,740
No matter what you say,

375
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,340
it's all because of me.

376
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,740
Whether it's my disciple,

377
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,740
or my sister's master,

378
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,540
I'm sure it won't be a big deal.

379
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,540
Actually, I also think

380
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,940
that being a cop

381
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,140
is also a good thing.

382
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:06,740
Half a life.

383
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,740
I'm a little tired.

384
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,540
I just took off my uniform.

385
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:16,740
What?

386
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:17,940
I'm a little bit hung up.

387
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,540
Daoshan, don't talk nonsense.

388
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,340
I'm a little bit hung up.

389
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,340
I'll go first.

390
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:26,940
Chen.

391
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:27,740
Chen.

392
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:28,340
Chen.

393
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:28,940
Chen.

394
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,340
Don't be impulsive.

395
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,540
What's this?

396
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:32,940
You can take off your uniform

397
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,340
as you wish.

398
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:35,740
Besides,

399
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,340
even if you really take it off,

400
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,140
what are you going to do in half a life?

401
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,340
And if Jia Jia knows,

402
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,540
what will she think?

403
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,940
Have you thought about it?

404
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,740
Chen.

405
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,740
All right, get up.

406
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,340
You're so polite.

407
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,540
You said you don't have any time.

408
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:14,540
I...

409
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,740
I don't know how long you can last.

410
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,540
When you can't get up,

411
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:19,940
I'll see what you'll do.

412
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,340
What should I do?

413
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,740
What if I retire?

414
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:25,540
You?

415
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,740
How can you retire?

416
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,340
I see you

417
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,540
are so busy these days.

418
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,140
People who contact you

419
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,540
are more than our police.

420
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,340
Look.

421
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,740
Why are you so kind?

422
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,740
How did you practice?

423
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,540
Crying is also a mistake.

424
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:46,940
Laughing is also a mistake.

425
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,740
Why don't you laugh?

426
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,940
And the more people contact you,

427
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,940
the more you realize that you're a good person.

428
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,740
There's no bad person.

429
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,340
There's only sick people.

430
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,940
You're right.

431
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:05,340
Look, there are so many people in our neighborhood.

432
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,540
But the one who's doing the homework

433
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:11,540
is just 0.0% of them.

434
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,740
There are still many good people.

435
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,140
Of course,

436
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,940
there are so many people who are kind.

437
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,340
As a police officer,

438
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,340
Chen is a good person.

439
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,140
So he sees the bad person.

440
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,540
As a doctor, he's a good person.

441
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,740
So he sees the sick person.

442
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,140
We're all doing this for the better.

443
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,340
We're all doing this for the better.

444
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,940
We're all doing this for the better.

445
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,540
You're almost a philosopher.

446
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,740
I'll come here often.

447
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,540
One is to pick the right body.

448
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,740
The other is to wash the soul.

449
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:50,540
Come on.

450
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,140
When you're not busy,

451
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,940
I'll sit down with my brother.

452
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:55,940
Have some wine.

453
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:56,340
Okay.

454
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,940
We'll talk about the truth.

455
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,940
Maybe we'll talk about the common sense.

456
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,340
You're so mean.

457
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,340
I'm sorry.

458
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,740
We've been together for so many years.

459
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,740
I've been here with you.

460
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:14,140
I've never said that we'd sit there and drink a cup of wine.

461
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,340
I'm sorry.

462
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:16,940
Let's do this.

463
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,940
When we're resting,

464
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:19,740
I'll treat you.

465
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:23,340
I know that there's a very good town in Zhenhai County.

466
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,140
No, no.

467
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,740
I'm not that good.

468
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,140
You know, I was hungry when I was little.

469
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:33,740
My biggest dream is to eat a big plate of pork.

470
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,940
I'll treat you to a pork chop.

471
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:37,540
Okay.

472
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,540
Then, pork chop.

473
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,540
Okay, pork chop.

474
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,340
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

475
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:50,940
You're back.

476
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:51,740
Yes.

477
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:52,740
I'm back.

478
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:53,940
The people are here.

479
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,940
I'm waiting for you at your office.

480
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,540
What's the rush?

481
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,740
Who are they?

482
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,140
If they don't come together, they're invincible.

483
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,540
Look.

484
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,540
I'm changing my clothes.

485
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,740
You go with me.

486
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:12,740
Mr. Zhang.

487
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,540
Mr. Zhang.

488
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,340
Mr. Zhang.

489
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:14,940
Mr. Zhang.

490
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:15,340
Mr. Zhang.

491
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:15,940
Mr. Zhang.

492
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:16,540
Mr. Zhang.

493
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,340
Mr. Zhang.

494
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,140
Mr. Zhang.

495
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:18,740
Mr. Zhang.

496
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,140
Mr. Zhang.

497
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:22,540
Mr. Zhang.

498
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,740
Mr. Zhang is here again.

499
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:24,540
Go away.

500
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,340
Don't move.

501
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,340
How many times have I said this?

502
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,140
I said I can't blow bubbles.

503
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,740
Why can't you understand?

504
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:34,140
I can't take this matter now.

505
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,340
So I'm the only one who can bear it.

506
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,140
If you get involved first,

507
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,340
it won't make any sense.

508
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:46,740
We'll bear the burden together.

509
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,540
You've all been sent by Yang Shung, right?

510
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,340
You're all so stubborn.

511
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,340
Mr. Zhang, what's the matter?

512
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,140
You're here again.

513
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,140
I'm not...

514
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:00,940
Mr. Zhang.

515
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,140
What are you doing here?

516
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,340
You've been hiding here for the past few days, right?

517
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,340
What's the secret?

518
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,140
No secret, right?

519
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,340
No secret?

520
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:13,940
You're lying, right?

521
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,540
Are you waiting for this?

522
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,140
Look at it.

523
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,140
What's going on, Mr. Yang?

524
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,740
It's nothing to do with him.

525
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,340
Listen,

526
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,740
I saw our leader today.

527
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,340
He's back again.

528
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,540
He's gone.

529
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,140
That's the truth.

530
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,540
That's the logic.

531
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,340
That's the secret.

532
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:49,540
Go!

533
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,740
Tell me, who's that?

534
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,540
You want evidence, right?

535
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,340
He's a good student.

536
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,340
Who's that?

537
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,140
Tell me.

538
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,740
Let me see again.

539
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,140
Don't you want evidence?

540
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,340
Look carefully!

541
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,140
What?

542
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,740
Don't touch me.

543
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,940
I'm telling you.

544
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,540
Explain to him.

545
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,340
How can he be so sure?

546
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:20,540
Mr. Yu.

547
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,740
You're being rude.

548
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,740
You're being rude to your daughter.

549
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,140
Do you know how to deal with you in the law?

550
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,540
Do you want me to give you a break?

551
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,540
How did you get that video?

552
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:38,540
Chief.

553
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,340
Chief.

554
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,940
Jia Jia gave me the video.

555
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:42,940
This...

556
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:43,740
Yes.

557
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:48,140
She said she was brave enough to hire him because of my sister.

558
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:51,740
She wanted to help you out bravely.

559
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,340
Xing Chang.

560
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,940
Jia Jia is not easy.

561
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:58,940
She also said

562
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,340
if that lucky man

563
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,740
still doesn't have a good wife,

564
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:04,940
she'll sue him.

565
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,940
She'll fight with him.

566
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,540
A little girl can say this.

567
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:13,940
You're so mean.

568
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,940
Jia Jia is more brave than we thought.

569
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,940
Master, that's good.

570
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,140
Jia Jia is so good.

571
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,740
Why are you so polite?

572
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,740
I can't stand it.

573
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,940
I can't stand it.

574
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:28,540
You can't stand it.

575
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:28,940
I can't stand it.

576
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:29,740
You're crying for me.

577
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:30,540
I'll cry for you.

578
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,540
Yes, yes, yes.

579
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,740
What are you laughing at?

580
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:33,740
What are you laughing at?

581
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,340
Chief.

582
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:34,940
What are you laughing at?

583
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:35,340
Brother.

584
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,140
What are you laughing at?

585
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:36,940
Are you kidding me?

586
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,540
Well...

587
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,140
Are you all right?

588
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:41,940
Are you all right?

589
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:42,740
Yes, I'm all right.

590
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:43,940
All right, sit down.

591
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:44,740
Let's have a meeting.

592
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,740
Chief.

593
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,140
You were so excited just now.

594
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,340
I'm so touched.

595
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,540
Let's sit down.

596
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,740
Let's sit down.

597
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,140
I'm so happy.

598
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:57,940
I'm so happy.

599
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,340
I'm so happy.

600
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,340
I'm so happy.

601
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,140
Really?

602
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,540
I'm so excited.

603
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,340
You two are so good.

604
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,340
You must be so touched.

605
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,140
I'm so happy.

606
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,340
Are you all happy?

607
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,140
Yes.

608
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,740
Are you all happy?

609
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,140
You four.

610
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,140
I'll stand up.

611
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,340
It's such a big thing.

612
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,540
You two are still laughing.

613
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,940
Don't you laugh at me?

614
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,740
You're the police.

615
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,340
The national law and the public agreement.

616
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,340
You know everything, you know the whole thing?

617
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,340
You guys still think you can be the police?

618
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,340
You still think you can wear this uniform?

619
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,340
You guys have been in the lock for days,

620
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,340
and you have been in the lock for so long,

621
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,340
and you have been so drunk.

622
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,340
What are you standing here for?

623
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,340
You know what I'm going to tell you, right?

624
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:04,340
A 20-year-old police officer who has been in the police for more than 20 years,

625
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:07,340
he knows nothing about the situation,

626
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:10,340
and you are in the prison, and you are in the prison.

627
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,340
How did you bring your apprentice here?

628
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,340
After he met you in the police station,

629
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,340
he was so impulsive,

630
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,340
and he didn't even think about it.

631
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,340
He was just learning from you.

632
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,340
You are such a good teacher.

633
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,340
Chief,

634
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,340
I can't do this.

635
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,340
I promise

636
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,340
I won't do this.

637
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,340
We promise.

638
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,340
I won't do this again.

639
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,340
I promise.

640
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,340
I promise.

641
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,340
I promise.

642
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,340
Chief,

643
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,340
we can write a check.

644
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,340
As long as you can

645
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,340
smile,

646
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,340
we can write a ten thousand-word check.

647
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,340
Ten thousand words, okay?

648
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,340
You can write words, right?

649
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,340
I'm afraid you'll be able to do it.

650
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,340
It's like this.

651
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,340
If you do it again,

652
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,340
you'll be able to leave immediately.

653
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,340
Do you remember what I said?

654
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,340
Yes.

655
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,340
If you remember,

656
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,340
get out of here.

657
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,340
Yes.

658
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,340
Please stay,

659
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,340
you two

660
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,340
hang this principle and the discipline

661
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,340
on your lips.

662
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,340
But when you talk about the principle,

663
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:38,340
you all get sucked into it.

664
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,340
You all get sucked into it

665
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,340
and get sucked into it.

666
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:48,340
You are so innocent.

667
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,340
You are responsible for

668
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:53,340
the principle and discipline.

669
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:03,340
You are not as good as a teacher.

670
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:05,340
You can't do it yourself.

671
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,340
What's the use?

672
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,340
What's the use?

673
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,340
Between the master and the student,

674
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,340
it's not enough to talk about the principle

675
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,340
and discipline.

676
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,340
You should be responsible for it.

677
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,340
Tell the young people

678
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:38,340
what kind of responsibility they bear.

679
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,340
Tell the young people

680
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,340
what the police's identity means,

681
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,340
what the police's honor is.

682
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,340
As a criminal,

683
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,340
the first thing to do is to

684
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,340
strictly follow your own rules,

685
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,340
to practice your own principles,

686
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:59,340
to practice your own patience.

687
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,340
Okay.

688
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,340
I'm done.

689
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,340
Xiao Zhe,

690
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,340
you can go.

691
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,340
The police

692
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,340
are all doing it.

693
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,340
They should know

694
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,340
what we are under.

695
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,340
What we are under

696
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,340
is the mission of protecting the society

697
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:30,340
and protecting the people.

698
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,340
This mission

699
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,340
requires us

700
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,340
to put the interests of the society,

701
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,340
the country and the people

702
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,340
in the first place.

703
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,340
This mission also requires us

704
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,340
to be

705
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,340
protected by our own

706
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,340
and be protected by our own.

707
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,340
So, we must

708
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,340
work hard

709
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,340
to improve our party's

710
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,340
responsibility for the people's service.

711
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,340
Hongyang will sacrifice

712
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,340
his life for the great and powerful city.

713
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,340
I'm so happy.

714
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,340
I'm so happy.

715
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,340
What's wrong?

716
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,340
I'm worried about

717
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,340
the mother of the child.

718
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,340
I'm so sorry

719
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,340
for the future.

720
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,340
I deserve it.

721
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,340
I'm so sorry.

722
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,340
Okay, stop talking.

723
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,340
I'm sorry.

724
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,340
Da Bei,

725
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,340
after we take the family

726
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,340
and the teacher

727
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,340
comes to the family,

728
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,340
I have to

729
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,340
take care of the baby.

730
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,340
I have to see

731
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,340
if the father of the police

732
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,340
is giving the child to the teacher.

733
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,340
Da Bei.

734
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,340
Dad.

735
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,340
Dad, I'll take it.

736
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,340
I'll take it.

737
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,340
Master, let me take it.

738
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,340
Okay, okay.

739
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,340
I'll take it.

740
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,340
I'll take it.

741
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,340
Take it.

742
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,340
Bring me the water.

743
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,340
Okay.

744
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,340
I have to come back

745
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,340
to see the mother.

746
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,340
Okay.

747
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,340
Let's go.

748
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,340
Da Bei.

749
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,340
Let's go.

750
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,340
Da Bei.

751
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,340
Let's go.

752
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,340
This way.

753
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,340
Da Bei.

754
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,340
Come on.

755
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,340
How do you like it?

756
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,340
I like it.

757
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,340
This is the bedsheet

758
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,340
that I just changed.

759
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,340
Your favorite blue.

760
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,340
Don't open it.

761
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,340
Come on.

762
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,340
How is it?

763
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,340
Put it in the drawer.

764
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,340
Take it.

765
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,340
Look at the light.

766
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,340
I know

767
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,340
the light is the key.

768
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,340
Look.

769
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,340
If you can open it

770
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,340
or open it,

771
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,340
do you know what you want to eat?

772
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,340
You say,

773
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,340
Chen,

774
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,340
I'll take some sugar cane.

775
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,340
I'll buy it for you.

776
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,340
If you feel annoyed,

777
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:12,340
you can close it.

778
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,340
Right?

779
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,340
It's the same.

780
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,340
This is my mother's phone.

781
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,340
Thank you.

782
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,340
Hello, mom.

783
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,340
What's up?

784
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:59,180
We're facing the following situation.

785
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,780
Go carefully.

786
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,620
What do you think?

787
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,940
I see.

788
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,540
Okay, I'll be right there.

789
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,340
I can't tell you now. Can you go back?

790
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,340
Go back.

791
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,340
Wait. Go to the lock.

792
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,340
Draw the police uniform.

793
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,340
Okay.

794
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,340
You go.

795
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,340
Mom.

796
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,340
Mom.

797
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,340
Mom.

798
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,340
Dawei.

799
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,340
Dawei.

800
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,340
What's wrong?

801
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,340
Why are you crying?

802
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,340
Are you okay?

803
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,340
I'm in the prison.

804
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,340
What's wrong?

805
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,340
What's wrong?

806
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,340
Mom.

807
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,340
What a stubborn girl.

808
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:06,340
I didn't want to tell you.

809
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,340
I was afraid of many patients with her.

810
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,340
They all said it was this disease.

811
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,340
Where is she?

812
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,340
I went out to find some friends to play with.

813
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,340
You went to find friends?

814
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,340
Mom, what did she think of you?

815
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,340
Why did she come back this time?

816
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,340
She didn't leave after coming back.

817
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,340
She came to find the old man who was sick, right?

818
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,340
Is that so?

819
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,340
Dawei.

820
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,340
He's your dad.

821
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,340
What's wrong with my dad?

822
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:56,340
He's not even a son of his own.

823
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,340
He wants to starve me when he's sick, right?

824
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,340
No way.

825
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,340
Dawei.

826
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,340
Dawei.

827
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,340
I'm so sick of this.

828
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:17,340
Is it cold or evil?

829
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:21,340
This is not cold or evil.

830
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:27,340
It's not just cold.

831
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:31,340
And the mouth is so big.

832
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:42,340
No wonder.

833
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,340
There's such a person in this world.

834
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,340
When you're not sick, you eat and drink.

835
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:52,340
You get sick and come back to remind us.

836
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,340
Is there such a good thing?

837
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,340
I found a reason to do that.

838
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,340
Son.

839
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,340
Son.

840
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,340
You can't.

841
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,340
You can't do this.

842
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,340
Fine. I'll call him.

843
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,340
I'll tell him.

844
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,340
No way.

845
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,340
He's your dad.

846
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,340
You can't do this.

847
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,340
He's been so ungrateful.

848
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,340
He wants to comfort us.

849
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,340
What? He needs comfort?

850
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,340
Who needs comfort?

851
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,340
You.

852
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,340
I need comfort.

853
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,340
I'll tell him.

854
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,340
Listen to me.

855
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,340
You can't do this.

856
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,340
Son.

857
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,340
Xiaoxia.

858
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,340
It was my dad who called you back.

859
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,340
It was my dad who knew you were sick.

860
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,340
I called him back.

861
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:32,340
It was my own wish.

862
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,340
What did you say?

863
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,340
It was my own wish.

864
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,340
Son.

865
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,340
Son.

866
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,340
You don't understand.

867
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:59,340
Actually, your dad is very important to me.

868
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,340
Mom.

869
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,340
You still don't have enough of him?

870
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,340
No.

871
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,340
Didn't you hate him for getting divorced?

872
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,340
Yes.

873
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,340
I hated him at that time.

874
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,340
I hated him for not coming home.

875
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,340
But he's back now.

876
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,340
What did you tell me?

877
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,340
Son.

878
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,340
Mom likes your dad.

879
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:44,340
He likes you for the rest of your life.

880
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,340
But he's not changed.

881
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,340
Son.

882
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,340
Son.

883
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,340
No matter how much you despise your dad,

884
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:09,340
you can't be with him.

885
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,340
I can't be with him.

886
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,340
No?

887
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,340
When you were a kid,

888
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:21,340
you wanted to be a good son.

889
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:26,340
You didn't care about your father.

890
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:32,340
And you had to follow the rules and rules.

891
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,340
What about you?

892
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:37,340
You followed the rules and followed the rules.

893
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:42,340
You lived a happy life.

894
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,340
The sunshine.

895
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:50,340
These are all given by your dad.

896
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,340
Son.

897
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,340
Son.

898
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,340
Son.

899
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,340
Son.

900
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:09,340
You have your dad's advantages.

901
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:14,340
But you know better than him that you have to be responsible.

902
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,340
Because of your dad,

903
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,340
I have you.

904
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,340
I will always be grateful to him.

905
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:29,340
But he's not only a witness now.

906
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:32,340
I don't know how long he can live.

907
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,340
In this world,

908
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,340
I only have you.

909
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,340
Mom, don't cry.

910
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,340
He's back.

911
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,340
Cui Ping.

912
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,340
Cui Ping.

913
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,340
Yes, I'm back.

914
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:57,340
Sit down and have some soup.

915
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,340
Really?

916
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,340
Dawei is back.

917
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,340
You're back.

918
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,340
It's time.

919
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,340
Let's have a talk.

920
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:29,340
I believe that the development of science

921
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:32,340
will be successful in the future.

922
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,340
Listen to what my son said.

923
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,340
I don't know.

924
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,340
What did you say?

925
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:51,340
I went to a few hospitals when I was outside.

926
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,340
Even the big hospitals in Singapore.

927
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,340
The foreign doctors said I don't need to know.

928
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,340
Since I got it,

929
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,340
I can enjoy life.

930
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,340
You want to enjoy life?

931
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:06,340
I don't know.

932
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,340
You want to enjoy life?

933
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,340
You don't want to enjoy life?

934
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:12,340
You've been responsible for your life.

935
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,340
You've been responsible for your life.

936
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,340
You've been responsible for your life.

937
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,340
What about my mom and I?

938
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,340
You're not qualified for the job.

939
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,340
We won't give you this.

940
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,340
We'll watch you...

941
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,340
What's wrong with this?

942
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,340
Listen to me.

943
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:12,340
I'll arrange a hospital for you.

944
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:14,340
You have to know if you want to be a doctor or not.

945
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,340
You've never been responsible for your life.

946
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,340
You've been responsible for your life.

947
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,340
You're not qualified for the job.

948
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,340
What will my mom do in the future?

949
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,340
Son.

950
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:28,340
Just do as your dad says.

951
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,340
Son.

952
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,340
I went to a few hospitals with your dad.

953
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,340
I can't take this disease anymore.

954
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,340
If you continue to do this,

955
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:45,340
your dad will be punished.

956
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,340
We'll be punished too.

957
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:50,340
Mom, he's not even qualified for this disease.

958
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:52,340
You'll remember it in the future.

959
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,340
I'm not afraid.

960
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:57,340
Because mom has you.

961
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:04,340
Now, as long as your dad is happy every day,

962
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:05,340
you'll be happy.

963
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,340
Son.

964
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,340
I've discussed it with your dad.

965
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,340
I've still got some money.

966
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:16,340
Instead of taking these money

967
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,340
to the hospital,

968
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:21,340
we should go to the hospital

969
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:24,340
and see what happens.

970
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:29,340
Mom, this...

971
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:30,340
I said it.

972
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,340
This is it.

973
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:35,340
Son.

974
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,340
Son.

975
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,340
Son.

976
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,340
Son.

977
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,340
Son.

978
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,340
Son.

979
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,340
Son.

980
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:48,340
When your dad chased me,

981
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:51,340
he kept on pushing me.

982
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:55,340
He said he had run away from the world.

983
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,340
He said he'd chase me

984
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:01,340
to the world.

985
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,340
He'd take me to the place

986
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:06,340
he had been to.

987
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:13,340
He ran away alone.

988
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:17,340
I was at home alone.

989
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:23,340
Now, God

990
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:25,340
has arranged time for us.

991
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:27,340
Time for us to realize

992
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:29,340
our childhood.

993
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,340
Mom.

994
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:41,340
Eat this, son.

995
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:46,340
The wheelchair is so good.

996
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,340
Really?

997
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:49,340
It's as good as the flat ground.

998
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,340
My wheelchair

999
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:53,340
is small and flat.

1000
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,340
Really?

1001
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,340
Let me take a picture.

1002
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:58,340
Here.

1003
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:01,340
Mom, is this okay?

1004
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,340
What if he's in a state of health

1005
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:05,340
and the wheelchair is on him?

1006
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:06,340
It's okay.

1007
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:09,340
I can take care of myself.

1008
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:10,340
I can't say no to you.

1009
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:11,340
It's really a day.

1010
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:13,340
I'm in the sea.

1011
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:15,340
The sea is very romantic.

1012
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:16,340
Don't say that.

1013
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:18,340
You have to come back with me.

1014
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,340
Okay.

1015
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:21,340
Mom, you're so happy.

1016
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:22,340
Okay.

1017
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,340
Let me take a picture with you.

1018
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,340
Come on.

1019
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:25,340
Son.

1020
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:28,340
Come back early.

1021
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:30,340
Don't forget that I'm here.

1022
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:31,340
You?

1023
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,340
I don't care.

1024
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:33,340
You're grown up.

1025
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,340
The rest is...

1026
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:36,340
Li Tao.

1027
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,340
Yes.

1028
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:38,340
The rest is

1029
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:40,340
the time I spent with your dad.

1030
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:41,340
Okay.

1031
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:43,340
Sit here.

1032
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:44,340
Let me take a few pictures.

1033
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:45,340
Okay.

1034
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:46,340
Come on.

1035
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,340
Take this.

1036
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,340
Okay.

1037
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:55,340
Thank you.

1038
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:03,340
Come on.

1039
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:04,340
Come back.

1040
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:05,340
Be careful.

1041
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:07,340
Come back to your room.

1042
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:11,340
Come on.

1043
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:12,340
Come on.

1044
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,340
Come on.

1045
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:15,340
Come on.

1046
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:18,340
Come on.

1047
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:19,340
Come on.

1048
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:58,340
The shadow of the wind

1049
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:03,340
After the rain

1050
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:08,340
The choice is to compromise

1051
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:12,340
Hug and love

1052
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:17,340
Love and love

1053
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:22,340
From the moment I smile

1054
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:27,340
Love, love

1055
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:32,340
From the moment I smile

1056
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:43,340
The dream is back

1057
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:49,340
The eyes of the dream

1058
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:53,340
From the moment I close my eyes

1059
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:57,340
I listen to you

1060
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:02,340
I cry

1061
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:07,340
I fall into you

1062
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:12,340
I don't fear

1063
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:18,340
I run towards you

1064
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:23,340
I run towards you

1065
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:33,340
I run towards you

1066
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:38,340
I cry

1067
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:43,340
I fall into you

1068
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:51,340
I don't fear

1069
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:55,340
I run towards you
