1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I

5
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:15,860
Often

6
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:25,460
About

7
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
How much money do you have here?

8
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Tell me the truth.

9
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Don't be so careless.

10
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Say it!

11
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Xia Jian.

12
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
What's wrong?

13
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Xia Jian.

14
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What's wrong, Xia Jian?

15
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You're not feeling well?

16
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Why don't you go to the doctor's office?

17
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
No.

18
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Then what?

19
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Just say it if you have any questions.

20
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Master.

21
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You just said that

22
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
he doesn't respect women and insults people.

23
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Even if he's a criminal,

24
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
he's a legal worker

25
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
who hasn't been investigated before.

26
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You should respect him.

27
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I thought you were sick.

28
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's good that you're fine.

29
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Xiaodou, come here.

30
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm asking a female suspect.

31
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Follow her.

32
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Xia Jian, take a rest.

33
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Master.

34
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's okay. I'll talk to you later.

35
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'll be back.

36
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Sister.

37
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Xia Jian.

38
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
What's wrong?

39
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm fine.

40
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
He's the one I brought back.

41
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
What are you doing?

42
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Don't do so many small things.

43
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm always asking you.

44
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
If you're really innocent,

45
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
tell me your problem earlier.

46
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Xia Jian.

47
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
If you have other things to do,

48
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
go back to work.

49
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm sorry.

60
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm sorry.

61
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Mom.

64
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Do you feel better?

65
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Much better.

66
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Take your medicine on the ambulance.

67
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Remember to drink it.

68
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
When will you be back?

69
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm busy today.

70
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I guess I can't go back.

71
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You can't go back?

72
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You just got off work.

73
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You just got a call.

74
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Mom.

75
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Do you know what kind of care I got

76
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
when I was a kid?

77
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I didn't do anything in the city.

78
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
That's what you should do.

79
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm a police officer.

80
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I need to practice and learn.

81
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You can't stay up late.

82
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
How did your dad raise them?

83
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Mom, I have something to do.

84
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm hanging up.

85
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
If you don't come back,

86
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
how can I eat alone?

87
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I bought beef and vegetables

88
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
in the fridge yesterday.

89
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
How about you cook?

90
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm fine.

91
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Don't mind me.

92
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I don't want to eat.

93
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You don't want to eat?

94
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
What do you want to eat?

95
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's not dry outside.

96
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's so big.

97
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I dare to eat.

98
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Why don't you go out and eat?

99
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
If you really care about me,

100
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
come back early.

101
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
If you can't come back early,

102
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
don't say it again.

103
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Dad.

104
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Dad.

105
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Chief.

106
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Why are you here?

107
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Let's go.

108
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What are you doing here?

109
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Yang Sui said you didn't go to the toilet.

110
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm sure the people in the dorm

111
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
will come here.

112
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'll make a private job for you.

113
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'll do it.

114
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I can't do it.

115
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Brother.

116
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
If you want to say this bold and new thing,

117
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
no one can compare you.

118
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
But I still have to say it.

119
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Chief.

120
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I know you want to say it.

121
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
The situation this time is really special.

122
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
No matter how special it is,

123
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
you should wait for the fire.

124
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Wait?

125
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You said it's a good road.

126
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It takes an hour to clear the road.

127
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's still in a hurry.

128
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
There's no way.

129
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Tianzhi.

130
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Think about the new situation.

131
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
That's a small-scale incident.

132
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It's not possible.

133
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
How many times have I said it?

134
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You can't act like this.

135
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
If you can't do it,

136
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'll punish you next time.

137
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Punish?

138
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Why not?

139
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'm punishing you for your own good.

140
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Jianjuan.

141
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Think about it.

142
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You're with your wife and child now.

143
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You're so beautiful.

144
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
How nice.

145
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You're going to be like Xintong.

146
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You're so beautiful.

147
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Xintong.

148
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Hello?

149
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
This is the boy.

150
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm not afraid of him.

151
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
He's right.

152
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
What are you doing here?

153
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's a secret.

154
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You're a man.

155
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm afraid...

156
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm afraid...

157
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I'm afraid...

158
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'm afraid...

159
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm afraid...

160
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm afraid...

161
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'm afraid...

162
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm afraid...

163
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
When my daughter-in-law asked me to pick up the child,

164
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I knew I met a good person with my wife.

165
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
My wife was working there.

166
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
There was really no way.

167
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Like I was so young, I couldn't find a good job.

168
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I found a few things that I didn't get.

169
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
My family was all with my wife.

170
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
By now, I can only tell you to believe in the law.

171
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Xia Ying, you saw it too.

172
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
My wife has been taking the child with her.

173
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I didn't force her.

174
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
She went in at once.

175
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I caught the shrimp.

176
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Can you bring me in a few words?

177
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
What are you talking about?

178
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Xiaoli.

179
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Xiaoli.

180
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Why are you laughing?

181
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Xiaoli.

182
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Xiaoli.

183
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Xiaoli.

184
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Xiaoli.

185
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Xiaoli.

186
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Xiaoli.

187
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Xiaoli.

188
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Xiaoli.

189
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I'm here to pick you up.

190
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Sit down.

191
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Don't go around, kids.

192
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Sit here.

193
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Sit here.

194
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
See you later.

195
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
We're almost done.

196
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm here to pick up the child.

197
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Thank you, Mr. Xia.

198
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,640
Hello?

199
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,400
Yes.

200
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,240
Hello?

201
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:40,600
Who's there?

202
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:41,760
Hello?

203
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,320
Hello?

204
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,480
Det doit specifically

205
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,620
in Sacramento,

206
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,460
Okay.

207
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,180
It's okay.

208
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,180
Sit down and eat.

209
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,540
Master, give me two chicken legs.

210
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,340
Okay.

211
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,820
Thank you.

212
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:14,940
Thank you.

213
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:15,660
I have something to do.

214
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,860
I have something to do.

215
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,380
Your Majesty, hurry up.

216
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,420
Don't touch the string.

217
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,300
Xiao Jie.

218
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,140
What's the matter?

219
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,020
Nothing.

220
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,380
Hurry up.

221
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,260
Get off.

222
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,260
Your car is here.

223
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,300
No.

224
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,220
Sister Xu, can we change the car?

225
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:35,980
I'll put this one.

226
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,780
Let's go.

227
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,580
Thank you.

228
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,020
This is the main car you just parked.

229
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:48,260
You said the main car you parked was this one.

230
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:49,940
It's him.

231
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,940
Stay here.

232
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,500
I can't believe you.

233
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,380
He is asking about your meal class.

234
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,060
I'm sorry, I'm too busy.

235
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,100
What is it?

236
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,140
It's all right.

237
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:06,860
Take your gun.

238
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,540
Hurry up.

239
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,940
Miss Xu, I'm here.

240
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,700
Get off the car.

241
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,940
I'll tell you what is going on.

242
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,060
What was he saying?

243
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:18,620
Nobody at home is smart enough to call me a pantomime patient.

244
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,980
If I touch the string,

245
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,980
What's going on?

246
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,980
What's going on?

247
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,980
Mom, you're back.

248
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,980
You're back.

249
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,980
Didn't you say you're not coming back today?

250
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,980
I've just finished the work.

251
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,980
I don't need to work. I'm back.

252
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,980
Mom, what did I buy for you?

253
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:09,980
I bought your favorite barbecue and char siu.

254
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:16,980
Xiao Jie, is something wrong with you?

255
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,980
What can I do?

256
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,980
I'm just worried about you.

257
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,980
I'm afraid you won't eat.

258
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:26,980
Did Wang Shou Yi get angry with you?

259
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:30,980
Mom, what are you thinking about all day?

260
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,980
You're so nice to me.

261
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,980
I can't even breathe.

262
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:37,980
Really?

263
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,980
Of course.

264
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,980
Mom, I want to be a common police.

265
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,980
Everyone treats me so well.

266
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,980
I'm under a lot of pressure.

267
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:51,980
Then why don't I talk to them?

268
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,980
No, please don't.

269
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,980
I've been too concerned about it.

270
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,980
Mom, you try it first.

271
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,980
I'll heat the dishes.

272
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:17,980
Xiao Jie, why didn't you call your aunt this afternoon

273
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,980
to talk about the matter today?

274
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,980
Did you ask me if I wanted to go?

275
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,980
Then I called the police.

276
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,980
But no one answered the phone.

277
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,980
Mom, I told you not to bother the police.

278
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,980
The police is in charge of this.

279
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,980
You're a nuisance.

280
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,980
Why?

281
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,980
Your dad is a hunter.

282
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,980
Yes, my dad is a hunter.

283
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,980
But we can't live together forever.

284
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,980
Besides, I'm already working.

285
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,980
I'm completely satisfied with your work.

286
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,980
I'll arrange it for you tomorrow.

287
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,980
Don't worry about living.

288
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,980
I'll help you to raise your aunt.

289
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:55,980
Don't.

290
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:56,980
I'm a big family.

291
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,980
I can't just raise my aunt for two days.

292
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,980
If your dad is here, that's good.

293
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,980
Can we talk about something happy?

294
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,980
Let's go.

295
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:00,980
Here.

296
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:01,980
Jia Zeyuan.

297
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:02,980
Morning.

298
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:03,980
Morning.

299
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:04,980
He's back as a doctor.

300
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:05,980
Jia Zeyuan.

301
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,980
He just came back from the hospital.

302
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,980
Yes.

303
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,980
Jia Zeyuan.

304
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,980
I'm fine tonight.

305
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,980
How about I go to the hospital to see an old man?

306
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,980
My grandpa left.

307
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,980
I've been in bed for two years.

308
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,980
I'm a big old man.

309
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,980
Don't need to take care of others.

310
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,980
You can work.

311
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,980
Jia Zeyuan, morning.

312
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:36,980
Morning.

313
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:42,980
Forget it.

314
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,980
Let's just talk to him.

315
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:03,980
Look.

316
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,980
Assume it's autumn.

317
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,980
Let's leave.

318
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,980
I'm sorry, Xiao Ding.

319
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,340
Well,

320
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,340
we'll take a photo of you

321
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,340
when we're done.

322
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:13,940
No need.

323
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,220
I can still hold on.

324
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,060
Tell Cheng Suo to help me

325
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,220
to keep up with the work.

326
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,220
Okay.

327
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,100
If you need anything,

328
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:19,980
just tell me.

329
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:20,980
Deputy Chief.

330
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:21,780
Yes, Deputy Chief.

331
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,420
No.

332
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,060
Your water is almost empty.

333
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,060
I'll change it for you.

334
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,060
Go, go, go.

335
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,060
Go.

336
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,660
Be careful.

337
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,660
Don't think too much.

338
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,660
This kid...

339
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:35,860
He's too kind.

340
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:36,860
He's too blind.

341
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,460
It's too early to get married now.

342
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,260
He's too strong.

343
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,860
Then go talk to him.

344
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,260
It's your strong point

345
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,980
to be a self-employed worker.

346
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,260
Come.

347
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,260
Yes.

348
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,460
Sun,

349
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,660
hand over the materials

350
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,060
to the chief to sign the papers.

351
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,620
Then go to the legal team.

352
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,460
We're going to break the human barrier.

353
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,980
There's no reason to stay.

354
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,220
The one in the front

355
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,220
is all taken care of.

356
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,220
Okay.

357
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,220
I'll go.

358
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,220
Shifu,

359
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,220
I'm so excited.

360
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,220
Shifu, have some.

361
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,700
Shifu,

362
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,700
I'm in the wrong this time.

363
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,700
I didn't hear your instructions.

364
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,700
I apologize to you.

365
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,700
But Shifu,

366
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,180
I have to explain to you

367
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,180
the situation at that time.

368
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,700
Sun told me

369
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,700
that you've been watching for a long time.

370
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,700
At that time,

371
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,180
they were going to go out to see the police.

372
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,180
If you don't catch them this time,

373
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,180
you'll have to work hard to pay the fine.

374
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,180
Are you apologizing?

375
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,180
Don't you think

376
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,700
I should thank you?

377
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,700
Without you,

378
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,700
my mission this month

379
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,700
wouldn't have been successful.

380
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,700
Shifu, I don't mean that.

381
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,700
I'm just explaining to you.

382
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,700
Please.

383
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,700
Don't explain.

384
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,700
By the way,

385
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,700
I have something to tell you.

386
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,700
From now on,

387
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,700
you can do whatever you want.

388
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,700
Okay?

389
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,700
If you remember one day,

390
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,700
and there's a man named Chen Yicheng,

391
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,700
you can tell me.

392
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,700
If you don't remember,

393
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,700
you can call me a piece of cake.

394
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,700
I'll go and play.

395
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,700
Don't say anything.

396
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,700
Okay, I'll go.

397
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,700
Xia Di, come here.

398
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,700
Come here.

399
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,700
Look at this.

400
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,700
Little Li,

401
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,700
he came running here this morning

402
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,700
to express his gratitude.

403
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,700
Your bag and phone

404
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,700
can be so fast.

405
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,700
I'm sorry.

406
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,700
Xia Jingguan

407
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,700
is not very kind.

408
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,700
Xia Jingguan,

409
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,700
thank you so much.

410
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,700
Thank you.

411
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,700
You're welcome.

412
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,700
We should do this.

413
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,700
But let me tell you something.

414
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,700
In the future,

415
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,700
you should be more cautious.

416
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,700
Don't carry the bag behind you.

417
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,700
Even if you don't carry it,

418
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,700
it's easy to be torn,

419
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,700
right?

420
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,700
Okay,

421
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,700
please go back.

422
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,700
Take the things.

423
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,700
Okay.

424
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,700
I don't need to take the things.

425
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,700
Let's go.

426
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,700
Let's go.

427
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,700
Okay.

428
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,700
Master,

429
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,700
what's going on?

430
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,700
What's going on?

431
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,700
His bag and phone are all found.

432
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,700
We didn't...

433
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,700
We gave up on chasing

434
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,700
because of various factors.

435
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,700
Xia Jing,

436
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,700
the police are facing crimes.

437
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,700
They won't withdraw.

438
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,700
It's a duty.

439
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,700
But...

440
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,700
When I heard

441
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,700
that there was only a phone in the bag,

442
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,700
I was confused.

443
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,700
Facing this kind of robbery,

444
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,700
it's a way to arrest the person.

445
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,700
But it's a way to get back to the superiors.

446
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,700
It's a way to kill the person.

447
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,700
Master, what did you do?

448
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,700
Think about it.

449
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,700
The robbery didn't take money.

450
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,700
The only big phone

451
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,700
will be out of the line.

452
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,700
The shop won't take any work.

453
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,700
So I told the shop's boss

454
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,700
to say hello.

455
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,700
So the person was killed.

456
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,700
I'm sorry, master.

457
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,700
I misunderstood you.

458
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,700
I thought you were wrong.

459
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,700
I'm too self-conscious

460
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,700
about many things.

461
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,700
Don't say that.

462
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,700
It's still a long time.

463
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,700
Let's talk slowly in the future.

464
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,700
Master.

465
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,700
I have one more important thing

466
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,700
that I want to admit my mistake.

467
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,700
Mistake?

468
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,700
Mr. Cheng.

469
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,700
The shop's security guard,

470
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,700
said he didn't sleep the whole night.

471
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,700
He's disturbing the people.

472
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,700
Please come over and take a look.

473
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,700
Okay.

474
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,700
Hello?

475
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,700
Captain Wu.

476
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,700
I remember.

477
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,700
Okay.

478
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,700
I'll be there soon.

479
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,700
I'll be there soon.

480
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,700
See you.

481
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,700
Miss, I have to go to the division.

482
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,700
I'll handle it.

483
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,700
This one?

484
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,700
No, no.

485
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,700
You can't.

486
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,700
Master.

487
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,700
Okay.

488
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,700
I'll go with you.

489
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,700
Ding.

490
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,700
Is there any police?

491
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,700
No one here.

492
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,700
Otherwise,

493
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,700
I can't send you this order.

494
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,700
But I'm just following the people.

495
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,700
I should...

496
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,700
Okay, I got it.

497
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,700
What's this smell?

498
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,700
It's a chicken lung.

499
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,700
Hello?

500
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,700
Is that the police?

501
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,700
Hello?

502
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,700
Is that the police?

503
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,700
Yes.

504
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,700
Police.

505
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,700
I reported it.

506
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,700
Who's doing this?

507
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,700
Our family on the street.

508
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,700
They're so shameless.

509
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,700
They saved our lives.

510
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,700
They're so stubborn.

511
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,700
What kind of people?

512
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,700
They're so stubborn.

513
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,700
They're so stubborn.

514
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,700
They're so stubborn.

515
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,700
They're so stubborn.

516
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,700
They're so stubborn.

517
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,700
They're so stubborn.

518
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,700
They're so stubborn.

519
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,700
Uncle, it's okay.

520
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,700
We know the situation.

521
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,700
Aunt.

522
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,700
There's a kid in our family.

523
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,700
What's going on?

524
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,700
What do you mean?

525
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,700
Can you tell them?

526
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,700
Let them move a little bit.

527
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,700
Okay?

528
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,700
You're so mean.

529
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,700
I told them what's going on when I called 110.

530
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,700
Why are you still afraid of the three young boys?

531
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,700
How can we tell them?

532
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,700
It's hard to tell them.

533
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,700
It's hard to find a cop, right?

534
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,700
Doctor.

535
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,700
This is a private matter.

536
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,700
It's not good for the police.

537
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,700
You're so young.

538
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,700
What do you mean?

539
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,700
If you say so,

540
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,700
no one will take care of it.

541
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,700
You don't care who I'm looking for.

542
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,700
I mean,

543
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,700
you can go up and remind them.

544
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,700
That's good.

545
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,700
You're so mean.

546
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,700
Let me go and knock on their door.

547
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,700
Tell them

548
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,700
that you'll live a small life in the future.

549
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,700
They won't beat us up.

550
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,700
We'll beat us up

551
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,700
when we go up.

552
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,700
Your police is doing this.

553
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,700
Okay, let's go up.

554
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,700
The group is in trouble.

555
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:40,700
The police is in the tree.

556
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,700
Which one?

557
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,700
The fourth floor.

558
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,700
One, two, three, four.

559
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,700
We're in the third floor.

560
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,700
Okay, please go up with us.

561
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,700
I'm not going up.

562
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,700
What do you want us to say?

563
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,700
It's a matter of conscience.

564
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,700
We didn't see it.

565
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,700
We didn't hear it.

566
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,700
There's a witness, right?

567
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,700
I can't go up with you.

568
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,700
If I go up,

569
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,700
they'll scold me.

570
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,700
Then we'll have no choice.

571
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,700
You're not willing to testify.

572
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,700
We're going up with no reason.

573
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,700
They'll blame us.

574
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,700
They won't admit it.

575
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,700
What should we do?

576
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,700
Look, sister.

577
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,700
Forget it.

578
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,700
Please sign this.

579
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,700
Thank you, sister.

580
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,700
I wish you a happy life.

581
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,700
The Dong San Guai report is completed.

582
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,700
The police are not pursuing the report.

583
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,700
The report is completed.

584
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,700
Li Diao Wei,

585
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,700
you're really a good cop.

586
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,700
The situation just now,

587
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,700
it's embarrassing to go up the bridge.

588
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,700
The doctor is taking my horse.

589
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,700
I'll take your horse.

590
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,700
What's the good thing about it?

591
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,700
You can live with me.

592
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,700
You can join me next time.

593
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,700
A month, five thousand.

594
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,700
A big house, one thousand eight.

595
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,700
Two houses, one thousand six.

596
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,700
I can let you guys go first.

597
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,700
Sister.

598
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,700
What's the matter?

599
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,700
What's the matter with him?

600
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,700
The angel and the girl.

601
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,700
Who doesn't belong to the angel and the girl?

602
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,700
I thought I should be a cop.

603
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,700
I should be a good cop.

604
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,700
Isn't that right?

605
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:33,700
They say that the family is not easy to get.

606
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,700
I've lost my wife.

607
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,700
I've lost my wife.

608
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,700
I have two sons and one daughter.

609
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,700
They usually don't come back.

610
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,700
We have a sick son.

611
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,700
He's relying on our old man.

612
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:54,700
The old man left his grandson to us.

613
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,700
Who knows that we'll be separated this time?

614
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:00,700
They've all come back.

615
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,700
Dad,

616
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,700
one of them said that he wanted to laugh.

617
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,700
He gave us a sheep's wool.

618
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:13,700
I knew that they were coming for the money.

619
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,700
Dad,

620
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,700
I'm sorry.

621
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,700
Go back with me.

622
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,700
Why should I go with you?

623
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,700
Do you usually stay at home?

624
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,700
You've never been there.

625
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:22,700
I've never been there.

626
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,700
I put my son here just to accompany my sister.

627
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,700
I didn't want to put him here.

628
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,700
It's easy for you to talk to me about this.

629
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,700
I've never been there.

630
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,700
You're better than singing.

631
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,700
I'm not going to take a penny.

632
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,700
You're a good boy.

633
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,700
What are you doing here?

634
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,700
You've been there.

635
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,700
This house has nothing to do with you.

636
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,700
What's wrong with me getting married?

637
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,700
Mom,

638
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,700
go with me.

639
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,700
I'll give you a sheep's wool.

640
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,700
Dad, I'll give you a sheep's wool.

641
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,700
What are you doing?

642
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,700
Dad, mom, you have to go with me.

643
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,700
Go with me.

644
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,700
Stop it.

645
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,700
Your parents don't want to go with you.

646
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,700
I warn you.

647
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,700
If you do it again,

648
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,700
you'll be punished.

649
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,700
You're too fast.

650
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,700
Our school's parents are in charge of the law.

651
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,700
That's right.

652
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,700
Are you really a school girl?

653
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,700
You're robbers.

654
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,700
Mom, I'm hungry.

655
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,700
Mom, I'll give you a meal.

656
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,700
Mom, where are you going?

657
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,700
Mom, I'm going to work.

658
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,700
Go out.

659
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,700
You're scaring me.

660
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,700
I'm going to kill you.

661
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,700
I'm not afraid of you.

662
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,700
You're a good boy.

663
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,700
Uncle Hong.

664
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,700
Come down.

665
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,700
Come.

666
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,700
Follow your uncle.

667
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,700
Come.

668
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,700
Where are you going?

669
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,700
I haven't finished my homework.

670
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,700
How can you leave?

671
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,700
I haven't finished my homework.

672
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,700
Where are you going?

673
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,700
You're still alive?

674
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,700
You're still hungry, you know?

675
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,700
Go.

676
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,700
Don't let me eat.

677
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:48,700
I'm still here with your mom.

678
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:51,700
Uncle Xia, are you hungry?

679
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,700
I'll be right back.

680
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,700
You're here, too.

681
00:30:58,700 --> 00:30:59,700
Okay, thank you.

682
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,700
Thank you.

683
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,700
Here.

684
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,700
Eat slowly.

685
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,700
Eat slowly.

686
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:27,700
Boss, we have another dish.

687
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,700
Boss.

688
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,700
Boss.

689
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,700
Boss, you eat it yourself.

690
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,700
Boss.

691
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,700
Boss.

692
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,700
What are you doing?

693
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,700
I'm here to rest.

694
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,700
What are you doing here?

695
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,700
I'm working.

696
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,700
I'm here to rest.

697
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,700
Did you do anything wrong?

698
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,700
No.

699
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,700
Kill like cat?".

700
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,700
Where are my Chinese pedal buttons?

701
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,700
Theárh Breton car za 나가ng for you.

702
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,700
Stay here.

703
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:45,700
Where are you going?

704
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,700
Li Target, where you going?

705
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,700
Li Target!

706
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,700
Uncle Xia, I'm out.

707
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,700
Go.

708
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,700
Go.

709
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,700
I'm going.

710
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,700
What's wrong?

711
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,700
Master.

712
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,700
Master.

713
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,700
Master.

714
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,700
Master.

715
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,700
Is it delicious?

716
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,700
I found a key person for him.

717
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,700
A new guest.

718
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,700
Really?

719
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,700
Okay.

720
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,700
Don't be angry with them.

721
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,700
It's okay. I'll come back in a few days.

722
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,700
Okay.

723
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,700
I'll listen to grandma.

724
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,700
Goodbye, uncle.

725
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,700
Goodbye.

726
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,700
Okay.

727
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,700
Okay. I'll go back to the studio.

728
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,700
Master.

729
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,700
Master.

730
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,700
Stop!

731
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,700
Hello?

732
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,700
Are you a cop?

733
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,700
It's really you.

734
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,700
Why are you back?

735
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,700
This is my home.

736
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,700
How could I not come back?

737
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,700
Where did you come from?

738
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,700
I'm from the Philippines.

739
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,700
I've been living in several countries.

740
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,700
Don't ask me.

741
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,700
It must be money.

742
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,700
I have something else to do.

743
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,700
What is it?

744
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,700
Cut the crap.

745
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,700
Where are you going?

746
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,700
Where are you going?

747
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,700
I'm going to buy some food.

748
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,700
Don't talk to me.

749
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,700
I'm going to buy some food.

750
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,700
I'm going to buy some food.

751
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,700
It's over.

752
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,700
You're asking me what you're wearing.

753
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,700
I'm asking you what you're wearing.

754
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,700
Stop!

755
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,700
Stop!

756
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,700
It's okay.

757
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,700
I'm looking for you.

758
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,700
It's okay.

759
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,700
The kid is going to pick up his mom.

760
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,700
I'll be there in a while.

761
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,700
You can't always be on my side.

762
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,700
Go back.

763
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,700
I'll be there in a while.

764
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,700
Okay.

765
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,700
I'll go to the summer vacation with the director.

766
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,700
You're calling again?

767
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,700
Well...

768
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:06,700
Director, I don't think I can live there.

769
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,700
Really?

770
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,700
It's been a few days.

771
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,700
I've been in the living room.

772
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,700
The other day, he asked me if we had a community dormitory.

773
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,700
I said no.

774
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,700
I suggest we stay together.

775
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,700
He lives somewhere.

776
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,700
Good boy.

777
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,700
I'm leaving.

778
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,700
I'll go find him.

779
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,700
You can't go.

780
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,700
Xing Cheng, it's time to get off work.

781
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,700
Boss Jiang.

782
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,700
You've been sleeping for several nights.

783
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,700
You must be tired.

784
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,700
You're so noisy.

785
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,700
What's the matter?

786
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,700
What's wrong?

787
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,700
He's sleeping on the bed.

788
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,700
You're so anxious.

789
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,700
You're not sleeping.

790
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,700
Zhao.

791
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,700
Zhao.

792
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,700
Why aren't you going back?

793
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,700
Yes.

794
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,700
I just got into the office.

795
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,700
I want to study more.

796
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,700
I have a bed in my office.

797
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,700
You can sleep here.

798
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,700
No need.

799
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,700
Go to sleep.

800
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,700
I need to teach you.

801
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,700
Go.

802
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,700
I'm not sleepy.

803
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:28,700
Besides, I can't sleep here.

804
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:32,700
I'll go out and work.

805
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,700
Let's go.

806
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,700
I'm a little confused.

807
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,700
Look.

808
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,700
This little boy is a little confused.

809
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,700
You're leaving?

810
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,700
Call me when you're done.

811
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,700
Hello, Li Dawei.

812
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,700
Where are you?

813
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,700
Are you okay?

814
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,700
Really?

815
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,700
Okay.

816
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,700
What did he say?

817
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,700
He said he's fine.

818
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,700
He told us to be at ease.

819
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,700
Let's go back to the dorm.

820
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,700
Let's go.

821
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,700
I'll go.

822
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,700
Okay.

823
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,700
I'm telling you.

824
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,700
Don't leave here.

825
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,700
Otherwise, you'll be in trouble.

826
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,700
It's a little light here.

827
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,700
It's not light.

828
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,700
It's just a chair.

829
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,700
Let's go see the sister-in-law.

830
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,700
You're a little angry.

831
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,700
Don't go.

832
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:18,700
My sister-in-law, my master's wife.

833
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,700
You're now Xia's master.

834
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,700
Sister-in-law won't let you come to the stage

835
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,700
in front of the little brother.

836
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,700
Why are you facing her?

837
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,700
Chief,

838
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,700
why don't you let me be Xia's master?

839
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,700
I didn't force you.

840
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,700
You chose it yourself.

841
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,700
Here comes the lady.

842
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,700
I'll tell your master

843
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,700
to choose a office for you.

844
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,700
But you don't do it.

845
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,700
Do you have to go with your old friends?

846
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,700
I said,

847
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,700
it's a good idea.

848
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,700
You're a good girl.

849
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,700
You're much better than us.

850
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,700
Yes.

851
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,700
My mom called again.

852
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,700
No, no.

853
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,700
No, no.

854
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,700
Chief, master,

855
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,700
do you have any tasks?

856
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,700
No, no.

857
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,700
I just want to see you off.

858
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,700
Let Cheng Suo drive.

859
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,700
We'll send you back.

860
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,700
No, I can go back myself.

861
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,700
Well,

862
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,700
let's go see our sister-in-law.

863
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,700
The first day you came to work,

864
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,700
we went to see her.

865
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,700
We rushed into the lock and the things were all in chaos.

866
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,700
We had no time.

867
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,700
We had time.

868
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,700
I'm sorry, chief.

869
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,700
I've invited the classmate tonight

870
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,700
to congratulate me on my official entry.

871
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,700
She's young.

872
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,700
She likes to be in a hot spot.

873
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,700
How about we let her go?

874
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,700
Look at her.

875
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,700
She should say hello to her in advance.

876
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,700
Let's discuss it.

877
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,700
Come on, let's go.

878
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,700
Thank you, chief.

879
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,700
Thank you, master.

880
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,700
Look at her.

881
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,700
She's so hot.

882
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,700
She's so heart-broken.

883
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,700
If you're scared,

884
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,700
you should live.

885
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,700
No.

886
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,700
Me.

887
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,700
What?

888
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,700
Okay.

889
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,700
Okay.

890
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,700
Okay, okay, okay.

891
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,700
Where's Li Dawei?

892
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,700
He's off work.

893
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,700
This, this, this...

894
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,700
Where's Xingcheng?

895
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,700
He's probably still here.

896
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,700
Let's go.

897
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,700
Xingcheng, Xingcheng.

898
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,700
Where's Xingcheng?

899
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,700
He's gone.

900
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:56,700
Call him.

901
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,700
He'll be here soon.

902
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,700
If he doesn't want to be a cop,

903
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:02,700
he'll leave early.

904
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,700
Okay.

905
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,700
I'm sorry.

906
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,700
I'm sorry.

907
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:26,700
I'm sorry.

908
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,700
I'm sorry.

909
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:30,700
I'm sorry.

910
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:32,700
I'm sorry.

911
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,700
I'm sorry.

912
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:36,700
I'm sorry.

913
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,700
I'm sorry.

914
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,700
I'm sorry.

915
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:42,700
I'm sorry.

916
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,700
I'm sorry.

917
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,700
I'm sorry.

918
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,700
I'm sorry.

919
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:50,700
I'm sorry.

920
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:52,700
I'm sorry.

921
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,700
I'm sorry.

922
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:56,700
I'm sorry.

923
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,700
I'm sorry.

924
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:00,700
I'm sorry.

925
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:02,700
I'm sorry.

926
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,700
I'm sorry.

927
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:06,700
I'm sorry.

928
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:08,700
I'm sorry.

929
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,700
I'm sorry.

930
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:12,700
I'm sorry.

931
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:14,700
I'm sorry.

932
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:16,700
I'm sorry.

933
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:18,700
I'm sorry.

934
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:20,700
I'm sorry.

935
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,700
I'm sorry.

936
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,700
I'm sorry.

937
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:26,700
I'm sorry.

938
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,700
I'm sorry.

939
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:30,700
I'm sorry.

940
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,700
I'm sorry.

941
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,700
I'm sorry.

942
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:36,700
I'm sorry.

943
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,700
I'm sorry.

944
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:40,700
I'm sorry.

945
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,700
I'm sorry.

946
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:44,700
I'm sorry.

947
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:47,700
I'm sorry.

948
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:49,700
I'm sorry.

949
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:53,700
I'm sorry.

950
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:55,700
I'm sorry.

951
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:57,700
I'm sorry.

952
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:59,700
I'm sorry.

953
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,700
