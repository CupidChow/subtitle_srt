00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I

5
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,720
I

6
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,080
What are they doing here?

7
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,420
They are

8
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,420
The

9
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,420
They are

10
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,420
This is for you.

11
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,420
This is for you.

12
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,420
Thank you.

13
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,420
Mr. Duan, you're here.

14
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,420
Why didn't you see your master?

15
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,420
He'll be here soon.

16
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,420
Okay.

17
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,420
Have a seat.

18
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,420
I'll put the work master's on the desk.

19
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,420
I'll report to you.

20
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,420
Okay.

21
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,420
Thank you.

22
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,420
Thank you.

23
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,420
You're welcome.

24
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,420
Thank you.

25
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,420
Brother Li, please take a look.

26
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,420
Thank you.

27
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,420
Okay.

28
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,420
Thank you.

29
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,420
Thank you.

30
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,420
Hurry up.

31
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,420
Get the car.

32
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,420
Hello, master.

33
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,420
What's the matter?

34
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,420
What's the matter?

35
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,420
Hurry up.

36
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,420
Master, this is real.

37
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,420
I'm telling you, this is real.

38
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,420
Uncle Jin Tang, the case is...

39
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,420
Yes.

40
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,420
This is for you.

41
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,420
This is for you.

42
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,420
This is for you.

43
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,420
This is for you.

44
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,420
Come on, take a look.

45
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,420
Take a look.

46
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,420
Master.

47
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,420
He'll be back soon.

48
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,420
Someone's looking for him.

49
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,420
Mr. Jin, what's the matter?

50
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,420
Okay, come on.

51
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,420
Come on.

52
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,420
Come on.

53
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,420
Come on.

54
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,420
Master.

55
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,420
Where have you been?

56
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,420
What's the matter, master?

57
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,420
What's the matter?

58
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,420
Last time, I told you

59
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,420
I saw that bastard in the upper room.

60
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,420
I saw him again.

61
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,420
Then?

62
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,420
Then I followed him to a small flat.

63
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:46,420
I heard a sound of a dead body in the flat.

64
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,420
I just got in.

65
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,420
You called me.

66
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,420
What did you see?

67
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,420
Someone was drinking and gossiping.

68
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,420
He was pulling the strings.

69
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,420
Was it in the 8th row?

70
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,420
Okay.

71
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,420
Let's go in and do the business.

72
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,420
Master, we're done here.

73
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,420
What about it?

74
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,420
I still think that 8th row is weird.

75
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,420
If you didn't call me today,

76
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,420
I would have been surprised.

77
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,420
Are you surprised?

78
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,420
Yes.

79
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,420
Ji Wei.

80
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,420
How is Feng Qiao's experience?

81
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,420
For those who have done illegal acts,

82
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,420
do you remember what we did?

83
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,420
I remember.

84
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,420
We didn't push or pull.

85
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,420
We didn't help the doctor.

86
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,420
So,

87
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,420
you're not allowed to act

88
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,420
easily.

89
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,420
Don't disturb the person's life.

90
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,420
Do you understand?

91
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,420
I'm not going to do it.

92
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,420
I'm not going to do it.

93
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,420
Do you understand?

94
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,420
Master.

95
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,420
What's wrong?

96
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,420
I still think that 8th row is weird.

97
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,420
Ji Wei.

98
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,420
You have to remember this.

99
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,420
The most important thing

100
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,420
in our police department is to

101
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,420
promote and educate people.

102
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,420
We need to help those who

103
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,420
are released from the criminal case.

104
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,420
We need to make them

105
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,420
capable and independent.

106
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,420
We need to help them

107
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,420
improve their legal knowledge.

108
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,420
This is the most important thing.

109
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,420
Don't follow him anymore.

110
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,420
Do you understand?

111
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,420
I know, Master.

112
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,420
Let's go.

113
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,420
Master, you're here so early.

114
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,420
You still call me master?

115
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,420
No matter when, you're my master.

116
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,420
I still need to learn from you.

117
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,420
Don't come.

118
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,420
The chief said that

119
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,420
he wanted me to teach you.

120
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,420
No, no. I want to learn from you.

121
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,420
I have good news for you.

122
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,420
The son of the Sun family

123
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,420
who is involved in the investigation

124
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,420
with Liu Qingjia

125
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,420
is in the dark.

126
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,420
In our 8th row,

127
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,420
there are also two police departments

128
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,420
in the Ma family.

129
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,420
The police department

130
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,420
has received a decisive progress.

131
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,420
Now, the police department

132
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,420
has already submitted

133
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,420
the investigation.

134
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,420
The police department

135
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,420
will soon be in charge.

136
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,420
Is that good news?

137
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,420
Yes, it is.

138
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,420
You're right.

139
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,420
Well,

140
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,420
the boss is satisfied

141
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,420
with the quality of the label.

142
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,420
Master is right.

143
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,420
I've misunderstood you.

144
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,420
Enough.

145
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,420
Pack up and get ready to go out.

146
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,420
Okay.

147
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,420
Master,

148
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,420
don't you want to show me?

149
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,420
You don't want to show me

150
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,420
but you want to show us your love?

151
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,420
We are in a good match.

152
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,420
We are in a good match, right?

153
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,420
We are in a good match.

154
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,420
We deserve to be in a good match.

155
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,420
Brother Cheng,

156
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:04,420
can you use your favorite painting?

157
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,420
Favorite painting?

158
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,420
Just him?

159
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,420
No.

160
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,420
Don't scare me.

161
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,420
Take it.

162
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,420
How?

163
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,420
How?

164
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,420
You can use it.

165
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,420
Master,

166
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,420
I'm not your child.

167
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,420
I can't go out

168
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,420
if you have a job.

169
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,420
No, Tu Er,

170
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,420
it's dangerous for you

171
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,420
to do this job.

172
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,420
Master doesn't want to use you.

173
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,420
Sister,

174
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,420
what does this mean?

175
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,420
I'm serious.

176
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,420
I'm serious.

177
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,420
I'm serious.

178
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,420
I'm serious.

179
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,420
Just carry it inside.

180
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,420
Master,

181
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,420
let's start now.

182
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,420
Just wait.

183
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,420
Go ahead.

184
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,420
Old Xu and Old Du,

185
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,420
they are going to the meeting room.

186
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,420
Master.

187
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,420
What are we going to do?

188
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,420
Old Xu and Old Du.

189
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,420
You just need to hurry up.

190
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,420
I'll know in a minute.

191
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,420
Master,

192
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,420
they have a plan.

193
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,420
What?

194
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,420
This is a big case.

195
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,420
Why?

196
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,420
The case is solved by yourself.

197
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,420
It's not enough for a person

198
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,420
to find a high-ranking officer.

199
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,420
I'm not sure.

200
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,420
I'm not sure.

201
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,420
I'm not sure.

202
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,420
I'm not sure.

203
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,420
I'm not sure.

204
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,420
I'm not sure.

205
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,420
I just said

206
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,420
you are always smart.

207
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,420
You think you can play the movie on the radio?

208
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,420
Well...

209
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,420
What does this mean?

210
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,420
You should tell me.

211
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,420
Fine.

212
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,420
I'll tell you.

213
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,420
To be honest,

214
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,420
this is

215
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,420
the best tradition

216
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,420
in the shooting room.

217
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,420
No matter if it's the case of the famous police

218
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,420
or the chief,

219
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,420
as long as there is a case,

220
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,420
you must find a deputy

221
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,420
to discuss the case.

222
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,420
In case you can't lose,

223
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,420
I can't do anything.

224
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,420
Do you understand?

225
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,420
Then you and the police

226
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,420
of the police station

227
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,420
must find a deputy.

228
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,420
Of course.

229
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,420
Hello, my ass.

230
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,420
Hello.

231
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,420
Tell me why.

232
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,420
Well,

233
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,420
I know you have to tell me

234
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,420
if I'm smart.

235
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,420
You should tell me.

236
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,420
I'm telling you.

237
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,420
This is the general

238
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,420
of the shooting room

239
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,420
in the big and small town.

240
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,420
Do you understand?

241
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,420
David,

242
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,420
remember,

243
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,420
no matter how big the case is,

244
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,420
the life and death are the most important.

245
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,420
Don't be reckless.

246
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,420
You must be careful.

247
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,420
Do you understand?

248
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,420
This is the most important thing

249
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,420
to find the deputy of the police

250
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,420
in the big and small town.

251
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,420
Do you understand?

252
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,420
Yes.

253
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,420
It seems

254
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,420
that the police officer

255
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,420
is called Wang Mang.

256
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,420
This is the deputy of the police.

257
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,420
What's the matter with you?

258
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,420
Do you really think you can use it?

259
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,420
Then why do you call me?

260
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,420
I'm just a little bit of a stranger.

261
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,420
What?

262
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,420
What do you mean?

263
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,420
I'm your kid.

264
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,420
You're so stupid.

265
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,420
But,

266
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,420
it's obvious

267
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,420
that the police officer

268
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,420
is called a big fish.

269
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,420
What's the matter with you?

270
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,420
What are you doing?

271
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,420
I told you,

272
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,420
you should leave.

273
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,420
I can't let you in.

274
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,420
You're not allowed in.

275
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,420
What are you doing?

276
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,220
I'll go, I'll go, I'll go.

277
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:58,940
Go away!

278
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,580
Sit down.

279
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,620
What's wrong with you?

280
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,060
Are you leaving?

281
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,460
There's a nightclub.

282
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,620
Don't be so rude.

283
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,780
Go away, go away, go away.

284
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,660
What's going on? Who's the police?

285
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,220
Me.

286
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:16,940
Let's go.

287
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:17,980
Who's the car?

288
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:18,780
I'm going.

289
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:19,540
Thanks for your cooperation.

290
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:19,860
Go away.

291
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,060
I'll go away.

292
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,460
Go away.

293
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,260
Don't look at me.

294
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:23,780
Go home.

295
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,260
Come here.

296
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:26,820
Go home.

297
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,700
Go home.

298
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,420
Don't look at me.

299
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,060
Go home.

300
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:29,580
Go home.

301
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,580
Don't look at me.

302
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,380
What's going on?

303
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,060
Tell me.

304
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,020
He...

305
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:38,780
He doesn't look at me.

306
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:39,420
He's a fast driver.

307
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,580
The school doesn't let me go to the school.

308
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,580
It's a rule.

309
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,300
What's the rush?

310
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,300
Are you asking?

311
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,620
Don't talk.

312
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:46,460
Let him talk.

313
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,060
No, no, no.

314
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:50,820
I'm not going home.

315
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,060
And then?

316
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,820
No, no, no.

317
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:57,580
No?

318
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,780
He doesn't look at me.

319
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:03,820
What are you saying?

320
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,980
How can I not look at you?

321
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,020
Tell me.

322
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,860
I said that Xu doesn't want to go to the school.

323
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:12,980
He said he wants to go home.

324
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,500
I said you can't go in.

325
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,260
He doesn't have money.

326
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,900
He said the house is his rent.

327
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,100
I said you can take the rent.

328
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,220
He can't take it.

329
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:25,140
Who wants to take the rent every day?

330
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:25,620
No.

331
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,900
Didn't I ask you to go in later?

332
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,460
Aren't you going?

333
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,060
I want to get married with the owner.

334
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,620
No, don't worry.

335
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,460
Just talk slowly.

336
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,660
Later,

337
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,820
I got caught.

338
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,460
And then you're afraid.

339
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,260
Even the leaders of the house are coming.

340
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,260
You were...

341
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,260
Okay, okay.

342
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,580
I'll ask you.

343
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,380
Do you want to get married with the owner

344
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,580
and do this kind of thing?

345
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,740
You didn't let him go in at first.

346
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,740
Who didn't let you go in?

347
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,540
Your wife is coming.

348
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,340
Your wife is coming.

349
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,340
You won't go in later.

350
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,580
I told you to talk.

351
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,980
Why are you so anxious?

352
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,140
You're just planning a conflict.

353
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,140
His wife is coming.

354
00:15:59,140 --> 00:15:59,540
Who?

355
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,540
Isn't she there?

356
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,780
You're his wife?

357
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:04,940
Is he his lover?

358
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:05,740
Yes.

359
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:06,940
Not really.

360
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,140
I'm getting divorced with him.

361
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,140
I'm not.

362
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,140
I'm not.

363
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,500
Why can't you see the expressway?

364
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,900
Even the sign can't see the expressway.

365
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,900
Why?

366
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,900
Why?

367
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:26,900
Why?

368
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,900
Sir.

369
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,900
Sir.

370
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,900
Sir, no one can see the expressway.

371
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:40,900
There's a mistake in the middle.

372
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,900
I'm sorry.

373
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,900
I'm sorry.

374
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,660
Sir.

375
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,660
Sir.

376
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,660
Who is it?

377
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,660
Who stopped the car here?

378
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,660
Sir.

379
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,660
How many times have you said not to stop the car?

380
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,660
How did you get here?

381
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,660
The car is full.

382
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:10,660
I'm going to go now.

383
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,660
You're stealing the basket.

384
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,660
Sir.

385
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,660
Sir.

386
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,660
Xiao Jie.

387
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,060
How is your mother?

388
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,660
She's in a big family.

389
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,660
I'm going to play.

390
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,660
Sir.

391
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,160
When her mother comes back,

392
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,660
we have to go to her home to see her.

393
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,160
I've said it a few times, but she didn't go.

394
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,660
No need, sir.

395
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,160
Call her and ask her when she comes back.

396
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,160
When she comes back, we'll go to see her.

397
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,160
Okay.

398
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,360
Police.

399
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:40,860
Hello.

400
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,160
My daughter is missing.

401
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:42,960
Don't worry.

402
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,960
When did she go?

403
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,960
Just now.

404
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,960
She...

405
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,960
After she went to school,

406
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,960
I gave her a plastic bag.

407
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,960
She was so dirty today,

408
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,960
I told her a few times.

409
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,960
She didn't see me.

410
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,960
I called her and she turned off the camera.

411
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,960
How old is the child?

412
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,960
Twelve.

413
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,960
Xiao Jie,

414
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,960
give her a warning.

415
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,960
How to call her?

416
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,960
Wu.

417
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,960
Okay, Ms. Wu.

418
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,960
Let's go to the police station.

419
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,960
Hurry up.

420
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,960
It's getting dark.

421
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,960
Ms. Wu,

422
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,960
we're going to the police station.

423
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,960
We're going to the police station.

424
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,960
Okay.

425
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,960
It's getting dark.

426
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,960
Ms. Wu,

427
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,960
I heard you said the child is twelve.

428
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,960
She hasn't been out for a while.

429
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,960
Is she going to the school?

430
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,960
She's not at home.

431
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,960
She's not at home.

432
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,960
It's impossible, police.

433
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,960
My daughter is a good girl.

434
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,960
She's been away from home since she was a child.

435
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,960
She doesn't go anywhere.

436
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,960
She tells me everything.

437
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,960
We don't have any secrets.

438
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,960
It's not right today.

439
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,960
I can't make a call.

440
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,960
I can't send a message.

441
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,960
She's not at home.

442
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,960
She's missing.

443
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,960
Are you being too strict?

444
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,960
If the parents are too strict,

445
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,960
the child won't be able to bear it.

446
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,960
What do you mean?

447
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,960
I'm her mother.

448
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,960
I don't care about her.

449
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,960
She's not responsible.

450
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,960
Why should I be strict?

451
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,960
Ms. Wu,

452
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,960
we understand your feelings.

453
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,960
You can go down there.

454
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,960
You need to know

455
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,960
the specific situation of Ms. Wu.

456
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,960
I'll go to the organization

457
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,960
and check the surveillance camera

458
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,960
of your father's house.

459
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,960
Okay?

460
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,960
Yes.

461
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,960
Give me your address.

462
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,960
Wen Gehua Garden,

463
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,960
B-1, 1-2-3.

464
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,960
Okay, I know.

465
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,960
Wait a minute.

466
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,960
This is my daughter's photo.

467
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,960
Take a look.

468
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,960
This...

469
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,960
Okay, I'll remember it.

470
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,960
No, no.

471
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,960
You just need to see it.

472
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,960
How can you remember it?

473
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,960
Just take a good look.

474
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,960
How about this?

475
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,960
I'll take a look.

476
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,960
Okay?

477
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,960
Take a look.

478
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,960
Okay.

479
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,960
I won't make a mistake this time.

480
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,960
Thank you.

481
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,960
Have a seat.

482
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,960
Thank you.

483
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,960
Ms. Wu,

484
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,960
can you tell me the situation?

485
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,960
Ms. Wu,

486
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,960
I've been missing for a long time.

487
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,960
Ms. Wu,

488
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,960
you need to meet the requirements

489
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,960
to make sure you're missing.

490
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,960
What do you mean?

491
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,960
Don't worry.

492
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,960
The surveillance camera

493
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,960
is looking for you.

494
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,960
I just want to know

495
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,960
the situation.

496
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,960
There's no other way.

497
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,960
Hurry up.

498
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,960
Hurry up.

499
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,960
When did you realize

500
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,960
that the child

501
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,960
was no longer around?

502
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,960
My daughter

503
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,960
went to study

504
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,960
and study for several hours.

505
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,960
She should have come back earlier.

506
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,960
But I couldn't reach her

507
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,960
and she didn't reply to my messages.

508
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,960
It's not normal.

509
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,960
What's the last time

510
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,960
she wore a red dress?

511
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,960
Red dress?

512
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,960
She's got two hairpin.

513
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,960
Ms. Wu,

514
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,960
hurry up.

515
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,960
Can you explain

516
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,960
her appearance

517
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,960
or

518
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,960
if she has any

519
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,960
good relationship with you?

520
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,960
No.

521
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,960
We don't use these anymore.

522
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,960
She's missing.

523
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,960
You need to find her.

524
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,960
You need to act.

525
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,960
Ms. Wu,

526
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,960
we know these.

527
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,960
It's better to help you.

528
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,960
I didn't say anything

529
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,960
clearly.

530
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,960
You sit here.

531
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,960
One more minute.

532
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,960
My daughter's danger

533
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,960
will be one more minute.

534
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,960
Okay.

535
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,960
Please write it down first.

536
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,960
I'll use it later.

537
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,960
No, no, no.

538
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,960
What do you mean?

539
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,960
What do you mean by writing it down?

540
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,960
If something happens,

541
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,960
it's better to do a DNA comparison.

542
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,960
What's the matter?

543
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,960
What's the matter with my daughter?

544
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,960
Ms. Wu,

545
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,960
why don't you write it down first?

546
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,960
Who's your Ms. Wu?

547
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,960
Why should I write it down?

548
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,960
My daughter is missing.

549
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,960
Why should you write it down?

550
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,960
Tell me clearly.

551
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,960
What's the matter with my daughter?

552
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,960
What's the matter with her?

553
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,960
Take a look.

554
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,960
You're so annoying.

555
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,960
Do you believe me?

556
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,960
I can report you immediately.

557
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,960
Do you have a parent?

558
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,960
Do you know

559
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,960
how much I love my parents?

560
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,960
Ms. Wu,

561
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,960
Ms. Wu,

562
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,960
calm down.

563
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,960
Calm down.

564
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,960
We understand your feelings.

565
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,960
Aren't you going to report the case?

566
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,960
Hurry up and report the case.

567
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,960
Tell her to tell me clearly.

568
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,960
Tell her to tell me clearly what she loves.

569
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,960
Does she have a sense of security

570
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,960
in her heart?

571
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,960
I'm going to find your leader.

572
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,960
I'll find her immediately.

573
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,960
I'll find her immediately.

574
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,960
Master,

575
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,960
I said I'd write it down first.

576
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,960
She's become like this.

577
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,960
Stop it.

578
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,960
Stop it.

579
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,960
Stop it.

580
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,960
Stop it.

581
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,960
We're going to find the first one

582
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,960
to help the child, right?

583
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,960
Xia Jin,

584
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,960
go to the monitoring room

585
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,960
and check on the monitoring room.

586
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,960
Hurry up.

587
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,960
Don't go.

588
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,960
Don't let her marry you.

589
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,960
Hurry up.

590
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,960
Don't let her talk.

591
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,960
She's like a mother.

592
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,960
Ms. Wu,

593
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,960
calm down.

594
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,960
Pour some water.

595
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,960
Pour some water.

596
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,960
Calm down.

597
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,960
We understand your feelings.

598
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,960
How about this?

599
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,960
We'll send two more people

600
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,960
to your neighborhood

601
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,960
to check on the surveillance camera in your neighborhood.

602
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,960
The scene will be clearer.

603
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,960
Thank you.

604
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,960
Come on.

605
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,960
Drink some water.

606
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,960
Master,

607
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,960
tell me

608
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,960
what happened

609
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,960
after your group arrived.

610
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,960
Mr. Feng,

611
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,960
Mr. He,

612
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,960
it's your first time here.

613
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,960
Mr. Feng,

614
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,960
what's wrong?

615
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,960
Are you missing?

616
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,960
Tell me if you can give me two.

617
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,960
Mr. Liu,

618
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,960
Mr. Zhang,

619
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,960
leave a message.

620
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,960
Okay.

621
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,960
Okay.

622
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,960
Mr. Zhang, Mr. Zhang.

623
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,960
Jin Zhong is back.

624
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,960
You two

625
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,960
can go home and tell him.

626
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,960
Okay.

627
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,960
I'll leave you two to it.

628
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,960
I'll go first.

629
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,960
Okay.

630
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,960
You

631
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,960
take care of everyone.

632
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,960
Let's clean up together.

633
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,960
Be careful.

634
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,960
Don't be too careful.

635
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,960
As a police officer,

636
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,960
no one will touch you.

637
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,960
Be careful.

638
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,960
You'll be back later.

639
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,960
It's like this.

640
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,960
A little girl

641
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,960
left the garden.

642
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,960
Of course,

643
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,960
it's a case that

644
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,960
she's not seen yet.

645
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,960
Maybe

646
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,960
she's really her mother.

647
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,960
She forced her child

648
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,960
to go to the study

649
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,960
and study.

650
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,960
She was bored.

651
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,960
She ran to

652
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,960
other schoolmates

653
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,960
and had fun.

654
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,960
She asked everyone to look for her.

655
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,960
Well,

656
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,960
Mr. Zhang,

657
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,960
go to the school

658
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,960
and find the class director.

659
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,960
Ask them

660
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,960
who's the child.

661
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,960
Which classmate

662
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,960
is closer to her.

663
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,960
And also,

664
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,960
on the way to the study,

665
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,960
look for her carefully.

666
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,960
When you get to the community,

667
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,960
you can ask the left and right

668
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,960
of the left and right of the left.

669
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,960
Mr. Zhang,

670
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,960
what do you think

671
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,960
about the cases

672
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,960
we've dealt with today?

673
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,960
How is it?

674
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,960
I think it's good.

675
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,960
Especially the one

676
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,960
in the courier.

677
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,960
The teacher is very accurate

678
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,960
when he sees the problem.

679
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,960
The main evidence of the problem

680
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,960
is

681
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,960
the relationship between the couple.

682
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,960
The key is to be with the woman.

683
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,960
So,

684
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,960
as long as you do the job of the woman,

685
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,960
all the problems

686
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,960
will be solved by the person.

687
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,960
As for the contradiction

688
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,960
between the courier

689
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,960
and the security,

690
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,960
it's not a problem.

691
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,960
There's still a lot of learning.

692
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,960
Whether it's facing the suspect

693
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,960
or the client,

694
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,960
the solution is usually

695
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,960
in their words.

696
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,960
For example,

697
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,960
if the suspect has more words,

698
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,960
the hole is bigger.

699
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,960
If the person has more words,

700
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,960
the more the person will be angry.

701
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,960
Thank you, master.

702
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,960
You're welcome.

703
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,960
You're welcome.

704
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,960
It's just a little experience.

705
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,960
You'll get familiar with it later.

706
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,960
Don't stop.

707
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,960
Continue.

708
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,960
What else is worth summarizing?

709
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,960
Then I'll summarize

710
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,960
this matter.

711
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,960
Through this incident,

712
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,960
the client also knows

713
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,960
that the rule of the client

714
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,960
cannot be higher than the law.

715
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,960
They have no right

716
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,960
to limit the delivery of delivery.

717
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,960
This is also a self-training lesson.

718
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,960
It's not a matter of course.

719
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,960
It's a big deal.

720
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,960
I think

721
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,960
you guys are really good at writing.

722
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,960
You'll be the leader in the future.

723
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,960
Master, you're overestimated.

724
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,960
You did a good job.

725
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,960
No, no, no.

726
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,960
Yang, I think you should

727
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,960
write down

728
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,960
all the words you just said

729
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,960
and all the cases we've experienced.

730
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,960
Write them down in the pen.

731
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,960
Didn't you write all the records?

732
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,960
Why do you write them?

733
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,960
Let us see

734
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,960
all the evidence in the bureau.

735
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,960
Let them know

736
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,960
how much our work

737
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,960
has.

738
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,960
Can I think about it?

739
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,960
Of course.

740
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,960
Of course you have to write it.

741
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,960
I'll write it down.

742
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,960
Tell me, tell me.

743
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,960
We're on the spot.

744
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,960
Okay, master.

745
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,960
I'll cover the position of the bureau.

746
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,960
The bureau has three minutes

747
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,960
to the point.

748
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,960
Master,

749
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,960
we've been here

750
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,960
for a few days.

751
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,960
I'm still standing here

752
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,960
with that eight-faced man.

753
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,960
Master,

754
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,960
I'm a little bit clear now.

755
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,960
You're really smart.

756
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,960
You're really smart.

757
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,960
Master,

758
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,960
you three

759
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,960
have done a lot of things.

760
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,960
Today,

761
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,960
it's my turn.

762
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,960
I'm not a little bit

763
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,960
short-tempered.

764
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,960
I'll help you.

765
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,960
I'll be back first.

766
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,960
Don't talk.

767
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,960
Master.

768
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,960
All the groups,

769
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,960
all the groups,

770
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,960
start to represent

771
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,960
the five-minute action.

772
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,960
As long as the other party opens,

773
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,960
we'll all go in.

774
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,960
Who?

775
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,960
Jin Jin.

776
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,960
Why are you turning off your phone?

777
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,960
Why are you so anxious?

778
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,960
Hurry up.

779
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,960
Go home with your mother.

780
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,960
I'm not going home.

781
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,960
I'm not going home.

782
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,960
Let's wear our shoes.

783
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,960
Listen to me.

784
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,960
Listen to me.

785
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,960
Go home with your mother.

786
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,960
I'm not going home.

787
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,960
Why not?

788
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,960
I just don't want to go home.

789
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,960
Why don't you go home?

790
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,960
You're like your father.

791
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,960
You're forcing me to go home.

792
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,960
I just don't want to go home.

793
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,960
I hate you.

794
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,960
What are you doing?

795
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,960
Go home with your mother.

796
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,960
Don't fall.

797
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,960
I'm telling you.

798
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,960
My daughter will come to your house.

799
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,960
You can't leave her.

800
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,960
She's coming.

801
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,960
You have to inform me at the first time.

802
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,960
Why are you talking like that?

803
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,960
I didn't let your daughter

804
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,960
come to our house.

805
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,960
Do you know how anxious I am?

806
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,960
You have to promise me.

807
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,960
You have to tell me.

808
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,960
My daughter.

809
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,960
My daughter.

810
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,960
My daughter ran away.

811
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,960
Master, I'll go after her.

812
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,960
Be careful.

813
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,960
If you don't promise me, I'll tell you.

814
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,960
You can't take care of your daughter.

815
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,960
You can't take care of others.

816
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,960
Why do you want me to take care of my daughter?

817
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,960
Xia Jie.

818
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,960
You go there.

819
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,960
I'll go there.

820
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,960
Xia Jie.

821
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,960
I'm here.

822
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,960
Open the door.

823
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,960
Wait a minute.

824
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,960
Master.

825
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,960
You are here.

826
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,960
You are a new friend.

827
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,960
Yes.

828
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,960
Come, boss.

829
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,960
Please go inside.

830
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,960
OK.

831
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,960
Stop running.

832
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,960
Don't run.

833
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,960
Don't run.

834
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,960
Stop.

835
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,960
Stop.

836
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,960
Don't run.

837
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,960
Don't run.

838
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,960
Stop running.

839
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,960
Stop.

840
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,960
Stop.

841
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,960
Stop.

842
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,960
Stop.

843
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:52,480
regardless of its condition,

844
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,280

845
00:28:55,280 --> 00:29:06,260
will search for most of the total

846
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,260
Go out!

847
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,260
It's okay, go out!

848
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,260
Take away the evidence!

849
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,260
Put it down!

850
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,260
Put it down!

851
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,260
Put it down inside!

852
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,260
Take it out!

853
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,260
Go out!

854
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,260
Go out!

855
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,260
Go out!

856
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,260
Go out!

857
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,260
Go out!

858
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,260
Take a look inside!

859
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,260
Take a look inside!

860
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,260
Don't run!

861
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,260
The next caught him

862
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,260
Who did you turn to?

863
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,260
Who did you turn to?

864
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,260
Who did turn to?

865
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,260
You, come inside!

866
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,260
Take the evidence!

867
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:29,260
Take the evidence!

868
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,260
Open it!

869
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,260
Come on, hold on!

870
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,260
Don't move!

871
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,260
Don't move!

872
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,260
Go, go, go!

873
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:37,900
Come on, you can do it.

874
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,820
This strategy, master.

875
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,580
I've never seen such strong people like them.

876
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,580
Everybody stop.

877
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,460
Angle is broken.

878
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,580
Angle is broken.

879
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,300

880
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,260

I'm sorry.

882
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,020
I'm sorry.

883
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:05,740
I'm sorry.

884
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,500
I'm sorry.

885
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,260
I'm sorry.

886
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:07,900
I'm sorry.

887
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,580
I'm sorry.

888
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,420
I'm sorry.

889
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,140
I'm sorry.

890
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:10,780
I'm sorry.

891
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:11,700
I'm sorry.

892
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,220
Why are you here?

893
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,780
You're a fool, aren't you?

894
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,180
Are you human?

895
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,180
David, listen to me.

896
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,060
What's wrong?

897
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:19,660
What's wrong?

898
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,460
David.

899
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,300
David.

900
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,220
David.

901
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,060
What's wrong?

902
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,540
Who am I to know?

903
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,460
Call the police.

904
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,380
Get off.

905
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,020
David.

906
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,300
David.

907
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,300

Solace.

915
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,140
Who told you to bring my mom to see me?

916
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,140
Sorry, Jingjing.

917
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,140
We're police.

918
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:38,140
Your mom asked us to see you.

919
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,140
We can't not see you.

920
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,140
Now I don't even have a friend.

921
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,140
Are you satisfied?

922
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,140
You're all bad guys.

Jingjing.

924
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,140
Jingjing.

925
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,140
Don't run.

926
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,140
Where are you going?

927
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,140
You can't let me see you.

928
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,140
I'm going to beat you up.

929
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,140
I'm going to beat you up.

930
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,140
I'm going to beat you up.

931
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,140
I'm going to beat you up.

932
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,140
I'm going to beat you up.

933
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,140
Dr. Wu.

934
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,140
Dr. Wu.

935
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,140
Don't be angry.

936
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,140
Get away from me.

937
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,140
I'm teaching my daughter.

938
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,140
It's none of your business.

939
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,140
Don't be angry, Dr. Wu.

940
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,140
Don't be angry with your child.

941
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,140
You're not going to let me do it.

942
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,140
Don't.

943
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,140
Don't get angry.

944
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,140
Don't.

945
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,140
I'm going to beat you up.

946
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,140
I'm going to beat you up.

947
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,140
Are you a police officer?

948
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,140
I'm not a police officer.

949
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,140
This is an accident.

950
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,140
But you

951
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,140
have broken my daughter's feelings

952
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,140
several times.

953
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,140
I'm going to sue you tomorrow.

954
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,140
Let's go.

955
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,140
How many times have I told you?

956
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:53,140
That's a lie.

957
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,140
I'm not a police officer.

958
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,140
That's a lie.

959
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,140
You didn't listen.

960
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,140
Now what?

961
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:01,140
You're here to catch me?

962
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,140
No.

963
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:05,140
He said he was going to beat me up.

964
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:07,140
How could he?

965
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,140
Beat you up?

966
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:13,140
You know how to beat me up?

967
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:16,140
We're like weaklings.

968
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,140
We trust him once and for once.

969
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,140
We have hope for him.

970
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,140
But

971
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,140
we're disappointed.

972
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,140
Listen to me.

973
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,140
From now on,

974
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:27,140
don't be a gossip with this person.

975
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,140
Then...

976
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,140
If he's been arrested,

977
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,140
will it affect you?

978
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,140
Of course.

979
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,140
What should we do?

980
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:44,140
You're so easy to be a police officer.

981
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,140
What should we do?

982
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,140
What can we do?

983
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,140
We'll die tomorrow.

984
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,140
I doubt if I'm

985
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:53,140
going to be a cop.

986
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:56,140
Do you think I'm not a cop?

987
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,140
Okay.

988
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,140
Don't talk to me.

989
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,140
I heard it all.

990
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,140
You thought...

991
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,140
You're a cop?

992
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,140
No.

993
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,140
No? What are you doing here?

994
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,140
I'm here to see you.

995
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:48,140
I'm here to see you.

996
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,140
I'm not going to eat.

997
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,140
You're not going to eat?

998
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,140
I'm going to sit here.

999
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,140
You look worse than me.

1000
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,140
What's wrong with you?

1001
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,140
Nothing. It's an accident.

1002
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,140
What's an accident?

1003
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:19,140
Who bullied you? Who did it?

1004
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,140
Tell me.

1005
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,140
Brother Chi.

1006
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,140
I'll sit here.

1007
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,140
I'm sorry.

1008
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,140
I'm sorry.

1009
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,140
I'm sorry.

1010
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,140
Police officer, I'm wronged.

1011
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,140
I'm not playing. I'm just going to see.

1012
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,140
This way.

1013
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,140
Sit down.

1014
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,140
Ding.

1015
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:37,140
Ding.

1016
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:39,140
This person is now in the management department.

1017
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,140
He's done the basic investigation.

1018
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:43,140
Don't let anyone else be in the police.

1019
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,140
I'll take care of it after I'm done.

1020
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,140
Okay.

1021
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,140
What's wrong?

1022
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,140
I'm scared to death.

1023
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,140
What's wrong, boss?

1024
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,140
I was with Sister Chi.

1025
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,140
They caught him.

1026
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,140
They went to get a knife.

1027
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,140
I know.

1028
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:13,140
I was just about to ask a question.

1029
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,140
I thought this person was familiar.

1030
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,140
I remember.

1031
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,140
The video we watched last time.

1032
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,140
Li Dawei's man who was on the street.

1033
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,140
Isn't that Li Dawei?

1034
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,140
No.

1035
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,140
It means that Li Dawei's real father

1036
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,140
was in the scene of the death of the victim.

1037
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,140
What's wrong?

1038
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,140
Come here.

1039
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,140
They caught him.

1040
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,140
What's the use of the police?

1041
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,140
Everyone knows it.

1042
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,140
What's the situation?

1043
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,140
I don't know.

1044
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,140
He said...

1045
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:46,140
He said he was innocent.

1046
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,140
That means...

1047
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,140
Just go and see.

1048
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,140
Just go and see.

1049
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:52,140
He took the victim as a cinema.

1050
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:54,140
He bought a ticket and went in to see it.

1051
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,140
You're a good boy.

1052
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:59,140
How can you be so stupid?

1053
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,140
Chief Han.

1054
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:03,140
Do you think this

1055
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:05,140
affects the child's reputation?

1056
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:08,140
It's a direct case.

1057
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:10,140
If it's at the right time,

1058
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,140
Li Dawei will be scared to death.

1059
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:13,140
The police will be at fault.

1060
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:17,140
The problem is not small.

1061
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:19,140
If his father is the organization,

1062
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:22,140
the child's future will be destroyed.

1063
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:25,140
How can you be so stupid?

1064
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:27,140
You don't know what your son is doing.

1065
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,140
You're making trouble.

1066
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,140
Did the child's future be destroyed?

1067
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:33,140
Well...

1068
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:38,140
Li Dawei didn't tell me anything.

1069
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:40,140
But I know that

1070
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:43,140
his father is a good man.

1071
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:45,140
He never cares about his son.

1072
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:47,140
His mother is a good man.

1073
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:50,140
She raised Li Dawei by herself.

1074
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:54,140
She's been a father to him

1075
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:56,140
since she was little.

1076
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,140
He's a tough boy.

1077
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:05,140
He's grown up in such a family.

1078
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:07,140
He can live like this.

1079
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:09,140
He's a good man.

1080
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:11,140
I thought

1081
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:14,140
he was a happy family.

1082
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:16,140
He was happy and happy.

1083
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:23,140
You mean he's a good man?

1084
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,140
Yes.

1085
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:26,140
Xingcheng, you're praising him.

1086
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:30,140
Chief Su, it's a good thing.

1087
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:32,140
I'm just asking for the right time.

1088
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,140
You're a good boy.

1089
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:42,140
Why do you think I'm a good man?

1090
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,140
Chief Su,

1091
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:48,140
you're so mean.

1092
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,140
You're not scared of him.

1093
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,140
Am I a bad man?

1094
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:53,140
Yes, I'm not scared of him.

1095
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:56,140
You should call the results.

1096
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:58,140
I want to know the details.

1097
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,140
Okay.

1098
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,140
Chief Su.

1099
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,140
Thank you.

1100
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,140
Thank you.

1101
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,140
Let's go.

1102
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:43,140
Why do you buy so many ice-creams?

1103
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:48,140
I like ice-creams when I'm not feeling well.

1104
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:51,140
I'm feeling better

1105
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:53,140
after I've had a cold.

1106
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:55,140
I'm ready to go.

1107
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,140
Didn't you say

1108
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:58,140
you can't eat cold food?

1109
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:00,140
You seem to understand.

1110
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:03,140
Please take care of yourself.

1111
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,140
Don't be afraid.

1112
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:08,140
You should eat one.

1113
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:10,140
I'll talk to you about the house.

1114
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:32,140
I've lost my mind.

1115
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:36,140
I've lost my life.

1116
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:39,140
I've lost my father

1117
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:41,140
for the past four years.

1118
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:46,140
I've never thought

1119
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,140
that I'd be in my first life.

1120
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,140
I've never thought

1121
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:53,140
that I'd be in my first life.

1122
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,140
I've never thought

1123
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:58,140
that I'd be in my first life.

1124
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:01,140
I've grown up.

1125
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:03,140
I don't need him anymore.

1126
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,140
I've come back

1127
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:07,140
in this way.

1128
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:17,140
Can you help me check one more?

1129
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:32,140
I'm not like you.

1130
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:40,140
I hope my father can come back.

1131
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:47,140
I just want

1132
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:50,140
to be with you

1133
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:52,140
for a long time.

1134
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,140
I just want

1135
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:00,140
to see him again.

1136
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:03,140
I want to say something to him.

1137
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:07,140
Dad,

1138
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:11,140
I miss you.

1139
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:29,140
I miss you.

1140
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:01,140
I'm chasing after the moon.

1141
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:06,140
I'm trying to escape.

1142
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:10,140
I'm hugging you.

1143
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:20,140
I've always wanted to be with you.

1144
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:29,140
I want to be with you.

1145
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:37,140
I've longed for you.

1146
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:43,140
I've longed for you.

1147
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:46,140
I've longed for you.

1148
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:50,140
I've longed for you.

1149
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:53,140
