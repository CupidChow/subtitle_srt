1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:51,800
am

5
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,800
I can't say anything else.

6
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,800
The top five best guests of the Martial Arts Club

7
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,800
will be here to remind you of the exciting news.

8
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,800
You guys, get ready.

9
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,800
He might be here in a few days.

10
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,800
But he will soon enter deep into the coma.

11
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,800
I don't think he will feel pain.

12
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,800
I'm sorry.

13
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,800
Taipei.

14
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,800
How are you?

15
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,800
Master.

16
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,800
I've never thought I would have a father.

17
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,800
But I finally feel that I have one.

18
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,800
I'm going to lose him.

19
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,800
I'm looking for your father.

20
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,800
I'm just good at anything.

21
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,800
I'm going to lose him.

22
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,800
Taipei.

23
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,800
Weiwei.

24
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,800
Are you okay?

25
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,800
My mother really has a son like you.

26
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,800
She must be even more mature than she is now.

27
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,800
Uncle Han Yang.

28
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,800
Thank you.

29
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,800
What did you say?

30
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,800
Uncle, don't sit there.

31
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,800
Give me some space.

32
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,800
Hurry up.

33
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,800
Give me some space.

34
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,800
Okay, don't be so anxious.

35
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,800
You're the only one who's afraid.

36
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,800
I'm afraid.

37
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,800
Okay, Uncle Han.

38
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,800
I'm sorry.

39
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,800
Uncle Han Yang.

40
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,800
Don't worry.

41
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,800
I'm fine.

42
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,800
I'm fine.

43
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,800
Thank you.

44
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,800
Thank you.

45
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,800
I'm sorry.

46
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,800
I'm sorry.

47
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,800
Please.

48
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,800
Please.

49
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,800
Don't be so anxious.

50
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,800
Please.

51
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,800
I don't want to be bothered by anything.

52
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,800
I'm fine.

53
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,800
I'm fine.

54
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,800
I'm fine.

55
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,800
Please.

56
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,140
Let us leave first.

57
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,880
Are you tired?

58
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,880
I'm not tired.

59
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:12,880
In the past, your dad always left you alone.

60
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:18,880
When he left, so many people gave him a heart.

61
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,880
He left under everyone's care.

62
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,880
He was not lonely on the way.

63
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,880
This is so good.

64
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,880
Okay.

65
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,880
Mom.

66
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,880
Mom, I'm the only one left.

67
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,880
I'll move back and live with you.

68
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,880
No.

69
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,880
I'll go back to your place.

70
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,880
That's not good.

71
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,880
We'll be like a couple in the future.

72
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,880
No.

73
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,880
I've finished cooking your dad's food.

74
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,880
I'm busy now.

75
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,880
I still have so much to do.

76
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,880
I have to make money.

77
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,880
If I make more money,

78
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,880
I won't be afraid of being cheated.

79
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,880
I'll ask you a question.

80
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,880
Mom, I'm not here to help you make money.

81
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,880
Just say no.

82
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,880
Your dad didn't go back home.

83
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,880
Mom is used to it.

84
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,880
Life doesn't change.

85
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,880
You have to live on.

86
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,880
What a fool.

87
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,880
I'm crying.

88
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,880
In my opinion,

89
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,880
I'm afraid that Xing Chen will be dependent on you.

90
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,880
What do you mean?

91
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,880
Aunt is a strong personality.

92
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,880
She's afraid that after uncle left,

93
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,880
she'll be dependent on her son in love.

94
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,880
She'll be more and more dependent on you.

95
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,880
Will she?

96
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,880
Yes.

97
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,880
Trust me.

98
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,880
Uncle is so simple.

99
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,880
The new day has begun.

100
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,880
The new day has begun.

101
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,880
It's 3 o'clock.

102
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,880
It's 3 o'clock.

103
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,880
David.

104
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,880
Yes.

105
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,880
Give me the bread.

106
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,880
I can't stand it.

107
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,880
I'll eat half of it.

108
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,880
I'll heat it up for you.

109
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,880
I can't stand it.

110
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,880
I can't stand it.

111
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,880
Brother Cheng.

112
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,880
Brother Cheng,

113
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,880
someone just called.

114
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,880
Qiang Tian.

115
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,880
Brother David.

116
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,880
Where is he?

117
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,880
He said he was on the way to the Shunhe Street.

118
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,880
I need a female police officer.

119
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,880
I'll call Qiang Tian.

120
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,880
Tell him to wait in the dormitory.

121
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,880
We'll go out first.

122
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,880
Okay.

123
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,880
I'll go.

124
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,880
I'll go.

125
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,880
We'll go out first.

126
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,880
Okay.

127
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,880
Police!

128
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,880
Police!

129
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,880
Police!

130
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,880
What's the matter?

131
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,880
What's the matter?

132
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,880
Hello.

133
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,880
What's the matter?

134
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,880
Tell me.

135
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,880
Police!

136
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,880
You just called the police.

137
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,880
Yes, it's me.

138
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,880
I'm being robbed.

139
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,880
Don't be afraid.

140
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,880
Tell me the name.

141
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,880
What's your name?

142
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,880
Lily.

143
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,880
Tell us the full name.

144
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,880
My name is Liu Xiaoli.

145
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,880
You're safe now.

146
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,880
Tell me the name.

147
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,880
What happened?

148
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,880
I...

149
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,880
I...

150
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,880
I drank alone tonight.

151
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,880
And I was drunk.

152
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,880
I met a man.

153
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,880
He said he wanted to drive me home.

154
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,880
And he took me to his house.

155
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,880
And then he took me home.

156
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,880
Did you know him before?

157
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,880
I don't know him.

158
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,880
You don't know him?

159
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,880
Then you went to the car?

160
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,880
We had a good conversation.

161
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,880
And I got in his car when I was happy.

162
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,880
But...

163
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,880
He...

164
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,880
He wanted to do something with me.

165
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,880
I didn't agree.

166
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,880
And...

167
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,880
And...

168
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,880
He was a pervert.

169
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,880
Police officer,

170
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,880
believe me, he's really terrible.

171
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,880
I almost couldn't get out.

172
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,880
Did you take his money?

173
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,880
He...

174
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,880
He gave me 200 yuan.

175
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,880
But I swear...

176
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,880
He didn't take my money.

177
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,880
He gave me the money.

178
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,880
Police officer, believe me,

179
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,880
he's really terrible.

180
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,880
I almost couldn't get out.

181
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,880
Really.

182
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,880
Really?

183
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,880
What's this?

184
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,880
I...

185
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,880
I saw a bullet bullet in the road.

186
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,880
The police officer is going to take the money.

187
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,880
Maybe he's too much.

188
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,880
We have to report it.

189
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,880
This is a safe place.

190
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,880
We're there.

191
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,880
It's right there.

192
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,880
Don't be afraid.

193
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,880
We have the police.

194
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,880
You're the one who needs the police.

195
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,880
Let's go.

196
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,880
Police officer, open the door.

197
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,880
I'm coming.

198
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,880
I'm coming.

199
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,880
Hello, we're police officers from the police station in Paris.

200
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,880
Police officer, what's the matter?

201
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,880
Is it him?

202
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,880
Yes, it's him.

203
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,880
Sir, do you know this woman?

204
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,880
Yes, she's been walking here for a while.

205
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,880
What's her name?

206
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,880
My name is Yue.

207
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,880
Yue Wei.

208
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,880
Please show me your ID.

209
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,880
Did I do something wrong?

210
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,880
This woman is holding a wall for you.

211
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,880
We need to investigate.

212
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,880
Please cooperate.

213
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,880
Wall?

214
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,880
Why did you say that?

215
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,880
I took her back to my house.

216
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,880
I...

217
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,880
Yes, we just had a relationship.

218
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,880
But you asked me to do it.

219
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,880
She even paid 200 yuan.

220
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,880
No, Li Li, you have to pay less.

221
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,880
You can't be so bloody.

222
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,880
You mean she paid the money.

223
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,880
Can't she count as a wall?

224
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,880
If she did,

225
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,880
she would be a prostitute.

226
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,880
If she did,

227
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,880
she would be against the law of the Central People's Republic.

228
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,880
We need to investigate.

229
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,880
Please show me your ID.

230
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,880
Sir,

231
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,880
please take her back to the car.

232
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,880
Lock her up.

233
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,880
Okay.

234
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,880
Police officer.

235
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,880
Sir,

236
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,880
we really are...

237
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,880
You asked me to do it.

238
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,880
We know each other in the bar.

239
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,880
We are a bit...

240
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,880
What do you mean?

241
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,880
Think about it.

242
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,880
If a woman doesn't want to do anything,

243
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,880
what would she do with a man

244
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,880
who is working overtime at night?

245
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,880
After she is done with her work,

246
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,880
I let her sleep here.

247
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,880
She doesn't agree.

248
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,880
And I want to send her off.

249
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,880
She doesn't agree either.

250
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,880
I feel a bit guilty.

251
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,880
I took her 200 yuan.

252
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,880
I was thinking about what to do with the car.

253
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,880
But I didn't expect

254
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,880
that this woman...

255
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,880
She...

256
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,880
She would turn her face when she mentioned the money.

257
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,880
She is holding your wall.

258
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,880
We need to investigate.

259
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,880
Please go to the police station with us.

260
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,880
Okay.

261
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,880
Go.

262
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,880
I'm not afraid of anything.

263
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,880
You said that I would be a prostitute.

264
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,880
I'm afraid of anything.

265
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,880
I'm not afraid.

266
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,880
You said that I would be a prostitute.

267
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,880
I was on the street.

268
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,880
I slept in the street.

269
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,880
I was not very strict.

270
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,880
But she told me to be strong.

271
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,880
Really.

272
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,880
I didn't even touch her until I walked to the sky.

273
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,880
Okay.

274
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,880
But you have to keep your word.

275
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,880
We'll wait for you outside.

276
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,880
Okay.

277
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,880
Wait for me.

278
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,880
When you left the bar,

279
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,880
did you tell her

280
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,880
that you wanted to go to her house

281
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,880
or let her take you home?

282
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,880
She said that she would take me home.

283
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,880
I drank too much.

284
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,880
And we had a good chat at night.

285
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,880
Look at her.

286
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,880
She looks so honest.

287
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,880
And our bar is

288
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,880
only ten minutes away.

289
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,880
I remember

290
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,880
when I wanted to go home,

291
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,880
it was ten thirty.

292
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,880
It was not too late.

293
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,880
If it was too late,

294
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,880
I wouldn't dare to get in her car.

295
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,880
I've been working outside for so many years.

296
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,880
Although I'm not old,

297
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,880
I really have seen a lot of women.

298
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,880
I can see

299
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,880
what kind of women I am.

300
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,880
You were in the bar,

301
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,880
and she was taking care of me.

302
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,880
She was talking to me.

303
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,880
She was telling me

304
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,880
that she was nice to me.

305
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,880
Comrade,

306
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,880
I'm just a normal person.

307
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,880
She is like this.

308
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,880
I can't stand it.

309
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,880
I just...

310
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,880
I just took her home.

311
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,880
Who knows

312
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,880
I would get confused when I got in the car.

313
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,880
When I was in the car,

314
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,880
I was already in her house.

315
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,880
My clothes

316
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,880
were almost

317
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,880
torn apart by her.

318
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,880
I woke up for a long time.

319
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,880
I begged her to run away.

320
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,880
But she couldn't.

321
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,880
She threatened me.

322
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,880
If I dare to run away,

323
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,880
she...

324
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,880
She killed me.

325
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,880
She said

326
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,880
no one could run away

327
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,880
before me.

328
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,880
I wanted to shout.

329
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,880
She took a knife

330
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,880
and put it on my neck.

331
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,880
I had no choice.

332
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,880
I just got out of the car.

333
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,880
Then

334
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,880
Then?

335
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,880
Uncle

336
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,880
He is a pervert.

337
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,880
I can't say anything.

338
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,880
You must have seen a lot of women like him.

339
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,880
But I have seen a lot of them.

340
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,880
But she is too much.

341
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,880
You said 200 yuan is not enough.

342
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,880
You told me

343
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,880
I could add some.

344
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,880
After all,

345
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,880
we will bring her home.

346
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,880
But she...

347
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,880
She can't harm me like this.

348
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,880
Let's wait a little longer.

349
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,880
Uncle

350
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,880
How is it going?

351
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,880
It's settled.

352
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,880
You two are in the same hospital.

353
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,880
I think it's okay.

354
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,880
What about you?

355
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,880
I want to take care of her.

356
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,880
Officer Xu, I checked.

357
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,880
She is not hurt.

358
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,880
Uncle

359
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,880
I think

360
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,880
it's a good idea.

361
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,880
Later, the girl regretted

362
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,880
that she had a low amount of money.

363
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,880
She should have said something.

364
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,880
Look at the girl.

365
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,880
She is not a real girl.

366
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,880
It's a good idea.

367
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,880
The girl is going to the police station.

368
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,880
Call the police later.

369
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,880
When you hear it,

370
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,880
you should give her to them.

371
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,880
Lao Cha, I'm leaving.

372
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,880
Okay, thank you.

373
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,880
Okay.

374
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,880
Call them.

375
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,880
Okay.

376
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,880
Bye.

377
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,880
Uncle

378
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,880
I'm sorry.

379
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,880
I didn't mean to do this.

380
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,880
But I bet.

381
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,880
We will see soon.

382
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,880
This is just a car accident.

383
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,880
What are you doing?

384
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,880
Dad is in a meeting.

385
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,880
My mom is in a heart attack.

386
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,880
Xianxian, dad is back.

387
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,880
Are you hungry?

388
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,880
I bought you something delicious.

389
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,880
Jiajia

390
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,880
What are you drawing?

391
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,880
You are so sad.

392
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,880
Okay.

393
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,880
Jiajia

394
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,880
Okay.

395
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,880
Let me see what you are drawing.

396
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,880
What are you doing?

397
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,880
Jiajia

398
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,880
Jiajia

399
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,880
Jiajia

400
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,880
Jiajia

401
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,880
Baby

402
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,880
Jiajia

403
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,880
What's wrong?

404
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,880
Are you feeling unwell?

405
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,880
Are you hungry?

406
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,880
How about this?

407
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,880
After dinner, you can sleep.

408
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,880
No.

409
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,880
You can't eat.

410
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,880
Look, I bought it.

411
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,880
I will cut the cooked food yesterday.

412
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,880
We will eat together.

413
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,880
Okay, I will sit here.

414
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,880
Okay, you can lie down.

415
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,880
I will call you later.

416
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,880
Okay, come on.

417
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,880
Eat.

418
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,880
Eat.

419
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,880
Eat this chicken leg.

420
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,880
Eat.

421
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,880
Eat.

422
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,880
Dad

423
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,880
Why are you alive?

424
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,880
I am not hungry.

425
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,880
No.

426
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,880
Why are you asking this?

427
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,880
I think it's boring.

428
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,880
Why is it boring?

429
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,880
Isn't it?

430
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,880
Is it good to draw?

431
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,880
It's boring.

432
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,880
Are you tired?

433
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,880
We can't always draw.

434
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,880
We can't always draw.

435
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,880
We can't always draw.

436
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,880
We can't always draw.

437
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,880
Zhou Hong, you can go out with your friends.

438
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,880
You can play with your heart.

439
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,880
It's boring.

440
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,880
Jia Jia

441
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,880
Do you still want to go to the painting shop

442
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,880
to learn painting?

443
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,880
It's okay.

444
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,880
You go.

445
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,880
Ask people how much you earn.

446
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,880
I am happy to have enough money.

447
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,880
I don't want to.

448
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,880
Jia Jia

449
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,880
What do you think?

450
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,880
You told dad that I was about to die.

451
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,880
You can't let me guess.

452
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,880
I feel bad for you.

453
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,880
I am sorry, dad.

454
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,880
But I want to know why I am fine.

455
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,880
I just feel boring and I can't play with my spirit.

456
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,880
I am sorry.

457
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,880
Youth is boring.

458
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,880
It must be like this.

459
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,880
You should encourage him to be friends.

460
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,880
I told you.

461
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,880
I told him to go out with friends.

462
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,880
But he didn't go out.

463
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,880
I am an old man.

464
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,880
It's too hard to have a daughter with a youthful man.

465
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,880
I am done.

466
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,880
I am done.

467
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,880
Li Xiaoli

468
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,880
Why are you here?

469
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,880
What did the former manager say?

470
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,880
Uncle Shen

471
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,880
I was forced to do it.

472
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,880
Why did I sell the painting?

473
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,880
Don't cry.

474
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,880
I will call Xingting.

475
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,880
I will talk to her.

476
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,880
Uncle Shen

477
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,880
I am not lying.

478
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,880
I was forced to do it.

479
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,880
I was forced to do it.

480
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,880
I was told to sell the painting.

481
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,880
I am sorry.

482
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,880
Okay.

483
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,880
Go home.

484
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,880
I will go to you after I know the situation.

485
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,880
Li Xiaoli

486
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,880
After you go home,

487
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,880
find your work.

488
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,880
Take care of yourself.

489
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,880
Don't be a entertainment group in the group.

490
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,880
Call some friends who are lazy.

491
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,880
You are his teacher this time, right?

492
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,880
I remember Uncle Shen.

493
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,880
Uncle Shen, you must help me.

494
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,880
I know everything in my home.

495
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,880
My mother doesn't let me in now.

496
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,880
How can you do that?

497
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,880
If he doesn't let you go home,

498
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,880
call Uncle Shen.

499
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,880
I will talk to him.

500
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,880
Okay, don't cry.

501
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,880
Go home.

502
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,880
Master, the police team said it was sold.

503
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,880
He said it was possible.

504
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,880
Xingting.

505
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,880
Xingting.

506
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,880
Look, this is in the bar.

507
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,880
Tell me.

508
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,880
Here, look.

509
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,880
He and this Yuewei,

510
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,880
colluded with each other,

511
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,880
talked a lot.

512
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,880
This is at the bar.

513
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,880
Look, they both walked out together.

514
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,880
He said he was drunk,

515
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,880
but he was quite stable.

516
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,880
According to the factory,

517
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,880
a girl shouldn't have

518
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,880
a stranger's car at this hour.

519
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,880
But look,

520
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,880
he can drive his own car.

521
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,880
Yuewei's door is not monitored,

522
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,880
but we found a surveillance camera near his house.

523
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,880
This is Yuewei's car.

524
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,880
Stop.

525
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,880
Put it there.

526
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,880
This is Yuewei's car.

527
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,880
He sat on the side of Yuewei's shoulder

528
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,880
while driving.

529
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,880
Is it possible?

530
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,880
Is he really drunk?

531
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,880
It's possible.

532
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,880
But judging by this,

533
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,880
Yuewei forced him.

534
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,880
It's hard to say.

535
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,880
He said Yuewei's shoulder

536
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,880
was not injured,

537
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,880
and he also took 200 yuan from him.

538
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,880
Tell me.

539
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,880
How do we determine this?

540
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,880
We also investigated this girl.

541
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,880
She graduated from junior high school,

542
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,880
but didn't go to school.

543
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,880
She didn't take the job as a regular.

544
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,880
She was blinded by society.

545
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,880
She used to have a few men in her family.

546
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,880
She also had a chance to get money from other men.

547
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,880
Captain Luo,

548
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,880
I remember this.

549
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,880
Li said that Yuewei was a pervert.

550
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,880
How did she say that?

551
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,880
She told you.

552
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,880
I told you.

553
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,880
Don't mention it.

554
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,880
For this,

555
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,880
I found several women.

556
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,880
I interrogated her several times.

557
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,880
Every time, she answered differently.

558
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,880
She was so beautiful.

559
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,880
You can have a look.

560
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,880
I guess

561
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,880
she was the one who made the decision.

562
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,880
We don't have any evidence

563
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,880
about the wall.

564
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,880
But we have evidence

565
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,880
about the silver plow.

566
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,880
Wang Chen,

567
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,880
we have no choice.

568
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,880
We can only deal with it

569
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,880
according to the silver plow.

570
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,880
Captain Luo,

571
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,880
did you investigate

572
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,880
Yuewei's history?

573
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,880
And

574
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,880
she told Liu Xiaoli

575
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,880
that she had entered the house.

576
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,880
She didn't escape.

577
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,880
What does that mean?

578
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,880
We found out

579
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,880
that Yuewei

580
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,880
used to drive a black car.

581
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,880
A single man.

582
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,880
He took his daughter home

583
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,880
to avoid

584
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,880
what he never did.

585
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,880
He escaped from her house.

586
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,880
I'm sure

587
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,880
he was a pervert.

588
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,880
Captain Luo,

589
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,880
thank you.

590
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,880
Can we

591
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,880
give you a copy of this?

592
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,880
No.

593
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,880
We just got this case.

594
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,880
We haven't got the case yet.

595
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,880
What?

596
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,880
Chen,

597
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,880
you still don't believe me?

598
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,880
I don't believe you, Captain Luo.

599
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,880
I...

600
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,880
My dad

601
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,880
thinks that this kid is pitiful.

602
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,880
How about this?

603
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,880
Let's watch it here.

604
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,880
Okay?

605
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,880
Let's watch it.

606
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,880
Thank you.

607
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,880
Captain,

608
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,880
take a look.

609
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,880
Your mind is in good shape.

610
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,880
You've seen it.

611
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,880
Remember it.

612
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,880
I really don't believe you.

613
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,880
I'm just asking you.

614
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,880
Hurry up.

615
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,880
Master,

616
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,880
you really don't believe me?

617
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,880
I don't believe you.

618
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,880
You're talking to him.

619
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,880
Captain Luo,

620
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:40,880
we're not like the police.

621
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,880
We'll never take the case to the city.

622
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,880
Got it?

623
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,880
You believe

624
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,880
that the drug is a drug,

625
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,880
not because of his beating

626
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,880
and his work.

627
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,880
But the girl who doesn't love him

628
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,880
may not be a drug.

629
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,880
He doesn't have a close relationship with anyone.

630
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,880
Got it?

631
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,880
We should

632
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,880
talk about this again.

633
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,880
Let's talk about this again.

634
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,880
Captain,

635
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,880
we must keep this matter a secret.

636
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,880
The case of Qiang Jian'an

637
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,880
is a case of the criminal.

638
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,880
They've already taken the case.

639
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,880
We shouldn't take it

640
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,880
as a case of the criminal.

641
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,880
It's like...

642
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,880
like our own interest.

643
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,880
Interest?

644
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,880
Yes.

645
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,880
That's great.

646
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,880
We should learn from Master.

647
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,880
What's the matter?

648
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,880
Fine.

649
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,880
I'll call Mr. Liu

650
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,880
and ask him to come.

651
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,880
Okay.

652
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,880
Here.

653
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,880
Let's go.

654
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,880
Thank you.

655
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,880
Xiaoli.

656
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,880
I've read

657
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,880
your statement

658
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,880
in the police station.

659
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,880
It's different

660
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,880
than what I said.

661
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,880
Come on.

662
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,880
Tell Uncle Chen

663
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,880
why you're lying to the police.

664
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,880
Uncle Chen.

665
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,880
They've been

666
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,880
asking me the same questions

667
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,880
over and over again.

668
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,880
They're just not trusting me.

669
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,880
I just want to

670
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,880
put things in a serious place

671
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,880
and attract their attention.

672
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,880
But I didn't expect

673
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,880
that the more I talk,

674
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,880
the more I can't come back.

675
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,880
I remember you said

676
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,880
that the music is very perverted.

677
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,880
From your description,

678
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,880
this person is really perverted.

679
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,880
But

680
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,880
we didn't find

681
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,880
any injuries on your body.

682
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:44,880
Uncle Chen.

683
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,880
I've been in there for a long time.

684
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,880
I found that he's perverted.

685
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,880
I once had a boyfriend

686
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,880
who was as perverted as him.

687
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,880
I know

688
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,880
that people like them

689
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,880
can't run away

690
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,880
if you want to.

691
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,880
I'll just keep on

692
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,880
following him

693
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,880
and find a chance to run away.

694
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,880
So

695
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,880
I've been trying to

696
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,880
control him and admire him.

697
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,880
And I didn't fight that much

698
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,880
so I didn't have any injuries.

699
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,880
But he's really perverted.

700
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,880
He's been

701
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,880
torturing me for three or four hours.

702
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,880
He even told me

703
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,880
that no one

704
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,880
could run away

705
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,880
because of him.

706
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,880
Since he said that,

707
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,880
he shouldn't have let you go

708
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,880
in that sense.

709
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,880
But how did he

710
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,880
let you go again?

711
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,880
He didn't let me go.

712
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,880
After the white thing,

713
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,880
he asked me to take a shower.

714
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,880
I thought

715
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,880
that time was running out.

716
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,880
So I deliberately

717
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,880
didn't go to the toilet.

718
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,880
Then

719
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,880
I took it off.

720
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,880
What's the point?

721
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,880
I often play outside

722
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,880
alone.

723
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,880
I'm afraid of getting into trouble.

724
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,880
So I set up

725
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,880
a self-propelled function

726
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,880
on my other phone

727
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,880
at home.

728
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,880
I'll use it

729
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,880
to broadcast on my phone.

730
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,880
As long as I don't go home

731
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,880
at half past two,

732
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,880
I'll answer the phone.

733
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,880
I'll hide it

734
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,880
until half past two.

735
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,880
I'll lie to him.

736
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,880
I said I had an appointment

737
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,880
with my sister.

738
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,880
I said

739
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,880
if I didn't go home

740
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,880
at all,

741
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,880
I'd let him call me.

742
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,880
If I didn't pick up,

743
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,880
he'd call the police immediately.

744
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,880
He told me to pick up.

745
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,880
I told him on the phone,

746
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,880
I said

747
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,880
I was at

748
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,880
the big brother's

749
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,880
house I met at the bar.

750
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,880
I'll be back in a while.

751
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,880
He believed me.

752
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,880
He hesitated for a while.

753
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,880
He let me go.

754
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,880
Then when I left,

755
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,880
he gave me 200 yuan.

756
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,880
I was afraid if I didn't pick up,

757
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,880
he wouldn't let me go.

758
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,880
So I picked up.

759
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,880
Xiaoli,

760
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,880
what you said just now

761
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,880
is true.

762
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,880
You can't lie to Uncle Chen.

763
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,880
Uncle Chen,

764
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,880
if I had a lie,

765
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,880
I'd beat me to death.

766
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,880
Don't be so formal.

767
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,880
But

768
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,880
the evidence now

769
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,880
is very bad for you.

770
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,880
It's hard to prove

771
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,880
these evidence.

772
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,880
But don't worry.

773
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:44,880
You must believe in law

774
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,880
and the police.

775
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,880
We won't give up on investigation.

776
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,880
We've already

777
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,880
found out the situation.

778
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,880
You go back first.

779
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,880
Okay.

780
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,880
I'll wait for you.

781
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,880
Look,

782
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,880
there's nothing wrong.

783
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,880
I'll leave it here.

784
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,880
Remember,

785
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,880
don't tell anyone

786
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,880
about what you came here for.

787
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,880
Especially him.

788
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,880
Don't tell anyone

789
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,880
about it.

790
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,880
Thank you, Uncle Chen.

791
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,880
Xiaoli,

792
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,880
you're not alone.

793
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,880
I was born in the year of my father.

794
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,880
He's not alone.

795
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,880
You really don't know

796
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,880
that you're not here anymore.

797
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,880
What do you mean?

798
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,880
Look at you.

799
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,880
You're so young,

800
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,080
I don't care about you.

801
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,600
You don't love yourself.

802
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,040
Who else can love you in this world?

803
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,360
Sometimes,

804
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,000
the evil in this world

805
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,640
is more than your imagination

806
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,360
and your self-worth.

807
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,040
After you go back,

808
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,360
work hard,

809
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,520
and work hard.

810
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,520
Let your mother's care

811
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,800
rest assured.

812
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,520
Uncle Chen,

813
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,080
since my mother passed away,

814
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,360
no one has told me

815
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,040
such a thing.

816
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,080
Thank you.

817
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,560
Okay.

818
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,120
Remember what I told you.

819
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,800
I didn't expect this girl to remember me.

820
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,120
Maybe she really saved herself.

821
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,400
Master,

822
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,080
she's right.

823
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,680
Maybe we met a pervert.

824
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,400
You need evidence?

825
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,720
Uncle Chen,

826
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,680
I really have to ask you this.

827
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,200
She said we can't listen to her.

828
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,360
Why did you choose to trust her?

829
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,280
She said

830
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,680
she and Yue Wei said they were reasonable.

831
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,760
But she kept thinking about it.

832
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,240
Yue Wei was driving a black car.

833
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,040
How much can she give?

834
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,800
She often goes to the pub.

835
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,000
And she lives in our neighborhood.

836
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,000
The car she took was in the city.

837
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,280
She even went to the whole city to the pub.

838
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:49,800
And Liu Xiaoli went to Yue Wei's house at 10.30 p.m.

839
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,480
She went to the pub at 3 p.m.

840
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,520
If you sell silver,

841
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,720
it's not a big deal.

842
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,680
Two people are free.

843
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:57,920
After all,

844
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,120
we should leave

845
00:41:59,120 --> 00:41:59,720
after we get the money.

846
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:02,120
After we get the money.

847
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,120
If we are in love,

848
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,120
we should stay.

849
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,720
Why did you leave at 3 p.m. at midnight?

850
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,120
Besides,

851
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,520
if we really sell silver,

852
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:18,920
you know,

853
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:23,120
a young girl is 200 yuan.

854
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:27,720
Is it too cheap?

855
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,320
Master,

856
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,120
when I first reported it,

857
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,120
I saw

858
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,120
that the price of the car was not enough.

859
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,520
I thought, what's the police?

860
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,920
I didn't expect you to be so good.

861
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,720
Take a picture of your butt.

862
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,720
You think you are a kid?

863
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,720
I don't know.

864
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,720
Did you not look at me well?

865
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,120
Do you think we are too old?

866
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,720
No, I'm not.

867
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,120
David.

868
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,120
There are two possibilities for this case.

869
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:09,720
One,

870
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,920
Liu Xiaoli is a liar.

871
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,320
And I'm the old cop.

872
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,320
There is one possibility.

873
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:23,920
We just met

874
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,920
a criminal who is against a machine.

875
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,320
The wind is blowing

876
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:55,320
in the hands of the warm-hearted.

877
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,320
The wind is blowing

878
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:05,320
in the hands of the warm-hearted.

879
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,320
The wind is blowing

880
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,320
in the hands of the warm-hearted.

881
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,320
The wind is blowing

882
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:29,320
in the hands of the warm-hearted.

883
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:37,320
The wind is blowing

884
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:45,320
in the hands of the warm-hearted.

885
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:49,320
The wind is blowing

886
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:59,320
in the hands of the warm-hearted.

887
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:02,320
The wind is blowing

888
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:14,720
in the hands of the warm-hearted.

889
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:20,260
ohh

890
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:25,340
buis-a-binn

891
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:30,200
buis-a-binn

892
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,220
body

893
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:40,640
my daaay

894
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:45,240
i

895
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:53,060
Don't turn to you
