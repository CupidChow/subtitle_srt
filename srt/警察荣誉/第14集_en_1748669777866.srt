1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I

6
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,740
Come, come.

7
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,160
Tanye, in the past days, my mom used to live with you.

8
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,160
Give her the Constitution.

9
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,300
Who is he?

10
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:48,080
Your mom is the youngest eldest of the الت and brothers in the family.

11
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,420
I've grown up a bit older than her.

12
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,700
She grew up in my stennis.

13
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,380
Our families love her a lot.

14
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,380
You're lazy, Master.

15
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:01,380
What's most worried is your mom.

16
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,380
When your mom married your dad,

17
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,880
my family gave you a breath of fresh air.

18
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:10,380
They all thought you could find someone reliable.

19
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,880
But where did you think of that?

20
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,880
We won't talk about the past anymore.

21
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,380
I've grown up now, right?

22
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:20,380
Yes, you're right.

23
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:24,380
Look at how outstanding you are now.

24
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,880
Thank you.

25
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,880
Xiao Jie, I agreed to let you come.

26
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,880
I just wanted to discuss your mom's matter with you.

27
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,880
Your dad was not a good boy before.

28
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,380
He's called Liang Wei.

29
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,380
You know that, right?

30
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:50,880
Uncle Liang is my dad's disciple.

31
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,880
They've been in a good relationship.

32
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:59,380
He's also been to Qingdao this time.

33
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:06,380
I think they're happy together.

34
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,380
It's a bit interesting.

35
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,380
I asked him about it.

36
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,380
Mr. Liang has already divorced his wife.

37
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,880
What about the child?

38
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,880
What do you think of this?

39
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,380
Uncle Liang has always been nice to my mom.

40
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,380
As long as my mom is willing to do this, I won't mind.

41
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,380
I'll take care of her alone.

42
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:34,380
Good boy, thank you.

43
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,380
Look, your power line is from the second floor to here.

44
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,380
It's very dangerous to use it like this.

45
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,380
Do you know that?

46
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:46,380
You didn't notice our delay in the car.

47
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,880
The car was in a mess.

48
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,880
I'll tell you one more thing.

49
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,880
It's the same as the second floor.

50
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,880
We'll charge the electric car from the second floor.

51
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,880
We'll steal the car.

52
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,880
We'll give it to the electrician.

53
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,880
We'll have to bear the responsibility of the owner.

54
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,880
Do you think he's wrong?

55
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,880
Yes, he is.

56
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,880
It's dangerous.

57
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,880
If we want to give the child or the pet to the electrician

58
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,880
or to send a fire,

59
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,880
we can't eat it.

60
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,380
And the fire is also a rule in our country.

61
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,380
Because of the fire,

62
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,380
we can't make a crime.

63
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,380
We have to pay more than 10 days for the fire.

64
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,380
And we have to pay 500 yuan.

65
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,380
We don't know how much.

66
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,380
Every time we come here, we have to pay 500 yuan.

67
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,380
What's the use?

68
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,380
It seems that he's the owner.

69
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,380
He's the owner.

70
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,380
You can help us.

71
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,380
I have to say that our memory is very good.

72
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,880
We really care about this matter.

73
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,880
We just hope that we can give the police some more time.

74
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,880
We lost one car yesterday, and another today.

75
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,880
If the police are watching over us,

76
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,880
we can't lose the car.

77
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,880
Sorry, sorry.

78
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,880
It's mainly because yesterday,

79
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,880
we lost a car.

80
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,880
We lost the electric car.

81
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,880
We have no money.

82
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,880
You can't say that.

83
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,880
We'll go there first.

84
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,880
I lost the car.

85
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,380
If you have a special friend to take care of you,

86
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,380
you can leave.

87
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,380
I think the police are all service to the women.

88
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,380
How can we leave?

89
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,380
Leave, give me the car.

90
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,380
What are you talking about?

91
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,380
Why are you talking about me?

92
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,380
Listen to me.

93
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,380
Leave, why can't we leave?

94
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,380
If we don't, we can drive over.

95
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,380
Don't worry.

96
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,380
We'll be safe.

97
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,380
The police have to do something small.

98
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,880
There's a college in this small thing.

99
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,880
Master, we haven't done anything big.

100
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,880
We thought we could run.

101
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,880
What are you looking at?

102
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,880
Look, there are many wounds on this person's body.

103
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,880
Where are they?

104
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,880
They're all on the back of their stomach.

105
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,880
Alright, don't keep an eye on them.

106
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,380
Master, there are so many wounds on this person's body.

107
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,380
There are so many wounds.

108
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,380
Maybe it's because Xiao Chong has them.

109
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,380
I just made sure that they're patient.

110
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,380
If they don't listen to me,

111
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,380
they won't be able to run.

112
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,380
No, Master.

113
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,380
I'm not being unfair to you.

114
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,380
Thank you.

115
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,380
Don't make me do this.

116
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,380
I'm not being unfair.

117
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,380
Master, we have to leave.

118
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,380
Drive.

119
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,880
We'll definitely work hard.

120
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,880
We'll do our best.

121
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,880
You understand?

122
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,880
No.

123
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,880
Master, we're here.

124
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,880
We're here.

125
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,880
We're here.

126
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,880
We're here.

127
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,880
We're here.

128
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,880
We're here.

129
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,880
We're here.

130
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,880
We're here.

131
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,880
We're here.

132
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,380
Captain Liu,

133
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,380
let me tell you something.

134
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,380
Last time, I reminded you

135
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,380
that the district must be under surveillance.

136
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:24,380
You're not even going to pretend until now.

137
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,380
Look.

138
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,380
The storage room is outside the residential building.

139
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,380
If this happens, it'll be bad.

140
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,380
No, Brother.

141
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,380
I don't want to go up there.

142
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,380
I have to pay for it.

143
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,380
We don't have money.

144
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:42,380
You know very well about our district.

145
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,880
If you want to live in a city like this,

146
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,880
I don't pay any of you for your business.

147
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,880
If you don't pay me, what can I get for you?

148
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,880
I'll explain to them all.

149
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,880
They'll say that

150
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,880
the police can't even get on the bus.

151
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,880
That's not true.

152
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,880
It's more convenient to have a camera.

153
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,880
How about this?

154
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,880
I'll design for you.

155
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,880
We'll compete

156
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,880
to make the smallest cost

157
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,880
for the future.

158
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,380
Look, there are a few roads outside.

159
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,380
You don't have to worry.

160
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,380
There's only one road here.

161
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,380
You can monitor the two roads.

162
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,380
Right?

163
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,380
I'll get you some water.

164
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,380
I'll get you some water.

165
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,380
Thank you.

166
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,880
Master,

167
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,880
did we really do this?

168
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,880
Qi Wei,

169
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,880
we've been pursuing the theft case

170
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,880
and we have a new phone.

171
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,880
Go to the phone shop and see what's the clue.

172
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,880
Look at your phone.

173
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,880
I've already sent you the address

174
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,880
and contact information

175
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,880
of the phone shops in the district.

176
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,880
I've already sent you the address

177
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,880
and contact information of the phone shops in the district.

178
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,880
I've already sent you the address

179
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,380
and the contact information of the phone shops in the district.

180
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,380
I've already sent you the address

181
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,380
and contact information of the phone shops in the district.

182
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,880
Then don't be el 대Kevin.

183
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,380
Can we save money?

184
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,380
Wait here.

185
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,380
Hello?

186
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,380
Hello?

187
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,880
Hello,

188
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,880
sweet baby.

189
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,880
Hello,

190
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,680
I want evidence.

191
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,280
What evidence?

192
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,880
Because there's no evidence,

193
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,680
so I have to collect the fingerprints.

194
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,080
Three hours have passed.

195
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,880
But there are so many people coming and going.

196
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,480
Where do you find the fingerprints?

197
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,680
Open the door.

198
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,480
Jia Jia.

199
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,280
Yes.

200
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,480
Jia Jia.

201
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,480
Don't run.

202
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,080
Jia Jia.

203
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,480
Jia Jia.

204
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,080
Jia Jia.

205
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,080
Jia Jia.

206
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,080
Jia Jia.

207
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,680
Where's the girl?

208
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,080
Let's go.

209
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,480
Hello, sir.

210
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,480
There's no clue about the phone shop.

211
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,280
It's okay.

212
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,480
Let's go back first.

213
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,080
Okay, sir.

214
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,480
This is the place.

215
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,080
I told you just now.

216
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,680
This is the place.

217
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,480
People usually stay two streets.

218
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:12,880
Right?

219
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,480
Yes.

220
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,280
By the way,

221
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,880
I have something to ask you.

222
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:20,080
Do you have several youth groups of people here?

223
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,880
There are seven people.

224
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,080
Three are over 20 years old.

225
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,880
Two are over 30 years old.

226
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,880
And two should be over 40 years old.

227
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,680
No.

228
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,280
You know, our neighborhood is too dirty.

229
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,280
You asked me, I really can't remember.

230
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,480
It's okay.

231
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,080
You should help me pay attention.

232
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,480
Okay.

233
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,280
They should be on the streets for a long time.

234
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,480
They should come back in the morning and night.

235
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,880
In your neighborhood,

236
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,880
it should be quite idle.

237
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,880
Isn't it the same house on the fifth floor?

238
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,880
Really?

239
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,880
Where?

240
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,880
It's on the fifth floor.

241
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,080
Then it's been about three months.

242
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,080
Seven people rent a house.

243
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,080
They also rent two cars.

244
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,280
As I told you,

245
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,480
they should come back in the morning and night.

246
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,080
We don't know what they are going to do.

247
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,480
Take me there.

248
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,480
This way.

249
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,680
It's on the fifth floor.

250
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,480
Usually, the car stops here.

251
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,480
But now, they are not here.

252
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,080
Good job, boy.

253
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,280
You are a good person.

254
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,880
What kind of graduation are you?

255
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,480
I'm not a good student.

256
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,080
Next time, when we take you to the police,

257
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,880
you can come and try.

258
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,680
Captain Liu,

259
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,880
look at this place.

260
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,680
I don't know.

261
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,680
It's all surveillance.

262
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,680
Master.

263
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,080
I'm back.

264
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,880
Why are you here?

265
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,680
We want to go to you.

266
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,280
Look, Captain Liu.

267
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,880
I'm talking about that.

268
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,880
The pole is on the head.

269
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,080
I can't see clearly on this road.

270
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,880
Right.

271
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,280
If we calculate it,

272
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,880
you can put five cameras in the community.

273
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,080
Then, you can cover the whole community.

274
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,280
And you can't spend much money.

275
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,680
It's not more than 24 hours of patrol.

276
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,080
Right?

277
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,880
Go and talk to the police.

278
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,280
Okay?

279
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,480
If you can't talk, come to me.

280
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,280
Okay.

281
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,280
I'll talk to them.

282
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,480
Okay.

283
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,280
Let's talk.

284
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,080
Let's go.

285
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,280
Let's go and see

286
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,080
how the situation of the four-wheel drive is going.

287
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,080
Master.

288
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,280
The phone case is not found yet.

289
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,880
That guy went to the line.

290
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,080
He caught him?

291
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,880
No.

292
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,880
But quickly.

293
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,280
I knew it.

294
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,080
He must be in a hurry to go out.

295
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,880
I called the police around here.

296
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,480
The line called me.

297
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,680
They said that a new phone case

298
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:42,480
was reported by a new owner.

299
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,880
He said

300
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,280
he was going to check

301
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,680
if the water goods were in the case.

302
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,880
If it wasn't for the water goods,

303
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,080
we would have taken him to the police.

304
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,280
We would have dragged him away.

305
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,480
I think that guy

306
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,680
would be there tomorrow morning.

307
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,480
He went there.

308
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,680
The locals in the line

309
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,680
could have taken him away.

310
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,880
Master.

311
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,080
Why did they let us catch our case?

312
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,280
He went to the line

313
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,280
and let the line catch him.

314
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,080
This neighborhood.

315
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,480
It's too easy to get involved

316
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,680
in the mess.

317
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,480
Look.

318
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,880
There are so many cars charging here.

319
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,480
It's hard to solve the charging device.

320
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,880
Master.

321
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,880
I've been following this case.

322
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,080
Can you call the police

323
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,480
and ask me to go there?

324
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,080
If I don't catch him,

325
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,880
can I catch him myself?

326
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,080
It's a little thief.

327
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,080
Forget it.

328
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:32,880
Master.

329
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,080
Let me go and have a look.

330
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,080
After all, I've been in the police.

331
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,480
I've never been in a case like this.

332
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,880
Fine.

333
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,480
Ask me first.

334
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,480
If you really want to go,

335
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,080
remember to do less.

336
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,480
Do less?

337
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,080
Yes.

338
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,480
If you don't know the situation,

339
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,480
don't talk.

340
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,480
Don't make any decisions.

341
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,880
Let's go.

342
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,480
Don't say that.

343
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,880
I've already called the chief.

344
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,280
It's not easy to get a job.

345
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,480
No.

346
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,680
Chief.

347
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,480
This is Comrade Barley He.

348
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,280
Chief.

349
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,280
I'm Zhao Junwei.

350
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:15,480
I'm a spy at Barley He's police station.

351
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,480
You're a spy at Barley He's police station?

352
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,080
Young man.

353
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,080
You're a very good worker.

354
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,080
Do you want to do all the work

355
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,080
we're doing?

356
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,080
No.

357
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,080
I'm a student at Barley He's police station.

358
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:32,080
You can take Barley He with you later.

359
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,680
You can't do this.

360
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,280
Do you have any clothes here?

361
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,080
I don't have any.

362
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,480
Call him first.

363
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,480
You'll have experience when you get into the police station.

364
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,080
Okay. Go.

365
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,480
Let's go.

366
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,480
Hello.

367
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,880
Hello. I'm Zhao Junwei.

368
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,680
Please follow me.

369
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,880
Okay. Get in the car.

370
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,480
Change your clothes.

371
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,480
Don't be sad.

372
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,480
I'll take care of him.

373
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,480
Master.

374
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,480
You're so old.

375
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,480
I'm old.

376
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,480
Brother.

377
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,480
Why are you here?

378
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,480
Are you not coming?

379
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,480
I'm in a hurry.

380
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,480
I'll never come.

381
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,480
Watch the sign.

382
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,480
It's a sign.

383
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,480
Boss.

384
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,480
I'll take a look at the green one.

385
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,480
Here.

386
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,480
This is green.

387
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,480
Yes.

388
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,480
Here.

389
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,480
Here.

390
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,480
You're here?

391
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,200
Okay.

392
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,000
Who's that?

393
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,360
Don't worry.

394
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,440
The battery is 5 years old.

395
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,720
How is it?

396
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,200
It's good.

397
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,040
It's a good product.

398
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,920
And the wine is good.

399
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,640
How is it?

400
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:33,760
Okay.

401
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,000
One hand is paid, one hand is paid.

402
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,400
The cash is still in the phone.

403
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,080
Cash?

404
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,000
Okay.

405
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,920
Why didn't you catch him?

406
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,400
I was just checking the card.

407
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,800
Good card.

408
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,600
He...

409
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,480
He ran away with the money.

410
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,000
What's going on?

411
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,160
What's going on?

412
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,360
Why did he leave?

413
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,040
Don't talk to me.

414
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,600
Brother.

415
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,000
Brother.

416
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,480
Why didn't you catch him?

417
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,320
Oh my god.

418
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,200
He ran away with the money.

419
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:37,680
Don't talk to me.

420
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,120
Go.

421
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,120
Stop, Police!

422
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:46,360
Hey!

423
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:46,760
Stop there!

424
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:47,880
Police!

425
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,520
No way in.

426
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,680
psychologically...

427
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,000
Stop!

428
00:19:59,080 --> 00:19:59,840
Get me out.

429
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,360
Help,

430
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,640
so I can run.

431
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,680
Get up!

432
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,440
Hello?

433
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,840
Hello?

434
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,240
Why did he leave?

435
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,240
We're broke.

436
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,240
I'll go and find him.

437
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,240
Be careful.

438
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,240
Hello, master. He's caught.

439
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,240
I'll catch him myself, master.

440
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,240
Run! I told you to run!

441
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,240
Brother, you're injured!

442
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,240
It's okay. We've broken three bottles.

443
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,240
You two, take him back.

444
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,240
Yes.

445
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,240
Hurry up.

446
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,240
Brother, how's the wound?

447
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,240
It's okay.

448
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,240
It's okay.

449
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,240
It's not too deep.

450
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,240
Let's go.

451
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,240
We'll take him there.

452
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,240
Let's go.

453
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,240
It's okay.

454
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,240
Just a simple bag.

455
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,240
Brother, where's that little rabbit?

456
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,240
Where did he come from?

457
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,240
I caught him.

458
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,240
That one.

459
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,240
You can only prove that he sold a phone

460
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,240
that doesn't belong to him.

461
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,240
How do you prove that the phone was stolen?

462
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,240
That's not him.

463
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,240
It's not him.

464
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,240
Where did he come from?

465
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,240
He was picked up.

466
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,240
We agreed to follow him to the place.

467
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,240
Why did you take him out?

468
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,240
I didn't.

469
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,240
He ran away.

470
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,240
If you don't catch him, he can run away.

471
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,240
I'm sorry.

472
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,240
Li.

473
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,240
Brother.

474
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,240
Find a friend.

475
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,240
Send these guys back to the bar.

476
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,240
Brother, it's not just me.

477
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,240
And that criminal.

478
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,240
I'm sorry, brother.

479
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,240
It's all my fault.

480
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,240
Okay.

481
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,240
Brother,

482
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,240
we're the ones who started this case.

483
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,240
We're the ones who started it.

484
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,240
I'm the one who did the work.

485
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,240
I'm the one who did it.

486
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,240
I have to take him back today.

487
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,240
Zhao is back.

488
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,240
What's wrong?

489
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,240
Are you hurt?

490
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,240
Are you okay?

491
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,240
I'm fine.

492
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,240
I just broke the window.

493
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,240
Chief.

494
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,240
Didn't we agree to follow him?

495
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,240
We're the ones who caught him.

496
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,240
Besides, I'm the one who did it.

497
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,240
Okay.

498
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:11,240
Let's give this time a chance to the comrades in the bar.

499
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,240
Okay.

500
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,240
It's not a yes.

501
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,240
I'm really sorry.

502
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,240
Chief.

503
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,240
Send him back with the criminal.

504
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,240
The criminal said he was not feeling well.

505
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,240
He just went to the hospital.

506
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,240
He's gone.

507
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,240
Let's wait for his check-up.

508
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,240
Okay.

509
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,240
Turn right.

510
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,240
Turn right.

511
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,240
Okay.

512
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,240
Right in front.

513
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,240
Okay.

514
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,240
Why is there no one?

515
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,240
What's wrong?

516
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,240
You're still in the team?

517
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,240
When they caught the criminal last time,

518
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,240
our chief and the staff were all in the group.

519
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,240
Where should we stop?

520
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,240
Over there.

521
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,240
Okay.

522
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,240
Okay.

523
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,240
Over there.

524
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,240
Okay.

525
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,240
Here.

526
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,240
What are you doing?

527
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,240
You scared me.

528
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,240
You're also in charge of the electric car?

529
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,240
You're also in charge of it?

530
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,240
Can we think of a way?

531
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,240
Don't always hold your head against the wall.

532
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,240
I'm thinking about it.

533
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,240
It's actually very simple.

534
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,240
It's just one part.

535
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,240
Think about it carefully.

536
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,240
What are you thinking about?

537
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,240
Think about it.

538
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,240
We're sharing a car.

539
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,240
We're sharing a car.

540
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,240
Why can't we find it when we're in the middle of nowhere?

541
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,240
You mean

542
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,240
you're going to put this car on the electric car?

543
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,240
The problem is that

544
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,240
the GPS is all on the same page as the company's.

545
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,240
The electric car of the person

546
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,240
is going to be in trouble if it's put on the same page.

547
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,240
There's no way.

548
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,240
The electric car is on its own.

549
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,240
But it's on the same page as the company's.

550
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,240
One of my classmates at work

551
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,240
was just about to sell this car to someone.

552
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,240
They didn't even recognize the owner.

553
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,240
They could only charge the electric car

554
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,240
by themselves.

555
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,240
We can

556
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,240
make a bridge between

557
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,240
the company and the GPS

558
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,240
that charge the electric car.

559
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,240
The owner buys a charging card

560
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,240
and the electric car

561
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,240
is sent to the GPS.

562
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,240
If we really do that,

563
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,240
we'll have a lot of problems.

564
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,240
The electric car is put on the GPS

565
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,240
and the road is blocked.

566
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,240
We can solve the problem of charging the electric car.

567
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,240
But the problem is

568
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,240
the company is not willing to do it.

569
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,240
It's definitely willing to do it.

570
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,240
My classmates can't complete the GPS

571
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,240
the whole day.

572
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,240
They're almost out of control.

573
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,240
Uncle,

574
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,240
you're still in the trouble.

575
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,240
The electric car is not bad.

576
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,240
That's right.

577
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,240
The bridge is connected

578
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,240
with the mutual bridge.

579
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,240
Well,

580
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,240
this is your case.

581
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,240
Go and discuss with your master.

582
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,240
I'll call my classmates.

583
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,240
Okay.

584
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,240
I'll take a call.

585
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,240
Hello, mom.

586
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,240
I can't go back.

587
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,240
I've told you before.

588
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,240
I've been very busy recently.

589
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,240
I've been busy with several cases.

590
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,240
I can't go back.

591
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,240
I'm working now.

592
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,240
I won't talk to you more.

593
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,240
Be late.

594
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,240
I'm sorry.

595
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,240
I'm sorry.

596
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,240
I'm sorry.

597
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,240
I'm sorry.

598
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,240
I'm sorry.

599
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,240
Xiao Li.

600
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,240
I'll go back to tell you.

601
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,240
We lost the last eight games.

602
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,240
But now we're in the same league.

603
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,240
Let her prepare for the game.

604
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,240
Okay.

605
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,240
Let's go.

606
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,240
Bye, sir.

607
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,240
Take care.

608
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,240
Okay, sir.

609
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,240
Bye.

610
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,240
Be careful.

611
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,240
Bye.

612
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,240
Sir.

613
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,240
How are you?

614
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,240
Are you

615
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,240
injured?

616
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,240
I'm fine.

617
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,240
I just broke the skin.

618
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,240
I'll be fine in a few days.

619
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,240
I'm in a hurry.

620
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,240
I asked you to work with someone.

621
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,240
You don't listen to me.

622
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,240
That person is going to run away.

623
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,240
You don't listen to me.

624
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,240
The police are going out.

625
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,240
It's dangerous to face people.

626
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,240
You know that we have to

627
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,240
follow the police.

628
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,240
Didn't you teach me?

629
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,240
It's like you.

630
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,240
How can the police go out?

631
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,240
What's the difference between that and the head?

632
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,240
I told them

633
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,240
that this guy is going to run away.

634
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,240
They're not panic.

635
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,240
You're so stubborn.

636
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,240
Do you think that Sige is really reasonable?

637
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,240
Are you already

638
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,240
a hero to Sige?

639
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,240
Well,

640
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,240
Gao Zeyu,

641
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,240
if someone asks you,

642
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,240
we'll ask them.

643
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,240
You two can go and ask them.

644
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,240
You can go now.

645
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,240
Chief,

646
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,240
I want to join too.

647
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,240
You're not going to join?

648
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,240
Go to the right

649
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,240
and clean up the wound.

650
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,240
Keep it safe.

651
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,240
Chief, I want to join.

652
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,240
I must join.

653
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,240
I've been following this case

654
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,240
since the beginning.

655
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,240
I'm fine.

656
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,240
If you don't believe me,

657
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,240
I won't take it.

658
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,240
Stop.

659
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,240
It's like the police.

660
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,240
Chief,

661
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,240
I want to join.

662
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,240
Go.

663
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,240
Sit here.

664
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,240
Go.

665
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,240
Brother.

666
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,240
Tell me,

667
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,240
Chief,

668
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,240
Chief has agreed to join the interrogation.

669
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,240
Okay.

670
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,240
Come on.

671
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,240
Record it.

672
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,240
How's the phone?

673
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,240
No problem.

674
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,240
Let's start from here.

675
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,240
Okay.

676
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,240
You lost two people again.

677
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,240
How many?

678
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,240
11 people.

679
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,240
The phone is crazy.

680
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,240
Chief,

681
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,240
you're responsible for this case.

682
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,240
Come and talk to me.

683
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,240
Why are there only

684
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,240
these small towns in the Dianping Town?

685
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,240
Because of the road

686
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,240
that they're on.

687
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,240
The surveillance on the road

688
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,240
was all demolished.

689
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,240
That is to say,

690
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,240
as long as the thief

691
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,240
enters the town,

692
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,240
steal the electric car,

693
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,240
and leave the town,

694
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,240
our target is lost.

695
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,240
Now,

696
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,240
we suggest that

697
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,240
we contact the police

698
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,240
and see if we can

699
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,240
speed up the progress of the work.

700
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,240
Then,

701
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,240
we'll add surveillance shots

702
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,240
and security patrols.

703
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,240
Qin Chen,

704
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,240
tell me.

705
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,240
They're on the road.

706
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,240
The speed of the construction is so fast.

707
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,240
No one can finish it in a year.

708
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,240
You're the one who's going to be the judge.

709
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,240
That's right.

710
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,240
The only thing that's expected

711
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,240
is the speed of the electric car

712
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,240
and the missing case.

713
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,240
That's not realistic.

714
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,240
You still have to think of other ways.

715
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,240
This is too long.

716
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,240
We have to speed up.

717
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,240
That's the old way.

718
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,240
We need to stop the human force

719
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,240
and stop the tunnel.

720
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,240
Human force?

721
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,240
Chen Zong,

722
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,240
tell the police

723
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,240
what we've done

724
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,240
in the police group.

725
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,240
Police,

726
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,240
you also tell us

727
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,240
how to stop the human force.

728
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,240
Chief,

729
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,240
don't rush me.

730
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,240
I'm just asking for advice.

731
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,240
Chief,

732
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,240
suspect Fan Zui,

733
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,240
our medical law

734
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,240
is now going to be

735
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,240
asking questions.

736
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,240
The procedure is on the way.

737
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,240
We hope you can

738
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,240
answer our questions

739
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,240
and cooperate with us.

740
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,200
Did you hear it?

741
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:19,920
What's your name?

742
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,560
Liu Xiaoguang.

743
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,520
Okay, tell me.

744
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,920
I'm wrong.

745
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,040
I really picked up that phone

746
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,040
in Dongqing Village.

747
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,800
It's a phone that hasn't been opened.

748
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,200
Who threw it in Dongqing Village?

749
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,000
You told me.

750
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,800
Liu Xiaoguang, you're not honest.

751
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,120
You're such a guy now.

752
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,680
You'll only be punished.

753
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,480
I'm telling the truth.

754
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,400
I was so anxious that day

755
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,240
that I ran to the back of the house.

756
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,600
I saw a box on the floor.

757
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,800
I thought it was an empty phone box.

758
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,840
But I opened it and saw it.

759
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,080
It's a phone that hasn't been opened.

760
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,120
I just wanted to pay for it.

761
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,280
When did you pick up the phone?

762
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,280
I don't know.

763
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,480
It must be three or four days.

764
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,480
The phone was just lost yesterday.

765
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,880
Yes, yes, yes.

766
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,680
I picked it up yesterday.

767
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,680
What are you laughing at?

768
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,480
I've told you the policy clearly.

769
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,880
I hope you can cooperate well.

770
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,480
Uncle,

771
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,080
picking up things is not the best way.

772
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,480
Then why are you running?

773
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,880
You're all dressed up.

774
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,480
How can I know who you are?

775
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,080
We all have your two identities.

776
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,480
There are so many public prosecutor's courts now.

777
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,080
At that time, the situation was urgent.

778
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,280
How can I be sure that you're really identity?

779
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,480
Besides, you came up here in six or seven people.

780
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,680
I thought it was a group of robbers.

781
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,880
Who else can't run?

782
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,280
All right, that's all for today.

783
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,880
Liu Xiaoguang, go back and reflect.

784
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,880
What should we do?

785
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,480
Answer our police's question.

786
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,480
Don't be so confident.

787
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,480
The law records the shooting clearly.

788
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,680
It's useless to be so anxious.

789
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:20,680
Do you hear me?

790
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,280
Let him sign on the notice book.

791
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,480
Then bring him back.

792
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,880
What? Am I fake?

793
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,080
Tell me, young man,

794
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,280
you're a newbie.

795
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,680
You can understand.

796
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,280
He came from the office.

797
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,480
Who is like him?

798
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,480
Yuan Hu, I've sent someone to the police station.

799
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,480
Maybe they can find his contact in the phone.

800
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,080
Tell me, Jie.

801
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,280
How is it? Is there anyone else?

802
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,080
No.

803
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,880
When we went, the police said that

804
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,680
four people rented a room.

805
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,080
Before we arrived,

806
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,480
the police sent the room.

807
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,280
No need to say.

808
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,080
They must have called him on the way.

809
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,280
Zhao Qifei is not a good person.

810
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,880
Young man is a good person.

811
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,080
He is a good person.

812
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,880
But don't be so arrogant.

813
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,680
The police station is closed.

814
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,080
I suspect that he did it.

815
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,280
He is a good person.

816
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,680
Is he a good person?

817
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,280
Why do you think so?

818
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,280
Yes, he is a good person.

819
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,880
He is in our hands.

820
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,480
The key is time.

821
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,880
Okay, I'll go to the river side

822
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,680
and see if I can get my phone.

823
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,880
No, master.

824
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,680
He is so good.

825
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,080
He can't get his phone.

826
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,080
Okay, go back to work.

827
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,480
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

828
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,480
Tell me.

829
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,080
What's the matter?

830
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,080
I'm sorry.

831
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,080
Learn from our master.

832
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,880
Master.

833
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,880
Master, I want to discuss with you

834
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,280
the case of the electric car accident.

835
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,880
I talked to Li Davei.

836
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,080
We want to take a car.

837
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,080
The car is in GPS.

838
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,480
I'm thinking about

839
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,080
contacting the company and the committee.

840
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:16,880
We promote it.

841
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,680
Put GPS on the residents.

842
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,680
Li Davei just had a classmate.

843
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,880
He is doing this.

844
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,080
How big is the amount of work?

845
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,080
The water can't be removed.

846
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,280
If it's done,

847
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,880
it's a matter of hard work.

848
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,080
Li Davei is a big fool.

849
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,080
No.

850
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,280
If you want to,

851
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,280
you can ask him to contact us.

852
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,280
But we still have to do our job.

853
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,680
I told the company that we have to improve our police force.

854
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,280
We have to do our best.

855
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,280
Wait.

856
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,280
The company has to listen to my advice.

857
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,680
Tell me.

858
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,280
Chief, Chief Cheng.

859
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,080
That is the one who caught the suspect.

860
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,080
It's not a suspect.

861
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,080
Let him go.

862
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,080
No.

863
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,080
He is likely to be

864
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,080
the suspect of the crime.

865
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,080
The suspect of the crime.

866
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,080
The suspect of the crime.

867
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,080
The suspect of the crime.

868
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,080
The case is very serious.

869
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,080
You want to arrest him?

870
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,080
Yes.

871
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,080
He is going to arrest the suspect.

872
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,080
He is not.

873
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,080
Even if he is arrested,

874
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,080
we have to find out.

875
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,080
I think so.

876
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,080
It's not a big deal.

877
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,080
It's a little bit complicated.

878
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,080
We may have a bad time.

879
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,080
But the suspect is in our hands now.

880
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,080
Since we have the clue,

881
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,080
why should we let him go easily?

882
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,080
He is a good guy.

883
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,080
He is doing this for the sake of the defense.

884
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,080
He is trying to hurt the person.

885
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,080
He is going to arrest him.

886
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,080
You take him to the hospital.

887
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,080
I will call the police.

888
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:53,080
You go to the police and get the police station.

889
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,080
I will send you to the police station.

890
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,080
The police station can go to the police station?

891
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,080
I said I will call the police.

892
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,080
You go and do it.

893
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,080
Open the door.

894
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,080
No.

895
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,080
Send the police station.

896
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,080
Why not?

897
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,080
Hurry up.

898
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,080
My master called him.

899
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,080
He is holding the phone.

900
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,080
Don't talk in front of the criminal.

901
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,080
Kochua, come here.

902
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,080
We just got the call from the police station.

903
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,080
They have already arranged the operation.

904
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,080
They are going to arrest him.

905
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,080
I am going to call the police.

906
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,080
They have already arranged the operation.

907
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,080
They will send the police station to the police station.

908
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,080
We don't have time.

909
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,080
Send them back.

910
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,080
Okay.

911
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,080
Wait here.

912
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,080
Wait here.

913
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,080
Wait here.

914
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,080
Sister.

915
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,080
How is it?

916
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,080
The doctor.

917
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,080
The child is missing.

918
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,080
Is it your child?

919
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,080
It must be.

920
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:39,080
If it weren't for such a big thing.

921
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,080
What's wrong with the child?

922
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,080
I said you have no choice.

923
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,080
Chen Zhe can do it.

924
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,080
I can't do it.

925
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,080
I can't do it.

926
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,080
I can't do it.

927
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,080
You are young.

928
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,080
You can understand.

929
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,080
Police station.

930
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,080
What are you talking about?

931
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,080
Sister, don't be so curious.

932
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,080
You can go back to your home.

933
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,080
Master.

934
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,080
How is it?

935
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,080
The phone is out.

936
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,080
What's wrong?

937
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,080
The phone is out.

938
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,080
I just sent the person.

939
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,080
It's okay.

940
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,080
We have to send it to the bureau first.

941
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,080
We will talk about it in the data.

942
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,080
This way, please.

943
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,080
Mr. Chen, we will have to trouble you.

944
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,080
Okay.

945
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,080
Thank you.

946
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,080
Okay, send it here.

947
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,080
Mr. Chen.

948
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:48,080
I will call the shop owner.

949
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,080
You two can cooperate.

950
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,080
Okay.

951
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,080
No matter what, I hope you can talk.

952
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,080
They have your GPS and charging port.

953
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,080
You have their store.

954
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,080
It's convenient to watch business.

955
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,080
Don't worry.

956
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,080
We are in other cities.

957
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,080
We will do my job.

958
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,080
The effect is very good.

959
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,080
That's good.

960
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,080
We will talk to them right away.

961
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,080
Thank you.

962
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,080
It's okay.

963
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,080
By the way, are you still in charge of this?

964
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,080
It's all for the safety of the electric car.

965
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,080
Okay, thank you.

966
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,080
It's okay.

967
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,080
Thank you.

968
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,080
Bye.

969
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,080
Take care.

970
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,080
I didn't expect that.

971
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,080
You still have this relationship.

972
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,080
I found his brother.

973
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,080
I don't know who he is.

974
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,080
I just signed the contract.

975
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:29,080
Have you heard of the theory of six people?

976
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,080
In this world, no matter which person,

977
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,080
the most people in the world

978
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,080
can meet each other.

979
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,080
That is to say,

980
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,080
if I want to meet B.R. Kaiz,

981
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,080
I will have enough of the six people.

982
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,080
Yes, you are right.

983
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,080
This is called the theory of six-degree space.

984
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,080
Yes, yes, yes.

985
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,080
The theory of six-degree space.

986
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,080
Okay, doctor.

987
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,080
You know everything.

988
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,080
Liao Wei, you are so good.

989
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,080
You are so casual.

990
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,080
I am not a bad person.

991
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,080
I am a genius.

992
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,080
I tell you,

993
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,080
I am a police officer.

994
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,080
I am not a police officer.

995
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,080
I didn't say that I was a thief.

996
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,080
Hello, mom.

997
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,080
I am busy.

998
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,080
I am very busy recently.

999
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,080
I have told you.

1000
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,080
Yes, yes, yes.

1001
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,080
You are right.

1002
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,080
But I am really busy now.

1003
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,080
I can't go back.

1004
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,080
I am busy now.

1005
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,080
What about the case?

1006
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,080
I have to stay safe when I get in the car.

1007
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,080
I won't tell you, okay?

1008
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,080
You take care of yourself.

1009
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,080
Okay, that's all.

1010
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,080
Goodbye.

1011
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:43,080
Hello, do you want to do it?

1012
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,080
Yes, yes, yes.

1013
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,080
Hurry up.

1014
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,080
Where is the police station?

1015
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,080
The police station.

1016
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,080
The police station.

1017
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,080
The police station.

1018
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,080
The body temperature.

1019
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,080
Where is the police report?

1020
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,080
It will arrive soon.

1021
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,080
Then wait until the police report arrives.

1022
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,080
We can talk about it later.

1023
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,080
Don't worry.

1024
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,080
Let's take care of the person first.

1025
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,080
Then we will talk about it in the police report.

1026
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,080
Then let's go.

1027
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,080
Okay, don't be late.

1028
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,080
Okay.

1029
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,080
Okay.

1030
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,080
Chief Gao.

1031
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,080
Chief Gao, what's the matter?

1032
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,080
Something happened.

1033
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,080
Something happened.

1034
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,080
Hurry up and send that...

1035
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,080
Chief Gao to the hospital.

1036
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,080
The police station just arrived.

1037
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,080
Hurry up and send that...

1038
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,080
The body is out.

1039
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,080
What?

1040
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,080
Chief Gao.

1041
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,080
Chief Gao.

1042
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,080
Chief Gao.

1043
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,080
Chief Gao.

1044
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,080
Chief Gao.
