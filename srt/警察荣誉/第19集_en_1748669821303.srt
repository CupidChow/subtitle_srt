1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I

6
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,440
Dumb

7
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,720
Dumb

8
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I told you two to stop assistant Li Dawei.

9
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
How dare you fight with her?

10
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
No.

11
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
She was holding my face.

12
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
We were really going to the garbage.

13
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
But the situation was too chaotic.

14
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You're still talking?

15
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I thought you were the coldest.

16
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Enough. What's the use of them?

17
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I did the thing on my own.

18
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's none of their business.

19
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
What's the use of being a doctor?

20
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
That person is really making a scene.

21
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You three can't get away from it.

22
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Then this matter,

23
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
won't it have any effect on me?

24
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Go away.

25
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Don't forget it's already like this.

26
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Think of a strategy.

27
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
What strategy?

28
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
That person is the one who's going to do the garbage first.

29
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
He'll tell us.

30
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Let's have dinner.

31
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You all know it.

32
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Well, Xiaoxiao.

33
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I have something to tell them.

34
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I want to help you.

35
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Jiajia.

36
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's true.

37
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Jiajia.

38
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Wei Dawei.

39
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You're really too rude this time.

40
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
That bastard committed a crime.

41
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
We should have let Jiajia use the law

42
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
to protect ourselves.

43
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
We're the police.

44
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
They're here to find us.

45
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
We're giving her a case.

46
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yeah.

47
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You said I thought about it.

48
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Have you ever thought about it?

49
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I've thought about it.

50
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I've thought about it.

51
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I've thought about it.

52
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I've thought about it.

53
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I know this guy.

54
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Jiajia's biological father is a cop.

55
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
How dare he do that?

56
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Is he afraid of Jiajia?

57
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yeah.

58
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Jiajia has evidence.

59
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Based on that video,

60
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
he had to go to the wedding banquet for five days.

61
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Five days?

62
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Five days.

63
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You know everything about this.

64
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
That guy is in the military.

65
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Five days.

66
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Do you think this is the evidence

67
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
that Jiajia said?

68
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I know.

69
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
But the problem is that we're the criminals.

70
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
We can't be legal.

71
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It's all right.

72
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's all right.

73
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Don't tell me

74
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
it's a matter of theory.

75
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm not doing this

76
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
because of theory.

77
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm doing it because of the result.

78
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Do you know that?

79
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
My master and Jiajia

80
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
had a conflict.

81
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Jiajia thought my master

82
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
didn't protect her.

83
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
She deliberately tortured my master.

84
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
In this situation,

85
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
you let my master know about this.

86
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
If he can't do anything,

87
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
the conflict will only be deeper.

88
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
If my master decides to do anything,

89
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
why not do it for me?

90
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
At least let Jiajia know

91
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
that there are relatives around him

92
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
and can protect him.

93
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yes.

94
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'm sorry.

95
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's my fault.

96
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I shouldn't have

97
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
told you about this.

98
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's not that, sister.

99
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's not that.

100
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm so grateful to you.

101
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I didn't expect

102
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
that Brother David would want to

103
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
take the risk of being punished

104
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
for me

105
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
and hit people

106
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
with a hat.

107
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm sorry.

108
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm really grateful to you.

109
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Silly girl.

110
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
We're all your older brothers and sisters.

111
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
My sister was bullied.

112
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'll take care of

113
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
all your brothers and sisters.

114
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Jiajia.

115
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Brother David, I'm sorry.

116
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm so impulsive.

117
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
What should I do?

118
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
No.

119
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm sorry

120
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
for Brother David.

121
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I should say sorry.

122
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You fought for me.

123
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm really happy

124
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
to have

125
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
a sister like you.

126
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Really.

127
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Thank you.

128
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
This girl.

129
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Why did you say thank you to your brother?

130
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
No matter what happens,

131
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
no matter what,

132
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
remember to find a brother.

133
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You can find your sister.

134
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
We're all family

135
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
just like these two brothers.

136
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
If you have a sister,

137
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
no matter what happens,

138
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
don't be afraid.

139
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Don't cry.

140
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Don't cry.

141
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Oh, no.

142
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Chen Jinghuan won't know.

143
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Shut up.

144
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Master, you're here so early.

145
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Come here.

146
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Please go in.

147
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
What did you do this morning?

148
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Nothing.

149
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Nothing?

150
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You think I don't know

151
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
what's good for you?

152
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Jiajia's mother told me.

153
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I know what you're asking me.

154
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
What are you doing?

155
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Yes, I'm the one who asked her.

156
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Don't worry.

157
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm the one who did this.

158
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's all my fault.

159
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
What nonsense?

160
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You're my disciple.

161
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Can it be a person's fault?

162
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You're the one who did this.

163
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You're the one who did this.

164
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
No, she's upset with you.

165
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You're the one who's been supporting you.

166
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You're not allowed to talk about her.

167
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Jiajia.

168
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Why are you here?

169
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Why are you here?

170
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Go home.

171
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Wait a minute.

172
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
What's going on?

173
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Since I was a kid,

174
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
no matter what I've ever met,

175
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
you've never protected me.

176
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Now that they've protected me,

177
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
you're going to be the one who's going to be the one to blame.

178
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
What kind of father are you?

179
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Stop it.

180
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Yes.

181
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
They protected you.

182
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
But...

183
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
But they beat up Yu Zhu.

184
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I know.

185
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I was the one who asked them to beat them.

186
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Jiajia.

187
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Why?

188
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I was the one who asked them to beat them.

189
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You should blame me.

190
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
What's going on?

191
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Jiajia, don't talk.

192
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Jiajia.

193
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
What's going on?

194
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Take a look.

195
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
What are you doing, Jiajia?

196
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm painting.

197
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
What are you doing?

198
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm painting.

199
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You're not only doing this for the sake of your life.

200
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Yes.

201
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
But it seems like you've made it to the end.

202
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's true.

203
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
What are you doing?

204
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Don't touch me.

205
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Don't touch me.

206
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm telling you.

207
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Don't touch me.

208
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Don't touch me.

209
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Hit me.

210
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Hit you.

211
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Hit me.

212
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Listen to me.

213
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
We've already done it.

214
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Hit me.

215
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Don't touch me.

216
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
We've already done it.

217
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You can't let him do it.

218
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Hit yourself.

219
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm going to kill you.

220
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Hit me.

221
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Master, you can't do it for yourself.

222
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Think about Jiajia.

223
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Jiajia can't protect him.

224
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
He's the only one.

225
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Jiajia.

226
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Why didn't you tell me?

227
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Why didn't you tell me?

228
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Dad!

229
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Dad!

230
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Dad!

231
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Dad!

232
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Dad!

233
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Dad!

234
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Dad!

235
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Dad!

236
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Dad!

237
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Dad!

238
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Dad!

239
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Dad!

240
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Dad didn't protect me.

241
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Dad!

242
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Dad!

243
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Dad!

244
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
The End

245
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Back then,

246
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
after I was discharged,

247
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
the whole world was very depressed.

248
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
This kind of emotion must have

249
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
brought me home.

250
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It's a long life.

251
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It's a long life.

252
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Your mom can't see the hope.

253
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
She proposed to me.

254
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I've been with you all day.

255
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
No one can tell me that it's a long life.

256
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Besides,

257
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I tried to make you two have a good life.

258
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
But I couldn't take it.

259
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
So I thought,

260
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
instead of this,

261
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I wouldn't let you two leave

262
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
and live a good life.

263
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
So I agreed.

264
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
When I got divorced,

265
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I insisted on your marriage.

266
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I'm a cop.

267
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I've been with you 24 hours.

268
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
How could I have taken care of you?

269
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
So I agreed.

270
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Later,

271
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
when I got married,

272
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I regretted it.

273
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I wanted to get you back.

274
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I wanted to get you back.

275
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
But your mom can't bear you.

276
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Dad,

277
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
let's not talk about my mom.

278
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I've been living with her these years.

279
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I know it's not easy for her to live.

280
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Yes.

281
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
But Jia Jia,

282
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
you're 18 years old now.

283
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
You've decided to live with her.

284
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Are you willing

285
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
to live with dad?

286
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Dad,

287
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'm old now.

288
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I know the truth.

289
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You'll have your own life.

290
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I will.

291
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Whether you come or not,

292
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I'll have my own life.

293
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
You mean,

294
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I'll...

295
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I...

296
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I don't know about this.

297
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
But Jia Jia,

298
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I can guarantee you that

299
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
before you leave,

300
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
you'll find your own happiness.

301
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I'll

302
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
stay with you alone,

303
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
okay?

304
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Let's be together.

305
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It's great.

306
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I'll

307
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
live with you.

308
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Dad,

309
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'm willing to.

310
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Don't come over here.

311
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Come over here.

312
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Come over here.

313
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Actually, I have a lot of demands.

314
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I hope that in three days,

315
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
the people like Li Dawei

316
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
and Chen Xingcheng

317
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
will fire the police.

318
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
And they will apologize to me

319
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
and write the statement.

320
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Don't come near me.

321
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Otherwise,

322
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I'll

323
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
put these videos online.

324
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
The house is almost done.

325
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
We have two days left.

326
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
We'll take Jia Jia back.

327
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Uncle,

328
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
it's just a matter of time.

329
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
You've been here for a long time.

330
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Really?

331
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Be careful.

332
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Are you okay?

333
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I'm sorry.

334
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
It's okay.

335
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I mean,

336
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
take good care of Jia Jia.

337
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
If you're not worried,

338
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
just take her back.

339
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Don't worry.

340
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Don't worry.

341
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Brother Chen, you're back.

342
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I mean,

343
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
thank you for this time.

344
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Okay.

345
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I can't be disobeyed by master.

346
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
How are you going to thank me?

347
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
You're so shameless, right?

348
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Let me teach you something.

349
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Once you're done with it,

350
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I'll do it for you.

351
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Do you hear me?

352
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Can't you see?

353
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Can't you see?

354
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I'm a master.

355
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Listen to me.

356
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Do you hear me?

357
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Don't, don't, don't.

358
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Brother Chen, you're back.

359
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Big Wei.

360
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I just had a meeting with the police.

361
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

362
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I have something to do with it.

363
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
What is it?

364
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
No, no, it's not me.

365
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It's the police.

366
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Okay.

367
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Wait.

368
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Take this envelope back.

369
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
And take a look at the gold key.

370
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Let's go.

371
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Brother Chen.

372
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Sister-in-law.

373
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
The husband is in the report.

374
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
The boss wants to see you.

375
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
What did he say?

376
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
He said

377
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
you called Li Dawei and the three of them

378
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
to have a plan.

379
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
He beat them up

380
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
at the place where he was running.

381
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
At that time,

382
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Chen Tian's people

383
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
took pictures of him with their phones.

384
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
He collected some videos

385
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
and checked them.

386
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
The boss wanted to talk to you first.

387
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Then he took care of the three of them.

388
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Tell me.

389
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
What's the matter?

390
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Kaosong.

391
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I forced them to do this.

392
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It has nothing to do with the three of them.

393
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Brother, you beat them up.

394
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I don't believe you

395
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
even if you say no.

396
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
You ran away

397
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
and you can't even get up.

398
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
You forced them.

399
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Think about it.

400
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I don't believe it.

401
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Who is the boss?

402
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Who is the boss?

403
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
It's like an old fox.

404
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
When that person comes in,

405
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
the boss will guess

406
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
the boss's name.

407
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
So,

408
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
we should call them first.

409
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
We should discuss

410
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
how to investigate the facts

411
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
and how to deal with them.

412
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Brother,

413
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I've watched your video.

414
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Although it's a short-lived video,

415
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I can see

416
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
that Li Dabai is a real man.

417
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
If you want to help them

418
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
to change the world,

419
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I suggest you

420
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
to think it over.

421
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
What do you mean?

422
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
If something happens,

423
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I'll help the apprentice.

424
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Then I'm still a man.

425
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Look.

426
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Tell me.

427
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I'm doing this

428
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
by myself.

429
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
It has nothing to do with others.

430
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Tell me.

431
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I'll be there in a while.

432
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
You help me to talk.

433
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Then you can

434
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
find out who I am.

435
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I'm not telling you.

436
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I'll help you.

437
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
No problem.

438
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
What's going on?

439
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Look.

440
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
If you don't tell me,

441
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
how can I help you?

442
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Okay,

443
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I'll go to the chief first.

444
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Think about it.

445
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Come here.

446
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Tell me.

447
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Chief,

448
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Brother Cheng is here.

449
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Come.

450
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Chief.

451
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Sit.

452
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Okay.

453
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I'll go to the chief.

454
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Okay.

455
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Chief.

456
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Chief.

457
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Thank you.

458
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Tell me.

459
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
What's going on?

460
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Actually,

461
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
it's not a big deal.

462
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I'm with that girl.

463
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
You know it.

464
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I've been watching her for years.

465
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
My wife took my place

466
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
that year.

467
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Although it's been so many years,

468
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I haven't felt

469
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
that much in my heart.

470
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
So,

471
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I forced Li Dawei

472
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
to take her away.

473
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Thank you, Si Fen.

474
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I was wrong.

475
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
You forced Li Dawei

476
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
to take her away?

477
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Uncle Yang,

478
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
you forced her to take her away?

479
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Yes.

480
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
It's all my fault.

481
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I told them.

482
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I said

483
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
they wanted to change the attitude

484
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
of our old police officers

485
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
to get the job done.

486
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
So, they didn't...

487
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Do you still remember

488
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
that you were an old police officer?

489
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I drank a little wine that day,

490
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
so I fainted.

491
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
But I think

492
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
you're the one who fainted now.

493
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
You're an old police officer.

494
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
You don't understand.

495
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
You want to protect them.

496
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
You take away all the things.

497
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
You force them to take away their clothes.

498
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
You lock them up.

499
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
You're the mastermind.

500
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
You're the mastermind.

501
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
What's this?

502
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
This is a crime.

503
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
You can't protect them.

504
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
You've put your right

505
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
in there.

506
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
And

507
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
this is what the other party wants.

508
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
She's talking about her.

509
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I'll just take care of it.

510
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Aren't you done?

511
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Is the police station

512
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
your house or our house?

513
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
How can I handle it?

514
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
You're an old police officer.

515
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
You have no sense at all.

516
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I have no sense at all.

517
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
But this matter

518
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
is my job.

519
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
We don't want

520
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
to have children.

521
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
You don't understand.

522
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Listen.

523
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Are you teaching me

524
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
how to be the chief?

525
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Chief.

526
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
This matter is

527
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
the personal relationship

528
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
between Mr. Cheng and Yu.

529
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
We need to solve

530
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
the problem.

531
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
You're lying.

532
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
That man is going to

533
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
make the world big.

534
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
He's just making trouble.

535
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I'm done with the deal.

536
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I'm...

537
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Mr. Cheng.

538
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Don't be anxious.

539
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Go.

540
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I'll beat you up.

541
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Don't be anxious.

542
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Listen to me.

543
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
How to deal with the lock

544
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
is the lock.

545
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
But you want to protect them.

546
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
You can't be innocent.

547
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Now.

548
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
The most important thing is

549
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
to make things clear.

550
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Chief.

551
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
What's there to be clear?

552
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
People can understand

553
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
the lock.

554
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Right?

555
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I'm with Yu.

556
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
It's personal.

557
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I'll take all the consequences.

558
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Chen Ke.

559
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
You're not the one who said it.

560
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Xing Cheng.

561
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
You're not the one who said it.

562
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
You're not the one who said it.

563
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
You're the one who said it.

564
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
The most important thing is to make things clear.

565
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
If you make a mistake

566
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
that year,

567
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
can you accept the punishment?

568
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Chief.

569
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
You're making it clear.

570
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Where did I make a mistake?

571
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Why did I make a mistake?

572
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Chen Ke.

573
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Chief.

574
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Why did I make a mistake?

575
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Why did I make a mistake?

576
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I made a mistake.

577
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Stop it.

578
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Stop it.

579
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Calm down.

580
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Okay?

581
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
This is my suggestion.

582
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
No need to exaggerate.

583
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Okay.

584
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
But the topic is how to deal with it.

585
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
You guys can do it.

586
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Come on.

587
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Are you done with the training?

588
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
What are you doing?

589
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Chief.

590
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Since it's personal,

591
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I'll call Xing Yu here.

592
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I'll have Chen Ke and I

593
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
sit together

594
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
and talk about it.

595
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
We'll be done.

596
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
What do you mean?

597
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
The police in our office

598
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
beat us up.

599
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
We're making a mess?

600
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Chief.

601
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Do you always call us leaders?

602
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
When we're making a mess,

603
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
we make a mess, right?

604
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
When did I make you make a mess?

605
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I didn't say it, okay?

606
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
What are you doing?

607
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Chief.

608
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Chief.

609
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Chief.

610
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Yes?

611
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Come with me.

612
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Miss.

613
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Did you take part in the beating of David?

614
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
You already know.

615
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
So you took part in it?

616
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I didn't take part in the beating.

617
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
But...

618
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
But what?

619
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
It has something to do with me.

620
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Then it has something to do with you?

621
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
What does it have to do with you?

622
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Master.

623
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
This matter...

624
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
This matter is about Jia Jia.

625
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I can't say it.

626
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Jia Jia?

627
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Chen Xingcheng's daughter?

628
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Well.

629
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I can say it.

630
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
But...

631
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Miss.

632
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Now, the situation is complicated.

633
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
So we might have to deal with David.

634
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Although Chen Xingcheng wants to take responsibility,

635
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
it's not that he wants to.

636
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Master.

637
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
David is also a good man.

638
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Can you go to the chief and tell him and his master?

639
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I'll try my best.

640
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Thank you, master.

641
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Miss.

642
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Remember.

643
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Don't be late.

644
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Say it three times.

645
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Chief.

646
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I'm not done yet.

647
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Chief.

648
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Come out.

649
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I have a situation to talk to you about.

650
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Chief.

651
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Didn't you see it?

652
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
What do you mean?

653
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Think about it.

654
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
If that person is really a real person,

655
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
he'll only apologize.

656
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
This means that it's very possible that

657
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
he has some kind of weakness

658
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
and is caught by Lao Chen.

659
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
He doesn't want to cause any big trouble.

660
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
So I think we should tell him

661
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
that they have already proposed a deal to Lao Chen.

662
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Chen Xingcheng can go through this.

663
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I can't see the clear evidence.

664
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
The problem is that we have to

665
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
sell this matter to our client.

666
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
We have to make it clear, right?

667
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
We are making a decision.

668
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
That's a discussion.

669
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Isn't it?

670
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
We have to make it clear

671
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
completely.

672
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Yes.

673
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
If there is any misunderstanding,

674
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
we will be in trouble.

675
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Yes.

676
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Go on.

677
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
My teacher told me that

678
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
your teacher has made things worse for himself.

679
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
My teacher doesn't know the time at all.

680
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I'll go to Lao Chen and talk.

681
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Don't panic.

682
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
What are you going to say?

683
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I'll do it for one person.

684
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
The video is all taken.

685
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
The three of you are here.

686
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
It's said that you did it alone.

687
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
No one will believe you.

688
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
We have a share in this matter.

689
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
No one can escape.

690
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
No.

691
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
No.

692
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Yang Shu is the target of the focus.

693
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
He can't do it because of this.

694
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Zhao Jige is worse.

695
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
He is more important than the police.

696
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Besides,

697
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Yang Shu and Zhao Jige were going to the police station.

698
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
The video should be taken clearly.

699
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I'll go to the police station.

700
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
You wait.

701
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Wait.

702
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Chief.

703
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
What are you doing here?

704
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I'm not letting you see the money.

705
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Hurry up.

706
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
The boss is waiting for you.

707
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Xia Jie, why didn't you come here?

708
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
The security situation in the desert.

709
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Didn't I let you see it?

710
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Hurry up.

711
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Chief.

712
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I was the one who was in charge of the fight.

713
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Yang Shu and Zhao Jige were going to the Lan family.

714
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
My master doesn't know anything.

715
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
All the blame is on me.

716
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Didn't you hear me?

717
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
And me.

718
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I was the one who was in charge of the fight.

719
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
That's why I was in charge of the fight.

720
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Xia Jie, what are you talking about?

721
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Chief, don't listen to him.

722
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
It's all my fault.

723
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
You are talking about your own fault?

724
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
What did you think of the police?

725
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Did you think of me?

726
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Xia Jie, did you participate in the fight?

727
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
If you didn't participate,

728
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
don't let it happen.

729
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Get out of here.

730
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I let Uncle Yang and Zhao Jige go.

731
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
That's why I participated.

732
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Shut up.

733
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
You again?

734
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Yes.

735
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Uncle again.

736
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Chief.

737
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I was the one who was in charge of the fight.

738
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Xia Jie didn't participate.

739
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
He was the one who was in charge of the fight.

740
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Uncle Yang and Zhao Jige were the same.

741
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
If you were in charge,

742
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
you would be in charge of me alone.

743
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Shut up.

744
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Don't listen to him, Chief.

745
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Master, what's your relationship with you?

746
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
You don't know anything.

747
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
If you weren't a member of my gang,

748
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I would have killed the man who was in charge of the fight.

749
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
You still talk?

750
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
You are really capable.

751
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Chief.

752
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Find a place to wake him up.

753
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I don't have my order.

754
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Don't come out.

755
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Chief.

756
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Wait a minute.

757
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Get out of the car.

758
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
You are his master.

759
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
You should do something.

760
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
How to make him a qualified police officer?

761
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Not when he did something wrong.

762
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
To cover him up.

763
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Yes, Chief.

764
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
You are the leader.

765
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
You have your attitude.

766
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
But Li Dawei beat him up.

767
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
It's all because of me.

768
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
You have to deal with it.

769
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
You deal with me.

770
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
You...

771
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Today, you are going to touch my disciple.

772
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
A hand-to-hand.

773
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I am Chen Xingcheng's enemy.

774
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
What?

775
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Okay.

776
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I will be your enemy.

777
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
You are a police officer.

778
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
You should say that.

779
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Chief.

780
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Take him down.

781
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Who dares to move?

782
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
No, brother.

783
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Get up.

784
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
You all want to know

785
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
why Li Dawei beat him up, right?

786
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I will tell you.

787
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
It's my fault.

788
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
It's my fault.

789
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I should have done it.

790
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I should have done it.

791
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
But I am not capable.

792
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I can't fly.

793
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I can't protect my daughter.

794
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Li Dawei beat him up.

795
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
He is a cop.

796
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
You have to deal with my disciple today.

797
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I will kill you tomorrow.

798
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Do you believe me?

799
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Okay, brother.

800
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Brother Chen.

801
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
You should tell the chief about this.

802
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I will be done.

803
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Please.

804
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
You are a fool.

805
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
You...

806
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
You are a fool.

807
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Who is his real son?

808
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Who is his father?

809
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Or is he my father?

810
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I can't protect him.

811
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I can't protect him.

812
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I can't protect him.

813
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
I can't protect him.

814
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
I can't protect him.

815
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
It's Li Dawei.

816
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Li Dawei saved him.

817
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
He went to the distance with that fish.

818
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
So he went to the private area.

819
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
If I didn't have that useless master,

820
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
he wouldn't have done this.

821
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
You are right.

822
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I didn't deal with it well.

823
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I'm in trouble.

824
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
What are you talking about?

825
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
It's our business.

826
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Do you know that?

827
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Chief.

828
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I understand this very well.

829
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I have a daughter.

830
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
You dare to hurt my daughter?

831
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I have to fight for her life.

832
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
You all go out first.

833
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Chief.

834
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I said you all go out first.

835
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Chief.

836
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Didn't you hear me?

837
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Go out first.

838
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Thank you.

839
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
What's wrong?

840
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
My house is full of rumours.

841
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Why are you in such a hurry?

842
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I heard that you and Zhao Jingyue

843
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
fought Mr. Chen, Mr. Qianqin and Mr. Qian's husband.

844
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Is that true?

845
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Who told you that?

846
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
You still have time to inquire about this.

847
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Now the office is in a mess.

848
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Because of this, it's all over.

849
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
So what are you doing in the research?

850
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Master.

851
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
It's true.

852
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I also participated.

853
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Are you crazy, Yang Shuang?

854
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Master.

855
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Why are you with them?

856
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I did go to the Lajia at the beginning.

857
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
But that person should fight.

858
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
If he should fight, he can fight with you.

859
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Are you the same as Li Dabai?

860
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
When he came,

861
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
he was a big hit.

862
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
And you?

863
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
You came to exercise.

864
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
You have to go to the bureau a year later.

865
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
You said you...

866
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
It's okay.

867
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
What are you doing with them?

868
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Master, you don't know the situation.

869
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
If you are here,

870
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
your temperament will be worse.

871
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Enough. I don't want to hear it.

872
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
You are so smart.

873
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
It's not clear

874
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
what you are doing at the moment.

875
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I know something.

876
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Remember.

877
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Li Dabai is a hitman.

878
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
And Li is a Lajia.

879
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
This is the truth.

880
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
So Li Dabai should be responsible

881
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
for his own actions.

882
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Don't you...

883
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Listen to me.

884
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Li Dabai...

885
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Officer Chen.

886
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Li Dabai.

887
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
What?

888
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Don't be so stupid.

889
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I just want Yang Shuang

890
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
to be more clear about his pain.

891
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Shouldn't I?

892
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Master.

893
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Li Dabai.

894
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Wait.

895
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Officer Chen.

896
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Officer Chen,

897
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I didn't say anything.

898
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I just want Yang Shuang

899
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
to be responsible for his own actions.

900
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Who should be responsible for his own actions?

901
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Look,

902
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
look at that.

903
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
That eye-catching thing.

904
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
It's like it's eating me.

905
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Let's go.

906
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Jianjian.

907
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
You don't have to work at night.

908
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Let's go.

909
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Okay.

910
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Wait.

911
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Jinxiu.

912
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Hurry.

913
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Don't move.

914
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Don't move.

915
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Don't move.

916
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
What do I do?

917
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Come on.

918
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Don't move.

919
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Don't move.

920
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Don't move.

921
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Don't move.

922
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Officer Jiang.

923
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Officer Jiang, come on.

924
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Don't move.

925
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Don't move.

926
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
I'll leave.

927
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
I'll leave.

928
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,560
We're going to the back.

929
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,280
Come on.

930
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,080
Let's go.

931
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,440
What's going on?

932
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,240
Officer Zhang,

933
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,560
it's not easy for everyone to put up a stall here.

934
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,600
Look, they're taking our stuff.

935
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,280
I know.

936
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,040
Brother Zhang, you know.

937
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,640
We can't put up a stall here.

938
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,560
We've got the告.

939
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,560
We've got the work.

940
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,640
We've asked them several times.

941
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,960
They just don't listen.

942
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,440
Okay, okay. I know.

943
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,320
Okay, okay.

944
00:40:59,320 --> 00:40:59,920
Come on.

945
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,760
Let me tell you.

946
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,640
It's like this.

947
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,200
You don't know much about this.

948
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,360
They're all the residents of this neighborhood.

949
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,480
Many people still rely on this little boy to eat.

950
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,560
Look, can you do this today?

951
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,800
Give me a face.

952
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,040
Don't touch their stuff, okay?

953
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,120
Give them back their stuff.

954
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,880
I'll definitely help you solve this problem.

955
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,800
Okay?

956
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,680
Yes, sir.

957
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,320
Okay.

958
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,080
Okay.

959
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,280
Give them back their stuff.

960
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,080
Okay, okay.

961
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,040
Come on.

962
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,080
Put up a stall here.

963
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:27,840
It's not easy.

964
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,440
Thank you.

965
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,560
Thank you.

966
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,920
Thank you.

967
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,240
Brother Zhang, you're so shy.

968
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,280
You promised to help me solve it.

969
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,400
I believe you.

970
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,000
But if you're so shy,

971
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:37,920
we'll be in trouble.

972
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,200
I know.

973
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,240
Don't worry.

974
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,600
I promise to help you solve it.

975
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,160
Okay?

976
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,200
Okay, thank you.

977
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:44,680
Okay.

978
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:45,080
Thank you.

979
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:45,800
Thank you.

980
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,880
Let's go.

981
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,560
Let's go.

982
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,840
It's okay.

983
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,680
Let's go.

984
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,040
Thank you.

985
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,240
Okay.

986
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,520
Take care.

987
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,320
Thank you.

988
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,040
Okay, okay.

989
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,280
Everyone, come here.

990
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,200
Come here.

991
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,280
Listen to me.

992
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,120
Come here.

993
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,160
Listen to me.

994
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,160
This place

995
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,200
really can't be a stall.

996
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,560
It's all under the rules of the civil rights.

997
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,120
You know?

998
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:20,520
Yes.

999
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,160
Okay.

1000
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,160
I have some time.

1001
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,080
I'll go to the community and discuss it.

1002
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,520
Let's see if we can solve this problem

1003
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,560
from the root.

1004
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,000
Okay?

1005
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:27,520
Okay.

1006
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,240
Thank you.

1007
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:28,760
Thank you.

1008
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,480
Please help me.

1009
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:29,960
Okay?

1010
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,080
Please cooperate with me.

1011
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:31,720
Okay?

1012
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:31,960
Okay.

1013
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:32,680
Thank you.

1014
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:33,400
Thank you.

1015
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:33,920
Okay?

1016
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,640
Thank you.

1017
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,480
Okay?

1018
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,160
Thank you.

1019
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:37,800
Please cooperate with me.

1020
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,800
Listen to me.

1021
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:41,840
Let's go.

1022
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,360
Master.

1023
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,680
Most of these residents

1024
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,720
are from the countryside.

1025
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,120
They have to rely on this small business

1026
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,520
to raise their families.

1027
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,280
If they don't let them do it,

1028
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,160
we have to find a place

1029
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,440
to put them in.

1030
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,600
Xun Wei, you're right.

1031
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,240
Finally, we can solve the problem

1032
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,160
of the old people.

1033
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,120
I'm in a hurry.

1034
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:04,680
What do you mean?

1035
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,840
I'm the old people.

1036
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:09,840
Hello?

1037
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:11,560
Mr. Cheng.

1038
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:13,960
Yes.

1039
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:15,520
You eat first.

1040
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,720
Don't wait for me.

1041
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:17,520
Okay.

1042
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,480
I'll be right there.

1043
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:19,680
Okay?

1044
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,760
What's the matter, Master?

1045
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,680
Xun Wei, tell me the truth.

1046
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,960
What's going on

1047
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:28,840
with you and Uncle Yang?

1048
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:05,800
I'm sorry.

1049
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,800
I'm sorry.

1050
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:07,800
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,800
I'm sorry.

1055
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:12,800
I'm sorry.

1056
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:13,800
I'm sorry.

1057
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:14,800
I'm sorry.

1058
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:15,800
I'm sorry.

1059
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:16,800
I'm sorry.

1060
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,800
I'm sorry.

1061
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:18,800
I'm sorry.

1062
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,800
I'm sorry.

1063
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:20,800
I'm sorry.

1064
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:21,800
I'm sorry.

1065
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:22,800
I'm sorry.

1066
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:23,800
I'm sorry.

1067
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:24,800
I'm sorry.

1068
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:25,800
I'm sorry.

1069
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:26,800
I'm sorry.

1070
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:27,800
I'm sorry.

1071
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,800
I'm sorry.

1072
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,800
I'm sorry.

1073
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,800
I'm sorry.

1074
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:31,800
I'm sorry.

1075
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:32,800

I'm sorry.

1084
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,480
I'm sorry.

1085
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,480
I'm sorry.

1086
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:44,480
I'm sorry.

1087

00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,480
I'm sorry.

1091
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,480
I'm sorry.

1092
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:50,480
I'm sorry.

1093
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,480
I'm sorry.

1094
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,480
I'm sorry.

1095
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,480
I'm sorry.

1096
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,480
I'm sorry.

1097
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,480
I'm sorry.

1098
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,480
I'm sorry.

1099
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,480

Not now.

00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:07,680
No, not now.

1110
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:08,080
No, not now.

1111
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:09,920
I'm sorry.

1112
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,040
But you know.

1113
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:14,120
Now I have to not say thank you.

1114
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:17,160
I've been doing this.

1115
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,200

I'm sorry.

1121
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,320
That's nice.

1122
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,200
I'm sorry.

1123
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,040
I'm sorry.

1124
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:32,040
I'm sorry.

1125
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,040
I will not regret

1126
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,040
I will not regret

1127
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:38,040
I will not regret

1128
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,040
I will not regret

1129
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:42,040
