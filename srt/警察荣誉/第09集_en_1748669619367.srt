1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I

3
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,480
I

4
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,120
Wish you a lot of fun

5
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,680
Li Hao

6
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,800
Is it true we are soancia

7
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,120
Is because of your father

8
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,880
This douche hating family

9
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,400
Scared the child

10
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,200
caused both parties' conflict.

11
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,400
In the conflict,

12
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,400
your father was very excited and fell down.

13
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,120
This was caused by his personal health.

14
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,440
As for your father's medical expenses,

15
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,960
how can we solve it?

16
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,960
You can seek justice.

17
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,320
Chief Wang,

18
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,720
you're talking to their family.

19
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,360
Exactly.

20
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,320
What nonsense are you talking about?

21
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,760
What are you talking about?

22
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,720
You said we were in a police meeting.

23
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,600
You said we were in charge.

24
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,320
Get the evidence.

25
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,920
You got the evidence.

26
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,080
I...

27
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,200
You...

28
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,640
That's all for today.

29
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,520
Hurry up.

30
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,520
Take your family and go back.

31
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,360
If you don't go back,

32
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,000
we'll be in trouble.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,920
I...

34
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,840
Wait.

35
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,680
What's wrong?

36
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,800
You have to sign the papers.

37
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,640
What?

38
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,520
We can't sign.

39
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,680
What?

40
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,080
Why can't we sign?

41
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,240
The papers are all signed.

42
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,200
Why can't we sign?

43
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,800
How can you not sign?

44
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,880
Exactly.

45
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,920
You can follow the legal order

46
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,320
and go to the court.

47
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,200
Why can't I sign?

48
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,440
If you're in trouble,

49
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,200
we'll be in trouble.

50
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,320
Let's go.

51
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,400
I'll send them off.

52
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,040
This way.

53
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,600
If the police are so serious,

54
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,200
what should we do?

55
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,640
We should go to their house.

56
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,280
What?

57
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:18,720
Yes.

58
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,400
They were fighting with their family.

59
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,760
They should pay for their expenses.

60
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,720
We can't help them.

61
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,600
We can't let them go back.

62
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,280
If they don't go back,

63
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,200
we'll let them go.

64
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:25,800
We'll see what they'll do.

65
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,560
Yes.

66
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,880
Come on.

67
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,880
We didn't pay.

68
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,240
Come on.

69
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,920
The police are not working.

70
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,280
Let's go home.

71
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:33,840
Let's go.

72
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,480
Get in.

73
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,200
Get in.

74
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,000
Okay.

75
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,760
Let's go.

76
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,280
Let's go.

77
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,120
Don't...

78
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,560
Come on.

79
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,200
What's going on?

80
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,240
What's going on?

81
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,360
I thought you were

82
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,200
a good man who was in charge of the complicated problems.

83
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,840
You're a good man.

84
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,120
What?

85
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,120
Why are you blaming me?

86
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,040
Who are you blaming?

87
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,080
A big morning,

88
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,840
a big group of people,

89
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,720
a big housekeeper,

90
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,040
they came.

91
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,600
Have you ever been in the hospital?

92
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,280
They were in the hospital.

93
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,200
Who could have guessed?

94
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,160
Have you ever understood?

95
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,280
We have to understand.

96
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,040
Obviously,

97
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,280
they were in the house.

98
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,240
We can't stay in the hospital for long.

99
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,960
When we came in,

100
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,000
we saw the old man.

101
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,760
He was gone.

102
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,000
It's okay.

103
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,920
When they came,

104
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,640
they were in the hospital.

105
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,360
There were a lot of people.

106
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,320
Then, we don't need to say.

107
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,440
It's obvious.

108
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,160
We can't stay in the hospital.

109
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,360
If we can't stay in the hospital,

110
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,840
it's easy.

111
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,440
We have to deal with it.

112
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,800
I've said this before.

113
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,440
There is no such big house in the neighborhood.

114
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,760
It's just the grand daughter of the Sun family.

115
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,600
What's their purpose?

116
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,640
Did they go through the same thing?

117
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,000
Do you think they care about it or are they wrong?

118
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,280
Obviously, they want to save money.

119
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,720
Mr. Zheng,

120
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,440
take the sheep tree

121
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,080
to comfort the little wolf.

122
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,320
It's not good to do the work of the little wolf.

123
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,800
Take it out and pay attention.

124
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,760
Get ready to fight for the wine.

125
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,600
Mr. Cheng,

126
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,600
you should also take a look at these cases.

127
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,000
Go and check which part of the society

128
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
is the left-wing.

129
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
How is the social relationship?

130
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Find a breakthrough.

131
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You should increase the number of people.

132
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The heart is there.

133
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's also a brain-to-heart business.

134
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's hard to deal with.

135
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You need to increase your strength.

136
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm fine.

137
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,400
Dr. Cheng,

138
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,400
you finally came.

139
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,400
You can't do this.

140
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,400
You don't care about the hospital.

141
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,400
Our doctor is a patient.

142
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,400
We need to take care of the medicine.

143
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,400
Yes, we are in contact with the family.

144
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,400
We haven't contacted them yet.

145
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,400
The hospital fee hasn't paid yet.

146
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,400
Before the first day,

147
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,400
we are fighting for the money.

148
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,400
What should we do?

149
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,400
We have to take care of the hospital.

150
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,400
We have to take care of the hospital.

151
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,400
We have to take care of the hospital.

152
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,800
What should we do?

153
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,800
Doctor, you go ahead.

154
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,800
I'll keep an eye on it.

155
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,800
The hospital is in a hurry.

156
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,800
Yes, yes.

157
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,800
Thank you.

158
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,800
Hello, master.

159
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,800
Hello, where are you?

160
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,800
I'm downstairs at Wang Kang's house.

161
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,800
What are you doing here?

162
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,800
You're here to do the self-sufficiency.

163
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,800
Don't you have anything to do?

164
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,800
No, master, I'm not...

165
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,800
I'm here.

166
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,800
Hurry up and come to the hospital.

167
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,800
I'll wait for you.

168
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,800
Hello, Mr. Xie.

169
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,800
I'm here to see you.

170
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,800
How much is the number?

171
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,800
I'm here to sue you.

172
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,800
What?

173
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,800
I'm here to sue you.

174
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,800
I'm here to sue you.

175
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,200
I didn't wear a uniform today.

176
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,200
No, I didn't wear a uniform either.

177
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,200
Your dad died because he was hospitalized.

178
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,200
You're his only lover.

179
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,200
Even if you drive me crazy today,

180
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,200
I'll find you another one.

181
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,200
So you'd better go with us.

182
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,200
I didn't have a dad.

183
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,200
We've been through the situation.

184
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,200
Your dad and I are both under-settled.

185
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,200
Did the law say that the law would still judge you

186
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,200
before the conclusion?

187
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,200
So what's the point of him?

188
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,200
We can only find you.

189
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,600
Okay.

190
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,600
Come, catch me.

191
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,600
Why are you asking me a question?

192
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,600
What kind of person are you?

193
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,600
You're not catching me, are you?

194
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,600
I'm going to work.

195
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,600
Open the door!

196
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,600
Open the door!

197
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,600
Open the door!

198
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,600
Open the door!

199
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,600
Open the door!

200
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,600
Open the door!

201
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,600
Open the door!

202
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,600
Open the door!

203
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,600
Open the door!

204
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,600
Open the door!

205
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,600
Open the door!

206
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,600
Get up!

207
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,600
What are you doing?

208
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,600
Hurry!

209
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,600
Don't touch me!

210
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,600
Stop it!

211
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,600
Where are you going?

212
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,600
Put the knife down

213
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,320
Don't be impulsive.

214
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,320
Impulsive is a devil.

215
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,480
Look at them.

216
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,960
They have no way to survive.

217
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,280
What's wrong with us?

218
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,000
Their dog is chasing us.

219
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,200
We are still looking for them.

220
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,520
We haven't found them yet.

221
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,200
What are they doing?

222
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,200
Don't worry.

223
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,000
We won't let them go.

224
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,200
Don't let them go.

225
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,400
They are all going to...

226
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,040
Take the wife back to the room.

227
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,800
When it's hot, let's open the door.

228
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,760
Okay.

229
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,240
Let's go back.

230
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,000
Let them go.

231
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,800
Let them go.

232
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,600
Go.

233
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,960
Where are these dogs?

234
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,000
They are so fast.

235
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,200
Let's go to the control room.

236
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:35,200
There's no other control room in this small area.

237
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,200
Let's go.

238
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,600
Let's go.

239
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,600
Uncle Chang.

240
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,600
Don't be impulsive.

241
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,800
We'll go back later.

242
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,600
I'll make you a good wife.

243
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,400
Okay.

244
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,600
Don't be impulsive.

245
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,600
Okay.

246
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,600
Okay.

247
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,600
You can't see Jia Zhuang, right?

248
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,600
Come on.

249
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,600
Please show us your ID.

250
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,600
I didn't bring it.

251
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,600
Then give me your ID.

252
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,600
Sorry.

253
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,600
I don't remember.

254
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,600
That's great.

255
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,600
We'll send you to the control room.

256
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,600
Let's continue the investigation.

257
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,600
You are so impulsive.

258
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,600
Hurry up.

259
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,600
What are you doing?

260
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,600
Police.

261
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,600
This is the ID.

262
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,600
Hurry up.

263
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,600
Okay.

264
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,600
Hurry up.

265
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,600
What have you been doing lately?

266
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,600
Nothing.

267
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,600
Nothing?

268
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,600
Just ask me.

269
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,600
We are chatting.

270
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,600
Officer.

271
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,600
Don't scare me.

272
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,600
I'm a little girl.

273
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,600
Tell us.

274
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,600
What have we done wrong?

275
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,600
Can we change it?

276
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,600
Don't be impulsive.

277
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,600
The price of the road is low.

278
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
You are ruining public property.

279
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,600
No.

280
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,600
This is the control room.

281
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,600
Did you see it?

282
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,600
You didn't see it.

283
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,600
Why did you say that?

284
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,600
We are in their house.

285
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,600
Who said that?

286
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,600
Do you have evidence?

287
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,600
Yes.

288
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,600
Do you have evidence?

289
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,600
Who saw it?

290
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,600
Don't frame a good person.

291
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,600
I...

292
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,600
I'm just saying.

293
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,600
I'm just saying.

294
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,600
Okay.

295
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,600
Do you really think we don't have evidence?

296
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,600
I'm warning you.

297
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,600
I hope you don't commit crimes.

298
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,600
If you two

299
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,600
don't take our business as a matter of honor,

300
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,600
you two can continue the investigation.

301
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,600
You mean this?

302
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,600
We are not in the mood for this.

303
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,600
Officer.

304
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,600
If you have this kind of evidence,

305
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,600
come here.

306
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,600
If you take us away,

307
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,600
if you don't have evidence,

308
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,600
I'm sorry.

309
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,600
Don't block the way.

310
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,600
I'm afraid.

311
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,600
Let's go home.

312
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,600
You are awake.

313
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,600
Let's go back to the camp.

314
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,600
I'm telling you.

315
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,600
We will find the evidence.

316
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,600
Okay.

317
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,600
When you find the evidence,

318
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,600
we will leave.

319
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,600
Bye bye.

320
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,600
You can come.

321
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,600
Master.

322
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,600
Listen.

323
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,600
You have to accompany me.

324
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,600
Take care of the house.

325
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,600
We don't care about our own son.

326
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,600
We don't care about our own son.

327
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,600
We care about them.

328
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,600
I don't want to tell you.

329
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,600
You can't tell?

330
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,600
His son has a lot of friends.

331
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,600
You think you can solve it

332
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,600
by yourself?

333
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,600
Let me talk to you.

334
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,600
Listen.

335
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,600
Be more diligent.

336
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,600
He is now

337
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,600
in the bed.

338
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,600
Master.

339
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,600
I can't do this.

340
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,600
I haven't given up on my own.

341
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,600
You have to give up on your own.

342
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,600
You can't do this.

343
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,600
You can't do this.

344
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,600
Before the problem is solved,

345
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,600
you can stay here.

346
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,600
You can't go anywhere.

347
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,600
Why are you following me?

348
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,600
Go back.

349
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,600
He is in my hands.

350
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,600
Why are you

351
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,600
so nervous

352
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,600
when you hit him?

353
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,600
Why are you

354
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,600
so nervous?

355
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,600
Doctor.

356
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,600
Yes.

357
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,600
Doctor.

358
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,600
What's the matter?

359
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,600
He is in bed.

360
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,600
Send someone to clean up for us.

361
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,600
Officer,

362
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,600
you saw it.

363
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,600
I am alone now.

364
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,600
I can't only take care of

365
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,600
him.

366
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,600
Call his family.

367
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,600
I am alone now.

368
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,600
I am alone now.

369
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,600
I am so tired.

370
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,600
I am so tired.

371
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,600
I am so tired.

372
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,600
You guys go to the toilet.

373
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,600
I will clean up.

374
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,600
Come on.

375
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,600
Thank you for coming.

376
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,600
Thank you.

377
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,600
You deserve it.

378
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,600
Don't do too much.

379
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,600
I will clean up for you.

380
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,600
Thank you.

381
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,600
Get up.

382
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,600
I will change my new bed.

383
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,600
Doctor.

384
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,600
If you don't cooperate with him,

385
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,600
I will not bother him.

386
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,600
You are so sleepy.

387
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,600
Get up.

388
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,600
Get up.

389
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,600
I am so tired.

390
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,600
Get up.

391
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,600
Okay.

392
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,600
You are wearing the same clothes.

393
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,600
Okay.

394
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,600
Get up.

395
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,600
Okay.

396
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,600
Okay.

397
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,600
Doctor, this...

398
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,600
The doctor is over there.

399
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,600
Okay.

400
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,600
Okay.

401
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,600
Let me see one more.

402
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,600
Look.

403
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,600
You...

404
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,600
Chief.

405
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,600
Jin Jun.

406
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,600
Where are you?

407
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,600
We are looking at

408
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,600
the construction site of Liu Xiang's house.

409
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,600
What's going on?

410
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,600
The Sun family is so cunning.

411
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,600
They are on the road to the construction site.

412
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,600
They don't have any evidence of the value.

413
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,600
Jin Jun.

414
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,600
The people can't live a normal life.

415
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,600
They can't get any security.

416
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,600
The whole life is in this panic.

417
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,600
We are in a terrible situation.

418
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,600
The information can't be found again.

419
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,600
Chief.

420
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,600
We don't want to see this.

421
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,600
The situation will continue.

422
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,600
I feel ashamed to say that we are in a terrible situation.

423
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,600
I can't let our Sun family

424
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,600
get all the evidence.

425
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,600
Do you have any evidence?

426
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,600
I know you will do this.

427
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,600
There is no war now.

428
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,600
But we can't let this kind of behavior

429
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,600
continue to be a long-term situation.

430
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,600
Jin Jun.

431
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,600
Jin Jun.

432
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,600
I have two points.

433
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,600
First, I have already said it.

434
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,600
Second.

435
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,600
Second is to find a way

436
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,600
to break through the history of the Ming dynasty as soon as possible.

437
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,600
First, solve it.

438
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,600
First, let the people come back to the normal life.

439
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,600
We must do something.

440
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,600
Right?

441
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,600
Yes.

442
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,600
I agree.

443
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,600
Chief.

444
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,600
Cheng Suo called me.

445
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,600
Is there any breakthrough in her?

446
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,600
Okay, you go first.

447
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,600
Cheng Suo, you go first.

448
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,600
Drink some water.

449
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,600
Let you know

450
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,600
the power of our Ma family.

451
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,600
How dare I disturb them?

452
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,600
I heard that their children

453
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,600
are not good at all.

454
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,600
My son opened a car repair shop.

455
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,600
My son opened a restaurant.

456
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,600
In the previous part of the

457
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,600
early-black-cooking operation,

458
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,600
many clues were pointed at this brother.

459
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,600
I am not good enough.

460
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,600
I haven't got enough time.

461
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,600
I just want to investigate thoroughly.

462
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,600
You are here to force me.

463
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,600
So, the solution is to go to the theater.

464
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,600
Liang Suo.

465
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,600
We have to help our sister

466
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,600
with this festival.

467
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,600
I said this period is so quiet.

468
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,600
It was a waste of time.

469
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,600
Can you let them

470
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,600
make a fuss about you?

471
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,600
No, no, no.

472
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,600
You are making me feel bad.

473
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,600
You want me to repair the house.

474
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,600
By the way,

475
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,600
her son is not a

476
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,600
good daughter.

477
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,600
Second daughter's son is also a doctor.

478
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,600
Doctor?

479
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,600
Is this an important clue?

480
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,600
But this clue is from the development department.

481
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,600
I can't do it.

482
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,600
I will handle this.

483
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,600
But you have to

484
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,600
take care of the two sons.

485
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,600
I will take care of it.

486
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,600
I will take care of it.

487
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,600
I will take care of this.

488
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,600
If you don't take care of it,

489
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,600
you will be independent.

490
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,600
By the way,

491
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,600
the annual full-time balance

492
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,600
is on the Paris River.

493
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,600
I will report you.

494
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,600
You will report me?

495
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,600
Even if I have such a line,

496
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,600
our ranking

497
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,600
is also in front of the Paris River.

498
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,600
You are still doing it in Paris River.

499
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,600
I didn't think about it.

500
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,600
Why are you afraid of it?

501
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,600
At least the young girls.

502
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,600
You come to my place.

503
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,600
We will be in charge.

504
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,600
Next year,

505
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,600
the full-time balance of the Marga collage

506
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,600
will be on the new high.

507
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,600
You will also be in charge of the future.

508
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,600
Forget it.

509
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,600
I am not a person

510
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,600
who is a water-based Yang Hua.

511
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,600
We have the Paris River

512
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,600
to enjoy.

513
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,600
Mr. Liang,

514
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,600
this matter is on your side.

515
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,600
No problem.

516
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,600
Thank you.

517
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,600
Xia Jie.

518
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,600
By the way,

519
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,600
I forgot to introduce.

520
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,600
Xia Jie's father

521
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,600
is my master,

522
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,600
Mr. Xia Jun.

523
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,600
I am so sorry.

524
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,600
Why didn't you say it earlier?

525
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,600
Miss,

526
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,600
how are you and your mother?

527
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,600
I am fine.

528
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,600
You have grown up.

529
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,600
You have become more and more beautiful.

530
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,600
Your father will be

531
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,600
famous

532
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,600
in the next 9,000 years.

533
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,600
Thank you, Mr. Liang.

534
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,600
We are leaving.

535
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,600
You have to take good care of Xia for me.

536
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,600
Yes.

537
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,600
Let's go.

538
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,600
This way.

539
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,600
Mr. Liang.

540
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,600
Mr. Liang.

541
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,600
Mr. Liang.

542
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,600
Take care of your mother.

543
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,600
Mr. Liang, sit here.

544
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,600
Okay.

545
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,600
I will go and cook for you.

546
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,600
Okay.

547
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,600
This is the old food.

548
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,600
This is the old food.

549
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,600
This is the old food.

550
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,600
This is the old food.

551
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,600
Master, here you are.

552
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,600
You sit here.

553
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,600
This is not right.

554
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,600
You sit here.

555
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,600
You sit here.

556
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,600
This is not right.

557
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,600
You sit here.

558
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,600
Li Dawei, you are a good boy.

559
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,600
Hey, drink this.

560
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,600
What?

561
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,600
I am a colleague.

562
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,600
He is not a good boy.

563
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,600
We have already decided.

564
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,600
The shop is on the way.

565
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,600
Right?

566
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,600
Our colleague is running

567
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,600
for his first treasure.

568
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,600
We even ordered

569
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,600
to send him to the hospital

570
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,600
to eat gauze and gauze.

571
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,600
What else?

572
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,600
We are helping him.

573
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,600
We have already made money.

574
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,600
We have already done

575
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,600
the human-made plan.

576
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,600
What else do we have?

577
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,600
What is going on?

578
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,600
Okay, don't worry about it.

579
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,600
Eat something.

580
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,600
I will take care of it.

581
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,600
My hand is a bit numb.

582
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,600
When is the meeting?

583
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,600
Come and have a look.

584
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,600
I have something to talk to you.

585
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,600
The bus that we were handling

586
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,600
was in a mess.

587
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,600
Here, have a look.

588
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,600
Well,

589
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,600
Wang's son

590
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,600
didn't recognize him.

591
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,600
He left his old man

592
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,600
in the hospital.

593
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,600
Xingcheng is running the shop

594
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,600
every day

595
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,600
to pick him up to the hospital.

596
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,600
He just wants to

597
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,600
do the medical care

598
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,600
for him.

599
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,600
He is not done yet.

600
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,600
David Li is taking care of him

601
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,600
in the hospital every day.

602
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,600
He just called the hospital.

603
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,600
He said he didn't pay the hospital bills.

604
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,600
He asked us

605
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,600
to take him back.

606
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,600
I thought

607
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,600
that this matter

608
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,600
could be solved.

609
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,600
But it's a matter of time.

610
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,600
Now that we have

611
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,600
reached this conclusion,

612
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,600
we can't

613
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,600
ignore him,

614
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,600
right?

615
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,600
So, there is no way.

616
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,600
I think

617
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,600
we should

618
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,600
send a witness

619
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,600
to the hospital.

620
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,600
We should pay

621
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,600
the hospital bills first.

622
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,600
As for the other problems,

623
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,600
they will be solved,

624
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,600
right?

625
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,600
What's wrong?

626
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,600
Are you all mute?

627
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,600
You're not talking?

628
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,600
Just treat it as a blessing

629
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,600
for your father, okay?

630
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,600
If you're in the hospital today,

631
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,600
you won't get the money.

632
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,600
Chief,

633
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,600
don't say that.

634
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,600
We don't have

635
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,600
such a father.

636
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,600
That's right.

637
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,600
He doesn't care about his son.

638
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,600
Why do we care?

639
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,600
Chief,

640
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,600
I'm not the one

641
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,600
who pays the bills.

642
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,600
You...

643
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,600
Listen.

644
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,600
I have more than one thousand yuan.

645
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,600
I'll take the money first.

646
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,600
Just eat it.

647
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,600
Help me

648
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,600
to make it easy, okay?

649
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,600
Thank you for your help.

650
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,600
Think about it.

651
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,600
If the patient dies,

652
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,600
it will be harder to solve the problem,

653
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,600
right?

654
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,600
We're not doing this for him.

655
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,600
We're doing this for work.

656
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,600
Okay?

657
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,600
Comrades?

658
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,600
Don't take so much.

659
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,600
This case is my case.

660
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,600
I can't handle it.

661
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,600
How is everyone?

662
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,600
How is it?

663
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,600
Chief,

664
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,600
thank you for your help.

665
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,600
Thank you for your help.

666
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,600
Thank you for your help.

667
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,600
Thank you for your help.

668
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,600
Let's pay the bills.

669
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,600
Okay.

670
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,600
Okay.

671
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,600
Du,

672
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,600
come and register.

673
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,600
Okay.

674
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,600
Come on.

675
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,600
Make a record.

676
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,600
Okay.

677
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,600
I'll pay the bill.

678
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,600
I have more money.

679
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,600
I'll pay the bill.

680
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,600
I'll pay the bill.

681
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,600
Okay.

682
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,600
Okay, I'll pay 500.

683
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,600
I'll pay 500 for Xia Jie.

684
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,600
No need, master.

685
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,600
I'll pay it myself.

686
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,600
It's okay.

687
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,600
I'll pay it clearly.

688
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,600
I'll pay 500.

689
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,600
I'll pay it later.

690
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,600
Okay.

691
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,600
300.

692
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,600
Chief,

693
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,600
we're here to pay the bill.

694
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,600
200.

695
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,600
Chief,

696
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,600
this is the face of the year.

697
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,600
Please don't.

698
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,600
Thank you.

699
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,600
I'll pay the bill.

700
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,600
Chief,

701
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,600
I'll pay the bill.

702
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,600
Thank you.

703
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,600
Why are you here?

704
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,600
Come and see.

705
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,600
How is it?

706
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,600
I thought you were a police officer.

707
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,600
You were a security guard.

708
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,600
I didn't expect you to be a police officer.

709
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,600
You're a police officer?

710
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,600
Did you take pictures?

711
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,600
I didn't.

712
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,600
I didn't.

713
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,600
I didn't.

714
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,600
I didn't.

715
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,600
I didn't.

716
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,600
I didn't.

717
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,600
I didn't.

718
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,600
I didn't.

719
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,600
I didn't.

720
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,600
What pictures do you take?

721
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,600
You don't take pictures.

722
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,600
How can the leader see this?

723
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,600
You did so many things.

724
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,600
You just did it.

725
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,600
I've told you on the Internet.

726
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,600
When you work,

727
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,600
especially when you work overtime at night,

728
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,600
you'll have a lot of flour and a bag of fried vegetables.

729
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,600
That's the best thing about a friend's circle.

730
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,600
You've cut off your tongue.

731
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,600
That's the chance of a hundred years of friendship.

732
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,600
Zhao Jiuyun,

733
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,600
you little heart.

734
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,600
Da Bei,

735
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,600
where's the plate?

736
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,600
I'll go get it.

737
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,600
I'll get it for you.

738
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,600
I'll leave the plate for you.

739
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,600
I'll leave it for you.

740
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,600
I'll send it back to you.

741
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,600
Okay?

742
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,600
Okay.

743
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,600
I want you to check that for me.

744
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,600
Have you checked it?

745
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,600
Yes.

746
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,600
Here.

747
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,600
Look.

748
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,600
I've checked it.

749
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,600
Is this a home bag?

750
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,600
Da Bei,

751
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,600
you should take a nap.

752
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,600
Isn't this old man so strict?

753
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,600
Every time,

754
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,600
the teacher is so strict.

755
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,600
He's been a wife since he got married.

756
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,600
It's been many years.

757
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,600
This old lady

758
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,600
has been beaten up by him.

759
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,600
This kind of person

760
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,600
is not related to the life.

761
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,600
It's related to the woman.

762
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,600
It's related to the lock.

763
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,600
This lock is for everyone to make money for him.

764
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,600
Your master has donated 500 yuan.

765
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,600
The lock doesn't let him make that much.

766
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,600
Your master said

767
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,600
that this is his case.

768
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,600
He didn't take good care of it.

769
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,600
He should have donated that much.

770
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,600
What kind of money is this?

771
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,600
Didn't he give up on his life?

772
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,600
He's donating money.

773
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,600
You didn't donate it?

774
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,600
I didn't donate it.

775
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,600
Let me tell you this.

776
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,600
Let me tell you this.

777
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,600
I've been through this day

778
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,600
and I've seen what you've been looking for.

779
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,600
I can understand

780
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,600
why his son doesn't show up.

781
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,600
Why don't you take care of him?

782
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,600
If I were him,

783
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,600
I wouldn't come here.

784
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,600
Why did you want to do

785
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,600
what you were young?

786
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,600
You were old,

787
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,600
and you were weak.

788
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,600
You forced your own child to donate.

789
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,600
That's not the point.

790
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,600
Alright.

791
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,600
I'll ask my mother-in-law to help me.

792
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,600
Well,

793
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,600
you go.

794
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,600
I'll help you.

795
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,600
Go home and take a shower.

796
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,600
And change your clothes.

797
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,600
Why are you helping me?

798
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,600
It has nothing to do with you.

799
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,600
Does this have anything to do with you?

800
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,600
It has nothing to do with you.

801
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,600
It has nothing to do with me.

802
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,600
Besides,

803
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,600
I donated 50 yuan.

804
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,600
I don't have money.

805
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,600
But I have interest.

806
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,600
I have money to pay.

807
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,600
I have interest.

808
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,600
Besides,

809
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,600
my grandpa

810
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,600
was in bed for two years

811
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,600
when he left.

812
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,600
I did it by myself.

813
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,600
Right.

814
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,600
Don't you

815
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,600
work for these emotional things

816
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,600
with me.

817
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,600
Da-Da-Bei,

818
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,600
you gave me your room.

819
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,600
You even helped me

820
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,600
to save the house.

821
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,600
Really.

822
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,600
It's all here.

823
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,600
I was in the police station

824
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,600
for so many years.

825
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,600
I didn't have a good friend.

826
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,600
I didn't expect

827
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,600
to see you and uncle

828
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,600
in our place.

829
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,600
I don't listen.

830
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,600
I don't like to listen to these emotional things.

831
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,600
Wei Wei, listen to me.

832
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,600
No.

833
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,600
After you lose the room,

834
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,600
you sleep there.

835
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,600
Alright?

836
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,600
No.

837
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,600
I don't mean that.

838
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,600
I don't mean that either.

839
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,600
I just want to keep

840
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,600
a safe distance with you.

841
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,600
Thank you.

842
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,600
Okay.

843
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,600
One.

844
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,600
Here you are.

845
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,600
I'm calling my master

846
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,600
to tell him about this.

847
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,600
I'll be right back.

848
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,600
Okay.

849
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,600
I'll get my clothes.

850
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,600
Thank you, bro.

851
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,600
I'm sorry.

852
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,600
Hello, master.

853
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,600
I need to do something.

854
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,600
There's a long-term report

855
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,600
for the police station.

856
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,600
I know.

857
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,600
You know?

858
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,600
What else?

859
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,600
The police station is here.

860
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,600
They said they'll help me.

861
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,600
I know.

862
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,600
You know that too?

863
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,600
What else?

864
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,600
Nothing.

865
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,600
That's all.

866
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,600
Listen.

867
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,600
It's 323 Road Traffic 4G.

868
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,600
You know?

869
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,600
323?

870
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,600
What do you mean?

871
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,600
323?

872
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,600
I just think it's really dirty.

873
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,600
There's no such thing as a toilet.

874
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,600
They're blocking the door to find the address.

875
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,600
They're shouting,

876
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,600
scolding,

877
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,600
and ruining the company's finance.

878
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,600
What difference does it make

879
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,600
with the Black Society?

880
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,600
You asked me

881
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,600
to make money for them.

882
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,600
Chief.

883
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,600
I'm quite experienced

884
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,600
when I'm talking.

885
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,600
You know, I used to have

886
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,600
a lot of problems.

887
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,600
When did you get soft?

888
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,600
How come

889
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,600
you can't make this family?

890
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,600
Gao Cheng.

891
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,600
You're still the vice president

892
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,600
of the executive committee.

893
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,600
You have evidence.

894
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,600
What evidence

895
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,600
can you prove to your grandson?

896
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,600
We're all doing what we should do.

897
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,600
But you have to give us time.

898
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,600
You have time?

899
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,600
Do you have time for the two of you?

900
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,600
You're working every day

901
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,600
to make sure

902
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,600
that you're not dead.

903
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,600
You say?

904
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,600
I'll say it clearly.

905
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,600
The first step is the order.

906
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,600
You're going to solve the problem first.

907
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,600
Jiang Jun.

908
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,600
I think you're right.

909
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,600
How about this?

910
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,600
You should solve it in a hurry.

911
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,600
And solve it with me.

912
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,600
You'll be in trouble

913
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,600
if you don't eat the food.

914
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,600
Am I right?

915
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,600
I'll cooperate with you.

916
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,600
Hurry up and make

917
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,600
the decision

918
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,600
to attack Black Society.

919
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,600
Okay?

920
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,600
That's right.

921
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,600
Okay.

922
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,600
I'll make it clear.

923
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,600
Let's have a meeting.

924
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,600
Wait a minute.

925
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,600
Do you have anything else?

926
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,600
Chief.

927
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,600
The two of you are here.

928
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,600
Chief.

929
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,600
The two of you.

930
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,600
Come on.

931
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,600
Chief.

932
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,600
Chief.

933
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,600
The two of you are here.

934
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,600
The two of you

935
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,600
are here for the night.

936
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,600
I'm so glad to see you.

937
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,600
Thank you.

938
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,600
Thank you.

939
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,600
I'm not here

940
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,600
because you're the one who's scared.

941
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,600
I'm not scared of you.

942
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,600
I'm even more scared of you.

943
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,600
You're...

944
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,600
We're from the Barrier and the Pact.

945
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,600
We're honored

946
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,600
to be able to be

947
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,600
a part of Black Society.

948
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,600
We're honored.

949
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,600
Right, Jianjun.

950
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,600
You should give

951
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,600
the materials of the Sun family

952
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,600
to Liang Suo.

953
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,600
My materials

954
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,600
are not perfect.

955
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,600
There are so many details.

956
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,600
Jianjun.

957
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,600
Didn't we say

958
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,600
that we're working with

959
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,600
Ma Jia-gou

960
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,600
to cooperate with them?

961
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,600
The one who's right

962
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,600
is the one who's black.

963
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,600
It's just that

964
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,600
we're fighting and fighting.

965
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,600
We're fighting and fighting.

966
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,600
That's right.

967
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,600
I see.

968
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,600
Chief,

969
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,600
wait a minute.

970
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,600
I'll get the materials.

971
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,600
Liang Suo.

972
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,600
Liang Suo.

973
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,600
Don't say that.

974
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,600
Sit down.

975
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,600
How did you find this?

976
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,600
I know you're used to it.

977
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,600
Get the car.

978
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,600
Go home after you finish eating.

979
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,600
Don't waste your time.

980
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,600
I won't care

981
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,600
if he says anything.

982
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,600
Don't be too hard on yourself.

983
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,600
Your noodles are ready.

984
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,600
Thank you.

985
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,600
I can understand you.

986
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,600
I've checked your report.

987
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,600
I know

988
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,600
that your dad did something

989
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,600
to your mom.

990
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,600
This kind of thing

991
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,600
happens to anyone.

992
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,600
It's the same as that.

993
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,600
But now there's no way

994
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,600
to do it.

995
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,600
I'm sorry.

996
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,600
I'm sorry.

997
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,600
But now there's no way.

998
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,600
Your dad has been hospitalized.

999
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,600
If you can save him,

1000
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,600
he can still live.

1001
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,600
If you don't,

1002
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,600
what should we do?

1003
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,600
He'll die.

1004
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,600
In your opinion,

1005
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,600
I'm a dresser.

1006
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,600
I'm not allowed to

1007
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,600
talk to you about this.

1008
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,600
But I can really understand you.

1009
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,600
Because my dad is a bastard.

1010
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,600
He's been doing his own business

1011
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,600
since he was a kid.

1012
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,600
He's never been honest with my mom.

1013
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,600
He lied to my mom.

1014
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,600
He's been living a life without a reason.

1015
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,600
My mom is very lucky.

1016
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,600
Han Xin and his father are very lucky.

1017
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,600
It's not like everyone else

1018
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,600
can stand it.

1019
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,600
The most important thing is

1020
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,600
that this old thing

1021
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,600
is still missing.

1022
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,600
Just a moment ago,

1023
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,600
I almost did something

1024
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,600
because of my dad.

1025
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,600
I took off my uniform.

1026
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,600
I've never told anyone

1027
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,600
about this.

1028
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,600
I've never told anyone

1029
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,600
about this.

1030
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,600
I've never told anyone

1031
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,600
about this.

1032
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,600
I've never told anyone

1033
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,600
about this.

1034
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,600
I really want

1035
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,600
people to know

1036
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,600
that I can really understand

1037
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,600
your feelings.

1038
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,600
If it wasn't for the duty,

1039
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,600
I wouldn't have come to persuade you.

1040
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,600
Even if I come to persuade you,

1041
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,600
you're just

1042
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,600
doing your own business.

1043
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,600
If you don't listen to me,

1044
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,600
I can understand.

1045
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,600
I can understand.

1046
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,600
He's older than my mom.

1047
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,600
He's always so quiet

1048
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,600
to come to my mom.

1049
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,600
He started to quarrel.

1050
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,600
Then he started to scold me.

1051
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,600
The more I scolded him, the more I felt bad.

1052
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,600
Then he started to drink.

1053
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,600
After drinking, he started to hit my mom.

1054
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,600
The more I drank,

1055
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,600
the more I was hit.

1056
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,600
I finally grew up.

1057
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,600
I accepted my mom.

1058
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,600
Then my mom died.

1059
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,600
I was afraid that she would be

1060
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,600
suffering alone.

1061
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,600
I also accepted her.

1062
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,600
Then what did you do?

1063
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,600
She took my child's life

1064
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,600
and then my mom kneeled down.

1065
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,600
She kneeled down.

1066
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,600
Then she took my child's life.

1067
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,600
My son was only one year old.

1068
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,600
He just learned to walk.

1069
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,600
Wait.

1070
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,600
There's one more thing I have to tell you.

1071
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,600
This is not the first time he's been in trouble.

1072
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,600
It's the second time.

1073
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,600
Both times are on your bed.

1074
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,600
Three, two, three.

1075
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,600
Boss, this is for you.

1076
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,600
Master, why are you here?

1077
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,600
Let's go back.

1078
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,600
I'm sorry.

1079
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,600
I'm sorry.

1080
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:19,600
I'm sorry.

1081
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,600
I'm sorry.

1082
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,600
I'm sorry.

1083
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,600
I'm sorry.

1084
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:26,600
I'm sorry.

1085
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:28,600
I'm sorry.

1086
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,600
I'm sorry.

1087
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,600
I'm sorry.

1088
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:36,600
I'm sorry.

1089
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:38,600
I'm sorry.

1090
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,600
I'm sorry.

1091
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:42,600
I'm sorry.

1092
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,600
I'm sorry.

1093
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:46,600
I'm sorry.
