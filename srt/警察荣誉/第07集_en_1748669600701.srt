1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I

5
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,040
I

6
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,120
This is the scene we took. I was on the way to the clinic with my master.

7
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,120
When I got to the scene, it was 10.42.

8
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,120
When I arrived at the scene, it was about 11 o'clock.

9
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,200
At that time, people said he was fighting with his husband.

10
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,200
His husband left home.

11
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,200
His mobile phone was off and couldn't find anyone.

12
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,200
But he also suggested that his husband went to their villa.

13
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,200
He told us to go to his villa to see.

14
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,200
When we arrived there,

15
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,200
we just had to make sure that his husband's car was parked in the yard.

16
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,200
We didn't knock on the door or call him.

17
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,200
He was afraid that we would disturb his husband's rest.

18
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,200
The scene was recorded.

19
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,200
He also signed the document.

20
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,200
Zhen Jun.

21
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,200
What's wrong with you?

22
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,200
I'm sorry.

23
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,200
I'm sorry.

24
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,200
What's wrong?

25
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,200
I saw his husband in the car this morning.

26
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,200
I saw his husband in the car this morning.

27
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,200
Why didn't you go to the car park?

28
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,200
Why didn't you go to the car park?

29
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,200
What?

30
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,200
Yes, Uncle Yang.

31
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,200
I just answered your phone.

32
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,200
Why didn't you go to the car park?

33
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,200
No, master.

34
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,280
How could I go in and see if the car parked in the yard?

35
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,280
Yes.

36
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,280
There was a yard in their villa.

37
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,280
They knocked on the door.

38
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,280
We couldn't go in.

39
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,280
We couldn't go in.

40
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,360
It's okay.

41
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,360
It's clear.

42
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,360
He signed the document.

43
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,360
We don't have any responsibility.

44
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,360
But you two have to be prepared.

45
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,360
This woman is now one-sided.

46
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,360
She's not a criminal.

47
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,360
She's a criminal.

48
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,360
She's a criminal.

49
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,360
She's a criminal.

50
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,360
She's a criminal.

51
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,360
She's a criminal.

52
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,440
This woman is now one-sided.

53
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,440
It's because the police are not responsible.

54
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,440
It caused her husband's death.

55
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,440
You two have to go see her.

56
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,440
I'll take this list.

57
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,440
I'll go talk to her.

58
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,440
I'm not afraid.

59
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,440
I'm not afraid of her.

60
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,440
I was sure about it.

61
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,440
I called her and confirmed it.

62
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,440
I have a recording.

63
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,440
Okay.

64
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,440
You listen to the chief.

65
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,440
You're afraid of responsibility, right?

66
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,520
Since it's all my fault,

67
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,520
I'll go with you.

68
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,520
Forget it.

69
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,520
You go with me.

70
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,520
Uncle Yang.

71
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,520
I'm not in a mood.

72
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,520
Her husband died.

73
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,520
It's because after she quarreled with him,

74
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,520
he couldn't think of dying.

75
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,600
He wanted to find a scapegoat.

76
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,600
You know?

77
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,600
Don't go to the mental hospital.

78
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,600
I remember it wasn't at that time.

79
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,600
I remember it was me.

80
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,600
It's our internal affairs.

81
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,600
Our internal solution.

82
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,600
In front of the people's community.

83
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,600
Don't show up.

84
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,600
Chief, I know what the National Bureau is.

85
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
Let's go.

86
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,600
Hello, ma'am.

87
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,600
I'm Wang Shuyi.

88
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,600
Let's talk slowly.

89
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,600
Okay.

90
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,600
Master.

91
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,600
I'm sorry for what happened yesterday.

92
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,600
I can't stand it.

93
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,600
You still say I'm angry?

94
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,600
I dare not.

95
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,600
Besides,

96
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,600
I'm not your master.

97
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,600
Master, I'm really bitter.

98
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,600
I don't want to tell you.

99
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,600
Lianping, I'm still bitter.

100
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,600
I want to go to the dorm.

101
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,600
Go upstairs and ask the chief to go to the dorm.

102
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,600
I've told the chief.

103
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,600
Okay,

104
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,600
I'll go two more times.

105
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,600
You're not easy to raise a parents' daughter.

106
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,600
The more you can't.

107
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,600
Then.

108
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,600
You're not your parents.

109
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,600
Yes.

110
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,600
Master.

111
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,600
You're the same.

112
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,600
You're not my master.

113
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,600
You are my master.

114
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,600
Okay, okay.

115
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,600
Just say it.

116
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,600
From your mouth,

117
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,600
we are all...

118
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,600
Uncle,

119
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,600
I have a deep feeling

120
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,600
about this.

121
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,600
I made a mistake.

122
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,600
I have a bad thinking.

123
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,600
I have a bad political sense.

124
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,600
I forgot the responsibility of the People's Police.

125
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,600
You mean,

126
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,600
you write a three-word sentence for me?

127
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,600
No.

128
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,600
Fine, no need to check.

129
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,600
I mean,

130
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,600
you can torture me.

131
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,600
You torture me.

132
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,600
You can kill me.

133
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,600
I have made a new

134
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,600
psychological preparation for improving my thinking.

135
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,600
Okay,

136
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,600
then...

137
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,600
put these things in order.

138
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,600
Come.

139
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,600
Take a step.

140
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,600
Take care of it.

141
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,600
Okay.

142
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,600
I told Wang that

143
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,600
I called the police.

144
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,600
He went to my villa.

145
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,600
Why didn't you go in?

146
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,600
My husband is dead.

147
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,600
What should I do?

148
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,600
Ma, you...

149
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,600
Ma, you...

150
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,600
Well,

151
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,600
look.

152
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,600
This is a key ring.

153
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,600
It has your name on it.

154
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,600
You asked us to

155
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,600
check if your husband's car is still there.

156
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,600
If the car is still there,

157
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,600
don't knock.

158
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,600
Don't call.

159
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,600
Don't disturb his rest.

160
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,600
According to your request,

161
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,600
we have already

162
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,600
taken care of the case.

163
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,600
Uncle Yang,

164
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,600
didn't you call Ma

165
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,600
at the villa?

166
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,600
Did you record the audio?

167
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,600
Yes, I did.

168
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,600
Not only recording,

169
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,600
but also recording.

170
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,600
This is your villa.

171
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,600
The door was locked.

172
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,600
We can only go outside.

173
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,600
We saw your car

174
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,600
parked inside the yard.

175
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,600
Look.

176
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,600
And this is the recording

177
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,600
we called back then.

178
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,600
Listen.

179
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,600
Hello.

180
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,600
Hello, Dr. Ma.

181
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,600
This is the police station

182
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,600
near the Paris Heal Center.

183
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,600
The villa you mentioned is already there.

184
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,600
Your husband's car is parked inside the yard.

185
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,600
We don't need to go in

186
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,600
or call him.

187
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,600
His car parked inside the yard.

188
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,600
Did you confirm his car?

189
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,600
Yes, it's 0158080.

190
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,600
That's good.

191
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,600
Don't call him.

192
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,600
Don't disturb his rest.

193
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,600
Thank you.

194
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,600
Let me confirm it with you.

195
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,600
As long as you see the car parked inside the yard,

196
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,600
that's fine.

197
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,600
We don't need to go in

198
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,600
or call him.

199
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,600
Right?

200
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,600
Yes.

201
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,600
Okay. Bye.

202
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,600
But...

203
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,600
But he's not dead in the yard.

204
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,600
But he's dead in the car.

205
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,600
The car was still moving.

206
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,600
He was making noise.

207
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,600
Can't you hear it?

208
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,600
Why can't you hear the car?

209
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,600
Just take a look.

210
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,600
Dr. Ma,

211
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,600
we didn't hear the car

212
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,600
when we were there.

213
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,600
The yard was a bit far from the car.

214
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,600
We didn't hear the car.

215
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,600
We really didn't hear it.

216
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,600
If we heard it,

217
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,600
we wouldn't have been saved.

218
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,600
You're saying we wouldn't have been saved?

219
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,600
If you went there

220
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,600
and looked at it,

221
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,600
would I be able to take care of him?

222
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,600
Oh, my God.

223
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,600
You're a good person.

224
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,600
You're a good person.

225
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,600
What should I do after you become a good person?

226
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,600
I'm so mad!

227
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,600
Ma.

228
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,600
Ma.

229
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,600
Control your emotions.

230
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,600
Ma.

231
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,600
Control your emotions.

232
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,600
We don't believe in you.

233
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,600
We're just friends.

234
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,600
But we can't deal with it.

235
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,600
There's no problem.

236
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,600
What do you mean?

237
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,600
I'm just afraid

238
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,600
that I'll be able to take care of you

239
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,600
if I don't talk to you.

240
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,600
What about you?

241
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,600
You're so mean.

242
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,600
You're not taking your life

243
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,600
as a return.

244
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,600
You're not responsible.

245
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,600
If he goes there and looks,

246
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,600
would I be able to kill him?

247
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,600
Ma.

248
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,600
If you think so,

249
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,600
you'll be punished.

250
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,600
What do you mean?

251
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,600
Do you think

252
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,600
it's his leadership

253
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,600
and his left-wing?

254
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,600
You want to protect him?

255
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,600
Why don't you teach him a lesson?

256
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,600
Fine.

257
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,600
If you don't teach him a lesson,

258
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,600
I'll find another team to teach you.

259
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,600
Ma.

260
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,600
Ma.

261
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,600
His family is dead.

262
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,600
It's hard to control his emotions.

263
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,600
Uncle Yang,

264
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,600
where's your master?

265
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,600
Why isn't he here?

266
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,600
It seems

267
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,600
he won't go to the bar to repair it.

268
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,600
Maybe he'll go out for a few days.

269
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,600
Or maybe

270
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,600
he'll go to the police.

271
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,600
It's raining again.

272
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,600
His mother is getting married.

273
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,600
Our cleanliness is

274
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,600
a good thing.

275
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,600
We're not guilty.

276
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,600
He's going to make trouble.

277
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,600
Let him make trouble.

278
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,600
Mr. Wang,

279
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,600
Mr. Ye.

280
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,600
Uncle Yang,

281
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,600
give me the police report of the case yesterday.

282
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,600
Zhenzhen.

283
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,600
Go to the hospital to send the drug-saving team

284
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,600
to find out about Ma's head-saving.

285
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,600
You go in and report the situation.

286
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,600
It's mainly Uncle Yang's fault.

287
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,600
Or is it Master?

288
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,600
You're the master. You go.

289
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,600
Yes.

290
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,600
Come.

291
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,600
The car you're looking for is parked in the yard.

292
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,600
We're going to see the worker now.

293
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,600
Call her and ask her.

294
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,600
She's parked in the yard.

295
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,600
Yes, 015 8080.

296
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,600
Don't bother her.

297
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,600
Don't disturb her.

298
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,600
As long as you see the car parked in the yard,

299
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,600
it's fine.

300
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,600
We don't need to go in and see it.

301
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,600
We don't need to see the call.

302
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,600
Right?

303
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,600
Yes.

304
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,600
Okay. Goodbye.

305
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,600
Here's the thing.

306
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,600
Your materials are very stable.

307
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,600
From the evidence,

308
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,600
there's no problem in your handling.

309
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,600
Of course,

310
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,600
if you could go and see it in the car,

311
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,600
it would be better.

312
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,600
Tuo,

313
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,600
it's easy to be a driver.

314
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,600
The driver

315
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,600
clearly wants our clean-up

316
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,600
not to disturb his wife's rest.

317
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,600
How can we think about our clean-up?

318
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,600
He's not in the car.

319
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,600
Okay.

320
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,600
We're not sure.

321
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,600
Your treatment

322
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,600
is not in the right place.

323
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,600
We'll report it to the police.

324
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,600
It should be fine.

325
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,600
Okay. Thank you.

326
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,600
We'll go back first.

327
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,600
Okay.

328
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,600
Uncle,

329
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,600
it's okay. Don't worry.

330
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,600
It's okay. Don't worry.

331
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,600
It's my problem.

332
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,600
It has nothing to do with you.

333
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,600
This is for you.

334
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,600
Come on.

335
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,600
Let's go there.

336
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,600
Your problem is solved.

337
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,600
I've got the boss scolded.

338
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,600
Okay, three thousand words.

339
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,600
Now,

340
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,600
we're waiting for the right treatment.

341
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,600
I really admire your attitude.

342
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,600
I told you.

343
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,600
I've been training since I was a kid.

344
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,600
When I was a kid,

345
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,600
I was not reliable.

346
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,600
We're not in a hurry.

347
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,600
We're just a couple.

348
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,600
By the way,

349
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,600
Xia Jie moved into our house.

350
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,600
You should stay there.

351
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,600
If you need any help,

352
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,600
please let me know.

353
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,600
Thank you.

354
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,600
Why do you trust me?

355
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,600
I have to thank you for this.

356
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,600
What?

357
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,600
It's okay if you can go there.

358
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,600
It's so easy to go there.

359
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,600
Do you know what I did to my boss?

360
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,600
I told him to go with me.

361
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,600
I told him that I was a fool.

362
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,600
Master.

363
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,600
Why are you so upset?

364
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,600
You're eating so little.

365
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,600
You're so tight.

366
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,600
You're not fat enough.

367
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,600
Are you done with the case?

368
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,600
I still have some.

369
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,600
Fine.

370
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,600
I won't be ugly today.

371
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,600
I'm talking about him.

372
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,600
In the face of the achievement won by the top city,

373
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,600
the whole Gantin has confidence

374
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,600
to develop a glorious tradition of Paris and Paris.

375
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,600
The best in the world.

376
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,600
This is a great achievement.

377
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,600
It's so good.

378
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,600
It's really a great achievement.

379
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,600
Besides,

380
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,600
we've experienced the freshness of the last quarter.

381
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,600
Come on, Ye Lin.

382
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,600
Read it.

383
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,600
Paris and the social scene, Zhang Zhijie.

384
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,600
Paris and the scene, Yuan Shiqi.

385
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,600
Paris and the scene, Jiang Zhigang.

386
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,600
Paris and the scene, Xia Jie.

387
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,600
Paris and the scene, Sun Qiancheng.

388
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,600
Congratulations to the comrades who read the name.

389
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,600
I hope that the comrades above

390
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,600
can be together and create a great achievement.

391
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,600
Okay?

392
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,600
Congratulations to them.

393
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,600
Director, Director Jiao.

394
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,600
I didn't do anything in the last quarter.

395
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,600
Jianjun and his apprentice saved someone.

396
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,600
Besides,

397
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,600
we've got new four-leafed comrades.

398
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,600
These four-leafed comrades

399
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,600
have done a great job.

400
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,600
But some comrades are still improving.

401
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,600
How to turn from a student

402
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,600
into a qualified civil servant?

403
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,600
This needs a change.

404
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,600
That's all for today.

405
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,600
What do you want?

406
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,600
What do you want?

407
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,600
You two, come here.

408
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,600
What are you doing?

409
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,600
Get to work.

410
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,600
Master.

411
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,600
What's wrong?

412
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,600
Come in and talk.

413
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,600
Jianjun.

414
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,600
Director Jiao.

415
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,600
Jianjun, what's the matter?

416
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,600
Why are you so serious?

417
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,600
Okay, sit down and talk.

418
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,600
It's okay.

419
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,600
I'll stand here.

420
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,600
What's wrong?

421
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,600
Officer Xia,

422
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,600
how many words

423
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,600
can you bring me in?

424
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,600
What?

425
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,600
My child has a fever.

426
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,600
He can't take the medicine.

427
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,600
Can you ask me

428
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,600
where is the medicine?

429
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,600
Officer Xia,

430
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,600
even if I beg you,

431
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,600
I really can't do anything.

432
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,600
I'm not angry.

433
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,600
He's been living for his child.

434
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,600
He knows that his child is good now.

435
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,600
He can only rest assured

436
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,600
that he can take good care of his education

437
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,600
and make a good change.

438
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,600
And this is the medicine for saving his life.

439
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,600
If Xiao Zhuo doesn't take the medicine,

440
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,600
what can I do

441
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,600
without the medicine?

442
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,600
Okay.

443
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,600
What do you want?

444
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,600
What do you want?

445
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,600
I'm about to ask.

446
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,600
I heard from Sister Xu

447
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,600
that the female suspect is the cook.

448
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,600
It's okay.

449
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,600
Sorry, master.

450
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,600
I was too naive.

451
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,600
I just think

452
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,600
he's pitiful and still takes this child.

453
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,600
I didn't expect that.

454
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,600
Jianjun,

455
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,600
a girl's family

456
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,600
has the same heart.

457
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,600
It's normal for them to live together.

458
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,600
And they just got married.

459
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,600
They haven't had the experience

460
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,600
of dealing with the suspect.

461
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,600
They're not blind.

462
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,600
They're in the south.

463
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,600
Don't worry about it.

464
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,600
Then do you want me to

465
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,600
make a review

466
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,600
with Suozhan?

467
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,600
No.

468
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,600
Don't worry about it.

469
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,600
Go back to work.

470
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,600
Your mother's phone.

471
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,600
Jian.

472
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,600
She must be congratulating you.

473
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,600
She got the first aid

474
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,600
when she got to work.

475
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,600
Jian.

476
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,600
Let her be happy.

477
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,600
Master.

478
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,600
What if she calls me

479
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,600
when her husband is there?

480
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,600
She's not at her husband's.

481
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,600
And

482
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,600
she won't call him again.

483
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,600
Sit down.

484
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,600
Come on.

485
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,600
Sit down first.

486
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,600
Let me tell you something.

487
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,600
That man is her partner.

488
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,600
They opened

489
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,600
this famous hotel

490
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,600
called Maiting.

491
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,600
We've caught that man.

492
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,600
We've told him.

493
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,600
This woman

494
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,600
is the owner of this hotel.

495
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,600
She's the one

496
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,600
who has hired

497
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,600
the waiter.

498
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,600
She's the one

499
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,600
who just got into the city

500
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,600
and set up a new hotel.

501
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,600
Once she's in,

502
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,600
she'll take the credit

503
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,600
and get a discount.

504
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,600
She'll even force her

505
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,600
to use her freedom

506
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,600
to destroy their pride

507
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,600
and break their rules.

508
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,600
The so-called

509
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,600
little girl

510
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,600
is the one

511
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,600
who just came in

512
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,600
and was forced

513
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,600
to take a photo of them.

514
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,600
They're also

515
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,600
the victims of the crime.

516
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,600
The man is actually

517
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,600
hiding

518
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,600
the dead bodies

519
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,600
under the shadow.

520
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,600
Once he's taken,

521
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,600
he'll threaten

522
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,600
the other victims.

523
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,600
He'll continue to come.

524
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,600
Xiaoxian,

525
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,600
you don't have to go.

526
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,600
It's time to start.

527
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,600
I'll tell you.

528
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,600
Wait.

529
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,600
I'll be back.

530
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,600
The door is open.

531
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,600
I'm still knocking.

532
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,600
Jianjun is looking for you.

533
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,600
I don't have any personal information.

534
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,600
Send me a job.

535
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,600
He's sending you a job?

536
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,600
I think

537
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,600
he's having a hard time.

538
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,600
He's having a hard time.

539
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,600
Now he's in trouble.

540
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,600
He's throwing the pot to the ground.

541
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,600
You don't know

542
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,600
his new disease.

543
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,600
Isn't it just that

544
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,600
he's stronger than him?

545
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,600
Can't he

546
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,600
bring his head to his old tent?

547
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,600
The problem is

548
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,600
he's not in Jianjun's body.

549
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,600
He's on his old tent mother.

550
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,600
He's always

551
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,600
comparing these two daughters.

552
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,600
He's rich,

553
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,600
he's a liar,

554
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,600
and he's not rich.

555
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,600
He's a scumbag.

556
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,600
Jianjun is trying to get out of his head.

557
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,600
He must be

558
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,600
busy with good things.

559
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,600
He's just

560
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,600
trying to get out of his head.

561
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,600
What do you want him to do?

562
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,600
Are you doing my job

563
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,600
or his job?

564
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,600
Is this his problem?

565
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,600
He has no self-criticism.

566
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,600
According to me,

567
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,600
this stick is his personality.

568
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,600
His job is not to get out of his head.

569
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,600
It's not to get out of his mother's head.

570
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,600
Can't you see that?

571
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,600
Yes, you're right.

572
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,600
Don't throw the pot to the ground.

573
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,600
I'm not throwing the pot to you.

574
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,600
I'm throwing it to myself.

575
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,600
We

576
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,600
can't let a good cop

577
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,600
make a mistake

578
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,600
in our hands, right?

579
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,600
What are you doing?

580
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,600
You're thinking about your job?

581
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,600
Didn't you say

582
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,600
that we can't let a good cop

583
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,600
make a mistake in our hands?

584
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,600
I didn't make a good one.

585
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,600
I'm sorry again.

586
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,600
Hello, mom.

587
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,600
Come back early today.

588
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,600
Mom bought a lot of seafood.

589
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,600
I'll cook it for you tonight.

590
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,600
Mom, what did you tell my boss

591
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,600
and my master again?

592
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,600
They told me

593
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,600
that you're usually in the first place.

594
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,600
It's all because of you.

595
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,600
You've already been in the first place.

596
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,600
After several more times of this kind of honor,

597
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,600
maybe you'll be able to get to the point.

598
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,600
You don't have to worry about it anymore.

599
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,600
Xiao Jie,

600
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,600
how can you hang up mom's phone?

601
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,600
Mom, I've told you many times.

602
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,600
Stop interfering in my work.

603
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,600
Why can't you just listen to me?

604
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,600
Even if it's the same word.

605
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,600
Mom, this is for your own good.

606
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,600
Otherwise,

607
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,600
everyone else will forget about us.

608
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,600
Mom, I'm officially informing you now.

609
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,600
I've moved out.

610
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,600
It's very close to the unit.

611
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,600
It's convenient to work.

612
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,600
When will you call me

613
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,600
without any more trouble?

614
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,600
I'll be back.

615
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,600
Mom.

616
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,600
Morning, uncle.

617
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,600
Morning.

618
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,600
It's early.

619
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,600
It's still so early.

620
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,600
Morning, uncle.

621
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,600
We can stay here.

622
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,600
You're young and good.

623
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,600
You're old and young.

624
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,600
You should get used to it.

625
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,600
Go.

626
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,600
Morning, uncle.

627
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,600
Morning.

628
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,600
Morning, brother.

629
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,600
Morning.

630
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,600
Song,

631
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,600
what's wrong with you?

632
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,600
Nothing.

633
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,600
I'm fine.

634
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,600
I'm fine.

635
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,600
Don't ask me anything.

636
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,600
What's wrong with you?

637
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,600
Police, don't ask the police.

638
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,600
Ask them for the right time.

639
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,600
You're so stupid.

640
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,600
Uncle,

641
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,600
get me some water.

642
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,600
I forgot to bring the key.

643
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,600
Come in.

644
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,600
Be careful.

645
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,600
The police are in the report.

646
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,600
The traffic police are rushing to get the key.

647
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,600
You're so stupid.

648
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,600
Luo Chen,

649
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,600
I'll go.

650
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,600
Ding,

651
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,600
wait.

652
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,600
Get the key.

653
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,600
Master,

654
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,600
can we have a chat?

655
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,600
Sure.

656
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,600
We found the police

657
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,600
sent them to work.

658
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,600
They're going to work.

659
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,600
Let's go to the community.

660
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,600
Master,

661
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,600
I'm still here.

662
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,600
Master.

663
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,600
Are you okay?

664
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,600
There's a fight in the car.

665
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,600
Someone's fighting.

666
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,600
Get the car.

667
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,600
Master,

668
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,600
I can't drink water.

669
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,600
You're just a mute.

670
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,600
Let's go.

671
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,600
Hurry up.

672
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,600
It's raining.

673
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,600
Where are you going?

674
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,600
Where are you going?

675
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,600
Tell the police.

676
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,600
Tell the police.

677
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,600
What's the matter?

678
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,600
I'm not going to.

679
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,600
Uncle,

680
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,600
no matter what,

681
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,600
leave the man first.

682
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,600
Try to be wise.

683
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,600
Be honest.

684
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,600
Don't make any trouble.

685
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,600
Don't make any trouble.

686
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,600
Remember that.

687
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,600
Open the door.

688
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,600
Master,

689
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,600
I'm not going to.

690
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,600
You're just a mute.

691
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,600
I'm not going to.

692
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,600
Master,

693
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,600
I'm not going to.

694
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,600
The police are here.

695
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,600
The police are here.

696
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,600
I can't tell you.

697
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,600
What's the matter?

698
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,600
What's the matter?

699
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,600
What's the matter?

700
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,600
Don't fight.

701
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,600
Don't fight.

702
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,600
Don't fight.

703
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,600
You're young.

704
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,600
You can't fight.

705
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,600
Where are you going?

706
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,600
Master,

707
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,600
Master,

708
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,600
you're already one hundred years old.

709
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,600
You can't be angry easily.

710
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,600
You don't know.

711
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,600
Tell me.

712
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,600
What's the matter?

713
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,600
Chief Jiang,

714
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,600
I'll tell you.

715
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,600
This old man has six dogs.

716
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,600
Look at him.

717
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,600
He doesn't have a dog.

718
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,600
Our family passed by here.

719
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,600
The dog looked at my child and chased him.

720
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,600
Look at him.

721
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,600
Look at his legs.

722
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,600
Look at his mouth.

723
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,600
Look.

724
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,600
Look at his mouth.

725
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,600
Look at his mouth.

726
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,600
It's because of this dog.

727
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,600
We didn't say anything.

728
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,600
We didn't ask for compensation.

729
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,600
No, right?

730
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,600
I'm with you, master.

731
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,600
Look, listen to him.

732
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,600
Master.

733
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,600
I'm with the dog.

734
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,600
What's the matter?

735
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,600
Your child is afraid of dogs.

736
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,600
Don't leave without a dog.

737
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,600
Master.

738
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,600
Master.

739
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,600
Listen to me.

740
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,600
Can we be so excited at the end?

741
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,600
Uncle, Ding.

742
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,600
Take Master to the inside.

743
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,600
Cool down.

744
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,600
Come on, Master.

745
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,600
Cool down inside.

746
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,600
It's true.

747
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,600
You're so big.

748
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,600
You have to be careful.

749
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,600
It's not in the countryside.

750
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,600
You should know it.

751
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,600
It's gone.

752
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,600
It's gone.

753
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,600
It's cold.

754
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,600
Can you be quiet?

755
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,600
Don't talk.

756
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,600
Tell me.

757
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,600
What's the name of the doctor?

758
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,600
The wife is here.

759
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,600
Mom, I'm home.

760
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,600
Right away.

761
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,600
This way.

762
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,600
Liu Qiang.

763
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,600
Mr. Liu.

764
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,600
Tell me.

765
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,600
Why are you so close to him?

766
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,600
No, comrade.

767
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,600
I've never met

768
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,600
such an unreasonable person.

769
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,600
Sir.

770
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,600
Okay.

771
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,600
You're so big.

772
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,600
What?

773
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,600
This is my home.

774
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,600
I'm at home.

775
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,600
What do I need?

776
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,600
My child is pregnant.

777
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,600
I didn't say anything.

778
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,600
He's on my side.

779
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,600
A group of people are following me.

780
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,600
They won't let me go.

781
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,600
Can I not call the police?

782
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,600
I know.

783
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,600
It must be him.

784
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,600
Look, he's a good man.

785
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,600
He's a good man.

786
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,600
He's a good man.

787
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,600
You two are

788
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,600
educated and well-behaved.

789
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,600
We don't need to talk to him.

790
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,600
Okay?

791
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,600
To be honest,

792
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,600
I don't want to talk to him.

793
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,600
But he's a bad guy.

794
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,600
A dog in the city

795
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,600
must be taken to the dog town.

796
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,600
I've been a dog for a lifetime.

797
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,600
I've never done anything.

798
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,600
So what?

799
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,600
Never mind.

800
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,600
Now the city is well-known.

801
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,600
In the city life,

802
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,600
you must follow the rules of the city.

803
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,600
A dog must be taken to the dog town.

804
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,600
A dog must be taken to the snake.

805
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,600
Don't say that.

806
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,600
I don't care about the city.

807
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,600
I know this is my home.

808
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,600
My land.

809
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,600
I love to walk.

810
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,600
I love to walk.

811
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,600
I guess you know you're a good man.

812
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,600
I'm afraid you'll lose your way.

813
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,600
So I won't give you the chance.

814
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,600
I'm not going to

815
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,600
live with an old man.

816
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,600
But I can't say it.

817
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,600
What should I do?

818
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,600
Okay.

819
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,600
I know.

820
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,600
Everyone,

821
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,600
can you do this?

822
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,600
You two are so broad.

823
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,600
I'll make a box later.

824
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,600
We'll talk about soft words.

825
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,600
Let's try to solve this.

826
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,600
Okay?

827
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,600
Yes.

828
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,600
Baby, let's listen to the police.

829
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,600
Okay?

830
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,600
The police is coming.

831
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,600
I'll correct you.

832
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,600
From the legal level,

833
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,600
it's not about where you are.

834
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,600
It's about your land.

835
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,600
This is the public property.

836
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,600
Everyone...

837
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,600
The law?

838
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,600
Then the law is me?

839
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,600
I'm telling you.

840
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,600
I'm over 70 this year.

841
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,600
Where?

842
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,600
Come.

843
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,600
Catch.

844
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,600
Baby, catch.

845
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,600
Catch.

846
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,600
Calm down.

847
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,600
Hold on.

848
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,600
Calm down.

849
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,600
Calm down.

850
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,600
Calm down.

851
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,600
I'm just asking

852
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,600
if you have a dog's ID.

853
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,600
What's wrong with you?

854
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,600
Sir.

855
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,600
Sir.

856
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,600
Look at me.

857
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,600
Don't wait for him.

858
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,600
According to the law,

859
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,600
there should be a dog's ID

860
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,600
in the city.

861
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,600
Besides,

862
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,600
six dogs need to be signed.

863
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,600
But

864
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,600
Mr. Liu

865
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,600
thinks you're probably

866
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,600
a big man.

867
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,600
You don't know

868
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,600
what's going on.

869
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,600
So he's willing to

870
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,600
take care of you.

871
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,600
Look at us.

872
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,600
Forget it.

873
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,600
And I can see it.

874
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,600
You're here because of him, right?

875
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,600
You're here to get the money, right?

876
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,600
Fine.

877
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,600
You're here to get the money, right?

878
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,600
Just catch me.

879
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,600
Catch.

880
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,600
Catch.

881
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,600
Don't do this.

882
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,600
I'm telling you.

883
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,600
You're not going to catch me.

884
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,600
I'm telling you.

885
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,600
Sir, can you calm down?

886
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,600
Calm down.

887
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,600
He can't stand it.

888
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,600
Fine.

889
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,600
I don't need money.

890
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,600
I'll pay you.

891
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,600
I won't be angry if I pay you.

892
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,600
I won't be angry if I pay you.

893
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,600
Sit down.

894
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,600
Sit down.

895
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,600
Sit down.

896
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,600
Sir, you...

897
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,600
You said you'd pay me, right?

898
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,600
I'll pay you.

899
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,600
I can pay you.

900
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,600
You've taken our child's mental health.

901
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,600
You'll pay us when we're done.

902
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,600
I'll pay you, okay?

903
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,600
I haven't paid you yet.

904
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,600
I'll pay you.

905
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,600
I'll take care of you.

906
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,600
What are you talking about?

907
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,600
You're talking about your child.

908
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,600
You're talking about your child.

909
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,600
I'll pay you.

910
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,600
You're a big loser.

911
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,600
You're a big loser.

912
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,600
Sir, I can't do this again.

913
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,600
I said you're a big loser.

914
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,600
You're a big loser.

915
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,600
You're a big loser.

916
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,600
Don't do this.

917
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,600
Don't do this.

918
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,600
Don't do this.

919
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,600
Sir.

920
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,600
Sir.

921
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,600
Sir.

922
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,600
Sir.

923
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,600
Hello.

924
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,600
Hello.

925
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,600
Hello, sir.

926
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,600
The situation is like this.

927
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,600
They're arguing over it.

928
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,600
Sir, you're a big loser.

929
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,600
You dare to hit me?

930
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,600
I'm not done with you.

931
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,600
You're a loser.

932
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,600
I'm sorry.

933
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,600
I'm sorry.

934
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,600
I drank it all.

935
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,600
I'm not done with you.

936
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,600
You're not done with him?

937
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,600
What's wrong with you?

938
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,600
Sir, you're a big loser.

939
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,600
You're a big loser.

940
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,600
You're a big loser.

941
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,600
I'm not done with you.

942
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,600
You hit me.

943
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,600
What are you talking about?

944
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,600
You hit me.

945
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,600
Look at what I'm doing.

946
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,600
What are you doing?

947
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,600
I'm not done with you.

948
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,600
You hit me.

949
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,600
I'm so bad at this.

950
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,600
You're a big loser.

951
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,600
Okay, stop arguing.

952
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,600
Sir, be careful.

953
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,600
What should I do?

954
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,600
He hit me, I'm careful.

955
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,600
Okay, okay.

956
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,600
Don't fight.

957
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,600
What's going on?

958
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,600
Who told me?

959
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,600
I did.

960
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,600
I hit him.

961
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,600
I'm almost out of the hospital.

962
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,600
He sent me to the hospital.

963
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,600
I can't live.

964
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,600
I can't live.

965
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,600
Take care of him.

966
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,600
Let's go.

967
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,600
Let's go.

968
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,600
What's going on?

969
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,600
What's going on?

970
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,600
What's going on?

971
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,600
What's going on?

972
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,600
What's going on?

973
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,600
What's going on?

974
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,600
Are you busy?

975
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,600
What are you talking about?

976
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,600
Yes, yes, yes.

977
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,600
We can't say that.

978
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,600
We can't afford to bother the elderly.

979
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,600
Sir,

980
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,600
the old man is the one who's been in trouble.

981
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,600
And he's in the bus.

982
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,600
He's in danger of public safety.

983
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,600
What's the solution?

984
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,600
Hurry up.

985
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,600
Yu Dawei,

986
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,600
you've been a teacher for two days.

987
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,600
You can't sit on the train again.

988
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,600
You can't, right?

989
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,600
I'm always saying that.

990
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,600
Besides,

991
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,600
what's the relationship between the case

992
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,600
and the client?

993
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,600
When we were in the police station,

994
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,600
we were in charge of the punishment.

995
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,600
Didn't you learn it?

996
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,600
I did.

997
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,600
The second one is the third one.

998
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,600
How can we make a decision?

999
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,600
We can't stay in the city

1000
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,600
for more than 70 years.

1001
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,600
You're still so young.

1002
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,600
If you say so,

1003
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,600
we can't deal with the old people.

1004
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,600
What do you mean?

1005
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,600
I said that.

1006
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,600
That's the punishment.

1007
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,600
You saw the surveillance video just now.

1008
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,600
I did?

1009
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,600
The girl can do it.

1010
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,600
Her old man's face is in trouble.

1011
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,600
That's the guard.

1012
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,600
What's the guard?

1013
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,600
You know what's serious?

1014
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,600
You're going to be a tiger.

1015
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,600
You're saying that

1016
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,600
if you're going to be a tiger,

1017
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,600
you have to be a woman.

1018
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,600
What do you think?

1019
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,600
You're now a old man.

1020
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,600
You're all over 70.

1021
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,600
If you're going to be a tiger,

1022
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,600
you're going to be a woman.

1023
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,600
That's unfair.

1024
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,600
The old man needs care.

1025
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,600
The father and daughter have to protect them.

1026
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,600
Enough.

1027
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,600
Don't say that.

1028
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,600
Later,

1029
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,600
you should go and understand

1030
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,600
the age of the old man.

1031
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,600
I'll go and do my job

1032
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,600
with that girl.

1033
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,600
After all, he's still young.

1034
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,600
It's reasonable.

1035
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,600
It's easier to say.

1036
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,600
The old man is 71 this year.

1037
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,600
He's not a car from the old man.

1038
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,600
He's a year old.

1039
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,600
Okay.

1040
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,600
Then don't go.

1041
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,600
Just go with me

1042
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,600
to find the girl.

1043
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,600
Come on.

1044
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,600
Come on.

1045
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,600
Come on.

1046
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,600
Come on.

1047
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,600
Help.

1048
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,600
Help.

1049
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,600
Help.

1050
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,600
Okay, let's go.

1051
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,600
What's wrong with him?

1052
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,600
What's wrong with him?

1053
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,600
He's a car from the old man.

1054
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,600
Come on.

1055
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,600
Come on.

1056
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,600
Come on.

1057
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,600
Come on.

1058
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,600
Come on.

1059
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,600
The police are leaving.

1060
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,600
They're leaving.

1061
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,600
The child is in the police school.

1062
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,600
The child is in the hospital.

1063
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,600
Come on.

1064
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,600
Help.

1065
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,600
Police.

1066
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,600
Help.

1067
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,600
Dacheng.

1068
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,600
Help.

1069
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,600
Dacheng, help me.

1070
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,600
What's wrong with him?

1071
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,600
He's in the police school.

1072
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,600
Help.

1073
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,600
Dacheng, don't hurry.

1074
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,600
Please calm down.

1075
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,600
I'll go to the police.

1076
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,600
Calm down.

1077
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,600
Do you have any positive evidence?

1078
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,600
No.

1079
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,600
Okay, it's obviously positive.

1080
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,600
No.

1081
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,600
You can see what happened.

1082
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,600
Don't worry.

1083
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,600
Are you with the old man?

1084
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,600
No.

1085
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,600
What's wrong with him?

1086
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,600
You're here.

1087
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,600
He ran away.

1088
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,600
Don't let him run away.

1089
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,600
He's going to give me the money.

1090
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,600
He's sick.

1091
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,600
No.

1092
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,600
He's sick.

1093
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,600
No.

1094
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,600
No.

1095
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,600
Why is he with the old man?

1096
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,600
I think he's sick.

1097
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,600
He's sick.

1098
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,600
You can't bring him out of the hospital.

1099
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,600
The investigation?

1100
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,600
The investigation is the right thing to do.

1101
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,600
Where are we going now?

1102
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,600
Liu is in the police station.

1103
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,600
Okay, thank you.

1104
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,600
Thank you.

1105
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,600
You go first.

1106
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,600
Be careful.

1107
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,600
This way.

1108
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,600
This way.

1109
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,600
Okay.

1110
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,600
Okay.

1111
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,600
Doctor, you're opening the patient's room.

1112
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,600
What's wrong with the patient's room?

1113
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,600
Let's go there.

1114
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,600
Officer, is the patient's family here?

1115
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,600
The informer has called.

1116
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,600
How is the patient's condition now?

1117
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,600
He's not checked.

1118
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,600
What's wrong with the old man?

1119
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,600
Blood pressure, blood pressure, blood sugar.

1120
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,600
They're all normal.

1121
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,600
There's no problem with the blood vessels in the brain.

1122
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,600
Okay.

1123
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,600
You go first.

1124
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,600
I should.

1125
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,600
If the investigation is not done,

1126
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,600
will you go to a bigger hospital to check it?

1127
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,600
Let's talk when the family comes.

1128
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,600
It's really a big forest.

1129
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,600
There's everything.

1130
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,600
What do you mean?

1131
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,600
What's the distance?

1132
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,600
I can meet here.

1133
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,600
Hello.

1134
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,600
Officer Chen.

1135
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,600
Officer, you're here too.

1136
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,600
What's wrong?

1137
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,600
Don't mention it.

1138
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,600
I fainted at that time.

1139
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,600
You and your master...

1140
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,600
I think it's okay.

1141
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,600
It's okay.

1142
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,600
What else can we do?

1143
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,600
Just be a normal colleague.

1144
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,600
I think it's not okay.

1145
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,600
You should talk to him.

1146
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,600
You should have a good relationship.

1147
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,600
I didn't do anything wrong.

1148
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,600
This is not a problem.

1149
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,600
Why are you so weak?

1150
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,600
Besides,

1151
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,600
he's teaching you how to be a normal colleague.

1152
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,600
How can you be a normal colleague?

1153
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,600
Do you think I'm making a big mistake?

1154
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,600
What's your problem?

1155
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,600
To put it simply,

1156
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,600
it's a bad old man.

1157
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,600
He's a bad guy.

1158
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,600
This is a big problem.

1159
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,600
We need to take care of their health.

1160
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,600
We need to take care of their emotions.

1161
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,600
I'm old and young.

1162
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,600
I have a wife and a daughter.

1163
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,600
It's the same.

1164
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,600
There's a father and a daughter.

1165
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,600
There's a father and a daughter.

1166
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,600
There's a father and a daughter.

1167
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,600
The husband of the daughter of the family.

1168
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,600
You won.

1169
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,600
The situation is more complicated than mine.

1170
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,600
Don't stop me.

1171
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,600
Don't stop me.

1172
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,600
Don't stop me.

1173
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,600
Don't stop me.

1174
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,600
Don't stop me.

1175
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,600
Don't stop me.

1176
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,600
Don't stop me.

1177
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,600
Don't stop me.

1178
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,600
I want you.

1179
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,600
I want you.

1180
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,600
I want you.

1181
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,600
I want you.

1182
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,600
I want you.

1183
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,600
I want you.

1184
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,600
I want you.

1185
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,600
I want you.
