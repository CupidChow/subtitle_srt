I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm not sure.

I'm not sure.

I'm not sure.

I'm not sure.

00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,060
I'm not sure.

00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,060
Welcome to W Turdy

49
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,280
Orgy

50
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,280
The exciting start of the new year's eve is coming soon.

51
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,280
Master, someone has brought the GPS to report.

52
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,280
What?

53
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,280
Didn't we put the GPS on the small area?

54
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,280
Now that we have one, the GPS is here to report.

55
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,280
You mean the charging card you sold?

56
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,280
What about the seat?

57
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,280
It's not charging card, it's the GPS.

58
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,280
Now someone has added the GPS to the car.

59
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,280
Where is the driver?

60
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,280
He is outside.

61
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,280
This time it's easy to catch.

62
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,280
Brother Cao.

63
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,280
Look, Officer Cao.

64
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,280
Master, the car is moving.

65
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,280
It moved more than 1000 meters when I saw it.

66
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,280
Okay, we are doctors.

67
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,280
Master, don't.

68
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,280
It's great.

69
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,280
It's great?

70
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,280
We can connect it.

71
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,280
That one.

72
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,280
That one.

73
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,280
My car.

74
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,280
That one.

75
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,280
That one.

76
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,280
That one.

77
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,280
That one.

78
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,280
That one.

79
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,280
Don't panic.

80
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,280
Hurry up.

81
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,280
What if it's lost?

82
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,280
You are afraid of the GPS, right?

83
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,280
He got into the car.

84
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,280
It's not for himself.

85
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,280
Let's follow him.

86
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,280
Let's see where he is.

87
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,280
Let's go.

88
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,280
Let's go.

89
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,280
Wait up there.

90
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,280
Wait up there.

91
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,280
Watch out.

92
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,280
The car.

93
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,280
Don't move.

94
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,280
Watch out.

95
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,280
Don't move.

96
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,280
Watch out.

97
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,280
Don't move.

98
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,280
Run.

99
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,280
Don't move.

100
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,280
Don't move.

101
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,280
Don't move.

102
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,280
Don't move.

103
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,280
Don't move.

104
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,280
Don't move.

105
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,280
Don't move.

106
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,280
Take him away.

107
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,280
Hurry up.

108
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,280
Hurry up.

109
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,280
Don't move.

110
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,280
Brother Tang, you are so kind.

111
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,280
There are more.

112
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,280
Take them all.

113
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,280
Go there and squat.

114
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,280
Xiao Qi.

115
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,280
There are so many people.

116
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,280
Jian Jun, that's great.

117
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,280
You are so good.

118
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,280
You solved a big case.

119
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,280
Chief, technology is a great job.

120
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:33,060
The past

121
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,280
is so advanced.

122
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,280
How did you come up with the idea?

123
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,280
I learned it.

124
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,280
I don't know myself.

125
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,280
I have a doctor.

126
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,280
I can think of a doctor to learn.

127
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,280
What is this?

128
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,280
It's not a human idea.

129
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,280
You are so good.

130
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,280
Lin Cheng.

131
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,280
Jian Jun, you are so good.

132
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,280
Yes.

133
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,280
Good.

134
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,280
Good.

135
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,280
Good.

136
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,280
Uncle Yang.

137
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,280
Uncle Yang.

138
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,280
Knowledge is power.

139
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,280
Listen, don't go.

140
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,280
You are sitting in the office.

141
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,280
Why are you here?

142
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,280
Interesting.

143
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,280
You are so mature.

144
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,280
Right?

145
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,280
Uncle Yang.

146
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,280
What's the matter?

147
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,280
Nothing.

148
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,280
Officer Cao.

149
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,280
Jian Jun, Anna.

150
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,280
Uncle Yang.

151
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,280
I talked to the director.

152
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,280
He told us to chase the electric car.

153
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,280
We will make a document report.

154
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,280
You can write it down.

155
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,280
The document can be written on the site.

156
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,280
The summary will be in place.

157
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,280
You write it.

158
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,280
I will report it to you.

159
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,280
What's wrong?

160
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,280
You are unhappy after breaking the case.

161
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,280
You even look sad.

162
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,280
Is there any?

163
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,280
No.

164
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,280
Uncle Yang.

165
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,280
You won't think that I didn't tell the director

166
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,280
that this is your dad's.

167
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,280
You are the one who made it.

168
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,280
You are unhappy.

169
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,280
You are unhappy, right?

170
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,280
You think too much.

171
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,280
You think that I didn't tell the director

172
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,280
that this is your dad's?

173
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,280
I don't know.

174
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,280
Besides,

175
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,280
am I your master?

176
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,280
Am I your disciple?

177
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,280
The case is yours.

178
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,280
You are mine.

179
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,280
You are mine.

180
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,280
Brother Cao.

181
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,280
What's the matter?

182
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,280
Look.

183
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,280
I just broke the case.

184
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,280
I didn't tell the director that it's his.

185
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,280
I'm not happy.

186
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,280
Doctor.

187
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,280
You are so good at this.

188
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,280
Are you still working?

189
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,280
Brother Cao.

190
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,280
The doctor was a good doctor.

191
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,280
He is good at this.

192
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,280
Why is he so good at this?

193
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,280
Exactly.

194
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,280
He is a great doctor.

195
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,280
He sent us to the bureau as a rich man.

196
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,280
What's wrong with this little guy?

197
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,280
You don't teach him?

198
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,280
Don't forget to write a report.

199
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,280
You are still a kid.

200
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,280
Work.

201
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,280
Uncle.

202
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,280
Come out and have a meal.

203
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,280
It's okay.

204
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,280
I won't eat.

205
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,280
You can eat.

206
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,280
What are you doing?

207
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,280
You are so shameless when you come back.

208
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,280
I wrote a report.

209
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,280
What report?

210
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,280
There are many other things.

211
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,280
Who are you?

212
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,280
What are you talking about?

213
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,280
I'm fine.

214
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,280
You can eat.

215
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,280
I'll help you.

216
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,280
I'll help you.

217
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,280
You can eat.

218
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,280
Help me close the door.

219
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,280
Okay.

220
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,280
He won't eat?

221
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,280
No.

222
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,280
I think

223
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,280
Uncle seems to be a little strange today.

224
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,280
He seems to have something new.

225
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,280
I saw him in the mirror

226
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,280
and he was looking for a new computer.

227
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,280
He said he was writing a report.

228
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,280
But I saw him

229
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,280
looking for some information.

230
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,280
What's wrong?

231
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,280
Let me close my eyes and guess.

232
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,280
It's cold and hot.

233
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,280
Why don't you close your nose?

234
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,280
Why don't you eat?

235
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,280
Wait for me.

236
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,280
What's wrong with you two?

237
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,280
What's wrong with Uncle?

238
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,280
Uncle Yang.

239
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,280
What's wrong with Uncle Yang?

240
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,280
Uncle wants to leave.

241
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,280
He wants to take the test.

242
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,280
The test?

243
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,280
Uncle Zhang, what are you talking about?

244
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,280
It's about the electric car.

245
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,280
I also heard about it

246
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,280
in the office this afternoon.

247
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,280
It's probably the police

248
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,280
who found the electric car

249
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,280
and said it was his own work.

250
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,280
And they are talking about Uncle Yang.

251
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,280
Isn't that ridiculous?

252
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,280
Uncle Yang

253
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,280
thought about it

254
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,280
when he found the electric car.

255
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,280
I contacted my classmate.

256
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,280
Uncle Yang did it

257
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,280
on his own.

258
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,280
What's wrong with the police?

259
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,280
Last time, it was a robbery.

260
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,280
It's a long story.

261
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,280
We have to get rid of

262
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,280
Uncle Yang.

263
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,280
It's a little bit.

264
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,280
Yes.

265
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,280
He is 30 or 40 years old.

266
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,280
I don't think we need to

267
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,280
be so strict with them.

268
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,280
I thought he could

269
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,280
change what happened last time.

270
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,280
Yes.

271
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,280
It's embarrassing.

272
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,280
I thought it wouldn't happen again.

273
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,280
But

274
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,280
only Uncle Yang was the one who woke up.

275
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,280
He was so strict.

276
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,280
He was so stubborn.

277
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,280
I thought

278
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,280
Cao Jingwen was a hero

279
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,280
when I came here.

280
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,280
I can't believe it.

281
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,280
Where are you going?

282
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,280
I'm going to tell him.

283
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,280
We have to discuss it together.

284
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,280
We can't just let it go.

285
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,280
What do you want?

286
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,280
Let him and his master

287
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,280
think about it.

288
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,280
Then we'll know everything.

289
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,280
Then we'll get rid of him.

290
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,280
Then we'll know everything.

291
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,280
At least you know what's going on.

292
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,280
He is the one who's the mastermind.

293
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,280
I think he knows.

294
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,280
But what if he knows?

295
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,280
He's a person who's

296
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,280
so important to the whole community.

297
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,280
Then I have to talk to him.

298
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,280
He can't change anything.

299
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,280
If he wants to say it,

300
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,280
he should have said it.

301
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,280
He has to wait until now.

302
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,280
I'm so worried.

303
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,280
We have to find 38 electric cars

304
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,280
for the whole community.

305
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,280
But we only have nine of them.

306
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,280
This is the cheap

307
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,280
cable car sales agency.

308
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,280
We can find 18 for them.

309
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,280
You didn't see

310
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,280
the face of the little guy

311
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,280
who always comes to your mind.

312
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,280
I don't know

313
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,280
what that guy is.

314
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,280
Then we'll be in trouble.

315
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,280
We have 21 of them.

316
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,280
We still have 12 of them.

317
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,280
So many?

318
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,280
If we lose them,

319
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,280
we'll sell them.

320
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,280
Then we'll take the suspect

321
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,280
to the execution site.

322
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,280
Okay.

323
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,280
Jianjun, I think you're right.

324
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,280
I'll go and talk to him.

325
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,280
Wait.

326
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,280
What?

327
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,280
Well,

328
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,280
we've divided up.

329
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,280
If we find them,

330
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,280
you'll take the suspect.

331
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,280
If we don't,

332
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,280
we'll take Jianjun.

333
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,280
Chief Su,

334
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,280
if we do this,

335
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,280
he'll be in trouble.

336
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,280
He found the car himself.

337
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,280
What a bad idea.

338
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,280
Just listen to me.

339
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,280
Be careful.

340
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,280
Be careful.

341
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,280
Don't let him go.

342
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,280
Don't worry, Chief.

343
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,280
I'll get him back.

344
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,280
Come on.

345
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,280
Let's do it.

346
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,280
One, two.

347
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,280
Go.

348
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,280
Be careful.

349
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,280
Be careful.

350
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,280
Come on.

351
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,280
I'll get him.

352
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,280
Okay.

353
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,280
Chief,

354
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,280
the car is ready.

355
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,280
What's this?

356
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,280
What's this?

357
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,280
How did you arrange this?

358
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,280
I don't know.

359
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,280
Be careful.

360
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,280
Be careful.

361
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,280
I've got a gift for you.

362
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,280
Thank you.

363
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,280
Thank you.

364
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,280
Thank you for buying it.

365
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,280
Thank you.

366
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,280
Thank you for your hard work.

367
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,280
You're really good to me.

368
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,280
You're really good to me.

369
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,280
Thank you.

370
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,280
Thank you.

371
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,280
Look.

372
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,280
It's your car.

373
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,280
I've seen it before.

374
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,280
It's this one.

375
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,280
Come on.

376
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,280
We'll register here.

377
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,280
Take the car away after we finish.

378
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,280
Here we go.

379
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,280
Finally,

380
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,280
we've got a gift.

381
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,280
We've waited for a long time.

382
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,280
Get up.

383
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,280
Thank you so much.

384
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,280
Okay.

385
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,280
I'll get the car.

386
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,280
We've found a car.

387
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,280
We've found a car.

388
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,280
Here we go.

389
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,280
It's mine.

390
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,280
It's my car.

391
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,280
Is it?

392
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,280
Thank you.

393
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,280
Thank you for your hard work.

394
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,280
Come on.

395
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,280
Let's take a look.

396
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,280
Let's see.

397
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,280
Let's see.

398
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,280
Don't let him go.

399
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,280
I'm going to get the car.

400
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,280
I'm going to get the car.

401
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,280
Here we go.

402
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,280
I've got two cars.

403
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,280
Not bad.

404
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,280
I've got a car.

405
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,280
Take it.

406
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,280
Don't be so careless.

407
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,280
Here we go.

408
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,280
This one's for you.

409
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,280
We'll bring it to you later.

410
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,280
Here.

411
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,280
Here.

412
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,280
We'll take it.

413
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,280
We'll find it.

414
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,280
Take it.

415
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,280
It's my car.

416
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,280
My car.

417
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,280
We've trouve the car.

418
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,280
Here.

419
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,280
Bring them here.

420
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,280
There's the Google Maps.

421
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,280
Thank you.

422
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,280
Let's see the car.

423
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,280
I made it.

424
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,280
Thank you for your hard work.

425
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,280
We've found the car.

426
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,280
I didn't get the car.

427
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,280
You should have.

428
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,280
Thank you.

429
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,280
Thank you.

430
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,280
Thank you.

431
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,280
Thank you.

432
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:53,280
All that work for a living to found a freeatively hi- íŒ” at the market

433
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:58,280
You can go down there and see where you live

434
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:09,280
Let's lift up clicking something

435
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:15,280
I becturblyzust lift this up

436
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,280
Look, look, look.

437
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,280
Look, look, look.

438
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,280
Over there.

439
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,280
What?

440
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,280
Over there.

441
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,280
Let's go.

442
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,280
Where are you?

443
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,280
Take a look.

444
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,280
Look at the camera.

445
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,280
Look.

446
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,280
What are you two doing here?

447
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,280
It's a black electric car.

448
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,280
How do you drive?

449
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,280
I used my black key.

450
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,280
The car is gone.

451
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,280
Hey, sir.

452
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,280
He stole my car.

453
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,280
The person caught it.

454
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,280
Where's my car?

455
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,280
Right.

456
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,280
We lost it.

457
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,280
We lost our car, too.

458
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,280
How many times have we lost it?

459
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,280
We lost it.

460
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,280
We should find the car.

461
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,280
I haven't found it yet.

462
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,280
The police found it.

463
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,280
They sold it to the countryside.

464
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,280
You didn't chase after it?

465
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,280
We didn't chase after it.

466
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,280
We didn't say we didn't chase after it.

467
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,280
We haven't chased after it for a while.

468
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,280
We haven't chased after it for a while.

469
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,280
We didn't chase after it for a while.

470
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,280
The salesmen

471
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,280
sold the car

472
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,280
to the countryside.

473
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,280
There's no better way

474
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,280
to find it.

475
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,280
What do you mean?

476
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,280
We can't find it

477
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,280
if we sell it to the countryside.

478
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,280
Don't worry.

479
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,280
We can't do that.

480
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,280
This case

481
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,280
has been broken.

482
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,280
Although the car

483
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,280
was not stolen by everyone,

484
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,280
we have caught the criminal group.

485
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,280
This will prevent more people

486
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,280
from getting bigger losses.

487
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,280
We have to get rid of them.

488
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,280
This is what we call

489
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,280
a breakaway law.

490
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,280
We should get rid of them.

491
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,280
We have caught the criminal group.

492
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,280
We should get rid of them.

493
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,280
We have a big progress.

494
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,280
This case has a big progress already.

495
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,280
Do you understand?

496
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,280
We have already

497
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,280
found a car for everyone.

498
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,280
Run.

499
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,280
Run.

500
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,280
Run.

501
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,280
Run.

502
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,280
Run.

503
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,280
Run.

504
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,280
Run.

505
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,280
Run.

506
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,280
Run.

507
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,280
Run.

508
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,280
What are you doing?

509
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,280
What are you doing?

510
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,280
Don't you dare to run to the police!

511
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,280
What are you doing?

512
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,280
It's so funny.

513
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,280
It happened to him.

514
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,280
He ran away because he was too stupid.

515
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,280
We were also killed.

516
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,280
We were also killed.

517
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,280
Don't blame the police for everything.

518
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,280
Don't blame you for being stupid.

519
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,280
You can't find out who you are.

520
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,280
You can't find out who you are.

521
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,280
How can you say that?

522
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,280
How did we get away?

523
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,280
Who did we come here for?

524
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,280
Yes.

525
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,280
We didn't find your car.

526
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,280
But we at least broke the road sign.

527
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,280
At least we gave you a car.

528
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,280
How did we get away?

529
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,280
We will definitely find out the water.

530
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,280
We will find out later.

531
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,280
But Shu Bo Tian,

532
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,280
this is a matter of fate.

533
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,280
He broke us and you.

534
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,280
He broke us.

535
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,280
He broke us.

536
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,280
We deserve it.

537
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,280
He broke you.

538
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,280
He can't live either.

539
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,280
Okay, okay.

540
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,280
Let's go.

541
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,280
Don't run away.

542
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,280
Let's go.

543
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,280
Let's go.

544
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,280
Are you okay?

545
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,280
I'm fine.

546
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,280
If you go back to the hotel,

547
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,280
you can go back to the hotel.

548
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,280
Okay, okay.

549
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,280
We will find out the water.

550
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,280
We will find out the water.

551
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,280
Don't worry.

552
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,280
Don't worry.

553
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,280
We will definitely find out the water.

554
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,280
Come on, come on.

555
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,280
Come on.

556
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,280
Thank you so much.

557
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,280
Thank you so much.

558
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,280
Don't give us the car.

559
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,280
Don't, don't.

560
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,280
We should do this.

561
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,280
Wait a minute.

562
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,280
Come on.

563
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,280
Come on.

564
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,280
Call me.

565
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,280
Tell you what.

566
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,280
These cars are from the police.

567
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,280
We are here to thank you.

568
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,280
Thank you.

569
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,280
No, no, no.

570
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,280
This is our 8-Litre Pact.

571
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,280
It's a common result.

572
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,280
You should take it.

573
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,280
It's a new meaning for the group.

574
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,280
Without you and Yang Shu,

575
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,280
the car won't be here.

576
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,280
Yang Shu.

577
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,280
Come on.

578
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,280
Please show us your face.

579
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,280
Please show us your face.

580
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,280
Please show us your face.

581
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,280
Please take it.

582
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,280
Please take it.

583
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,280
Please take it.

584
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,280
The police are not enough.

585
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,280
We should thank the public for their support.

586
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,280
Please give them a big hand.

587
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,280
Please give them a big hand.

588
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,280
Please give them a big hand.

589
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,280
Please give them a big hand.

590
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,280
Please give them a big hand.

591
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,280
Good, good.

592
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,280
Good.

593
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,280
What's up?

594
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,280
Xizi, please show us your face.

595
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,280
Please take it.

596
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,280
Please take it.

597
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,280
Brother Cao,

598
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,280
can I take a picture with you?

599
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,280
Sure.

600
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,280
Take a picture.

601
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,280
Yang Shu.

602
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,280
Can I take a picture with you?

603
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,280
This is your effort.

604
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,280
Your idea is the best.

605
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,280
I won't take it.

606
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,280
This matter is your work.

607
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,280
How about I take a picture with you?

608
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,280
Yang Shu, come on.

609
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,280
Take a picture.

610
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,280
Give me a face.

611
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,280
What a long way to go.

612
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,280
Yang Shu, smile.

613
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,280
Brother Cao,

614
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,280
are you going to the old town?

615
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,280
You haven't left yet.

616
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,280
I'm going.

617
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,280
I'm going.

618
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,280
Master, I'll go to the old town.

619
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,280
Yang Yang,

620
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,280
Yang Yang,

621
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,280
you're here to change your shoes.

622
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,280
What are you going to say to the old man?

623
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,280
I'm going to show him

624
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,280
the old man's shoes.

625
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,280
I've baked a top 100 of my month's salary.

626
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,280
My daughter is awesome.

627
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,280
Have a seat.

628
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,280
Mom.

629
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,280
Mom.

630
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,280
Mom.

631
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,280
Mom.

632
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,280
Mom.

633
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,280
After you go, you must be polite.

634
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,280
Don't eat too much.

635
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,280
Don't eat too much.

636
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,280
Dad.

637
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,280
Dad.

638
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,280
Dad.

639
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,280
What are you looking at?

640
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,280
Did you get the money?

641
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,280
I was wondering

642
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,280
if I wanted to go with you

643
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,280
to see the old man.

644
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,280
I didn't bring it up.

645
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,280
You really like it.

646
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,280
You want me to go home and ask for your life?

647
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,280
What's wrong with it?

648
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,280
I just miss my old man.

649
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,280
I'll spend the rest of my life with him.

650
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,280
Don't worry.

651
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,280
He's the only one

652
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,280
who cares about you.

653
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,280
You're right.

654
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,280
You're the one who cares about me.

655
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,280
I'm not worried about you.

656
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,280
I'm worried about you.

657
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,280
Let's go.

658
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,280
Okay.

659
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,280
Good boy.

660
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,280
We're back.

661
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,280
Hello, dad.

662
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,280
Come on.

663
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,280
Come here.

664
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,280
Poor boy.

665
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,280
He's in school again.

666
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,280
Dad, you'll be used to it.

667
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,280
Yaya, what do you want to see?

668
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,280
I'll get the money.

669
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,280
You're smart.

670
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,280
Mom.

671
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,280
Dad, how's your second child?

672
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,280
Good.

673
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,280
Black dog.

674
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,280
This is what Jianjun bought for you.

675
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,280
He didn't want to buy it.

676
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,280
He's just like an old man.

677
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,280
He's so busy all day.

678
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,280
He'll have to buy it.

679
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,280
Xiaohui is here.

680
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,280
Sis.

681
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,280
Jianjun is here too.

682
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,280
Have some fruits and we'll have dinner.

683
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,280
Sis, why didn't you come to the school?

684
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,280
Don't mention it.

685
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,280
I said, a kid like him

686
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,280
can be seen in school.

687
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,280
He can't be seen on the street.

688
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,280
He's angry with the international community.

689
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,280
There's a school event today.

690
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,280
He can't come.

691
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,280
My sister is rich.

692
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,280
She can't spend money anywhere.

693
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,280
For the kid?

694
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,280
Yes, she's late.

695
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,280
You guys talk first.

696
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,280
We'll have dinner later.

697
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,280
Okay.

698
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,280
Mom, take a look.

699
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,280
What did Jianjun buy for you?

700
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,280
He doesn't spend money.

701
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,280
I bought it for Xiaohui.

702
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,280
Western style.

703
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,280
Good.

704
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,280
I don't understand.

705
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,280
This is for protein.

706
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,280
It's for health.

707
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,280
It's a high-end product.

708
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,280
I bought it for him.

709
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,280
You don't like it?

710
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,280
This is for the knee.

711
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,280
It's expensive.

712
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,280
You have to eat it.

713
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,280
I'll buy it for you.

714
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,280
Good.

715
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,280
I have your stuff.

716
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,280
I should eat this.

717
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,280
Your dad is young.

718
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,280
I've never been a three-year-old.

719
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,280
He's back.

720
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,280
He said he'd go back to the city.

721
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,280
He doesn't have money.

722
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,280
He doesn't want to be embarrassed.

723
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,280
What did he buy?

724
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,280
Bread.

725
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,280
That's a big bag.

726
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,280
He hasn't seen it.

727
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,280
Dad, you'll buy something.

728
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,280
I'll buy something.

729
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,280
Dad, you'll buy something.

730
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,280
It's beautiful.

731
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,280
Huihui.

732
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,280
Come here.

733
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,280
Come.

734
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,280
Your brother-in-law

735
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,280
gave me

736
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,280
tens of thousands.

737
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,280
I'll take care of it.

738
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,280
How?

739
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,280
Look at the color.

740
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,280
It's tens of thousands.

741
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,280
Yougong.

742
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,280
Tell me.

743
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,280
Don't be mad.

744
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,280
16.

745
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,280
I have to buy it.

746
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,280
What's wrong?

747
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,280
You're so...

748
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,280
What's wrong?

749
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,280
You're so cheap.

750
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,280
You're burning it.

751
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,280
You have to buy it.

752
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,280
You're a good boy.

753
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,280
You're so...

754
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,280
You're so greedy.

755
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,280
You're so...

756
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,280
You're so...

757
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,280
You're so good at talking.

758
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,280
You're so...

759
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,280
Brother-in-law.

760
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,280
Don't make me mad.

761
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,280
We just broke up.

762
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,280
We just broke up.

763
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,280
One fish-pot

764
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,280
is 200 yuan.

765
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,280
It's tens of thousands.

766
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,280
It's a big deal.

767
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,280
It's been more than ten years.

768
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,280
I'm the one.

769
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,280
Jianjun.

770
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,280
Look at the money.

771
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,280
It's a real deal.

772
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,280
And this.

773
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,280
The official certificate.

774
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,280
The guarantee.

775
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,280
The official certificate?

776
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,280
The official certificate?

777
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,280
Then...

778
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,280
This kind of certificate is fake, right?

779
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,280
You're so...

780
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,280
Don't show it to him.

781
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,280
I don't understand.

782
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,280
That's true.

783
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,280
The police.

784
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,280
They're responsible for the crime.

785
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,280
They must have seen a lot of fake goods.

786
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,280
They must have seen a lot of fake goods.

787
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,280
They must have seen a lot of fake goods.

788
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,280
I'm so happy.

789
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,280
Thank you.

790
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,280
Why are you laughing at me?

791
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,280
Look.

792
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,280
We're not good at taking care of the cats.

793
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,280
They're different.

794
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,280
And we should be good at taking care of the cats.

795
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,280
We should be good at taking care of the cats.

796
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,280
Right, Mr. He?

797
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,280
It's true.

798
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,280
Mr. He,

799
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,280
you're not a good person.

800
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,280
You're the chief.

801
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,280
You're a good person.

802
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,280
You should be good at taking care of the cats.

803
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,280
Right?

804
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,280
I hope you're a good person.

805
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,280
We should do it.

806
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,280
That's right.

807
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,280
You're a good person.

808
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:07,280
This society,

809
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:11,280
needs the police to protect it.

810
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,280
I agree.

811
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,280
So, you mean,

812
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,280
his brother-in-law is a businessman.

813
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,280
He needs to rely on the police.

814
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,280
Mom,

815
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,280
it's a peaceful age.

816
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,280
What did I say?

817
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,280
Look.

818
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,280
You're protecting him.

819
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,280
Why are you following him?

820
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,280
Mom,

821
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,280
any age,

822
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,280
people should rely on the police.

823
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,280
But the hard part is the police's likes.

824
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,280
They're afraid of it every day.

825
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,280
The kids don't care.

826
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,280
Little Song told me,

827
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,280
when you were little,

828
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,280
your brother-in-law loved him the most.

829
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,280
Now, Little Song is a little bit

830
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,280
more complicated.

831
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,280
He's a good person.

832
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,280
Xiaohui, I know the police is not good.

833
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,280
If you have any problems,

834
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,280
just tell your brother-in-law.

835
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,280
I guarantee you.

836
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,280
Brother-in-law, thank you.

837
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,280
I don't care. I'm willing to.

838
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,280
This girl,

839
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,280
she's so stubborn.

840
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,280
Your mom is still in pain.

841
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,280
Don't be in pain.

842
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,280
I'll take care of your heart.

843
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,280
I'm not eating.

844
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,280
Let's go.

845
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,280
What are you doing?

846
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,280
The food is ready. Where are you going?

847
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,280
I'm full. I'm not eating.

848
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,280
What? You haven't heard it?

849
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,280
Mom, you're kidding me.

850
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,280
You're right. You didn't let me talk.

851
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,280
You're still talking.

852
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,280
Why are you being serious?

853
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,280
Don't persuade me.

854
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,280
Let's go.

855
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,280
Let's go.

856
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,280
Mom, Dad.

857
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,280
Sorry, I'm sorry.

858
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,280
I'm sorry.

859
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,280
Go to your mom.

860
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,280
Mom,

861
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,280
tell me.

862
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,280
The county army is not easy to get back.

863
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,280
The army is not easy to get back.

864
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,280
You're the one who's got the attitude.

865
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,280
What's wrong with my attitude?

866
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,280
What's wrong with my attitude?

867
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,280
You're a daughter.

868
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,280
You're afraid of nothing but a thousand bowls of rice.

869
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,280
You've got nothing.

870
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,280
I can't say it.

871
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,280
I'm going to talk.

872
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,280
I...

873
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,280
The test is indeed a problem.

874
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,280
It's also a fact.

875
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,280
Give yourself some time to think.

876
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:49,280
Although I'm not satisfied with my actual work,

877
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,280
I'm still very honest.

878
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,280
You're still not leaving?

879
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,280
I still have some things to do.

880
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,280
Master, you're not going back.

881
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,280
Why are you back?

882
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,280
Good question.

883
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,280
I'm sorry.

884
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,280
I'm sorry.

885
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,280
You haven't eaten anything, have you?

886
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,280
Let's go.

887
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,280
I'll have some rice with you.

888
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,280
Master, I'm not going.

889
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,280
You can go by yourself.

890
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,280
It's not okay for you to not eat.

891
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,280
Let's go.

892
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,280
Master, please.

893
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,280
Master, I'm not hungry.

894
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,280
Really. You can go by yourself.

895
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,280
Master.

896
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,280
Sister.

897
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,280
Who is it?

898
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,280
What's the matter?

899
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,280
I'm going to work for you today.

900
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,280
Brother Cao, are you not going to stay?

901
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,280
I'm telling you, I'm not going to work for you today.

902
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,280
You can't let me work for you.

903
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,280
Or I'll go back.

904
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,280
I'm not going to work for you either.

905
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,280
Master.

906
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,280
Master.

907
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,280
Let's go.

908
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,280
Look.

909
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,280
I don't know what to do with the stock.

910
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,280
I'm a little bit bored, but I'm still working.

911
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,280
Master, what do you want to drink?

912
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,280
I'll get it.

913
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,280
Master.

914
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,280
Some people are doing the police.

915
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,280
They don't seem to be doing anything else.

916
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,280
The things that we do at work are all those things.

917
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,280
Eat.

918
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,280
Eat.

919
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,280
Master, you're putting wine in here.

920
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,280
Master, I'm not allowed to drink in the 305.

921
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,280
What is this?

922
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,280
What is this?

923
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,280
This is for work.

924
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,280
I'm at home.

925
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,280
What if the notification suddenly says to work overtime?

926
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,280
What do you mean?

927
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,280
What do you mean?

928
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,280
What if the notification suddenly says to work overtime?

929
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,280
I'm going to drink with my disciple.

930
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,280
I'll tell him what I want to say.

931
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,280
Why don't you tell him?

932
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,280
Master, don't drink.

933
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,280
I have a cup of wine today.

934
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,280
I just want to drink.

935
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,280
I want to tell him what I usually can't say.

936
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,280
Master, you can say anything you want to say.

937
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,280
You don't need to drink.

938
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,280
No, I have to.

939
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,280
You don't need to drink.

940
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,280
I have to.

941
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,280
You didn't drive today.

942
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,280
I'll drink later.

943
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,280
You can send me back.

944
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,280
No problem.

945
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,280
I'll definitely not drive if I drink.

946
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,280
This is the bottom line.

947
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,280
Don't worry.

948
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,280
Master,

949
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:07,280
I just want to be a good judge.

950
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,280
I know, master.

951
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,280
You don't know.

952
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,280
Your mother-in-law, my daughter-in-law,

953
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,280
are excellent.

954
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,280
They look beautiful.

955
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,280
They have culture.

956
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,280
They are from my family.

957
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,280
They are very good.

958
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,280
They look like my children.

959
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,280
They are very good.

960
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,280
They don't need to drive every day.

961
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,280
They are very good.

962
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,280
They take care of me and my uncle.

963
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,280
What can I say?

964
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,280
Sit down.

965
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,280
Do your job well.

966
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,280
Let her be happy and happy.

967
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,280
Let her have a husband.

968
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,280
I don't know why I...

969
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,280
I'm so worried about her mother-in-law.

970
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,280
I always think I'm not good.

971
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,280
I always think I can't be with her.

972
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,280
I don't care what you do to me.

973
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,280
She makes my wife feel that she has no husband.

974
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,280
She can't even get a haircut.

975
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,280
But master will do the police.

976
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,280
He loves the police.

977
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,280
I always think that if I do the police job well,

978
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,280
I will be successful.

979
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:52,280
I can turn my wife into a real estate agent.

980
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:57,280
Yes, I understand.

981
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,280
You don't understand?

982
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:06,280
You think you are blaming me?

983
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,280
I don't blame you anymore, master.

984
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,280
You blame me?

985
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,280
That's right.

986
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,280
It's my fault.

987
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,280
I'm so worried.

988
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:31,280
I'm sorry, master.

989
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,280
Don't drink.

990
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,280
It's over.

991
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,280
Don't be angry.

992
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,280
It's not over.

993
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,280
I told you it's not over.

994
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,280
I just took your credit.

995
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,280
I can't stand the situation.

996
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,280
My mother-in-law can't even do me a favor.

997
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,280
I still feel sorry for my wife.

998
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:00,280
I think she's so angry.

999
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,280
I think she's so blind.

1000
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,280
She's talking for me.

1001
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,280
I just...

1002
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,280
I just feel so sorry for her.

1003
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,280
What are you doing?

1004
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,280
Master,

1005
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,280
eat more vegetables.

1006
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,280
Eat more.

1007
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,280
I'm sorry.

1008
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,280
I'm sorry.

1009
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,280
I'm sorry.

1010
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,280
I'm sorry.

1011
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,280
I'm sorry.

1012
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,280
I'm sorry.

1013
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,280
I'm sorry.

1014
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,280
I'm sorry.

1015
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,280
I'm sorry.

1016
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,280
I'm sorry.

1017
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:40,280
I'm sorry.

1018
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,280
I'm sorry.

1019
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,280
I'm sorry.

1020
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,280
I'm sorry.

1021
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,280
I'm sorry.

1022
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,280
I'm sorry.
