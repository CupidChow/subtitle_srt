00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,300
Whumo, I was not expecting this.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,980
Ok,

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,040
Hey

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,560
What?

5
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,400
Are you doing business?

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,400
I'm going to make a little bit of a

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,400

very close

33
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,400
to

34
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,600
However, to ensure this business forms mesh between two friends,

35
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,940
we should always consider the process we make well in advance.

36
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,000
Deep Deep касantom

37
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,220
Hey, stop!

38
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,180
That'snot the right Girl, right?

39
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,180
Cheers!

40
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,180
Cheers!

41
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,180
I'll drink some more.

Cheers!

43
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,180
You're drinking fast.

44
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,180
I'm happy.

45
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,180
Uncle, uncle, uncle.

46
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,180
You can't drink anymore.

47
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,180
You're already drunk.

48
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,180
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

49
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,180
You're drunk.

50
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,180
I'm the one who's going to drink.

51
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,180
You're going to drink, right?

52
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,180
You're drunk, too.

53
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,180
You're drunk.

54
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,180
Uncle, uncle, uncle.

55
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,180
You can't see me as well.

56
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,180
How is that possible?

57
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,180
You can't drink anymore.

58
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,180
You can't drink anymore.

59
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,180
Drink enough.

60
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,180
You guys take it.

61
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,180
Little boy.

62
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,180
It's okay.

63
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,180
I'm just a little boy.

64
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,180
Come on, drink it.

65
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,180
Uncle, uncle.

00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,180
Uncle, uncle.

67
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,180
Don't take it to heart, uncle.

68
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,180
It's easy to be drunk.

69
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,180
Don't drink.

70
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,180
Today is the day of drinking.

71
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,180
We must drink beauty.

72
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,180
We must drink beauty.

73
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,180
Don't drink.

74
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,180
Are you happy?

75
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,180
Happy.

76
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,180
Don't drink.

77
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,180
You're drunk.

78
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,180
Don't drive.

79
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,180
We're looking for a driver.

80
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,180
Be careful.

81
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,180
We'll drink.

82
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,180
Don't drink.

83
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,180
Be careful.

84
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,180
Be careful.

85
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,180
Be careful.

86
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,180
Be careful.

87
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,180
Don't drive when you're drunk.

88
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,180
We're looking for a driver.

89
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,180
Okay.

90
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,180
Wait for me.

91
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,180
I'm going.

92
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,180
See you later.

93
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,180
Get in the car.

94
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,180
Be careful.

95
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,180
Go.

96
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,180
It's okay, master.

97
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,180
Don't worry.

98
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,180
Bye.

99
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,180
I'll be back.

100
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,180
I'll take you back.

101
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,180
Uncle.

102
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,180
I've been calling you back.

103
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,180
I haven't eaten well.

104
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,180
It's okay.

105
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,180
You can rest.

106
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,180
Give me the car keys.

107
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,180
What's wrong?

108
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,180
My phone is in the kitchen.

109
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,180
It's okay, master.

110
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,180
Master.

111
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,180
Wait for me here.

112
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,180
I'll get it for you.

113
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,180
Okay.

114
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,180
Wait for me.

115
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,180
What's wrong with you?

116
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,180
I'll get you a car.

117
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,180
Master.

118
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,180
You're done with your meal.

119
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,180
Can you please hide the car?

120
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,180
Let the car stop.

121
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,180
There's no car seat.

122
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,180
Okay.

123
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,180
Thank you, master.

124
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,180
Thank you.

125
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,180
The car is in the kitchen.

126
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,180
How can you drive?

127
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,180
You don't know how to drive.

128
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,180
The car just came out.

129
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,180
You're driving too fast.

130
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,180
You're against the rules.

131
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,180
You're talking about me?

132
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,180
Let's call the police.

133
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,180
I just want to stop.

134
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,180
What's wrong with you?

135
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,180
There's a police.

136
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,180
No need to call.

137
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,180
Wait for me.

138
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,180
Excuse me, sir.

139
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,180
Excuse me, sir.

140
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,180
I'll go to see Master.

141
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,180
Hello.

142
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,180
Sir.

143
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,180
What's wrong?

144
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,180
Look at him.

145
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,180
He's not letting me drive.

146
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,180
He just hit me.

147
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,180
Hello.

148
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,180
Excuse me, sir.

149
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,180
I'm Xia Zhizhen.

150
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,180
I'm Xia Zhizhen.

151
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,180
Please come in.

152
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,180
Bro.

153
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,180
What's wrong with you?

154
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,180
You're not a family.

155
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,180
You're a real family.

156
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,180
What do you mean?

157
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,180
I'm not a family.

158
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,180
I'm serious.

159
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,180
What's wrong?

160
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,180
Okay.

161
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,180
It's a police.

162
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,180
What's wrong?

163
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,180
You're asking him about the car.

164
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,180
I'm sorry.

165
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,180
Comrade Jiao Ding.

166
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,180
He's a police officer.

167
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,180
What do you think he's doing?

168
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,180
Comrade Jiang.

169
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,180
Comrade Jiang.

170
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,180
I'm sorry.

171
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,180
I'm sorry.

172
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,180
I'm sorry.

173
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,180
Sir.

174
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,180
Comrade Jiang.

175
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,180
It must be a misunderstanding.

176
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,180
My master didn't plan to drive.

177
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,180
He just...

178
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,180
He just hit me.

179
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,180
I didn't drink.

180
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,180
I came here to drive.

181
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,180
I gave him.

182
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,180
Comrade.

183
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,180
He...

184
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,180
He didn't drive.

185
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,180
He just hit me.

186
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,180
He hit you?

187
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,180
He hit you on the road?

188
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,180
He just hit me.

189
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,180
He hit me on the road?

190
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,180
He hit you on the road?

191
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,180
He hit me.

192
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,180
Right?

193
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,180
I'll go with you.

194
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,180
Comrade Tao.

195
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,180
Right?

196
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,180
Okay.

197
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,180
Comrade Jiao Ding.

198
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,180
He's a police officer.

199
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,180
What do you think he's doing?

200
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,180
Get off.

201
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,180
I'm not a police officer.

202
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,180
I'm just a motorbike.

203
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,180
Why are you so rude?

204
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,180
What are you doing?

205
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,180
What are you doing?

206
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,180
Stop talking.

207
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,180
I'm sorry.

208
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,180
Don't be so serious.

209
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,180
Please.

210
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,180
Don't talk, master.

211
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,180
Comrade Jiao.

212
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,180
I know it's our fault.

213
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,180
We're responsible for it.

214
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,180
But master,

215
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,180
he didn't plan to get married.

216
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,180
He just drove.

217
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,180
I...

218
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,180
I just gave him a phone number.

219
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,180
He just...

220
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,180
Master,

221
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,180
I'm sorry.

222
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,180
I broke your car.

223
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,180
You can always keep it.

224
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,180
Or you can tell me

225
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,180
what other requirements you have.

226
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,180
I'll love you.

227
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,180
I don't have any requirements.

228
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,180
I'll see how to deal with a police officer.

229
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,180
My dowry.

230
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,180
Yes.

231
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,180
Where's the toilet?

232
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,180
You're a police officer.

233
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,180
Don't you know

234
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,180
that you can't drive when you're drunk?

235
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,180
Comrade Jiao.

236
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,180
He knows it.

237
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,180
He knows it.

238
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,180
When his friend left,

239
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,180
he asked them to take him.

240
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,180
Comrade Jiao.

241
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,180
He...

242
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,180
He didn't drive.

243
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,180
He...

244
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,180
He didn't drive.

245
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,180
He didn't drive.

246
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,180
How did he get on the road

247
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,180
without driving?

248
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,180
He just...

249
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,180
Stop him.

250
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,180
You...

251
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,180
I'm sorry.

252
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,180
Walk with me.

253
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,180
Where are you taking him to?

254
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,180
You didn't want to take him away.

255
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,180
You let him go.

256
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,180
What do you mean?

257
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,180
He's drunk.

258
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,180
I'll take him back to deal with him.

259
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,180
What do you say?

260
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,180
Don't worry.

261
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,180
Don't worry.

262
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,180
You can go with him.

263
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,180
Bro.

264
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,180
Do you need him?

265
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,180
Master.

266
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,180
You can't talk to our police officer

267
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,180
when he's at the toilet.

268
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,180
Master.

269
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,180
I don't want you to talk to him.

270
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,180
I don't want you to talk to him.

271
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,180
Do you hear me?

272
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,180
What do you want me to do?

273
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,180
Don't talk to him.

274
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,180
Master.

275
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,180
Master.

276
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,180
What are you driving?

277
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,180
What are you driving?

278
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,180
Don't you want to hurt me?

279
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,180
You...

280
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,180
Don't let me get out of the car.

281
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,180
He let you drive.

282
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,180
You don't know how to drink.

283
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,180
I just want to stop.

284
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,180
You're right.

285
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,180
Master.

286
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,180
Master.

287
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,180
Now you...

288
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,180
You need to be more careful.

289
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,180
You know what's going on.

290
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,180
Do you know how serious it is?

291
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,180
Calm down.

292
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,180
I'll handle it.

293
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,180
Miss.

294
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,180
I'm sorry.

295
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,180
I'm in trouble.

296
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,180
I know it's our responsibility.

297
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,180
I'm sorry.

298
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,180
Call your colleagues.

299
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,180
Look, is this okay?

300
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,180
Or if there's any problem,

301
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,180
I'll send him back.

302
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,180
Then I'll ask you to deal with him.

303
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,180
We'll talk face to face.

304
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,180
His family?

305
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,180
It's his family.

306
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,180
Why should I take you back?

307
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,180
Listen to me.

308
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,180
You drive his car.

309
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,180
Take him with you.

310
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,180
Let me go.

311
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,180
Uncle Yang.

312
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,180
Don't care about anything.

313
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,180
Just see what they can do to me.

314
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,180
Master, can you stop talking?

315
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,180
You're wrong.

316
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,180
Don't you know?

317
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,180
Can we listen to you?

318
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,180
What does he know?

319
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,180
I beg you.

320
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,180
Can you listen to me?

321
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,180
Calm down.

322
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,180
Calm down.

323
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,180
Comrade Qingyun.

324
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,180
Why don't you go with me

325
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,180
on our car?

326
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,180
I have a car.

327
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,180
Miss.

328
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,180
Are you going to the police

329
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,180
with us

330
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,180
or do you want to listen to

331
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,180
our decision?

332
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,180
I have something to do.

333
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,180
I'll wait at home.

334
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,180
Okay.

335
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,180
Then you can leave your contact information.

336
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,180
Thank you for your cooperation.

337
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,180
I've recorded it.

338
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,180
I'll see

339
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,180
if you're doing justice.

340
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,180
Comrade Qingyun.

341
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,180
Take him with you.

342
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,180
Follow me.

343
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,180
Master.

344
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,180
Just go.

345
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:09,180
Master, you're so ridiculous.

346
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,180
Why are you running away from the police?

347
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,180
You've hurt yourself.

348
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,180
It's all right.

349
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,180
Listen to me.

350
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,180
We'll be in the police.

351
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,180
You've made a mistake.

352
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,180
Don't fight with them again.

353
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,180
I can't.

354
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,180
I'm a stranger.

355
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,180
I'm working hard

356
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,180
to fight them.

357
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,180
Master.

358
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,180
Don't say that.

359
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,180
Master.

360
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,180
If you say that,

361
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,180
it'll only make things more troublesome.

362
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,180
I'll call everyone.

363
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,180
Don't.

364
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,180
Yang Rong.

365
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,180
Well.

366
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,180
Don't say anything.

367
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,180
I'm afraid I can't hide it.

368
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,180
Master.

369
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,180
Please wake up.

370
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,180
Second Brother.

371
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,180
Master, wake up.

372
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,180
You're so capable.

373
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,180
You're so good at driving.

374
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,180
Let's go.

375
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,180
Let's go.

376
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,180
Master, wake up.

377
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,180
Second Brother.

378
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,180
Comrade Qingyun.

379
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,180
Comrade Zhang.

380
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,180
Please explain to me.

381
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,180
Don't put him in the room.

382
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,180
I'm sorry.

383
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,180
It's nothing.

384
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,180
Just wait here.

385
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,180
No, Comrade Qingyun.

386
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,180
Comrade Qingyun.

387
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,180
Please listen to me.

388
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,180
My master is so ridiculous.

389
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:37,180
Do you know the business case of Lianhua Mountain?

390
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:40,180
I risked my life to break that case.

391
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,180
He was so happy

392
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,180
to have a few drinks for this case.

393
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,180
He didn't plan to drive.

394
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,180
I was called by him.

395
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,180
I went in to get him a...

396
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,180
I went in to get him a phone.

397
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:56,180
The restaurant waiter asked him to get in the car.

398
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:00,180
But I know this must be wrong.

399
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,180
But after all, it's a family.

400
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,180
It's not the same.

401
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,180
Stop it.

402
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,180
You're too secretive.

403
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,180
Wait here.

404
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,180
Let's go.

405
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,180
Let's go.

406
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,180
This way.

407
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,180
Sit there.

408
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,180
Here you are.

409
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,180
What are you wearing today?

410
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,180
Look.

411
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,180
Look at this.

412
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,180
What's your name?

413
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,180
Two dollars.

414
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,180
You're not bad.

415
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,180
I'm quite new today.

416
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,180
You're a good person.

417
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,180
How much is the top?

418
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,180
Five dollars.

419
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,180
It's a lot.

420
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,180
Five dollars for the top yesterday.

421
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,180
Seven dollars.

422
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,180
Yes, seven dollars.

423
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,180
I'm so happy.

424
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,180
I'm not poor.

425
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,180
I'm not poor.

426
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,180
Uncle Yang,

427
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,180
you called me the first time.

428
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,180
What's wrong?

429
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,180
What?

430
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,180
Okay.

431
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,180
I'll be there soon.

432
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,180
Wang Shuyi.

433
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,180
Give it to me.

434
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,180
I have something to do.

435
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,180
Wang Shuyi.

436
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,180
Wang Shuyi.

437
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,180
What are you doing?

438
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,180
I'm going to kill you.

439
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,180
I'm going to send you a gift box.

440
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,180
Here.

441
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,180
Blow it.

442
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,180
Brother.

443
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,180
I was just saying that.

444
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,180
Do you know?

445
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,180
Anyway,

446
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,180
this is my job.

447
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,180
Please cooperate.

448
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,180
I'll blow it.

449
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,180
I'll blow it.

450
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,180
I heard you've been working.

451
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,180
You're happy now, right?

452
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,180
You're happy now.

453
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,180
You can't drive.

454
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,180
It's a basic thing.

455
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,180
You're a cop.

456
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,180
Don't you know?

457
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,180
I'm telling you.

458
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,180
You're going to be in trouble this time.

459
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,180
Sit down.

460
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,180
I'll go.

461
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,180
I'm telling you.

462
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,180
You're going to be in trouble this time.

463
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,180
I'll go.

464
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,180
President.

465
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,180
What's going on?

466
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,180
Sorry, President.

467
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,180
Sorry.

468
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,180
I'm sorry.

469
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,180
I'm sorry.

470
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,180
Don't fight.

471
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,180
Come, let's go.

472
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,180
Theiboo!

473
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,180
Where is the car?

474
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,180
I'm coming.

475
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,180
Hold on!

476
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,180
How dare they drive you home!

477
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,740
What are you doing?

478
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,860
My master didn't plan to drive.

479
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,860
He drove 50 meters to the counter.

480
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,380
Who would know it's so bad?

481
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,780
You must find a way to save him.

482
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:12,180
I'm afraid I can't help him.

483
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,660
Let's go.

484
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,660
Go and see.

485
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,300
Uncle Yang, you're really...

486
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,180
You're really a loser.

487
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,380
Stop!

488
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,340
The car is still in the way.

489
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,340
Don't run!

490
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,580
Stop!

491
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,820
Don't run!

492
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,260
Captain, my master's car.

493
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,260
Master!

494
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,420
Stop!

495
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,460
Run!

496
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,900
Captain Tao, you're going to kill me.

497
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,300
Captain Tao!

498
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,180
The road is on the road.

499
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,300
Someone is blocking the road.

500
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,100
They just passed by.

501
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,100
Stop him!

502
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,300
Run or you won't be able to run.

503
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,420
Captain, Captain.

504
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,580
Hello, I'm Captain Wang Shu Yi,

505
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,780
the captain of the Barrier and the Pair.

506
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,380
Are you the team leader?

507
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,300
Captain, I'm in the wrong.

508
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,300
Give me some time.

509
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,940
I'll call him right away.

510
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,980
Wait for him to come back and take his hand.

511
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,020
Take his hand?

512
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:03,740
It's so serious.

513
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,180
What do you think?

514
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,100
No.

515
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,060
No, no, no. Give him some chance.

516
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,620
Give him some chance.

517
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,260
Stop it!

518
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,660
The car can't be called.

519
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,860
He's going to call again.

520
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:15,660
Yes, yes, yes.

521
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,860
What are you talking about?

522
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:21,180
Comrade, think of a way to stop him.

523
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,380
You must stop him.

524
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,580
I'll stop him.

525
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,580
Okay.

526
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,260
I got it.

527
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,060
Turn around.

528
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,820
There's a car again.

529
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,820
It's stopped.

530
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,860
Ready.

531
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,860
Captain,

532
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,220
how is it going now?

533
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,860
The law says

534
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,820
you have to study law.

535
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,820
I'm sorry, Sui Xiao.

536
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,820
This is half of my life.

537
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,820
You've been in the house for three years.

538
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,820
I can't stand it anymore.

539
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,820
I can't stand it anymore.

540
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:43,820
I can't stand it anymore.

541
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,820
My master is...

542
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,820
He's actually very simple.

543
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,820
He's actually very simple.

544
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,820
He's just happy today.

545
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,820
He's done his job, he's gone.

546
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,820
He's been doing his best.

547
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,820
How can we find a way to stop him?

548
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,820
You know that he's a very simple person.

549
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,820
He's just happy today.

550
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,820
I'm sorry, Sui Xiao.

551
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,820
I didn't forgive him.

552
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,820
I...

553
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,820
I'm responsible for him.

554
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,820
I'm responsible for the death of Sui Xiao.

555
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:49,820
He's been doing his own business.

556
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,820
How can you be responsible for him?

557
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:01,820
There are some things we can do.

558
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:06,820
There are some things that can't be done.

559
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:15,820
The police can't do this job anymore.

560
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:19,820
I don't know if he'll be able to do it.

561
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,820
Let's see how much he can do.

562
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,820
He hasn't reached the highest level.

563
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,820
Even if he hasn't reached the highest level,

564
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:39,820
two times, he'll be able to escape.

565
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:43,820
It's hard to see him anymore.

566
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,820
I'm sorry.

567
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,820
I'm sorry.

568
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,820
Sui Xiao.

569
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,820
Sui Xiao.

570
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,820
I have to go to see them.

571
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,820
You wait for me here.

572
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:46,820
I'm going to see my teacher.

573
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,820
Okay.

574
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,820
Let's go.

575
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,820
Come.

576
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:56,820
Have a look.

577
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:01,820
The highest standard is 80% of the students who don't have a good student.

578
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,820
He's 127.

579
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,820
He's the worst.

580
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:09,820
He's got two traffic jams and he's going to be able to escape.

581
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:15,820
Is he in a situation like this?

582
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:17,820
Yes.

583
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,820
It's clear.

584
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,820
What's going on?

585
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,820
It's like this.

586
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:29,820
He's the famous police.

587
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,820
He has a lot of work to do.

588
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:37,820
But if he leaves, he'll be in trouble for many days.

589
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:41,820
Can you let me talk to him before you leave?

590
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,820
I'll talk to him about his work.

591
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:47,820
I'm sorry.

592
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:50,820
Comrade.

593
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,820
We're all brothers.

594
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,820
You don't need to be so formal.

595
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:58,820
I'm a criminal.

596
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,820
So you can't handle it.

597
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,820
But you can't delay your work, right?

598
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:04,820
How about this?

599
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,820
You can stand next to him and watch.

600
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,820
Okay?

601
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,820
Where's your team leader?

602
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:10,820
He's here.

603
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,820
Come in.

604
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:14,820
Sit down.

605
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,820
Tell him.

606
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:17,820
I'm sorry.

607
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,820
I'm in trouble for you.

608
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:21,820
But there's only one thing.

609
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,820
I want to see him before you leave.

610
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:27,820
Okay?

611
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:36,820
This is a pain.

612
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,820
Take the food out.

613
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:02,820
Comrade, come out.

614
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:03,820
Go there.

615
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:28,820
Comrade.

616
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:44,820
Comrade.

617
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:46,820
I'm sorry.

618
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:48,820
I'm sorry.

619
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:50,820
I'm sorry.

620
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:52,820
I'm sorry.

621
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,820
I was so confused.

622
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,820
I just want to be more formal.

623
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:04,820
You said you were in a hurry.

624
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:06,820
You wanted to go to Baiqiang.

625
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,820
I was so embarrassed.

626
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,820
I'm sorry.

627
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,820
I don't know what to do.

628
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:15,820
I'm sorry.

629
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,820
I'm sorry.

630
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:28,820
Okay.

631
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,820
Don't say that.

632
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:34,820
Jin Jun.

633
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:39,820
Take the blame on Li Ming.

634
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,820
And investigate him.

635
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,820
I want to be in a big position.

636
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:52,820
Comrade.

637
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:54,820
I know.

638
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,820
Can you tell me

639
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,820
whether I took the credit for my second job

640
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,820
and I'm a police officer?

641
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,820
I'm a police officer.

642
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,820
What nonsense!

643
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:10,820
You're still awake?

644
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:15,820
Master.

645
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:17,820
I'm in trouble.

646
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,820
I have half the responsibility.

647
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:20,820
I'm sorry.

648
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:23,820
Master.

649
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:25,820
Listen to me.

650
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,820
Take the blame on Li Ming.

651
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,820
And find yourself in a big position.

652
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,820
I don't deserve to be your master.

653
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,820
I want to find you a master again.

654
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,820
Master.

655
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,820
You're always my master.

656
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,820
You're always my good master.

657
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:51,820
You...

658
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,820
You're the best one I've ever seen.

659
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,820
Yang.

660
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:58,820
Yang.

661
00:29:58,820 --> 00:29:59,820
Yang.

662
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,820
Get the new one.

663
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:18,820
What did you tell your family?

664
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:19,820
Tell me.

665
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:26,820
Director Su.

666
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:30,820
Can you let my family know about this?

667
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:31,820
How could you?

668
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:35,820
Because I

669
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:40,820
was at their house all day.

670
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,820
I didn't know what they said.

671
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,820
What do you care?

672
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,820
Think about it.

673
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,820
What do you want to teach them?

674
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:02,820
Hui Hui

675
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,820
made me a police officer.

676
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,820
I've never done anything wrong.

677
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,820
If you see him,

678
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:14,820
tell him I'm sorry.

679
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,820
He's dead.

680
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:20,820
Okay.

681
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:22,820
I got it.

682
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:23,820
Come on.

683
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:24,820
Okay.

684
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:25,820
Sun.

685
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:27,820
What's wrong?

686
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:29,820
I'll be right there.

687
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:31,820
I'll be right there.

688
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,820
Okay, Jiejie.

689
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:35,820
Control yourself.

690
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:39,820
Master.

691
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:42,820
Take care.

692
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:44,820
I'll wait for you.

693
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:45,820
I'll wait for you.

694
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,820
Okay.

695
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:49,820
I'll wait for you.

696
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:55,820
Director Su.

697
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,820
Can I still be a police officer?

698
00:31:58,820 --> 00:31:59,820
Can I still wait?

699
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:10,820
That's all.

700
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:11,820
Okay, thank you.

701
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:14,820
It's late.

702
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,820
Tell the team leader to thank me.

703
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:17,820
Okay.

704
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:18,820
I'll be there.

705
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:19,820
Take care.

706
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:24,820
He was thinking about it.

707
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,820
It seems like he's his wife.

708
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,820
I don't know how to tell his family.

709
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:29,820
So he didn't pick up.

710
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:32,820
Thank you.

711
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:41,820
Let's go.

712
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:48,820
Okay.

713
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:50,820
Don't cry.

714
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:53,820
Now,

715
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,820
think about it.

716
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,820
How to tell their family.

717
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,820
Director Su.

718
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:07,820
I'm sorry.

719
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,820
I'm sorry.

720
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:11,820
I'm sorry.

721
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:13,820
I'm sorry.

722
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:15,820
I'm sorry.

723
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:17,820
Director Su.

724
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:21,820
Did my master

725
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:25,820
really end up like this?

726
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:28,820
What do you mean?

727
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:32,820
Can't I be a police officer?

728
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,820
That's what others think.

729
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:37,820
But to my master,

730
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,820
it's not like a police officer.

731
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:46,820
Uncle Yang.

732
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:50,820
Okay.

733
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,820
Don't think about it.

734
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:55,820
Let's go to his house.

735
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:16,820
I'm sorry.

736
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:46,820
Who is it?

737
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,820
Today,

738
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:48,820
my father is a doctor.

739
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:16,820
Director Su.

740
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,820
What happened to the officer?

741
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,820
This is the officer's land, Uncle Yang.

742
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,820
Ding Yue,

743
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,820
can we go to the room?

744
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:29,820
Where is Han?

745
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:31,820
He's asleep.

746
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,820
What's wrong with him?

747
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:36,820
He's drunk.

748
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:39,820
You have to be strong.

749
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:41,820
I'm sorry.

750
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,820
I'm sorry.

751
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:45,820
I'm sorry.

752
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:47,820
I'm sorry.

753
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:49,820
I'm sorry.

754
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:51,820
I'm sorry.

755
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:53,820
I'm sorry.

756
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:55,820
I'm sorry.

757
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,820
I'm sorry.

758
00:35:58,820 --> 00:35:59,820
I'm sorry.

759
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:02,820
Jian Jun.

760
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:04,820
He got married.

761
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:06,820
He had a drink and drove.

762
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:07,820
He had an accident.

763
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:11,820
Where is he?

764
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:13,820
Is he okay?

765
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:14,820
He's fine.

766
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:16,820
He didn't have an accident.

767
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:20,820
But he...

768
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:23,820
He's a drunk driver.

769
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:25,820
He's still suspicious

770
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:26,820
of the police.

771
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:56,820
Zhou Hei.

772
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,820
You have to control your emotions.

773
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,820
Don't think too much.

774
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:09,820
I'm fine.

775
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,820
I just heard

776
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,820
that he had an accident.

777
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:18,820
I'm fine.

778
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:20,820
I just heard

779
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:22,820
that he had an accident.

780
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:23,820
I thought...

781
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,820
What's the matter with him?

782
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:34,820
Can I go see him?

783
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,820
I went to the police

784
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:40,820
with Uncle Yang

785
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:42,820
before you came here.

786
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:44,820
It was good.

787
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,820
I'm afraid you can't see him

788
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:49,820
for a while.

789
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:50,820
It's a good thing.

790
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:53,820
I'm suspicious of him.

791
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:58,820
You have to be prepared.

792
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:03,820
You mean

793
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:06,820
he can't go to the police?

794
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,820
The consequences are worse than this.

795
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:15,820
I'm sorry.

796
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:17,820
I'm sorry.

797
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:19,820
Hepotu.

798
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:23,820
You will help him

799
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:26,820
when you dictatorised him, right?

800
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:31,820
Zhou Hei,

801
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:32,820
you should know

802
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:34,820
that there are some things

803
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:35,820
that can be helped

804
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,820
and some things that cannot be helped.

805
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:40,820
I don't think

806
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,360
he was no longer

807
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,080
ctional

808
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,820
Very well.

809
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:14,960
Okay.

810
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,820
He is fine, right?

811
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,820
Yes, he is fine.

812
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,820
The other person is fine too.

813
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,820
The other person is fine.

814
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,820
That's enough.

815
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,820
There is nothing better than

816
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:33,820
he is fine and the other person is fine.

817
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,820
I can hear it.

818
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,820
Where is Wang Su Xiao?

819
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,820
The General,

820
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:50,820
he has been working for over ten years.

821
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:54,820
I hope that Suo can protect him.

822
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,820
General.

823
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:04,820
I can now show you a attitude

824
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,820
on behalf of Suo.

825
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,820
No matter what happens to the General,

826
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:11,820
as long as you say hello to your family,

827
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:14,820
we will do our best.

828
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,820
He is fine.

829
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:28,820
He doesn't care about the other person.

830
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:32,820
I can take him to the police station.

831
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,820
General.

832
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,820
Thank you.

833
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:49,820
You came to give me this letter.

834
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,820
Please.

835
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,820
It's my pleasure.

836
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:58,820
Then...

837
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,820
I won't talk to you.

838
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,820
Thank you.

839
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:10,820
It's getting late.

840
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:13,820
You should rest early.

841
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:18,820
Mrs. Suo.

842
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,820
I'm sorry.

843
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,820
He is my master.

844
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,820
I couldn't take good care of him.

845
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,820
I'm sorry

846
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,820
for letting him do this.

847
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:44,820
You are Uncle Yang, right?

848
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:49,820
Your master will often remind you

849
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:52,820
that you have a culture and a future.

850
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:55,820
He is not worthy of being your master.

851
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:02,820
You won't have any problems in the future.

852
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,820
Forget him.

853
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:08,820
Let's go.

854
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,820
Okay.

855
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,820
Let's go.

856
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:15,820
Call me when you have time.

857
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:23,820
Thank you.

858
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:41,820
General Cao is really unwell.

859
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:10,820
General Cao.

860
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:40,820
General Cao.

861
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:10,820
I'm sorry.

862
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:40,820
I'm sorry.
