00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I

4
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:57,760
S

5
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,760
The production of the film will start soon.

6
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,760
The 999pn channel will remind you of the exciting news.

7
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,760
Mom, I'm back.

8
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,760
I'm back.

9
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,760
Miss, you promised them you would go to the wedding ceremony.

10
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,760
You told me to go with you.

11
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,760
How about I call the office?

12
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,760
You can go if you want to go to the wedding ceremony.

13
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,760
Why should I call the office?

14
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,760
They promised me when your dad left.

15
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,760
Mom, it's been 10 years.

16
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,760
Let's not bother the office anymore.

17
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,760
If you want to go to the wedding ceremony, I'll arrange it.

18
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,760
By the way, didn't the doctor say they have two bedroom?

19
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,760
The one that is big for the doctor and the one that is rich.

20
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,760
It's not convenient.

21
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,760
What's not convenient?

22
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,760
I'm not going to the wedding ceremony.

23
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,760
Besides, you and the doctor are together.

24
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,760
I'm at ease.

25
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,760
It's not convenient.

26
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,760
Six thousand.

27
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,760
Ten thousand.

28
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,760
Ten thousand and two thousand.

29
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,760
That's crazy.

30
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,760
Aunt.

31
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,760
Xiao Jie, your mom said you didn't want your mom to live in my house.

32
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,760
She wants to rent a house for her.

33
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,760
Aunt, my mom wants to live by herself.

34
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,760
I think she thinks she can live with you.

35
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,760
She and Uncle Liang don't have a good relationship.

36
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,760
That's the truth.

37
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,760
But the rent of the house in the Dali is too expensive.

38
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,760
Otherwise, your uncle Liang will ask for a dormitory.

39
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,760
Let him help to solve the house.

40
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,760
Aunt, it's not good.

41
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,760
My mom and her relationship is not clear now.

42
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,760
I'm afraid that my mom will live in someone else's house.

43
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,760
In the future, if my mom doesn't look after Uncle Liang,

44
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,760
she will feel sorry for her love and feel sorry for herself.

45
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,760
You think about it.

46
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,760
But the rent of the house in Dali...

47
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,760
I'm looking at it.

48
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,760
Why is it so expensive?

49
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,760
It's a house around you.

50
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,760
I have a good land.

51
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,760
I'll live by your side.

52
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,760
Otherwise, I'll give your mom...

53
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,760
Aunt, it's already a big trouble for you.

54
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,760
I'll pay for the rent.

55
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,760
Don't worry. I'll help her.

56
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:45,760
Aunt, my mom is going to trouble you again.

57
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,760
Also, my mom and Uncle Liang...

58
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,760
You can give them a chance to create a new life.

59
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,760
But don't push my mom.

60
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,760
My mom sometimes thinks about it and doesn't agree.

61
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,760
I'm afraid that if she is pushed by someone,

62
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,760
she will regret it in the future.

63
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,760
Miss, do you know that she is your mom?

64
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,760
Don't you know that you think that you are her mom?

65
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,760
Okay, go back.

66
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,760
Remember to keep your mom safe.

67
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,760
Don't worry.

68
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,760
Okay, you too.

69
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,760
Tell me when you get there.

70
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,760
I'm going.

71
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,760
Xiao Jie, I'm going back.

72
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,760
What are you going back for?

73
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,760
You haven't got home yet.

74
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,760
Jing Qing is coming. You have to come back soon.

75
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,760
Hao, you dare to say that?

76
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,760
I can't say it without hearing it.

77
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,760
Bye.

78
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,760
You have to do this.

79
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,760
Bye.

80
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,760
Police! Police!

81
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,760
Dr. Wu.

82
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,760
Is there anyone else?

83
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,760
Is there anything wrong?

84
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,760
Are you a police officer?

85
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,760
Yes.

86
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,760
My daughter is lost. Help me find her.

87
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,760
Dr. Wu, tell me. I'm on duty.

88
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,760
My daughter is still young.

89
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,760
It's dark outside. She will be in danger.

90
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,760
How long has your daughter been lost?

91
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,760
Li Dawei, I'm on duty.

92
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,760
Xia Jingguan is on duty.

93
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,760
What's the matter? You want to see her?

94
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,760
I don't want to see her. I'm looking for you.

95
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,760
You have to help me find my daughter.

96
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,760
Now, Xia Jingguan is on duty.

97
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,760
I'm off duty.

98
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,760
Dr. Wu,

99
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,760
how long has Jing Qing been lost?

100
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,760
Are you familiar with my daughter?

101
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,760
I have Jing Qing's WeChat.

102
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,760
When did you add her WeChat?

103
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,760
How come I don't know?

104
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,760
No wonder my daughter is always missing.

105
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,760
You should have told me.

106
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,760
Ms. Wu, you can't say that.

107
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,760
Xia Jingguan is a police officer.

108
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,760
She must be the daughter of Guan Xin.

109
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,760
She added her WeChat.

110
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,760
Guan Xin?

111
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,760
My daughter is only 12 years old.

112
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,760
She added my daughter's WeChat when she was pregnant.

113
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,760
What's her WeChat?

114
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,760
Ms. Wu, don't be so agitated.

115
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,760
These are not the key points.

116
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,760
The key point is that

117
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,760
we should find her first, right?

118
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,760
Tell me more.

119
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,760
How long has she been lost?

120
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,760
An hour.

121
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,760
An hour and more.

122
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,760
I took her home today.

123
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,760
I cooked for her.

124
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,760
I let her write her homework in the room.

125
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,760
I always thought she was in the room.

126
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,760
When I went in, there was no one.

127
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,760
I searched the house.

128
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,760
I couldn't find the child's shadow.

129
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,760
Go back to my WeChat.

130
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,760
I told you that the one in the class

131
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,760
was the one in the last class.

132
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,760
Really?

133
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,760
She said so.

134
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,760
Wait.

135
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,760
I should call her out to bring her home.

136
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,760
You?

137
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,760
She told me the whereabouts.

138
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,760
But she didn't want you to know.

139
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,760
If you knew from my point of view,

140
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,760
you should go to her directly.

141
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,760
I'm afraid she won't even tell me next time.

142
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,760
You mean she believes you

143
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,760
and doesn't believe me as a mother?

144
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,760
Dr. Wu,

145
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,760
if you want to avoid this kind of thing,

146
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,760
let me go first.

147
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,760
Otherwise,

148
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,760
I'm afraid if she leaves again,

149
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,760
it's hard for you to find her in this way.

150
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,760
Dr. Wu,

151
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,760
let's think calmly.

152
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,760
Is the child important at this time?

153
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,760
Or is it important in the face?

154
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,760
Okay.

155
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,760
Go home first.

156
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,760
Just pretend nothing happened.

157
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,760
Jingjing will be back soon.

158
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,760
Hao.

159
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,760
Hao.

160
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,760
I'll go to work now.

161
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,760
I'll go get the scissors.

162
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,760
Thank you.

163
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,760
Miss,

164
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,760
what's the matter?

165
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,760
I'll go.

166
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,760
It's okay.

167
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,760
It's a small matter.

168
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,760
Mr. Cheng, I'll go first.

169
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,760
I can't go.

170
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,760
Okay.

171
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,760
Take care.

172
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,760
Let's go.

173
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,760
Xiao Hao.

174
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,760
Xiao Hao.

175
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,760
What's the matter?

176
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,760
I'm not sure.

177
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,760
I just went out to deliver the document.

178
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,760
Are you busy?

179
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,760
Yes.

180
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,760
Wei.

181
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,760
Thank you.

182
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,760
Why thank me?

183
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,760
I know.

184
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,760
You're afraid that my master

185
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,760
would know about my business.

186
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,760
I also think

187
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,760
your little girl's WeChat

188
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,760
is really considerate.

189
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,760
You know her mother, right?

190
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,760
You've been in so much trouble before.

191
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,760
Besides,

192
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,760
Jingjing is a foreign man.

193
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,760
Maybe one day,

194
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,760
if something happens,

195
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,760
Dr. Wu will bite you

196
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,760
and bite you.

197
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,760
You'll be in trouble

198
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,760
if you get drunk.

199
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,760
You know that?

200
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,760
Who heard the child's voice?

201
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,760
What?

202
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,760
They're all thinking about their own safety.

203
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,760
Who heard the child's voice?

204
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,760
Her mother.

205
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,760
She's a foreign man.

206
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,760
Her mother is the one who's here to protect her.

207
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,760
I think

208
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,760
I've seen her.

209
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,760
Where are you going?

210
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,760
Where are you going?

211
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,760
What do you mean?

212
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,760
She lost her father when she was 12.

213
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,760
She's the one who's been

214
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,760
taking everything away from her.

215
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,760
Why do you guys

216
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,760
think of her

217
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,760
every time you think of her?

218
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,760
She can't stand her mother

219
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,760
and that kind of pressure.

220
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,760
You haven't run away?

221
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,760
Yes.

222
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,760
So I think I'm not as good as her.

223
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,760
I can't run away without her.

224
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,760
My father is a hero.

225
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,760
My mother sacrificed everything for her.

226
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,760
I can't run away.

227
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,760
I can't run away.

228
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,760
I can't run away.

229
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,760
I can't run away.

230
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,760
I can't run away.

231
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,760
Princess.

232
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,760
Leave his� parsley余.

233
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,760
주.

234
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,760
Don't be so curious.

235
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,760
Honey, I don't want to get home.

236
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,760
I hear

237
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,760
I love you.

238
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,480
You're cold to her every time.

239
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,980
You can't solve any problem.

240
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,980
You're second in the class.

241
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,280
Your mom won't show you.

242
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,520
She will never show me.

243
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,920
I told her I'm second in the class.

244
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,220
She asked me why I'm first in the class.

245
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,820
She said I'm in the first grade.

246
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,620
I can't even enter the first grade.

247
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,820
If you think I'm too close to you,

248
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,820
you can tell me.

249
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,480
For example, the third grade makes you play for half an hour.

250
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,880
You're already 12 years old.

251
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,220
You can communicate with your mom.

252
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,760
You're so excited to run outside.

253
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,160
How excited is your mom?

254
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,160
I'm sorry, sister.

255
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,240
Promise me that

256
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,480
you'll send me a message

257
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,120
about what will happen in the future.

258
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,520
I'll play the game again, okay?

259
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,520
I promise you, sister.

260
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,820
Mom.

261
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,820
Where did you go?

262
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,820
Do you know how anxious I was?

263
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,820
You're so mean.

264
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,820
Mom, I'm sorry.

265
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,820
I shouldn't have come alone.

266
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,820
I shouldn't have answered your phone.

267
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,820
Go home.

268
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,820
Let's go.

269
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,820
Report!

270
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,820
Come in.

271
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:15,820
Chief, Dr. Wu is here again.

272
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,820
Why is he here again?

273
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,820
He didn't see you.

274
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,820
He said that Xia Jie didn't pass his approval.

275
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,820
He sent his daughter's message to him.

276
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,820
He also told her to leave home.

277
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,820
He also said that

278
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,820
if you don't ask Xia Jie,

279
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,820
he'll steal our place again.

280
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,820
Okay, I know.

281
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,820
You go and ask Xia Jie to stay here.

282
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,820
Okay.

283
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,820
Chief, you call the principal

284
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,820
and come to my place.

285
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,820
Something happened again.

286
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,820
Instructor.

287
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,820
I'm coming.

288
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,820
Sit here.

289
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,820
What's wrong with you?

290
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,820
You ate 100 beans.

291
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,820
Don't you know that beans are new?

292
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,820
Don't you know that you're interested in teaching?

293
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,820
Why did you add her WeChat?

294
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,820
I just think that girl needs a friend.

295
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:17,820
Child, why are you so simple?

296
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,820
That girl is Wei Chen Nian.

297
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,820
Dr. Wu is his guardian.

298
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,820
Dr. Wu can say that you've sent her consent.

299
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,820
You've added her WeChat in private.

300
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,820
She can sue you.

301
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,820
She really likes me.

302
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,820
I should go with her yesterday.

303
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,820
Xia Jie,

304
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,820
after you go down,

305
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,820
tell Dr. Wu that

306
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,820
you deleted WeChat in front of her.

307
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,820
Chief, I really can't delete it.

308
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,820
That girl is saying that

309
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,820
I can kill her,

310
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,820
comfort her and protect her.

311
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,820
You can protect her?

312
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,820
You can't even protect yourself.

313
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,820
Xia Jie,

314
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,820
don't be so anxious.

315
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,820
Just like this mother,

316
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,820
she will force the child to come.

317
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,820
Who will be responsible?

318
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,820
I don't know.

319
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,820
I'll delete it.

320
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,820
Delete it.

321
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,820
Dr. Wu,

322
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,820
I'm not here to drink tea.

323
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,820
Where is your chief?

324
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,820
Why are you hiding from me?

325
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,820
Are you afraid of me?

326
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,820
Dr. Wu,

327
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,820
it's been a long time.

328
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,820
Have you heard about it?

329
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,820
Look at this child.

330
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,820
After leaving the house,

331
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,820
he pushed Xia Jie to come here.

332
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,820
He is so lucky.

333
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,820
He found her.

334
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,820
Chief,

335
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,820
I'm not here to see you off.

336
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,820
I'm not here to see you off.

337
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,820
No.

338
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,820
You are the police.

339
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,820
It's a crime to be a human.

340
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,820
Why should we raise you?

341
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,820
Yes, yes.

342
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,820
You are...

343
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,820
You Xia Jie,

344
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,820
I'm not allowed to do that.

345
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,820
I'm not allowed to do that.

346
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,820
My daughter is only 12 years old.

347
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,820
12 years old.

348
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,820
What does she want?

349
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,820
No wonder my daughter left the house recently.

350
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,820
Someone told her to leave.

351
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,820
Look, look, look.

352
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,820
You are talking too much.

353
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,820
This is not appropriate.

354
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,820
Yes, look.

355
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,820
You also said your daughter ran out of the house.

356
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,820
Xia Jie found her last time.

357
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,820
She added her WeChat.

358
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,820
Right?

359
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,820
She added her WeChat.

360
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,820
She ran out of the house this time.

361
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,820
She went to the hospital.

362
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,820
She went to the hospital and found her.

363
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,820
How could she do that?

364
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,820
It's impossible.

365
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,820
Of course.

366
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,820
Your daughter is still young.

367
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,820
She didn't pass your approval.

368
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,820
She added her WeChat.

369
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,820
It's not appropriate.

370
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,820
I'll call her in.

371
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,820
I'll apologize to you first.

372
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,820
I'll delete the WeChat.

373
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,820
I'll delete the WeChat.

374
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,820
You should call her in.

375
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,820
Xia Jie.

376
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,820
Xia Jie.

377
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,820
Come here right now.

378
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,820
Have some water.

379
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,820
Dr. Wu, you are here.

380
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,820
Xia Jie.

381
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,820
Have some water.

382
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,820
They actually did?

383
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,820
An air airasında would drive you crazy.

384
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,820
Yes.

385
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,820
Xia Jie.

386
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,820
It's cold outside.

387
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,820
Please, please.

388
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,820
Xia Jie.

389
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,820
Hello Ms. Gooh.

390
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,820
What's she looking at?

391
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,820
Ha-ha-ha, what's this?

392
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,820
I'm a Livesay Mackerel.

393
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,820
She uploaded the interested video.

394
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,820
I'm busy.

395
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,820
I just want to give him a compliment

396
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,820
or give him a positive expression.

397
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:01,820
I really want to find someone to talk to.

398
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,820
I just want to give him a place.

399
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,820
My daughter wants to talk to someone,

400
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:10,820
but she can find me.

401
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,820
I'm her mother.

402
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,820
Who are you?

403
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,820
Why are you trying to make my daughter a threat?

404
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,820
I'm not your daughter.

405
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:24,820
I'm sorry.

406
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,820
I didn't think much.

407
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,820
Dr. Wu,

408
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:28,820
it's like this.

409
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,820
I was the one who did it.

410
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,820
Because of last time,

411
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,820
we're worried about the child.

412
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:37,820
We're afraid that similar things will happen.

413
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:38,820
Think about it.

414
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:39,820
If we run to a place

415
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,820
where there's no surveillance,

416
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,820
we can't see it.

417
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,820
Will we be more anxious?

418
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,820
Of course, I can't think of

419
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,820
not telling you this in advance.

420
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:49,820
You're too slow.

421
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:50,820
Yes.

422
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:52,820
Dr. Wu,

423
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,820
you saw it too.

424
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,820
Thanks to Officer Xia,

425
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,820
you added the child's WeChat.

426
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,820
That's why you can find the child so quickly.

427
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:00,820
Okay.

428
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,820
If you think this is a violation of your love,

429
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,820
I'll delete it.

430
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:07,820
Dr. Wu,

431
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,820
I'm sorry that Wei Jinging's WeChat

432
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,820
with Xue Jia is my fault.

433
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,820
But Jingjing is no longer a child.

434
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:13,820
Does she even want to

435
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,820
send a WeChat to your consent?

436
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,820
Do you think it's good?

437
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:16,820
What do you mean?

438
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,820
I mean she's 12 years old.

439
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,820
She's a normal child.

440
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,820
She needs her own space and life.

441
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:22,820
You're too strict.

442
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:23,820
How can I care about her?

443
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,820
It's my business.

444
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:25,820
I want you to handle it.

445
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:28,820
Dr. Wu,

446
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,820
I think

447
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,820
what Officer Xia meant is

448
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:31,820
because she's young,

449
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:32,820
she might know more about

450
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,820
Jingjing than we do.

451
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:35,820
She's so young.

452
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,820
She has a real idea every day.

453
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,820
Okay, Cheng.

454
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,820
Don't say it.

455
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,820
Get in.

456
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,820
Get lost.

457
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,820
Chief, I promised Jingjing.

458
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:47,820
She won't run away

459
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,820
if she gets out of the car.

460
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,820
She told me on WeChat.

461
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,820
If I delete her,

462
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,820
I should tell her in advance.

463
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,820
What do you mean?

464
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,820
Don't say it now.

465
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,820
It's a secret.

466
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,820
Delete it.

467
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,820
I'll send her a WeChat

468
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:04,820
and tell her I deleted her.

469
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:05,820
What do you want?

470
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,820
You're trying to get her to do it.

471
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,820
Jingjing,

472
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:10,820
I'll give you a secret.

473
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:13,820
Jingjing,

474
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,820
this is Dr. Wu's family business.

475
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:17,820
He doesn't want to let others take care of it.

476
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,820
Don't bother him.

477
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,820
Xia, wait a minute.

478
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,820
Chief, why are you here?

479
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,820
Dr. Wu,

480
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:24,820
listen to me.

481
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,820
I was here yesterday.

482
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,820
I told Xia Jie

483
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,820
that I sent her back

484
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:31,820
with her.

485
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,820
I blamed her

486
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,820
when I came back.

487
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:35,820
I said,

488
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:36,820
why do you add

489
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,820
a child's WeChat?

490
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:38,820
Isn't it a problem for you?

491
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:41,820
Do you know

492
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:42,820
how Xia Jie told me?

493
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,820
Xia Jie said,

494
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,820
if everyone in this world

495
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,820
is afraid of trouble,

496
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,820
and everyone is only

497
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,820
for their own safety,

498
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:56,820
who will be taken care of by the child?

499
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:00,820
Dr. Wu, you know,

500
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:01,820
Xia Jie is a police officer.

501
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,820
She's always busy

502
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,820
with the job

503
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:05,820
for more than ten hours.

504
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,820
She can't have that idle mind.

505
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,820
She can't have that energy

506
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:08,820
to talk to a child.

507
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:10,820
She knows you're annoying her.

508
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:11,820
She still added

509
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,820
your daughter Jingjing's WeChat.

510
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:14,820
Why?

511
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:16,820
It's because in the last case,

512
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,820
she found out

513
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,820
that your daughter has no friends.

514
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,820
She needs to be with someone else.

515
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,820
On the other hand,

516
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:28,820
she also pulled Jingjing's distance

517
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:29,820
through this way.

518
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:31,820
What's the idea

519
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,820
of Jingjing?

520
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:33,820
At least we know

521
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,820
what's going on.

522
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:38,820
Just like this time,

523
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,820
your daughter left home.

524
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,820
It's because Xia Jie has WeChat.

525
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,820
We can

526
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:44,820
find the child back so quickly.

527
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:46,820
Now you forced Xia Jie

528
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:47,820
to delete her WeChat.

529
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,820
What if

530
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:51,820
this happens again?

531
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:52,820
Have you ever thought about it?

532
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:54,820
Do you have any other plans?

533
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:59,820
I've thought about it.

534
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,820
I'm responsible

535
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,820
for my own family.

536
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:05,820
No one else needs to care about it.

537
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,820
Fine.

538
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,820
Now you delete it.

539
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:13,820
Hello?

540
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,820
You have to use your good heart

541
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,820
to deserve it.

542
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,820
Why are you

543
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:17,820
doing this to me?

544
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:18,820
What's wrong?

545
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,820
Dr. Wu,

546
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:45,820
things have been settled.

547
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:46,820
In the beginning,

548
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:47,820
it's all my fault.

549
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:48,820
Master,

550
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,820
you don't have to

551
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,820
make trouble for me.

552
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,820
Dr. Wu,

553
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,820
I apologize to you,

554
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:56,820
but this has nothing

555
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:57,820
to do with me.

556
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:58,820
It's all my own idea.

557
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:00,820
Master, you don't have to

558
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:01,820
to protect me.

559
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,820
I'll bear the responsibility

560
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:03,820
that I did.

561
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:06,820
But Dr. Wu,

562
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,820
I want to say one more thing.

563
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,820
Your daughter is right,

564
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,820
but she's also

565
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:11,820
a independent person.

566
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:13,820
You've already

567
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,820
made her not look after her.

568
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:16,820
If you don't change

569
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:17,820
your way of loving her,

570
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:18,820
I'm afraid that

571
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,820
you'll...

572
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:20,820
Stop it.

573
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,820
This will happen again.

574
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,820
Say it again.

575
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:23,820
Dr. Wu,

576
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,820
you're so young.

577
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,820
Well,

578
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:26,820
Ms. Xia,

579
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,820
she's also kind.

580
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:29,820
She's a good tip

581
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:30,820
for your daughter.

582
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,820
I use her tip?

583
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:33,820
That's my daughter.

584
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,820
I won't teach her.

585
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,820
What does she want?

586
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:38,820
What do you mean

587
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:39,820
that my daughter

588
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,820
will leave the house?

589
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:41,820
You're making a mess.

590
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,820
What are you talking about?

591
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,820
She's full of herself.

592
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,820
She's trying to get you out of her way.

593
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:49,820
What's the point of her?

594
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,820
How can she say that?

595
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,820
Well,

596
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,820
I'll say it today.

597
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:58,820
In the future,

598
00:23:58,820 --> 00:23:59,820
you'll be involved in

599
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:00,820
your case.

600
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:02,820
Ms. Xia,

601
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,820
you're not going to be involved.

602
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,820
Is that okay?

603
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,820
I think it's okay.

604
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:09,820
Chief Su.

605
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:10,820
Enough.

606
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,820
What are you looking at?

607
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:13,820
Stop it.

608
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:21,820
Stop it.

609
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:22,820
Come here.

610
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,820
Dr. Feng.

611
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:29,820
Ms. Xia, listen to me.

612
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:31,820
You're not that girl.

613
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,820
Your mother

614
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:33,820
is not Dr. Wu,

615
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:34,820
the one who's sick.

616
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:35,820
Don't put your shadow

617
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:36,820
on that girl.

618
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:37,820
You can't help her

619
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,820
solve any problem.

620
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:40,820
What do you know?

621
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:41,820
Why are you

622
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:42,820
being so formal to me?

623
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,820
I'm worried about you.

624
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,820
Don't be emotional.

625
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,820
The outcome of this

626
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,820
is not what you think.

627
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,820
That's my problem.

628
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,820
Have you ever thought about it?

629
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:56,820
If you look at it from another perspective,

630
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:57,820
you're such a

631
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:58,820
wretched Dr. Wu

632
00:24:58,820 --> 00:24:59,820
in another form.

633
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:03,820
I might be a little heavy.

634
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:04,820
But think about it.

635
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:06,820
That girl

636
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:07,820
is not going to

637
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:08,820
grow up

638
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:09,820
without you.

639
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,820
Why must you insist

640
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:13,820
that she's safer

641
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:14,820
if you participate?

642
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:20,820
Of course, you can't

643
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:21,820
help that girl.

644
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,820
But the situation

645
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:24,820
is so tense

646
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,820
with her mother.

647
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,820
Her mother

648
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:28,820
is so close to you.

649
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,820
If you insist on participating,

650
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:31,820
will it really

651
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:32,820
make this matter better?

652
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:38,820
Li Dawei,

653
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:39,820
I promised to go to the police.

654
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,820
I'll tell her about it

655
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:41,820
on WeChat.

656
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,820
But I didn't say anything

657
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:43,820
and deleted it.

658
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:48,820
This is easy.

659
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:50,820
Give it to me.

660
00:25:58,820 --> 00:25:59,820
Hello.

661
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,820
Miss Xia Jie,

662
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:01,820
you've passed the examination.

663
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,820
You're now a driver.

664
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,820
I've heard it all.

665
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,820
What's going on?

666
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:13,820
You really don't want to be a cop?

667
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:14,820
Be quiet.

668
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:16,820
Tell me clearly.

669
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:17,820
What's going on?

670
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,820
Nothing.

671
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:20,820
Don't bother.

672
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:21,820
I can't watch you

673
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,820
regret your past.

674
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:25,820
You're not telling me, are you?

675
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:27,820
I'll go to the police.

676
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:28,820
I'll let them stop you.

677
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:30,820
Li Dawei, why are you so broad-minded?

678
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:31,820
Of course I have to.

679
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:33,820
We can't be without you.

680
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:36,820
Why do you

681
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:37,820
do such a disgusting thing?

682
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:38,820
Can you be quiet?

683
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:39,820
No.

684
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:40,820
Why do you do such a disgusting thing?

685
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:41,820
Okay, okay.

686
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:42,820
I promise you.

687
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:43,820
Okay?

688
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,820
I'll do it.

689
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:50,820
There's so much.

690
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,820
Jingjing,

691
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:10,820
Jingjing is here.

692
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:11,820
Jingjing.

693
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:12,820
Jingjing.

694
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:13,820
Jingjing is here.

695
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,820
Jingjing.

696
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,820
Jingjing.

697
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:16,820
Jingjing.

698
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:17,820
Jingjing.

699
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,820
Come here.

700
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,820
Uncle, I've seen you.

701
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:22,820
Yes.

702
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,820
I'm from the Barricade Police Department.

703
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,820
I've been here with Miss Xia Jie.

704
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:28,820
Uncle,

705
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,820
why did Miss Xia Jie

706
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,820
send me a WeChat message?

707
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:32,820
Did Miss Xia Jie

708
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,820
send you to the police

709
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,820
to carry out a secret mission?

710
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,820
The leader doesn't want

711
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:37,820
to take the message from others.

712
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,820
He's afraid that everyone will delete it.

713
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:40,820
But he cares about you.

714
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:41,820
He's afraid that you'll misunderstand him.

715
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:42,820
He came to me to explain it to you.

716
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:44,820
So that's the case.

717
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:46,820
Uncle,

718
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:47,820
but can I still

719
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,820
find Miss Xia Jie in the future?

720
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:51,820
His secret mission

721
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:52,820
is to be afraid that

722
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:53,820
I can't take the message.

723
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,820
Come.

724
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:57,820
This note is my phone number.

725
00:27:58,820 --> 00:27:59,820
If you have anything,

726
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,820
call me.

727
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,820
Thank you, uncle.

728
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:03,820
Uncle.

729
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,820
What are you doing in the middle of the night?

730
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:30,820
What are you doing?

731
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:32,820
When I go to work,

732
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:33,820
I have to report to you.

733
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,820
You're not going to the internet car, are you?

734
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,820
The key is in the head.

735
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:43,820
It's not better than me.

736
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:45,820
If you were found in the internet car,

737
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:46,820
you'd know

738
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:47,820
that you were going to be fired.

739
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:48,820
You wouldn't know that.

740
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:50,820
As long as you don't say it.

741
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:51,820
Idiot.

742
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:53,820
I said I didn't know

743
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:54,820
unless I had heard about it.

744
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,820
We're in such a small place.

745
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:57,820
We can't see each other.

746
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,820
We can't see each other.

747
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,820
Who is that bastard?

748
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,820
Go away.

749
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:03,820
Get out of the way.

750
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:05,820
I can't watch you make mistakes.

751
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:07,820
How about you close your eyes?

752
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:13,820
Your face.

753
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:14,820
It's good that you're here.

754
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:15,820
Close the door.

755
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,820
Don't let Xia Jie make mistakes.

756
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:17,820
Don't listen to him.

757
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,820
He's a good guy.

758
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:19,820
Why do you open the internet car?

759
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:25,820
I didn't hear about Xia Jie

760
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:26,820
in the internet car.

761
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:27,820
Look.

762
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:28,820
The doctor doesn't think so.

763
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:29,820
Of course.

764
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:31,820
The public can't do anything

765
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,820
or participate in any profit-making activity.

766
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,820
That's right.

767
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:54,820
It's okay if you don't open it.

768
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:56,820
Then you can leave this house.

769
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:58,820
Why?

770
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:00,820
We don't want you to open the internet car.

771
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,820
You shouldn't have decided with us.

772
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:04,820
Who said we should have decided?

773
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:07,820
My mom has finished her work.

774
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,820
Our house is also under control.

775
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:13,820
Your house is so far away.

776
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:15,820
It's convenient to live here, right?

777
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,820
Yes, Xia Jie.

778
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,820
What's the matter with you?

779
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:23,820
I'm fine.

780
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:26,820
I'm back.

781
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:30,820
Are you missing money?

782
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:35,820
No.

783
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:37,820
Xia Jie, if you need anything,

784
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:38,820
don't pay me.

785
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:40,820
If you need money,

786
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:41,820
you can leave the rent.

787
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:42,820
Or when you have money,

788
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:43,820
you can ask me.

789
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:44,820
It's okay, Xia Jie.

790
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:45,820
I have some money.

791
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:46,820
I'll give you the money in the next month.

792
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:47,820
No need.

793
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:48,820
I rent the house.

794
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,820
I'll tell you the truth.

795
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:50,820
I'm giving you the money.

796
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,820
That's right.

797
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:55,820
Xia Jie,

798
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,820
tell me how much you need.

799
00:30:58,820 --> 00:30:59,820
People are all very rich.

800
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:00,820
I'll help you with the money.

801
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:03,820
If you need money,

802
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:08,820
I can give you some money.

803
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:10,820
Xia Jie, look.

804
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:12,820
People who are so rich

805
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,820
will lend you money.

806
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:14,820
You can leave it.

807
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:15,820
Who are you talking about?

808
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:16,820
You said you're rich.

809
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:17,820
You don't admit it.

810
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:18,820
How can I say I'm rich?

811
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:19,820
You said you...

812
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:21,820
Don't make a fuss.

813
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:23,820
Xia Jie,

814
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,820
how happy we are to live together.

815
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:29,820
Really?

816
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:30,820
No.

817
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,820
How can I hear from Zhao Jingwei

818
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:36,820
that you're looking at the doctor?

819
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,820
That's because of my master.

820
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:45,820
I now understand

821
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:47,820
what you're going to do.

822
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,820
If I know who the creditors are,

823
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:51,820
I'll be the real creditors.

824
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,820
Since you're a police officer,

825
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:56,820
the most important thing is

826
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:57,820
to solve the problem for the people.

827
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:58,820
Don't do that.

828
00:31:58,820 --> 00:31:59,820
It doesn't matter to you.

829
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:04,820
You two finally know the truth.

830
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,820
He's messing with me.

831
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:06,820
Enough. Stop it.

832
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:08,820
I won't drive the car to the moon.

833
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:09,820
I won't move it away.

834
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:10,820
Enough.

835
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:12,820
I'm so scared.

836
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,820
Xia Wei, I'm so scared.

837
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:18,820
Xia Wei, stop.

838
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:19,820
Stop.

839
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:20,820
Come on.

840
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:24,820
Have a seat.

841
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,820
Hello.

842
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:26,820
The president is here.

843
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,820
Dr. Wu's business.

844
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:29,820
Take a picture.

845
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:35,820
Master.

846
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,820
I know you're doing this

847
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,820
for my own good and my concern.

848
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,820
But since I'm wearing the uniform,

849
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,820
I'm responsible for the responsibility

850
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:46,820
of the people here.

851
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,820
I have to do my best.

852
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:49,820
You're protecting me like this.

853
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:51,820
Xia Jie,

854
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,820
I'm not protecting you.

855
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,820
It's because you're my disciple.

856
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:58,820
If it's Li Dawei

857
00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:59,820
or Zhao Jiwei,

858
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:00,820
it's your disciple.

859
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:01,820
You'll also

860
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:02,820
put everything on your own.

861
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:04,820
What's the problem?

862
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,820
After all, they're men.

863
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:07,820
Master, don't tease me.

864
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,820
We're a police.

865
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:10,820
We don't have any men or women.

866
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:11,820
If I really

867
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:12,820
regard myself as a woman,

868
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:13,820
I won't come to the police.

869
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,820
I won't wear this uniform.

870
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:18,820
Master,

871
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:19,820
you treat me

872
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,820
as a common name

873
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,820
like Li Dawei or Zhao Jiwei.

874
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:24,820
Okay?

875
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:28,820
Okay.

876
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,820
Get in the car.

877
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:39,820
Stop hitting.

878
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:40,820
Stop hitting.

879
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:41,820
Stop hitting.

880
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:42,820
The police are here.

881
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:43,820
Stop hitting.

882
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:44,820
Don't move.

883
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:45,820
Don't move.

884
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:46,820
Let go of him.

885
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:47,820
Let go of him.

886
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:48,820
Put your phone down.

887
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:49,820
Don't move.

888
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:53,820
Don't move.

889
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:54,820
Don't move.

890
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:55,820
Where's he?

891
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:56,820
Let go of him.

892
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:57,820
Dawei.

893
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,820
Wait.

894
00:33:58,820 --> 00:33:59,820
Don't take pictures.

895
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:00,820
Don't take pictures.

896
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,820
Don't take pictures.

897
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:02,820
Dawei, let him get up.

898
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:03,820
Let's go play.

899
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:04,820
Let's go.

900
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:05,820
Let's go.

901
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:15,820
Let's go.

902
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:21,820
Hey,

903
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:22,820
I thought you liked it.

904
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:23,820
You said you bought a hamburger.

905
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:24,820
You should have changed it.

906
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:25,820
Why are you here?

907
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:26,820
You're here to eat noodles.

908
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:27,820
I like it.

909
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:28,820
I want to eat noodles.

910
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:29,820
I want to eat noodles.

911
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:31,820
Then you eat this.

912
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:32,820
I'll eat the hamburger.

913
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,820
Okay.

914
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:34,820
You like it.

915
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:39,820
Let's eat first.

916
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:40,820
I'll carry it later.

917
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:42,820
Let's exchange it.

918
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,820
Okay.

919
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,820
Okay.

920
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,820
What's wrong with the young people?

921
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,820
Can't you hit them?

922
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:51,820
Dawei,

923
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:53,820
don't be too reckless.

924
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:55,820
You still have your phone.

925
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:57,820
No matter what,

926
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,820
you can't talk to my master.

927
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,820
Okay, let's go.

928
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:05,820
Lan Tingya's company.

929
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:06,820
The name Tingya.

930
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:08,820
I don't know what to do.

931
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:10,820
It sounds like a tea house.

932
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,820
It's a tea house.

933
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:15,820
Uncle,

934
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,820
this is when a person

935
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:19,820
appeared in the experience.

936
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,820
This place is obviously called the meeting room.

937
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,820
It's actually a special place.

938
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:27,820
Special place?

939
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:29,820
It's open.

940
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,820
Why don't you hit the bell?

941
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:32,820
No evidence.

942
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,820
This place is not a place

943
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:35,820
that ordinary people can come in.

944
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:37,820
The meeting room,

945
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:39,820
the meeting room is a hundred thousand.

946
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,820
Then you have to go up to ten million.

947
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,820
Even one hundred million.

948
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,820
Actually, you go up to ten million.

949
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,820
You can't stop without a certificate.

950
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:51,820
Some people eat and drink tea.

951
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:52,820
They chat.

952
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,820
It's complicated to do that.

953
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,820
Master,

954
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,820
modern society's basic laws

955
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:00,820
are the wrong reasoning.

956
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:01,820
It's wrong reasoning.

957
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:03,820
You don't know what's going on inside.

958
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:04,820
You can't say that

959
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:05,820
they are often wrong.

960
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:13,820
You are really a bastard.

961
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:15,820
That's it, right?

962
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:20,820
Here.

963
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,820
Let's exchange.

964
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:26,820
Wait.

965
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,820
I'll find the evidence for you.

966
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:31,820
I'll go.

967
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:48,820
Hello?

968
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:51,820
What's the matter?

969
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:53,820
I'm sorry.

970
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:02,820
Okay.

971
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:03,820
Wait a minute.

972
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,820
Wait a minute.

973
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:07,820
What's wrong with me?

974
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:10,820
What's the big deal?

975
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:14,820
Okay, okay.

976
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:15,820
I'll go over there later.

977
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:24,820
Master,

978
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:25,820
something's wrong.

979
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:27,820
Kai Cheng,

980
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,820
I'll send you off first.

981
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,820
I'm wearing a police uniform.

982
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,820
If you really need anything,

983
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,820
tell me.

984
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:37,820
See if I can help.

985
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:40,820
Why are you talking nonsense?

986
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:41,820
Can you open it?

987
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:42,820
Can't I open it?

988
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:43,820
No, no, no.

989
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,820
Okay, I'll go over there later.

990
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,820
Okay.

991
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:14,820
Master,

992
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:15,820
where are you going?

993
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:16,820
Do you need my company?

994
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:18,820
No, no.

995
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:19,820
Tell me where I'm going.

996
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:20,820
I'm going to work.

997
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:21,820
You're going to work.

998
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:22,820
Okay.

999
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:23,820
Okay, go ahead.

1000
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:31,820
Okay.

1001
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:53,820
What's the matter?

1002
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:54,820
You have to meet me.

1003
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:02,820
What's wrong?

1004
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:03,820
Why are you crying?

1005
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,820
Did something happen to Jia Jia?

1006
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:10,820
Why are you talking?

1007
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,820
You're still asking me?

1008
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,820
Have you ever been responsible for your father?

1009
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:19,820
We're divorced.

1010
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:21,820
You don't have to care about it.

1011
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:24,820
But you have to care about the child.

1012
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:26,820
Chief,

1013
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:29,820
you called me out at night.

1014
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,820
You just want to save me, right?

1015
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:33,820
What's wrong with you?

1016
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:35,820
Did something happen to Jia Jia?

1017
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:39,820
I was good at learning painting.

1018
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,820
I learned painting with him.

1019
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:45,820
Other people's father

1020
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:46,820
paid for the child.

1021
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:48,820
He was the best painter.

1022
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:49,820
He taught me how to use his hands.

1023
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,820
I can't afford to hire a good painter.

1024
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:53,820
But I can afford to hire him.

1025
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:54,820
I also hired him.

1026
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:57,820
He learned the art of beauty.

1027
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:58,820
He suddenly said he didn't want to learn it.

1028
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:00,820
He even asked me to withdraw the money.

1029
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:01,820
Why?

1030
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:02,820
I don't know.

1031
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:03,820
You're so rebellious.

1032
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:04,820
Don't you know?

1033
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:11,820
I saw him in the police station these days.

1034
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:13,820
He was with a stranger.

1035
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:15,820
He was so good at painting.

1036
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:17,820
I ran away when I saw him.

1037
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:19,820
I want to ask you why?

1038
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:22,820
I don't know how to lend him money.

1039
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:23,820
He just said he didn't want it.

1040
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,820
He said he wanted to earn money and live on his own.

1041
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:27,820
Can you blame him for the child?

1042
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:30,820
Now the family is growing up.

1043
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:31,820
He knows how to do things.

1044
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:34,820
I don't want to use your money.

1045
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,820
Although I don't have money with you,

1046
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:38,820
I'm a relative after all.

1047
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,820
I can't afford to pay for the private education.

1048
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:44,820
But I can't afford to pay for the service.

1049
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:46,820
I can't afford to sell the iron in the pot.

1050
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:48,820
Sell iron in the pot?

1051
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,820
How many iron do you have in your country?

1052
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:52,820
That's my business.

1053
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:56,820
Did he say how to make money?

1054
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:57,820
He's so young.

1055
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:58,820
He can't do anything.

1056
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:02,820
He said he'd pay for it.

1057
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:04,820
What?

1058
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,820
He just went to the bar to drink with someone.

1059
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:16,820
What did you say?

1060
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:19,820
He just went to drink with someone.

1061
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:20,820
Are you crazy?

1062
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:27,820
Are you really that kind of mother?

1063
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:28,820
Are you still his mother?

1064
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:29,820
Can you earn money?

1065
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:33,820
I have no choice.

1066
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,820
I cried and sold my mother.

1067
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,820
He just didn't want to go.

1068
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:38,820
Which president?

1069
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:39,820
Which president?

1070
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:44,820
Get in the car.

1071
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:46,820
Why are you so hungry?

1072
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:47,820
Get in the car.

1073
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:48,820
I'm looking for a girl.

1074
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:56,820
Go.

1075
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:24,820
Jiajia.

1076
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:26,820
What are you doing here?

1077
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:28,820
Go to drink with someone.

1078
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:29,820
You don't have to do anything else.

1079
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:31,820
That big brother has a lot of money.

1080
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:33,820
He's getting better tonight.

1081
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:35,820
Xiao Fei.

1082
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:36,820
Brother Li.

1083
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:37,820
Come here.

1084
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:54,820
Go back.

1085
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:57,820
Go.

1086
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:58,820
Go.

1087
00:42:58,820 --> 00:42:59,820
What are you doing?

1088
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:00,820
Jiajia, what are you doing?

1089
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:01,820
You want your father's life?

1090
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:03,820
Let go of me.

1091
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:04,820
I'm going to work.

1092
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:05,820
What are you doing?

1093
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:06,820
You're a bastard.

1094
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:07,820
What are you doing?

1095
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:08,820
Go.

1096
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:09,820
Go.

1097
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:10,820
Brother Li.

1098
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:11,820
I'll arrange a better one for you later.

1099
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:12,820
Who are you?

1100
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:13,820
What are you doing?

1101
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:14,820
Who are you?

1102
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:15,820
Go.

1103
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:16,820
What are you doing?

1104
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:17,820
You're a thief, right?

1105
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:18,820
Where are you going?

1106
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:19,820
Where are you going?

1107
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:22,820
Do you know what I'm doing?

1108
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:23,820
Okay.

1109
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:25,820
Get up.

1110
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:27,820
Get up.

1111
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:28,820
Go.

1112
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:21,820
Go.

1113
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:50,820
Go.

1114
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:20,820
Go.

1115
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:57,820
I miss you.
