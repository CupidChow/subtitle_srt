1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I

6
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Mom Xiao Jie

7
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Why did you answer my call

8
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm so anxious

9
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm a little busy today

10
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
But still have a sense of achievement

11
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Don't say it

12
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I've called Wang Shou Yi's night shift

13
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Why are you still not back

14
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Mom, why are you calling me again

15
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
If I don't call

16
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I don't know you're suffering so much outside

17
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Come back quickly

18
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Let's not do it

19
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Let's not do it in Paris and the police station

20
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'll call the director now

21
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Don't mom

22
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Hello

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The police station

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I

28
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I

29
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,960
How are you?

30
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,580

00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:39,180
This is my father's precious, precious, precious,

42
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:43,300
The beautiful flower of my heart,

00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,300
A happy song, full of happiness.

44
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,820
You are so hot, you are so hot, you are so hot,

45
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,260
You are so hot, you are so hot,

46
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:55,700
A happy song, full of happiness.

47
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,300
Son.

48
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,300
Son.

49
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,300
Li Dawei.

50
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,300
Li Dawei.

51
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,300
Li Dawei.

52
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,300
I love you.

53
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,300
Let's welcome Li Dawei, the chief of the national team.

54
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,300
Shaoxi.

55
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,300
What?

56
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,300
You are so handsome, my son.

57
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,300
You are so handsome.

58
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,300
You are so busy at work,

59
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:39,300
You are so handsome, you are so hot,

60
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,300
You are so hot,

61
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,300
I will change my clothes.

62
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,300
Go.

63
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,300
You are so beautiful.

64
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,300
Sister.

65
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,300
Mom, what's wrong?

66
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,300
I feel uncomfortable.

67
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,300
I have no appetite.

68
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,300
Are you cold?

69
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,300
Drink some cold medicine.

70
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,300
Wang Shuyu told me that

71
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,300
you are going to the execution today.

72
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,300
It's very dangerous.

73
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,300
Mom, I am not going to the execution today.

74
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,300
It's just a normal exchange.

75
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,300
Many people have gone to the execution.

76
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,300
Since so many people have gone,

77
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,300
Why do you still go?

78
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,300
Originally,

79
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,300
I was willing to let Cheng Hao be your teacher.

80
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,300
I didn't want to say anything.

81
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,300
But Wang Shuyu can't be so proud.

82
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,300
The next day,

83
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,300
he asked you to do such a dangerous task.

84
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,300
Did Cheng Hao also tell you to go?

85
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,300
No.

86
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,300
I just said

87
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,300
I can't let Cheng Hao be your teacher.

88
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,300
What is his right?

89
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,300
When he was your father's disciple,

90
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:29,300
he was a little clever and clever.

91
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,300
Your father will not sacrifice himself.

92
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,300
Mom, we don't talk about the past anymore.

93
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,300
How can we not talk about it?

94
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,300
Your father is dead.

95
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,300
You still have the problem of the blood.

96
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,300
Then you can't complain about it.

97
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,300
Why not complain?

98
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,300
Mom,

99
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,300
I have no problem.

100
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,300
So don't mention it again.

101
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,300
Mom,

102
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,300
I want you to say something.

103
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,300
People are getting cold.

104
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,300
Mom, don't look at me like that.

105
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,300
I'm sorry to eat it.

106
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,300
What did you say?

107
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,300
Say it again.

108
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,300
I'm sorry to eat it.

109
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,300
You're so sorry.

110
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,300
I'm still trying to explain.

111
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,300
I didn't say it when I was in the college.

112
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,300
You're a little stubborn.

113
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,300
Right?

114
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,300
I'm just like you.

115
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,300
What?

116
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:54,300
The female model of the kitchen engineering team,

117
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,300
is like a big sea.

118
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,300
They are all very nice to me.

119
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,300
I don't want to be a special person.

120
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,300
But the police are still so polite.

121
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,300
Okay, mom.

122
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,300
Let's not talk about the past.

123
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,300
You can have dinner with me, okay?

124
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,300
I'm really hungry.

125
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,300
I haven't eaten anything in a while.

126
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,300
I'm not hungry.

127
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,300
Don't cry.

128
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,300
Put on your shoes.

129
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,300
Eat slowly.

130
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,300
Why are you so romantic?

131
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,300
You're so mean.

132
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,300
Did you take a picture?

133
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,300
The food is not good.

134
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,300
I didn't.

135
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,300
It's good.

136
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,300
It's just that we don't have a point in our job.

137
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,300
When we have something to eat,

138
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,300
you can't tell anyone.

139
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,300
Wait a minute.

140
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,300
I'll have dinner first, right?

141
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,300
Of course.

142
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,300
We have to work first.

143
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,300
It's really hard to do this job.

144
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,300
Let me make you some soup.

145
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,300
It's really hard.

146
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,300
You've been tired for a day.

147
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,300
Why don't you eat?

148
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,300
I'll eat.

149
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,300
I'm going to eat.

150
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,300
Mom, have some more.

151
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,300
I'll have some more.

152
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,300
I'll get you some meat.

153
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,300
Here.

154
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,300
It's not bad, right?

155
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,300
By the way,

156
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,300
you know that

157
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,300
you've worked hard in the office.

158
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,300
You've been far away from our house.

159
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,300
The office is really tight.

160
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,300
So,

161
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,300
I want to rent a house near the office.

162
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,300
I usually stay there at work.

163
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,300
I'll come back when I'm off.

164
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,300
Mom, what's wrong with you?

165
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,300
Don't be like this.

166
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,300
I'm not going to rent a house.

167
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,300
Wait.

168
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,300
Balie and Shi are not close.

169
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:44,300
How about I call them tomorrow?

170
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,300
Let them arrange for you to work near our house.

171
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,300
We'll be out of the house.

172
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,300
Mom, I'm begging you.

173
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,300
Don't call them.

174
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,300
I'm not going to rent a house.

175
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,300
I'll come back when I'm off.

176
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,300
Xiao Jie,

177
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,300
I'm doing this for your own good.

178
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,300
I know.

179
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,300
Son,

180
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,300
I've thought about it.

181
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,300
You're new to work in the office.

182
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,300
You have to work hard.

183
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,300
You have to work hard.

184
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,300
You have to take part in the event.

185
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,300
And you have to take part in the event.

186
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,300
Of course, taking part in the event is like this.

187
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,300
Our house is a little bit far from your office.

188
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,300
I'm thinking like this.

189
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,300
I want to rent a big house near your office.

190
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,300
No, mom.

191
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,300
Don't waste money.

192
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,300
What do you mean?

193
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,300
Spend money on my son?

194
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,300
I spent money on my son.

195
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,300
Don't worry about it.

196
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,300
As long as you have high confidence,

197
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,300
you can do whatever you like.

198
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,300
I'll take care of the money.

199
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,300
Don't worry about it.

200
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,300
Mom,

201
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,300
you have to work hard.

202
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,300
Besides,

203
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,300
you're a family member.

204
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,300
I'm so busy now.

205
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,300
I have to take care of my family.

206
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,300
Son,

207
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,300
come on.

208
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,300
Put your face forward.

209
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,300
My handsome son.

210
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,300
Why are you so sensible?

211
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,300
You're so sensible.

212
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,300
You're so sensible.

213
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,300
It's because it's not easy to make money.

214
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,300
So when you spend money,

215
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,300
you have to be happy and happy.

216
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,300
That's all.

217
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,300
Don't worry about it.

218
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,300
Didn't you say that

219
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,300
your mom is a sister

220
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,300
and your mom is a devil.

221
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,300
You just have to live here.

222
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,300
I'll take care of it.

223
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,300
Fine.

224
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,300
I'll pay you when I have the money.

225
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,300
How dare you?

226
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,300
No, mom.

227
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,300
I just...

228
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,300
Shut up.

229
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,300
Eat.

230
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,300
Eat.

231
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,300
Eat.

232
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,300
I'll sing.

233
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,300
I'm tired.

234
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,300
I'm tired.

235
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,300
You're working hard.

236
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,300
I'm tired.

237
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,300
I'll sing.

238
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,300
I'll sing.

239
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,300
I'll sing.

240
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,300
That's all I have to say.

241
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,300
Please sit down.

242
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,300
What I just said

243
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,300
is the key.

244
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,300
It's the key.

245
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,300
Especially in learning

246
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,300
Fengqiao's experience.

247
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,300
You can't stop

248
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,300
on this topic.

249
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,300
You have to be in the specific job.

250
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,300
Especially in the new building.

251
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,300
You have to learn more seriously.

252
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,300
Understand?

253
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,300
Yes.

254
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,300
Just talk about the time

255
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,300
in the Yanguang District.

256
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,300
Before you deal with the problem,

257
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,300
you have to do a detailed investigation.

258
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,300
Otherwise, it's a plan.

259
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,300
It's not a solution.

260
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,300
You have to be sincere,

261
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,300
touching, emotional,

262
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,300
and honest.

263
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,300
Be patient.

264
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,300
Do your best to

265
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,300
take care of your job.

266
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,300
Solve your problems.

267
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,300
And make a big deal out of it.

268
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,300
Make a big deal out of it.

269
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,300
And solve your problems.

270
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,300
Our new staff, Xia Jie,

271
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,300
has really done

272
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,300
this with his heart.

273
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,300
He's a hero.

274
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,300
He's a hero.

275
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,300
Chief,

276
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,300
I'm sorry.

277
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,300
We did it together.

278
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,300
Look, it's still very modest.

279
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,300
But

280
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,300
I don't know if you'll be in the risk.

281
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,300
Chief, I'll take care of the risk.

282
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,300
You're not talking.

283
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,300
No one is going to hurt you.

284
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,300
Someone said

285
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,300
I'm too proud of the residents

286
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,300
of Yanguang District.

287
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,300
Am I that proud?

288
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,300
I've worked here for 30 years.

289
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,300
I'm strict with them.

290
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,300
From the farmers to the city workers.

291
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,300
They haven't learned

292
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,300
how to become a city resident.

293
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,300
They don't know

294
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,300
the way of living in this city.

295
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,300
They don't know.

296
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,300
We know.

297
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,300
Right?

298
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,300
One of the responsibilities

299
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,300
of our work is to teach these new city residents

300
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,300
to become

301
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,300
a decent city resident.

302
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,300
To follow the way of living in the city.

303
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,300
All right.

304
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,300
Don't be like this now.

305
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,300
You're going to be a big fan of me.

306
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,300
You'll be a big fan of me in the future.

307
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,300
I'm not.

308
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,300
I have something to announce.

309
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,300
Our team

310
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,300
has always had

311
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,300
a tradition of the generations of the gang.

312
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,300
Every new resident

313
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,300
has to recognize the master.

314
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,300
He used to be a gang leader.

315
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,300
He's a team leader.

316
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,300
Now,

317
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,300
he's a legend.

318
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,300
This master

319
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,300
is not only teaching the land itself.

320
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,300
He also teaches

321
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,300
the land itself.

322
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,300
It's easy for the police.

323
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,300
It's also easy for the police.

324
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,300
Of course,

325
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,300
young people are not old.

326
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,300
The whole city is open.

327
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,300
When we were in the police

328
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,300
it was different.

329
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,300
The master

330
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,300
can also learn from the land.

331
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,300
Young people

332
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,300
have their own ideas and ideas.

333
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,300
But the delivery of the lock

334
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,300
has the separation of the lock.

335
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,300
Like Xingzhen,

336
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,300
the community,

337
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,300
Zhiyan,

338
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,300
Huji,

339
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,300
all the work

340
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,300
has to be done by someone.

341
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,300
You have to know

342
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,300
that the separation of the lock

343
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,300
is impossible.

344
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,300
It's only a job

345
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,300
for a lifetime.

346
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,300
Understand?

347
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,300
Yes.

348
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,300
Zhiyan,

349
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,300
Chen Hao,

350
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,300
and Xia Jie.

351
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,300
You all know.

352
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,300
Cao Jianjun,

353
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,300
and Yang Shu.

354
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,300
This is a group of people.

355
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,300
Jianjun is the

356
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,300
key to our contribution.

357
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,300
Yang Shu

358
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,300
is a senior.

359
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,300
He is the main

360
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,300
person in the bureau.

361
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,300
Hu Da.

362
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,300
Chief,

363
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,300
he is a senior in the north.

364
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,300
I can take him.

365
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,300
He is a senior.

366
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,300
He is a senior.

367
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,300
Of course you can take him.

368
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,300
Yang Shu,

369
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,300
tell your master.

370
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,300
Master,

371
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,300
I will learn well with you.

372
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,300
Thank you.

373
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,300
Relax,

374
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,300
don't be shy.

375
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,300
What you said yesterday,

376
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,300
this...

377
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,300
Let's learn together.

378
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,300
The community,

379
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,300
Zhijie, Zhang Zhijie,

380
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,300
Zhao Jiuyun.

381
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,300
The community.

382
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,300
I don't need to introduce Zhijie.

383
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,300
He is our full talent.

384
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,300
Full talent.

385
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,300
Chief,

386
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,300
learn well with your master.

387
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,300
Chief,

388
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,300
what about me?

389
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,300
I can't be like you.

390
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,300
Yes.

391
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,300
Yu Dawei,

392
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,300
what I want to share with you is,

393
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,300
the most powerful and

394
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,300
most experienced,

395
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,300
become a new officer.

396
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,300
Wait, wait, wait.

397
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,300
Chief,

398
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,300
something is wrong.

399
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,300
What?

400
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,300
What's wrong?

401
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,300
What's wrong?

402
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,300
Master,

403
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,300
I think you can do it.

404
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,300
You can do it,

405
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,300
or you can do it.

406
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,300
OK, three times.

407
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,300
No, no, no.

408
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,300
Chief.

409
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,300
Chief.

410
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,300
Chief.

411
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,300
Zhao Lin.

412
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,300
Chief.

413
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,300
You teach me.

414
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,300
No, no, no.

415
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,300
I'll teach you.

416
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,300
I'll teach you.

417
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,300
Zhang Zhijie.

418
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,300
Yang Shu.

419
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,300
OK.

420
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,300
OK.

421
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,300
OK.

422
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,300
Chief.

423
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,300
Chief.

424
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,300
Why don't you go out?

425
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,300
No.

426
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,300
There are more than 500 hours.

427
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,300
I'll show you.

428
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,300
Go.

429
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,300
Chief.

430
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,300
Yang Li.

431
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,300
Why are you squatting?

432
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,300
Come on.

433
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,300
Chief.

434
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,300
Yang Li.

435
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,300
Why are you squatting?

436
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,300
Zhao Hu.

437
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,300
No, no, no.

438
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,300
What's wrong?

439
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,300
Let's talk inside.

440
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,300
My waist is moving.

441
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,300
It's OK.

442
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,300
It's OK.

443
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,300
It's OK.

444
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,300
You're so slow.

445
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,300
Go and see.

446
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,300
Xiaojie.

447
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,300
You can work here in the future.

448
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,300
You can bring your stuff back.

449
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,300
Thank you, master.

450
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,300
You're welcome.

451
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,300
Master.

452
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,300
Other new police officers

453
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,300
are working in the office?

454
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,300
Of course not.

455
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,300
Don't say that it's a office.

456
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,300
There are no tables.

457
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,300
I'll be the same as them.

458
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,300
You're a girl.

459
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,300
Why are you compared to them?

460
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,300
Master.

461
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,300
Thank you for your kindness.

462
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,300
Since we're all police officers,

463
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,300
we can share

464
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,300
whether you're a girl or not.

465
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,300
I'll go.

466
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,300
Xiaojie.

467
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,300
You're so nice to master.

468
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,300
You sit down.

469
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,300
I'll sit down.

470
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,300
What do I do?

471
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,300
We agreed.

472
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,300
You promised.

473
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,300
Why are you so annoying?

474
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,300
What did I promise you?

475
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,300
What did I do to you?

476
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,300
Master.

477
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,300
You're not like this.

478
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,300
I'm not like you.

479
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,300
OK.

480
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,300
I'll make it clear to you today.

481
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,300
I can't take Li Dawei.

482
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,300
Why can't you take him?

483
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,300
I'm old.

484
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,300
I can't take him.

485
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,300
Cheng Jingcheng.

486
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,300
You have something to say.

487
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,300
You're not scolding me.

488
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,300
You're scolding me

489
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,300
for being old.

490
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,300
Aren't you scolding me?

491
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,300
Let me tell you.

492
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,300
He's the representative of the age group.

493
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,300
The representative of the age group is experience.

494
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,300
I have experience.

495
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,300
Can I take him?

496
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,300
You can find him a new master.

497
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,300
I'll take him.

498
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,300
I announced it at the downstairs.

499
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,300
You want me now?

500
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,300
How can I take him?

501
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,300
Cheng Jingcheng.

502
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,300
I've seen Li Dawei's kid.

503
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,300
He's a bit naughty.

504
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,300
But his strengths are also very obvious.

505
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,300
He can train.

506
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,300
So I'll give him to you.

507
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,300
I'll let him become mature.

508
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,300
Let me tell you.

509
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,300
If I give it to someone else,

510
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,300
I'm not worried.

511
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,300
If I give it to you,

512
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,300
you'll see him.

513
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,300
That's enough.

514
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,300
Why are you so sure

515
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,300
that I can see him?

516
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,300
I'm a group of naughty people.

517
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,300
Right?

518
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,300
Chief, let me tell you.

519
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,300
Cheng Jingcheng.

520
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,300
Come on. Sit down.

521
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,300
Sit down.

522
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,300
I know where you're from.

523
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,300
Since you were wronged,

524
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,300
your attitude has changed.

525
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,300
Actually,

526
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,300
he knows everything.

527
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,300
It's over.

528
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,300
Let it be.

529
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,300
Like our age,

530
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,300
he still puts

531
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,300
his time on the old emperor.

532
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,300
That's not good.

533
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,300
Right?

534
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,300
Don't worry.

535
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,300
I won't let you

536
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,300
be like Gao Chao.

537
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,300
You can't go forward.

538
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,300
You just have to do your job.

539
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,300
Help me bring the land back.

540
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,300
Okay?

541
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,300
Okay?

542
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,300
Wang Zui.

543
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,300
I'm good at this.

544
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,300
You can put it on your waist.

545
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,300
No.

546
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,300
I can't.

547
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,300
I have to massage it.

548
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,300
I'll leave it to you.

549
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,300
You still have so many threads.

550
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,300
You're so...

551
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,300
No need.

552
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,300
You're so old.

553
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,300
You're still like a kid.

554
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,300
You're a good suspect.

555
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,300
You know what?

556
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,300
I'll change my own clothes.

557
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,300
Go.

558
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,300
Tell me.

559
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,300
Come.

560
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,300
The director of the work

561
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,300
is not good.

562
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,300
You have to be more specific.

563
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,300
I'll teach you in two days.

564
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,300
Okay.

565
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,300
I'll remind you.

566
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,300
Okay.

567
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,300
You go first.

568
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,300
Xu.

569
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,300
Come.

570
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,300
Be careful.

571
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,300
The master is here.

572
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,300
I'll go first.

573
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,300
Go.

574
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,300
Did your baby dancers break up?

575
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,300
Master.

576
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,300
I've told you the first day.

577
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,300
I'll ask your having laid down.

578
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,300
Feel happy.

579
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,300
Don't be angry.

580
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,300
Fix your mistakes before hurting the victims.

581
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,300
Talk just like your Godfather.

582
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,300
Can't we just stop here?

583
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,300
You didn't get the tips?

584
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,300
Surely.

585
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,300
I'm asking you, how old are you?

586
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,300
Twenty.

587
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,300
What's your name?

588
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,300
Uncle, you're a real criminal.

589
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:32,300
Why did you go to the police station?

590
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,300
My mom told me to go there.

591
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,300
Your mom?

592
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,300
Well, I can't manage it at home.

593
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,300
I can't manage it at home.

594
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,300
I can manage it at home.

595
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,300
That's what you mean?

596
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:53,300
Your mom took the police station as a place?

597
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,300
She took it from me?

598
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,300
That's what she said.

599
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,300
She's a dog.

600
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,300
Uncle, you like to drink?

601
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,300
My mom got a bunch of good things from her.

602
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,300
I can't use them.

603
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,300
Uncle, you don't like me?

604
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,300
You don't want to take me?

605
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,300
Don't worry. I'll do my best.

606
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,300
I promise I won't let you worry.

607
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,300
Really?

608
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,300
Yes.

609
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,300
I promise.

610
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:36,300
I'll tell you everything about the big deal.

611
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,300
Uncle, I...

612
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,300
You're a criminal.

613
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,300
Don't say that.

614
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,300
Look at the situation.

615
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,300
You can't go anywhere.

616
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,300
Don't touch me.

617
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,300
I'll take it for you.

618
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,300
What's the deal?

619
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,300
Drink it.

620
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,300
Drink it?

621
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,300
Drink it.

622
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,300
Can you not follow me?

623
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,300
Can I?

624
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,300
What's the deal?

625
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,300
Just a little bit.

626
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,300
It's not me.

627
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,300
Uncle Yang is the same.

628
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,300
I'll go and get it.

629
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,300
Morning.

630
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,300
Morning.

631
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,300
You must remember.

632
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,300
Under the situation of knife,

633
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,300
the new knife must be protected

634
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,300
by the police.

635
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,300
It's me.

636
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,300
What's the deal?

637
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,300
I'll go and get it.

638
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,300
Under the situation of knife,

639
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,300
the new knife must be protected by the police.

640
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,300
Go.

641
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,300
Hello, I'm your uncle.

642
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,300
Xiao Jie,

643
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,300
you just study with me today.

644
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,300
You'll be fine.

645
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,300
Take a picture with me.

646
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,300
You're so good at shooting.

647
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,300
You're so good at shooting.

648
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,300
You're so good at shooting.

649
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,300
Don't hit me.

650
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,300
What are you doing?

651
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,300
Take a picture with me.

652
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,300
Uncle Yang,

653
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,300
you're eating with me.

654
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,300
Go.

655
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,300
Take a picture with me.

656
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,300
Go.

657
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,300
Go.

658
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,300
Hello, you're so good at shooting.

659
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,300
You're so good at shooting.

660
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,300
Uncle.

661
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,300
Uncle.

662
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,300
Uncle.

663
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,300
Police.

664
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,300
Close the door.

665
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,300
Don't move.

666
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,300
Don't move.

667
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,300
I must not open the door.

668
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,300
Police.

669
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,300
What's going on?

670
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,300
Don't move.

671
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,300
Open the door.

672
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,300
Don't move.

673
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,300
Don't move.

674
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,300
Open the door.

675
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,300
Open the door.

676
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,300
Hello, you're so good at shooting.

677
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,300
You're so good at shooting.

678
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,300
Xiao Jie,

679
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,300
you're waiting here.

680
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,300
You two go inside with me.

681
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,300
Don't move.

682
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,300
Uncle,

683
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,300
you're so good at shooting.

684
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,300
I can do it.

685
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,300
I'll go and get it.

686
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,300
I'll go and get it.

687
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,300
Excuse me,

688
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,300
can I see your passport?

689
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,300
Sure.

690
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,300
Go ahead.

691
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,300
No.

692
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,300
No.

693
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,300
No.

694
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,300
No.

695
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,300
No.

696
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,300
No.

697
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,300
No.

698
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,300
No.

699
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,300
No.

700
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,300
No.

701
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,300
No.

702
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,300
No.

703
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,300
No.

704
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,300
No.

705
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,300
No.

706
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,300
Uncle,

707
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,300
my team.

708
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,300
No.

709
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,300
No.

710
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,300
No.

711
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,300
No.

712
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,300
No.

713
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,300
No.

714
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,300
No.

715
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,300
Sorry.

716
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,300
My feelings are about to subside.

717
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,300
Don't hesitate.

718
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,300
Ji Weiyin.

719
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,300
Okay.

720
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,300
Stop shooting.

721
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,300
No.

722
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,300
No.

723
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,300
Stop shooting.

724
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,300
Stop shooting.

725
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,300
Stop.

726
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,300
Stop.

727
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,300
Stop.

728
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,300
Stop shooting.

729
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,300
Why are you in the Blue Desert?

730
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,420
What's wrong with you?

731
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,420
You're not in the right place.

732
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,420
I'm not.

733
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,420
I'm just a police officer.

734
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:47,420
I'm just a dream.

735
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,420
That's what you are.

736
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,420
Everyone is a little bit busy.

737
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,420
I'm used to it.

738
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:56,420
I think I should get used to it first.

739
00:34:56,420 --> 00:35:00,420
I think your teacher is actually quite good.

740
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,420
Yes.

741
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,420
She must like you.

742
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:07,420
She's good, she's good at studying.

743
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:10,540
She doesn't even bring me with her.

744
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:16,540
Uncle An, I think your teacher is really good.

745
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:20,540
If I were to be with her, she would be very angry with me.

746
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,540
Not like now.

747
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,540
I'm not doing anything.

748
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,540
I'm just a waste of money.

749
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,540
I have to run away from my teacher now.

750
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:27,540
But you know, she's been wearing a long sleeve shirt all day.

751
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,540
She's not hot.

752
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:32,540
My teacher is quite good.

753
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:35,540
She's just like a police officer.

754
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,660
She's just like a police officer.

755
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,660
Isn't she a police officer?

756
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:44,660
Miss Wei, I think you're the best.

757
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,660
Why am I the best?

758
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:49,660
I heard that the city is your father's disciple.

759
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,660
He must be nice to you.

760
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,660
Yes, it's not just him.

761
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,660
The whole派出所 is very nice to me.

762
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,660
Do you remember?

763
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,660
Yes.

764
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:04,660
If that's the case, I have to do something.

765
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,780
It proves that Xia Jie can be a good police officer.

766
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,780
He won't disappoint everyone.

767
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,780
Don't give yourself so much pressure.

768
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,780
What's the point of being so stressed?

769
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:20,780
For Xia Jie, it's not that easy.

770
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,780
Why are you so upset?

771
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,780
Yes.

772
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:28,780
It seems that everyone in the police station is good to her.

773
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,780
They protect her.

774
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,780
But what's so good about protecting her

775
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,900
is a trick.

776
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,900
Don't underestimate Xia Jie.

777
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,900
She's a good police officer.

778
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,900
Okay, I'll be your partner.

779
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,900
Are you three hungry?

780
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,900
You look hungry.

781
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,900
Are you hungry?

782
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,900
Yes.

783
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,900
Okay, I'm off work.

784
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,900
See you tomorrow.

785
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:30,900
Bye.

786
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,900
Master, you go first.

787
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,900
I want to quickly take off my shoes.

788
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,900
Don't worry.

789
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:43,900
Master, I want to be a human.

790
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,900
I'm going to the hospital.

791
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:14,900
Did you bring all the stuff?

792
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:15,900
Yes.

793
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:16,900
Hey, Jianjiu, what's wrong with your hand?

794
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,900
It's not good to be treated like this.

795
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:28,900
What are you looking at?

796
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:29,900
Master, come.

797
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:34,900
This is for you.

798
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:35,900
In the future,

799
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,900
whether it's a scene or a daily work,

800
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:38,900
use a notebook or a notebook.

801
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,900
Don't take a few more blanks.

802
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,900
Master, such a big notebook

803
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:50,900
is not convenient to hold.

804
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,900
There is no need for this.

805
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,900
Why is there no need?

806
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,900
Don't just think about using your brain

807
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,900
to remember every thing.

808
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:00,900
Do young people like to

809
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,900
remember everything with their phones?

810
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:05,900
Then I'll tell you.

811
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:06,900
When the phone is critical,

812
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:07,900
it will also fall off.

813
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,900
It's better to remember than to take a blank.

814
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,900
You will have an understanding of this later.

815
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:15,900
By the way,

816
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:16,900
you have to prepare

817
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,900
a special notebook for the meeting.

818
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,900
The content can be read.

819
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,900
You can...

820
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,900
You can't see what you are writing.

821
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:26,900
But the title and date

822
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:27,900
must be clear.

823
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:29,900
This thing is useless.

824
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,900
But when you want to use it,

825
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,900
it's true.

826
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,900
If you have it, you can keep it.

827
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,900
Master, it's not that exaggerated.

828
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,900
Master will still be mad at you.

829
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:41,900
You are so thoughtful.

830
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,900
Okay.

831
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:53,900
Let's go.

832
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:54,900
I'll take you out for a walk.

833
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:57,900
Is this really a thing?

834
00:39:58,900 --> 00:39:59,900
Don't be afraid.

835
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:02,900
Master.

836
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:09,900
Be careful.

837
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:10,900
The bus is coming.

838
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:11,900
Let's go.

839
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:19,900
Master.

840
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:20,900
The bus is coming.

841
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:21,900
Let's go.

842
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:26,900
Master.

843
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:27,900
The bus is coming.

844
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:28,900
Let's go.

845
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:37,900
Master.

846
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:38,900
Take a taxi.

847
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:39,900
Yes.

848
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:40,900
You are still standing here.

849
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:41,900
Yes.

850
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:42,900
Let's go.

851
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:43,900
I'll call you later.

852
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:44,900
Okay.

853
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:46,900
Brother Zhang Jing'an is here.

854
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:47,900
I'll help you out.

855
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:49,900
You can come over.

856
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:50,900
Okay.

857
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:55,900
Zhang Jing'an is here.

858
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:56,900
Yes.

859
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:57,900
I'll help you out.

860
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:58,900
No.

861
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:59,900
Okay.

862
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:00,900
Take care.

863
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:01,900
Master.

864
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:02,900
Where is the water?

865
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:03,900
It's in the water.

866
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:04,900
You need to be careful.

867
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:05,900
Okay.

868
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:06,900
Don't worry.

869
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:07,900
I'll wash it after I finish it.

870
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:08,900
Okay.

871
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:09,900
You need to clean it later.

872
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:10,900
Okay.

873
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:11,900
Thank you.

874
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:12,900
Master.

875
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,900
Who knows this neighborhood?

876
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,900
The most important thing in our community is

877
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:18,900
to have friends.

878
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,900
Friends?

879
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:21,900
Thank you.

880
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:25,900
Yes.

881
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,900
Only friends and acquaintances.

882
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,900
In the future, the police and all other departments

883
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:32,900
will come to us

884
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,900
to clean up the area.

885
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:35,900
Do you understand?

886
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:36,900
Yes.

887
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:37,900
Look.

888
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:38,900
The usual work in this neighborhood

889
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:39,900
is all about

890
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:40,900
cleaning up the area.

891
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:41,900
But the most important thing

892
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,900
is to clean up the area.

893
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:44,900
Do you understand?

894
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:48,900
Master, I'm done cleaning up.

895
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:50,900
Uncle Jing'an.

896
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:52,900
What's wrong, kid?

897
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:53,900
Help us.

898
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:57,900
Uncle Jing'an,

899
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:58,900
please take a look.

900
00:41:58,900 --> 00:41:59,900
What's wrong?

901
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:02,900
What's wrong?

902
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:03,900
It's our neighbor's car.

903
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,900
It's almost a day.

904
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:06,900
He must be having a baby

905
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,900
with such a big belly.

906
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,900
Please help him.

907
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:14,900
Kid,

908
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:17,900
this is not a police station.

909
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,900
You should send him to the hospital.

910
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:22,900
Brother,

911
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:25,900
I'm not asking you to take care of my parents.

912
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,900
They are too dirty.

913
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:28,900
They don't give me money

914
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:31,900
to send them to the hospital.

915
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:32,900
Even the cage

916
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,900
is bought by my neighbor.

917
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,900
No one can tell me, Dad and Mom.

918
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:41,900
Uncle Jing'an,

919
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:42,900
you are in trouble.

920
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,900
You should find Uncle Jing'an.

921
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:45,900
Yes.

922
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:47,900
Find Uncle Jing'an.

923
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:49,900
Master,

924
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,900
it's not a good idea

925
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:52,900
to get involved in this matter.

926
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:57,900
Okay.

927
00:42:58,900 --> 00:42:59,900
I'll send him to the hospital.

928
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:01,900
You are too kind.

929
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:03,900
Uncle Jing'an,

930
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:04,900
send him back

931
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:05,900
to the hospital.

932
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:06,900
We'll feed him

933
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:07,900
when we have time.

934
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:10,900
Okay.

935
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:11,900
I'll send him back

936
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:12,900
when he's recovered.

937
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:13,900
Kid,

938
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:14,900
come back soon.

939
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:18,900
Kid,

940
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,900
even you are a good friend.

941
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:21,900
Of course.

942
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,900
We are friends.

943
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:35,900
I'm sorry.

944
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:05,900
I'm sorry.

945
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:35,900
I'm sorry.

946
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:05,900
I'm sorry.

947
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:35,900
I'm sorry.
