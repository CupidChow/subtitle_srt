00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,920
BLUEMING
COLORED BY YOU

2
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,160
Put the blanket on.

3
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,210
No matter how hot it is,
you need to cover your tummy.

4
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,039
I don't get it.

5
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,539
I don't get why you like me.

6
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,620
I don't get it.

7
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,620
You are...

8
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,290
You're cute when you get mad.

9
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,620
You're always so serious and diligent,

10
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,540
but at the same time, you're clumsy.

11
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,750
You have pretty eyes when you smile.

12
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,040
You're kind.

13
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,670
And you're cautious.

14
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,920
Keep stroking my hair.

15
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,160
I have hard time falling asleep
in an unfamiliar place.

16
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,750
Okay.

17
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,500
But you...

18
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,580
But when you came to my house,
you slept so well.

19
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:05,750
Oh.

20
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,380
I told you not to talk about that.

21
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,620
You were drunk...

22
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:13,920
Stop it. I wasn't like that.

23
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,160
You slept like a baby.

24
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,120
You even got undressed.

25
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,420
Stop it.

26
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:23,790
I told you not to talk about that time.

27
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,540
Stop laughing.

28
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,670
Come here.

29
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,079
No.

30
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,160
Okay, I won't laugh.

31
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:10,500
EP 09. ONE FINE SPRING DAY

32
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:20,709
DA-WOON & SI-WON WERE HERE

33
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,580
THE FINAL EXAM

34
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,160
Huh?

35
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,880
When did you get here?

36
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,160
Let's take the van. You must be tired.

37
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,120
Here's your coffee.

38
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,830
You have your shooting to do.
You'll be tired later.

39
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:41,380
I got all the equipments out already
so I got a plenty of sleep. I'm good.

40
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,920
Where's the van?

41
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,500
It's over there.

42
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,830
Aren't you cold?

43
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,159
I'm good.

44
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,750
Excuse me. Can you walk this way?
We're shooting a film now. I apologize.

45
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,920
Thank you.

46
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:06,710
Excuse me. Can you walk this way?
We're shooting a film now. I apologize.

47
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,290
- Is it done?
- Yes.

48
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,790
You know you're absolutely
cute and adorable, right?

49
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,460
This is just a movie, so this isn't
the real version of you. Remember that.

50
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:33,670
Cool.

51
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:36,880
So what we're going to shoot now is...

52
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:39,540
Your parents just had a fight.

53
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:44,000
You don't want to hear or see the fight
and nor do you want to think about it.

54
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,920
That's why you'll be running.

55
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,330
You can do that, right?

56
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,250
Thanks.

57
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,210
When I say, "Ready, Action,"
you'll run, okay?

58
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,750
We'll do the rehearsal.

59
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:59,580
- Okay.
- Okay.

60
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,830
Ready.

61
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,380
Sound.

62
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,160
Camera.

63
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,120
Roll.

64
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,160
Action.

65
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,159
Are you really leaving?

66
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,540
Are you crazy?

67
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,040
Leave me alone.

68
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,380
Let's get divorced.
I'll send you the papers.

69
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,290
Hey.

70
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,580
Hey!

71
00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:00,000
You'll look a lot better
once you lose 7kgs.

72
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:05,920
People judge others based on looks.

73
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,880
There you go, baby.

74
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,580
Are you seriously not coming back?

75
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,420
Okay, I got it.

76
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,880
No, I won't divorce you.

77
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,880
I'm not crazy.

78
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,159
What?

79
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,710
Mind your own business.

80
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,250
MY RUNNING BIKE
CHARACTERS / PRODUCED BY

81
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,960
PRODUCTION: KIM EUN-A
DIRECTION & SCRIPT: CHA SI-WON

82
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:27,710
It's our first supporting project.
I look forward to your support.

83
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,210
- I enjoyed the film.
- Thank you.

84
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:30,080
Thank you.

85
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:34,250
There will be another one,
so please look forward to it too.

86
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,880
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello.

87
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,500
I enjoyed the film.

88
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,620
The production was very fresh and raw
which suited the concept of the film.

89
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,880
Thank you.

90
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:49,080
I know you're one of Da-woon's friends.
Shall we have lunch?

91
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,830
- Sure.
- Okay.

92
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:54,710
Come down to the first basement floor.
I'll let Da-Woon know.

93
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,080
Okay.

94
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:04,790
Da-Woon's father had to attend
another movie preview.

95
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,670
If you're majoring in production, I guess
you have to write a lot of scenarios.

96
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:11,790
Yes, ma'am.

97
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:16,120
I'm still a freshman so I'm going to try
writing longer ones more and more.

98
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:20,040
Right. When you finish writing one,
send it to me so I can read it.

99
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:21,830
I expect a full-length one.

100
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,960
Yes, ma'am.

101
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,620
This is not an easy business to be in.

102
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,960
If you look closely, everything works
based on connections.

103
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:42,040
It's understandable that your work is
green since you're a freshman who's 20.

104
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,830
I showed a lot of movies
to Da-woon as a kid

105
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,290
so he becomes a director or a writer.

106
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,500
His dad and I lived in
the shooting scenes,

107
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,580
so I used to give him the list to watch.

108
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:15,040
When I shot this film, Da-woon gave me
lots of reference films to watch.

109
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:16,830
Oh, is that so?

110
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,040
They were all so helpful.

111
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:23,120
I was so happy when you said
you were going to major in film.

112
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,960
We never pushed him to though.

113
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,830
Excuse me. Is it okay I call my sister?
She keeps calling me.

114
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,830
Sure.

115
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,290
I'm sorry.

116
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,080
Why do you keep calling me?

117
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:57,620
Hey, mom watched the film on your laptop.

118
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:58,620
What?

119
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,330
I don't know how.

120
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,830
She's crying and everything.

121
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,420
I thought you should know.

122
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,420
Come home quick.

123
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,380
I'm hanging up now.

124
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,500
It's good to try directing
as many times as you can.

125
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:23,790
It would have been better if you wrote
the scenario and directed.

126
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,580
No.

127
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:28,790
If you did, people would've talked.

128
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:33,880
If it wasn't you, his work
wouldn't have even made in the rank.

129
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,460
Thank you.

130
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:39,880
It looks like you two are very close.

131
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:43,040
I mean, the film wasn't done so well.

132
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,880
We should've chosen one of the graduates.

133
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:50,620
No, it was green but fresh.

134
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:55,250
I hope it makes to the film festival
so I can go there have some fun.
