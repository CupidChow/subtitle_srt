Will it be me прямо

6
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,500
More than myself

7
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,180
Say goodbye to me

8
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,280
I won't ask you

9
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:16,780
Show your hand

10
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,720
Sing along

11
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:19,700
I want to ask you

12
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,760
Will you go with me?

13
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,100
Live together

14
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:22,920
What do you need?

15
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,460
What's the lacking of time now?

16
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,120
How will you respond to me?

17
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,000
Why are you saying those two songs использ다 li 간

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,380
What's the lacking of time now?

19
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,100
Let's travel

20
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,860
Are you listening?

21
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,460
I'm sorry

22
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:35,460
I'm sure some people change their lives with just one kiss.

23
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,460
But I'm different.

24
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,460
Every time I see Mai's face, I get nervous.

25
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,460
And I remember the heat I felt on my lips.

26
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,460
I feel like something's wrong with my heart.

27
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:48,460
It's no fun kissing friends.

28
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,460
Let's forget about it.

29
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,460
You're over-watching.

30
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,460
What's wrong?

31
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,460
You look at her with your eyes like you've lost your soul.

32
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,460
No, I'm still gorgeous.

33
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,460
It's like we're going to France from now on.

34
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,460
You've been friends with Osuka, haven't you?

35
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,460
Well, yeah.

36
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:13,460
If I had known her a little later, I would have been a little more cheerful.

37
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,460
That's...

38
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,460
I don't know if I should say it.

39
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:21,460
If you stay close to her, you can see her frustrated face.

40
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,460
What? For that reason?

41
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,460
Well, I'm going.

42
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,460
Yes, yes.

43
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,460
See you later.

44
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:32,460
Don't be disappointed in the fact that you didn't look at her.

45
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,460
You're not special.

46
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,460
You're just a friend.

47
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,460
Did you fall in love with that woman?

48
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,460
What?

49
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,460
I'll just tell you that you shouldn't.

50
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,460
No, no, no.

51
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,460
What?

52
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,460
I haven't seen you for a while and I'm lonely.

53
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,460
Can't you stay alone on the roof for a while?

54
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,460
Mai Osuka.

55
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,460
I don't know. I don't know.

56
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,460
Excuse me.

57
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,460
What?

58
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:01,460
Why do I have to be so desperate to see Mai?

59
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,460
Hey.

60
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,460
You came, didn't you?

61
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,460
Renako.

62
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,460
I'm untied my hair.

63
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,460
The wind feels good.

64
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,460
I'll give you a reason.

65
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,460
I like you.

66
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,460
I like you too.

67
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,460
As a friend.

68
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:27,460
It's been a long time since I've seen you after school.

69
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,460
I can't stand a week.

70
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:33,460
So, I need you to replenish the Renako component while you're away.

71
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,460
I'm lonely because I can't see my friends.

72
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,460
So, get away from me.

73
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,460
House.

74
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,460
I told you not to dress up.

75
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,460
Mai!

76
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:53,460
I was going to be smart today.

77
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:58,460
But it's strange since I first kissed you the other day.

78
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,460
Go away!

79
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,460
I'm going.

80
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,460
The smell of Mai.

81
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,460
What?

82
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,460
I can feel the remaining face.

83
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,460
I'm in love with you.

84
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,460
I'll forget about Mai for now.

85
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:21,460
I don't know such a stubborn and stubborn guy.

86
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,460
Wow, Ousuka Mai.

87
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,460
She's so beautiful.

88
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,460
I'll kiss her.

89
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,460
Wait.

90
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:35,460
I can't believe I'm kissing such a noble creature.

91
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,460
I'm getting sleepy.

92
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,460
Maybe it's because Mai isn't here.

93
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,460
It's the summer.

94
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,460
Kaho is like that.

95
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:50,460
Satsuki said she'd study and make a difference.

96
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,460
I have a plan to get rid of the shame.

97
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,460
I've been alone for a while.

98
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,460
I'm getting sick.

99
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,460
I'm tired of being with everyone, but I'm weak in my heart.

100
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,460
I'm not a coward.

101
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:07,460
I have to show Mai that I can do it even if Mai isn't here.

102
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:10,460
I'll be entangled in that woman's hands forever.

103
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,460
Hey, Ajisai.

104
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,460
What?

105
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,460
If you don't mind, why don't we go somewhere together?

106
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,460
Sure.

107
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,460
What?

108
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,460
So easily?

109
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,460
It's rare to be invited by you.

110
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,460
Ajisai.

111
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,460
Thank you for inviting me.

112
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,460
Thank you too.

113
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,460
Of course this isn't a trick.

114
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,460
What's a trick to a friend?

115
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,460
Thank you for choosing a cute color.

116
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,460
No, I got a lot of supplies.

117
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,460
I like the color you painted.

118
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,460
It's so cute.

119
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,460
It's just that the quality of the cosmetics was good.

120
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:58,460
Ajisai, you're too invincible to match the lip color.

121
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,460
Really?

122
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,460
What?

123
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,460
Ajisai, one more time.

124
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,460
You're taking it off?

125
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,460
It was so cute.

126
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,460
It's okay.

127
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,460
I just want to enjoy it alone.

128
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,460
I'm glad I'm alive.

129
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,460
Let's go upstairs.

130
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,460
Sorry, you didn't like it?

131
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,460
It's not like that.

132
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,460
What?

133
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,460
You like me?

134
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,460
Your heart is beating so fast.

135
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,460
Of course I like you.

136
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:38,460
I've been hearing all that in a strange way because of you.

137
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,460
Can I talk to you for a minute?

138
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,460
Yes, sorry.

139
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,460
Why are you apologizing?

140
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:51,460
I have a little brother, but he's always scolding me at home.

141
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:54,460
Is there anything that Ajisai gets angry about?

142
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,460
There is.

143
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,460
He doesn't clean up, he always forgets things.

144
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:00,460
He doesn't reply to me when I play games.

145
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,460
It's my sister.

146
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,460
That's right.

147
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:08,460
That's why I wanted to come to the department store with a cute girl like this.

148
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,460
What's this heart-pounding?

149
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,460
I like a girl.

150
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,460
What's wrong?

151
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,460
Are you sick?

152
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:24,460
I feel like I've written down the save data on the dungeon that I can't enter again.

153
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,460
Sena and Amaori are shopping.

154
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,460
That's right.

155
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,460
You two?

156
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,460
I'm looking for her template.

157
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,460
I've already added the template.

158
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,460
So, I'll go somewhere.

159
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,460
What should I do?

160
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,460
It's like this.

161
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,460
I'm not going to play today.

162
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,460
The boy is coming.

163
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,460
Boy?

164
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,460
I don't care.

165
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,460
Do you have anything to ask me?

166
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:56,460
I'm being cheeky, but I won't ask you again.

167
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:02,460
I think I was just laughing at that time.

168
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:06,460
I wonder if that wasn't her favorite either.

169
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:11,460
Then I was ignored and I was alone until graduation.

170
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:17,460
Since then, I've been extremely afraid of others' eyes and refusing to be invited.

171
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,460
If Mai were here...

172
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,460
What's that? It's no good at all.

173
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:29,460
I can't say that I'm an ideal friend just because I use it on the one hand to rely on it when it gets worse.

174
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:34,460
I have to refuse it with my own mouth so that I can meet him again.

175
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,460
What are you going to do, Rena?

176
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,460
I'm sorry.

177
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,460
I...

178
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,460
Rena!

179
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,460
I'm sorry.

180
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:02,460
I recovered quickly from a light cold.

181
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:06,460
The two boys went home saying they didn't want me to be worried.

182
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:10,460
They're so kind. I'm sorry I'm not good at it on the one hand.

183
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,460
Um...

184
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,460
I'm sorry, Rena.

185
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:17,460
Rena, you're not good at boys, are you?

186
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,460
You should have refused me first.

187
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,460
No, but...

188
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:25,460
I think it's more fun to play with two people than with me.

189
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,460
Even if you cut me off.

190
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,460
No.

191
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,460
It's meaningless if you can't enjoy it, Rena.

192
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:34,460
I'm here to date you today.

193
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,460
I'm sorry.

194
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,460
Did you understand?

195
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,460
I understand.

196
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,460
Did you really understand?

197
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:46,460
I'm pretty selfish and I'm a little stubborn.

198
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,460
I'll remember it.

199
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,460
If you understand, it's okay.

200
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:58,460
You know, when I teach the kids, they hold their hands like this.

201
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:02,460
Then they'll listen to what I say.

202
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,460
My sister's secret technique.

203
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,460
I'm not going to listen to that.

204
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,460
Are you okay?

205
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,460
I caused you trouble.

206
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,460
I'm sorry.

207
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:24,460
I'm more into this game because I play it with the kids.

208
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,460
You got a new one.

209
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,460
I bought this!

210
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:31,460
Really? I want to play it too.

211
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:34,460
Then let's come home and play next time.

212
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,460
Is that okay?

213
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,460
I'm going.

214
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,460
I'm so happy.

215
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:41,460
I might have caught the trick of the youkai.

216
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,460
Well, it's bad.

217
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:46,460
While you're under the distant sky,

218
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:50,460
I'm starting to see a new sign of a friend.

219
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:56,460
Good things are different.

220
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,460
It's definitely Mai.

221
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,460
Hello?

222
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,460
What's wrong? You look a little cold.

223
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,460
Are you feeling cold without me?

224
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,460
No!

225
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,460
Don't worry.

226
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,460
I'm tying my hair now.

227
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,460
I'm your best friend.

228
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:25,460
I saw it on TV.

229
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,460
My friend was cool, and I thought it was amazing.

230
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:31,460
I see. It's fast.

231
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,460
How's it going?

232
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,460
Is your work going well?

233
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,460
Of course.

234
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,460
I'd like to say that,

235
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:42,460
but I guess it's not necessarily me.

236
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,460
What's that?

237
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:49,460
I'm just saying that I'm his daughter.

238
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,460
No, it's nothing.

239
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,460
I said something weird.

240
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,460
Please forget it.

241
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,460
You're a best friend now, right?

242
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:02,460
You can't hear your friend's words under the distant sky.

243
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,460
I love you.

244
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:09,460
You're the only important person in the world.

245
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,460
No, I mean...

246
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:15,460
The more I spend time with you, the more I'm confident.

247
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,460
I can't take anyone else's place?

248
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,460
Of course.

249
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:25,460
Well, I'm not like Mai.

250
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,460
Really?

251
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,460
Of course.

252
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:31,460
I can't stand so many girls who are so hard on me.

253
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,460
Thank you. I'm relieved now.

254
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,460
You're a really nice person.

255
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,460
It's normal.

256
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:43,460
Anyway, I went out with Ajisai today.

257
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:49,460
Ajisai plays games a lot, so I'm going to play at home tomorrow.

258
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,460
Just the two of you?

259
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,460
Yeah.

260
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:56,460
You're a bad girl who's cheating on me when we're in a long-distance relationship.

261
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,460
You're so mean!

262
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,460
I'm the one who plays with anyone!

263
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,460
Don't do that!

264
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:06,460
I'll go on a date with someone beautiful!

265
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,460
What?

266
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,460
No, I won't.

267
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,460
I'm sorry.

268
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:15,460
I was just going to throw away my pride.

269
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,460
I'm a man who's not like Mai.

270
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,460
I see.

271
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:21,460
So you can be rude to me.

272
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,460
Playing with Ajisai is a joke, right?

273
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,460
That's true!

274
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,460
What a jerk!

275
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,460
Repeat it again!

276
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:31,460
Mai's getting more and more crazy since that kiss.

277
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:34,460
Love is dangerous after all.

278
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,460
Even Mai gets crazy!

279
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:42,460
I'm bored!

280
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,460
I don't want to!

281
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,460
Calm down, 16-year-old.

282
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:48,460
Why are you so obsessed with Mai?

283
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,460
You don't understand!

284
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:54,460
That spadari is in the class and she's so lucky!

285
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,460
I guess you're not used to it.

286
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,460
It doesn't matter if Mai is in the class or not.

287
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:02,460
I'm just jealous of her.

288
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:06,460
You look so lonely without a partner.

289
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,460
Ouch!

290
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:10,460
Mai's group was peaceful.

291
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:13,460
I'm also calm and satisfied.

292
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,460
I'm home.

293
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,460
My sister's friends are here today.

294
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,460
Oh, there's a beautiful girl.

295
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,460
Rena's sister?

296
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,460
Nice to meet you.

297
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,460
I'll play games with my sisters.

298
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,460
Don't bother me.

299
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,460
There's a lot of games.

300
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:33,460
I wonder if it's normal.

301
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,460
I was curious about this one too.

302
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,460
I played this game with Mai the other day.

303
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:41,460
You overwrite your lover's memories with another person?

304
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,460
What kind of woman are you?

305
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,460
Let's play!

306
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,460
I'll tell you first, but I'm bad at games.

307
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,460
I'm sorry if I bother you.

308
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,460
It's okay.

309
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,460
I won't let you touch a finger.

310
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,460
I'll kill you before you see me.

311
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,460
I can't do that.

312
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:01,460
Then I'll adjust the hit point so that I can beat you in one blow.

313
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,460
It's okay to be normal.

314
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,460
That's right.

315
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,460
It's okay to be normal.

316
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,460
But what is normal?

317
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,460
I've only played games with Mai.

318
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,460
I'm sweating a lot.

319
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:18,460
But routine is important.

320
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:22,460
As soon as the game started, I regained my calmness.

321
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,460
I'm embarrassed.

322
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,460
I was really screaming.

323
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,460
Calmness is impossible!

324
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,460
You're so cute!

325
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,460
Rena is doing her best.

326
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,460
Do you remember where the enemy is?

327
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,460
I just happened to be there.

328
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,460
You're good at games.

329
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,460
Really?

330
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:45,460
Hey, do you want to come to my house next time?

331
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,460
I'll definitely go.

332
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,460
Yay!

333
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:51,460
The little girls will be happy to see you playing games.

334
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,460
Oh, that's what it means.

335
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:57,460
But I think it's okay if I can see you playing games.

336
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:00,460
I want to ask you a question.

337
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,460
What kind of people do you like?

338
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,460
What?

339
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,460
I don't think I have a lot of people like that.

340
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:12,460
I think I like people who can relax.

341
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,460
I see.

342
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,460
What? Is there anyone you're interested in?

343
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,460
No, there isn't.

344
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,460
From my experience,

345
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,460
I don't know what kind of people you like.

346
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:26,460
It depends on whether you like that person or someone you like.

347
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,460
If you're going to say it in that sense,

348
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,460
I think you're the one I like.

349
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,460
You're right.

350
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,460
What? Is that so?

351
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,460
No, it's not!

352
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,460
I was surprised.

353
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:38,460
I've never been confessed to by a girl's friend.

354
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,460
No, it's not!

355
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,460
I'm not!

356
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,460
What a shame.

357
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,460
Please forgive me.

358
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:51,460
Maybe Aji-sai is teasing me and having fun.

359
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,460
Did you find out?

360
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,460
Hey!

361
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,460
Oh, that's kind of gross.

362
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,460
A fallen angel who seduces humans.

363
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:01,460
Oh, and I'm starting to think about this because of Mai.

364
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,460
I'm not running!

365
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,460
That woman changed me!

366
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,460
I'm sorry, Aji-sai.

367
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,460
It's okay. I'll forgive you.

368
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,460
Huh?

369
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,460
Do I have to leave?

370
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,460
It's okay. I have a sister.

371
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,460
Sis!

372
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:21,460
Someone like Hario and Joya is here!

373
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,460
Hey, darling.

374
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,460
W-Why?

375
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,460
Work finished early.

376
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,460
And you're taking off your hair!

377
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:33,460
I can't. Aji-sai is here.

378
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,460
Then it's perfect.

379
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,460
Let's play together.

380
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,460
What? Mai?

381
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,460
Hi. I'm here to see you.

382
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,460
You're Renako's sister, huh?

383
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,460
Nice to meet you. I'm Oozuka Mai.

384
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,460
Nice to meet you.

385
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,460
Sister?

386
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,460
Are you her friend?

387
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:54,460
Yes. We're getting along.

388
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,460
Oh.

389
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,460
What should I do?

390
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:02,460
I'm so nervous that they're holding me.

391
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,460
Why did Mai come here when we're dating?

392
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,460
I have to be careful with girls who cheat on me.

393
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,460
Why do I look like a bad girl?

394
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,460
We're friends!

395
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,460
Then let's play games together.

396
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,460
Huh?

397
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,460
I'll do it!

398
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,460
Sorry. It's already this late.

399
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:30,460
My brother is coming. I'll go home first.

400
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,460
You guys can play.

401
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,460
I'll send you to the station.

402
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,460
I can't go alone with Mai.

403
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,460
I know.

404
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,460
Then Oozuka, you too.

405
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,460
Sorry. I'm late.

406
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:44,460
I'll stay for an hour.

407
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,460
You're so selfish.

408
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,460
Go ahead.

409
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,460
Then I'll send you to the station.

410
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,460
Let's go, Aji-sai.

411
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,460
Okay.

412
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,460
I'm sorry to bother you.

413
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,460
I had fun today.

414
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,460
Mai, see you at school.

415
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,460
Okay. See you.

416
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,460
See you.

417
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,460
Okay. See you.

418
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:09,460
Now, let's continue.

419
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,460
You're so loud.

420
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,460
You're so quick!

421
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,460
I'll be punished by this wolf!

422
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:18,460
I came home early for you.

423
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,460
For me?

424
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:27,460
You can see through my foolishness.

425
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,460
I'm sorry.

426
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,460
Stop it.

427
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,460
I'm jealous right now.

428
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:44,460
I can't believe Aji-sai is holding me like this.

429
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,460
As you said,

430
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:50,460
it's not always beautiful to fall in love with someone.

431
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,460
Mai, wait.

432
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,460
It's soft and smells good.

433
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,460
It's the smell of Renako.

434
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,460
You're embarrassing me.

435
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:03,460
I want to take all of you to my place.

436
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,460
Change?

437
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:12,460
You're wearing a uniform when you came home?

438
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,460
Okay.

439
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,460
Then I'll change myself.

440
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,460
I'll be fine.

441
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,460
Renako.

442
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,460
Wait.

443
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,460
Mai.

444
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,460
I love you.

445
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,460
It's beautiful.

446
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,460
A really beautiful girl.

447
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,460
Even if I'm punished,

448
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:36,460
I'll be able to brag to everyone.

449
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,460
Because I'm against Oozuka Mai.

450
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:43,460
I just want to feel Renako's warmth.

451
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:47,460
It's comfortable to touch people's skin.

452
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,460
But if I ask for it,

453
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:52,460
I don't think I can be friends with her.

454
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,460
No.

455
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:57,460
I want to be your true lover.

456
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,460
I might change.

457
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,460
I might be able to be who I want to be.

458
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,460
Renako.

459
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,460
What?

460
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,460
You're kidding!

461
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,460
It's okay, Renako.

462
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,460
I'll be nice to you.

463
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,460
It's not that kind of problem!

464
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,460
I love you.

465
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,460
Don't say it now!

466
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,460
I can't do that!

467
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,460
I can't!

468
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,460
I can't do it seriously!

469
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,460
I'm home.

470
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,460
I'm sorry, Renako.

471
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,460
I'm a little...

472
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,460
You're the worst!

473
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,460
You saw me!

474
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,460
I told you!

475
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,460
You're the worst!

476
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,460
It's the worst to be a lover!

477
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,460
Get out!

478
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,460
Okay.

479
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,460
I'm sorry.

480
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,460
I'm sorry.

481
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,460
I'm sorry.

482
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,460
I'm sorry.

483
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,460
Oh, no.

484
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:03,460
I should have just turned it down.

485
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:09,460
I thought I'd be able to let it go in a second.

486
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:31,460
Angels and demons are like co-incidents.

487
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:36,460
It's some kind of artistic communication.

488
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,460
It's meaningless.

489
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:41,460
We're just hiding our true selves.

490
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,460
Search, search.

491
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:46,460
We're waiting for the answer.

492
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,460
Search, search.

493
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,460
We're doing something wrong.

494
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:55,460
It's like a sweet poison that can melt even a sword.

495
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:58,460
It's a scanty one.

496
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,460
What's right when you get lost?

497
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,460
Fake is a trick.

498
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:08,460
I'm sure it's the right thing to do.

499
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,460
Again,

500
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,460
L.O.V.E. L.O.V.E. L.O.V.E.

501
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,460
I'm laughing.

502
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,460
I'm the one who's lying.

503
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,460
I'm the one who's lying.

504
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:19,460
I'm not scared of anything.

505
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,460
But

506
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,460
L.O.V.E. L.O.V.E. L.O.V.E.

507
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,460
I have to believe in that.

508
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:30,460
It's like something important is being fixed.

509
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,460
I'm lost.

510
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,460
L.O.V.E. L.O.V.E. L.O.V.E.

511
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,460
L.O.V.E. L.O.V.E.

512
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,460
I'm lost.

513
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,460
L.O.V.E. L.O.V.E. L.O.V.E.
