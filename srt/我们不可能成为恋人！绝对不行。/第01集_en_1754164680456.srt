1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry. It seems that I've fallen in love with you as a woman.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Oh no.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This is bad.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I made a mistake with the signal I made earlier.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I made a strange sound.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What should I do?

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
What should I do to get it back?

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The drama we did yesterday...

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Drama?

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I don't watch dramas much.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
But I have to say something.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It's a video.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It's a video.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
A video?

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Then I'll search for it.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
That lunch box is really handmade.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The topic has changed again.

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Well, lunch box...

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Oh, wait a minute.

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Oh, lunch box!

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
What?

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
What's wrong?

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Rena?

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry. I'm a little...

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'll say it's a little urgent.

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'll say it's a little urgent.

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Everyone, eat it.

28
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm sorry. I'll do it later.

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I can live again.

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I can't do it all the time.

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
No matter how hard I try, I'm a commission employee.

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
When I was in middle school, I was a little naughty and naughty with my friends.

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But one day, when I was in elementary school, everyone was in love and youthful and glittering.

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I was anxious.

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Huh? I'm not a fool?

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And I woke up.

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I searched for the real-life youkya and practiced how to talk and smile.

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I passed the school of science, which I didn't know, aiming for the start of my life.

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I got a job from a younger sister who was like a youkya representative.

40
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
My mom was relieved.

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And I was motivated to get used to the class and aim for the real-life youkya.

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I had a fateful encounter.

43
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Mai Ozuka.

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
My mom is a famous fashion designer.

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
She's a professional model and a senior high school student.

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I got a full-fledged super-darling.

47
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
In short, a super-darling.

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Nice to meet you.

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
My name is Amori Renako.

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Um, can I be your friend?

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Of course.

52
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Thank you for talking to me.

53
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Nice to meet you, Renako.

54
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I was able to join the Ozuka group, but I was still a child of Akiru in the group of white-chip.

55
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I was about to reach my limit.

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The other four were very cute, smart, and good at reading the post.

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Human power, level 75.

58
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I was 35 years old.

59
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I tried my best not to make mistakes and made a smile.

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I couldn't be a youkya for two months after I got married.

61
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I was so hot-headed like a dead smartphone.

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I was already out of control.

63
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
What a nice breeze.

64
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm free now.

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Renako...

67
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I can't go.

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm going to fall.

69
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I won't let you.

70
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Ozuka!

71
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's okay, Renako.

72
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What's wrong with you?

73
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm lucky.

74
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It's the most useless life in the game.

75
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
She's alive.

76
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You're saved.

77
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's nothing.

78
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
My voice is shaking.

79
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I didn't know that Ozuka had that kind of thing.

80
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm sorry.

81
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I was right to follow you.

82
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I was saved.

83
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I didn't mean to jump off.

84
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Why did you get on the waves?

85
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I was trying to control my freedom.

86
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You were trying to control your freedom?

87
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
But you actually...

88
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Ozuka was in a rush.

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I was surprised and I broke the balance.

90
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I see.

91
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So you were dying because of me.

92
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm glad you were worried.

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm so sorry.

94
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm sorry.

95
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Don't be sad.

96
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's not that you're sorry.

97
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's not my fault.

98
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I was on the roof.

99
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm not good at talking to people.

100
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You're not good at talking?

101
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You're always energetic and cheerful.

102
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm using magic points every time I talk.

103
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Magic points?

104
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm not good at talking.

105
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I can't talk to people.

106
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm scared of people.

107
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I talk to people and steal people's turns.

108
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm not focused at all.

109
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm not focused at all.

110
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I can't sleep because I'm worried about people.

111
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm not focused at all.

112
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm tired and I ran to the roof.

113
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm trying to save my time.

114
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I was forcing you.

115
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You're enjoying the conversation with me.

116
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I didn't think you were that busy.

117
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I like talking.

118
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I have to work hard.

119
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I enjoy it.

120
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
But I can't do it like everyone else.

121
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I see.

122
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm sure you're embarrassed to say you understand how you feel.

123
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
But I sometimes feel the same way.

124
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm a great Maeda, as you can see.

125
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'm blessed by the environment and I'm trying to do my best.

126
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I mean it.

127
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I feel good when everyone is comfortable with me.

128
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
But sometimes I feel like this.

129
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I wonder if everyone is looking at me for real.

130
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I suddenly feel lonely.

131
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Ozuka-san?

132
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I may just be acting as the Ozuka Mai I'm wanted.

133
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm sorry.

134
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I don't understand why Ozuka Mai, who always aims for perfection, is like this.

135
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
No, it's like I'm in a 12-second period.

136
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'm the real me.

137
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
This may be the first time I've heard you cry.

138
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Of course, I've never told anyone.

139
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Are you disappointed?

140
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
No, not at all.

141
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I thought I had to work harder if you were always working hard, even when you were fighting with anxiety.

142
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I honestly thought so.

143
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
But it's natural to get tired if you work hard every day.

144
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I can accept any failure you make.

145
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It's impossible to not be forgiven for one failure.

146
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's okay.

147
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Even if you take a break sometimes.

148
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
This is the word I wanted someone to say.

149
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Ozuka-san?

150
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I wonder what it is.

151
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm really happy.

152
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm glad I met you.

153
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
What?

154
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
No, I want a friend too.

155
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Let's be friends, Renako.

156
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
A real friend.

157
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Let's be friends, Ozuka-san.

158
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
No, Mai.

159
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Oh, right.

160
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
The key to the rooftop.

161
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I became friends with Mai, so the teacher trusted me and lent me the key.

162
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Call me anytime.

163
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Let's go take a break.

164
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's a secret between the two of you.

165
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Renako-chan, are you okay?

166
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You were so fast in the classroom.

167
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
No, I was a little weird earlier.

168
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You look better now.

169
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You said that so you wouldn't worry about others, right?

170
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Huh?

171
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Right?

172
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Yeah.

173
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
What is this friend?

174
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
So cool.

175
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Mai is very popular among all the kids.

176
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
That's my secret friend.

177
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I wish I could be her best friend someday.

178
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I wish I could be her best friend someday.

179
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I was thinking that.

180
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm on the rooftop the next day.

181
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm sorry.

182
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It seems that I've fallen in love with you as a woman.

183
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Huh?

184
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Wait, wait.

185
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Where's my friend?

186
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Where did my friend go?

187
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
No, no, no.

188
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's impossible.

189
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Impossible.

190
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Why is it impossible?

191
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You don't have a crush on anyone else, do you?

192
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
That's right.

193
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Isn't it too early to fall in love?

194
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
We talked about it yesterday.

195
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
That's right.

196
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You accepted my weakness for the first time, didn't you?

197
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
When I think of your face when I get home, my heart beats fast.

198
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
That was a very shocking event in my life.

199
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
When I realized that, I realized that I like you.

200
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
That's a big deal.

201
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
If I was depressed, everyone would have comforted me.

202
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
But it was you.

203
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You were the one who was in front of me at that moment.

204
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It's not like that.

205
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's too much to confess to me just once.

206
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You're embarrassed, aren't you?

207
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You're both in love, aren't you?

208
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
No, I'm not.

209
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I like you as a friend.

210
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
That's a misunderstanding, Renaka.

211
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You like me as a lover.

212
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You're so confident in your uselessness.

213
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You're so annoying when you're with your enemies.

214
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Are you being stubborn because I'm a woman?

215
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
That's...

216
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Mai is cool, so there are a lot of girls who like both of them.

217
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Anyway, it doesn't matter if I like it or not.

218
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You don't seem to have any role.

219
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
No, I can't.

220
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I want a friend.

221
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I want a close friend who can enjoy school life with me.

222
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Is that not a lover?

223
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
No!

224
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'll be honest with you now.

225
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I don't know about lovers in general, but I get anxious and cold.

226
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
If we break up, we'll be in a bad mood and separate into groups.

227
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I don't want that kind of unstable relationship.

228
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It's the first time in my life that I've been rejected so strongly.

229
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Wait, wait.

230
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm not saying I don't like Mai.

231
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I just want to get along with her.

232
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I see.

233
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Then can I propose a relationship proposal?

234
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
A relationship proposal?

235
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
What an answer.

236
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
One day you're a best friend, one day you're a lover.

237
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
How about trying it out one after another?

238
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
We'll decide which one of us is better for you, lover or best friend.

239
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Lover or best friend...

240
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
On the day of the lover, I'll show you the beauty of a lover.

241
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
If it's impossible, I'll just stay still.

242
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I wasn't attractive enough to reject you.

243
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
On the day of best friend, it's the other way around.

244
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,000
On the other hand, it's better to make the other person think that we're more related.

245
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
The period is a month.

246
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
In other words, it's a month and a half.

247
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Even if I don't accept the relationship of a lover...

248
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
No, I won't give up.

249
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I've decided to change, so I've come this far.

250
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I won't go back to being a coward again.

251
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I'll win.

252
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
The best hidden skill!

253
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
One, two, three!

254
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I thought you were all right.

255
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Anyway, this is how the previous battle ended.

256
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
The third day of the battle.

257
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
The day is best friend or lover.

258
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It was decided by the previous hairstyle.

259
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
If you're tying your hair, it's best friend.

260
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
If you're downing it, it's your lover.

261
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Stop tying your hair!

262
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Why are you downing it for three days in a row?

263
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I'm straight without any sleep habits.

264
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It's a waste if I don't put it down.

265
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
This doesn't make it a game!

266
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You were a friend for two months.

267
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
If you don't have a little bit of a lover day, you can't have a long date.

268
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Hey, this is school!

269
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
What if someone sees us?

270
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I don't mind.

271
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
By the way, do you like me that much?

272
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Yeah, I like you.

273
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
This guy...

274
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Seriously, this guy...

275
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Golden Retriever's scent!

276
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
What's so good about me?

277
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I don't understand at all.

278
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I see.

279
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You made me think you were not confident, and you tried to pull out the words of love from me.

280
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
No, I'm 100% serious!

281
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Don't say that like you're caring about people!

282
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm always like that!

283
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Huh?

284
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You always look so confident and do whatever you want!

285
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
If you push me a little harder, I'll fall down right away.

286
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It's a big mistake!

287
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I have to push hard!

288
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I'm the one who's trying to keep everyone's face color from being noticeable, and I can't win against that!

289
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I see.

290
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
But even if you say so,

291
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I've become what I want to be.

292
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I won't give up, so you give up.

293
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I want to destroy what I thought before.

294
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You're pretty reckless.

295
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Do you say that to your favorite girl?

296
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Probably.

297
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Oh, you're not going to date?

298
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
No, I want to fall in love with her more.

299
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Why?

300
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It's really fun to have something that doesn't go as you want.

301
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Please scold me a lot from now on, Renako.

302
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Don't do anything that will make me scold you!

303
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Welcome back.

304
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I have a question for you, Renako.

305
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
You're rich, but you look like a fool, and you're poor, but you're handsome.

306
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Which one would you like to date?

307
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Honestly, it doesn't really matter if you're rich or poor.

308
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
There's always someone who's kind and caring.

309
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I'm sure people who date Ajisai would be happy.

310
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
What?

311
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Even if you're suddenly praised, you only smile.

312
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Cute angel.

313
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,000
If Ajisai had confessed to me, I might have been a little more worried.

314
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Hey, hey, listen!

315
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:20,220
Mai said she went to the hotel's

316
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'll win the next test again if you work so hard.

317
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You...

318
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
You...

319
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
What about you, Rena?

320
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I...

321
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Of course I'll go with you!

322
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I can't say no to being invited to play with people.

323
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I have to do that so I don't repeat my mistakes in the past.

324
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Hm?

325
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I'd like to go with everyone, but I have to study.

326
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I have an appointment today, so I'll go shopping next time.

327
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
He gave me a life jacket.

328
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Because he's my boyfriend.

329
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
No, even if he's my best friend...

330
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Anyway, he might be cool.

331
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
It's okay if you go home and study.

332
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Tomorrow is the short test.

333
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
You can do it too, Satsuki.

334
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Even if you can't beat me in the future, you're doing a great job.

335
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Why am I getting along with this guy?

336
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Well, well, you're a childhood friend from elementary school.

337
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Yeah, I've been like this for a long time.

338
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Then let's just say we're leaving today.

339
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Did something happen between Mai and Rena recently?

340
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
What? No, no, no, no!

341
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
That's a bad way to deny it.

342
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Sorry.

343
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I was teased!

344
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
That's what I'm talking about!

345
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
You're so arrogant!

346
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Arrogant?

347
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
You're in trouble, aren't you?

348
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
You don't understand Mai.

349
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Because I'm Mai's boss!

350
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'm going to do it too!

351
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I'm the one who's just good-looking.

352
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I see.

353
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Only Satsuki understands Mai's true nature.

354
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
But you're not wrong about that.

355
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Recently, Rena is my boss.

356
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Why?

357
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Okay, okay, okay.

358
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Rena, you're too young.

359
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Why does she like me?

360
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Isn't it just a prank by the mercenaries?

361
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Or is Mai doing something?

362
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
She's doing something!

363
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
What is it?

364
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It's obvious in this situation!

365
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
What promise do you have?

366
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I didn't say it was a promise to play with me!

367
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
That's right. Thank you for coming.

368
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
You brought me here for no reason!

369
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
You said it was okay if it was a cafe.

370
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Where is the cafe in the red-sacred luxury hotel's staff pool?

371
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
This rose hip tea is very tasty.

372
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
It's only 2,000 yen per cup.

373
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I didn't write the price.

374
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
The staff here are not affected at all.

375
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I made your membership card, so you can visit it alone.

376
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
You're so mean!

377
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I thought, why are you changing clothes?

378
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
If it's this style, I can't help it.

379
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
How is it?

380
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Would you like to swim with me?

381
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I came to the cafe.

382
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I can't swim, can I?

383
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Don't you think a cafe with a pool is more important than a cafe?

384
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Stop thinking like a cheese hamburger curry!

385
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
You're wearing such a great swimsuit.

386
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
You can't throw me away.

387
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Well, I didn't want to swim, but...

388
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
You're changing clothes and getting up.

389
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
If you want to get into the water, you have to put your hair together.

390
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Then the time of this date with you will melt like bubbles.

391
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
That's thorough.

392
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
So let's enjoy this moment for a while.

393
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
It's just you and me.

394
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Okay.

395
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
It's really calm here.

396
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
It's like a different world.

397
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Thank you.

398
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:35,680
What's with the

399
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
If you're happy, I'll be more than a lover.

400
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Yes, thank you.

401
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
You're just so good at it.

402
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
If I could dance more than now,

403
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I wonder if I could swim with you.

404
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
You don't really have to send me by car?

405
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I don't care.

406
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I'm sure I'll tie my hair tomorrow.

407
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
It's a good friend mode.

408
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Yeah, that's right.

409
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I had a lot of fun today.

410
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
No, I don't think so.

411
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I'm not the kind of girl who would kiss the third-day guy after dating.

412
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Wait, wait.

413
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Mai!

414
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
No way!

415
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Forcing is not a hobby.

416
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I'll let you go with this today.

417
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Renako is really cute.

418
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
No, I'm not.

419
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Lovers are so boring.

420
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I'm too conscious and nervous.

421
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It's not fun at all.

422
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Look at me, Mai.

423
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Next, I'll be the

424
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
one who makes my best friend laugh.

425
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I'm a little shy.

426
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I'm a little shy.

427
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I'm a little shy.

428
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I'm a little shy.

429
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I'm a little shy.

430
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I've been looking around lately.

431
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I've been aiming for that.

432
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I'm sure I'm going to get a good life.

433
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I just started.

434
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I'm a little shy.

435
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I'm a little shy.

436
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I'm a little shy.

437
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
But it's natural in front of you.

438
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Wait a minute.

439
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I want to go to the same world with you.

440
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I'm a big revolution.

441
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I can't do this.

442
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
It's too long to run away.

443
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
One day, I feel like I'm going to break through,

444
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
but I'm going to give up.

445
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I'm a little shy.

446
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I'm a little shy.

447
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I'm a little shy.

448
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I'm a little shy.

449
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I'm a little shy.

450
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I'm a little shy.

451
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I'm a little shy.

452
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I'm a little shy.

453
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I'm a little shy.

454
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I'm a little shy.

455
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I'm a little shy.

456
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I'm a little shy.

457
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I'm a little shy.

458
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I'm a little shy.

459
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I'm a little shy.

460
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I'm a little shy.

461
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I'm a little shy.

462
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I'm a little shy.

463
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I'm a little shy.

464
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I'm a little shy.

465
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I'm a little shy.
