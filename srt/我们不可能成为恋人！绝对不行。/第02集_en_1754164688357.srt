1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
If Mai is tying her hair, it's best friend mode. If not, it's best lover mode.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We promised each other.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Today, we finally tied our hair, so if we invite her to our house...

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This reaction...

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Why? It's normal to invite friends to our house.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm going to hit you today that you're better off than a lover.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Welcome to my house.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm going to hit you today that you're better off than a lover.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm going to hit you today that you're better off than a lover.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm going to hit you today that you're better off than a lover.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm going to hit you today that you're better off than a lover.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm going to hit you today that you're better off than a lover.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm going to hit you today that you're better off than a lover.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm going to hit you today that you're better off than a lover.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm going to hit you today that you're better off than a lover.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm going to hit you today that you're better off than a lover.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm going to hit you today that you're better off than a lover.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm going to hit you today that you're better off than a lover.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm going to hit you today that you're better off than a lover.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm going to hit you today that you're better off than a lover.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm going to hit you today that you're better off than a lover.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm going to hit you today that you're better off than a lover.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm going to hit you today that you're better off than a lover.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm going to hit you today that you're better off than a lover.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm going to hit you today that you're better off than a lover.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm going to hit you today that you're better off than a lover.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm going to hit you today that you're better off than a lover.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm going to hit you today that you're better off than a lover.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm going to hit you today that you're better off than a lover.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm going to hit you today that you're better off than a lover.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm going to hit you today that you're better off than a lover.

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
To the next episode

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
This is a room of a commoner with no weirdness.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Ah, sorry to bother you.

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Yeah, it's like...

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's very...

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It feels like a room in Renako's room.

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Tenka's spadari is nervous.

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
But I wonder if he's not being mischievous in a room like this.

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm going to cry if he does.

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So, I'm the one who likes to play games.

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I see, it's like Renako.

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I've never played games, but I'm interested.

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Can you show me how you're playing?

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Mai, you're a good guy!

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
If it's a good thing, let's play together.

47
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I wanted to play with you two.

48
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You've never done it before?

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
No, it's my first time calling a friend to my room.

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I see.

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm Renako's first partner.

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Don't you have any weird way of saying it?

53
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What!?

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's not that way, Mai.

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
There's a bullet here, so you can pick it up.

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I got it.

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Ah, zombies are coming from the right!

58
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Leave it to me.

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
All right, I got it!

60
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I did it, Renako!

61
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
This, this, this...

62
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
This is the peace I've been looking for.

63
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Mai's getting better and better, and it's getting a little frustrating.

64
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I can't believe it's got anything more to do with this!

65
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Freedom is the best!

66
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Mai, are you having fun?

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm having a lot of fun.

68
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I believed that you thought the same thing.

69
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
But...

70
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You didn't tie your hair!

71
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Is it okay to give your lover Mai at home?

72
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
But there's no reason to refuse.

73
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I wonder if it was a good thing.

74
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You're reading, Rena.

75
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I was going to study, but my friend invited me to play.

76
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I guess I'll play if I'm the one.

77
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I can study after I play.

78
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
That's right!

79
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Then let's play!

80
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Sounds good.

81
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What are you going to do?

82
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You know what?

83
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Um...

84
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm going to shoot the head of the zombie with a gun.

85
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The moment I hit it, the brain goes boom!

86
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It feels really good.

87
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm going to play with you.

88
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm going to play with you.

89
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It feels really good.

90
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's gross.

91
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You're so human that you can't be with such a good kid.

92
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I can't see it.

93
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I think there's a lot of dark.

94
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Rena?

95
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Well...

96
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm going to hang out at home.

97
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
What?

98
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
That sounds fun.

99
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
That's weird, but it's better than a brain shop.

100
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yeah, this should be fine.

101
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
The next day

102
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Um...

103
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
My friend...

104
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Nice to meet you.

105
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
My name is Mai Oozuka.

106
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Um...

107
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
My mother is a citizen of the same age as me.

108
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm sure you're the same age.

109
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I hope you'll be with Rena for a long time.

110
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yes, of course.

111
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Are you really your friend?

112
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Not the kind of person who came here as a ninja?

113
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Yes.

114
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm having a very good date with Rena.

115
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm glad you said that.

116
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm going to play games with Mai now, so don't come into my room.

117
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
What are you dating?

118
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You and I are definitely good friends as friends, but did you take it in a different way?

119
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's okay, but I just wanted to play games.

120
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Of course I did.

121
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You were wearing a cat to distract me the other day.

122
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
No, I was just nervous.

123
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Then you should be nervous again this time!

124
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I usually do what I've experienced once.

125
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Oh, really?

126
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
That's right.

127
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Why don't you play with this?

128
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Today, you and I are more suitable for a match than for a co-op play.

129
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I need to prove that I won the game before I even became friends.

130
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I want to make you say that I lost once.

131
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Okay, let's do it.

132
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Then why don't you ask me for a favor if you lose?

133
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I've raised the bet!

134
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
That's impossible!

135
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Okay, let's do it.

136
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Then it's better to play three times.

137
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You're really good at it.

138
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,680
I'm sorry, but my game history is not a

139
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,000
bad luck.

140
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'm not as good as I can win by luck.

141
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Okay, let's go!

142
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You're kidding me.

143
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I won.

144
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You said you were going to play games the other day!

145
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I bought a game machine and practiced instead.

146
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
How was it?

147
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Were you surprised?

148
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I was embarrassed.

149
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm sorry for your talent.

150
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I didn't have time.

151
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I've been practicing only strong actions and combos.

152
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Damn it, Miss Perfect!

153
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm going to use the school cast!

154
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So you're going to ask me for one favor, right?

155
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I can't ask you too much.

156
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
My mom is downstairs.

157
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Of course.

158
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
What are you doing now?

159
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I want to have the feeling of being a weak place at any time.

160
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I don't have it!

161
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
What do you want to do by asking me for a favor?

162
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I see.

163
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
There are infinite possibilities.

164
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
But I'm not sure.

165
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's too normal and suspicious.

166
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I knew it.

167
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm not good enough.

168
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Then I'll ask you for a more exciting favor.

169
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
For example, your boobs.

170
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I like your boobs!

171
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I like this!

172
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I see.

173
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Then, Renako.

174
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Hey.

175
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I like your face.

176
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Then I'll excuse myself.

177
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Okay.

178
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
What's this?

179
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
This is bad.

180
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Renako.

181
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I like you.

182
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I know.

183
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
That's...

184
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I love you, Renako.

185
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I want to be like this forever.

186
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Isn't it too long?

187
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Gyu...

188
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Why is that Oozuka Mai doing this?

189
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Um, Mai...

190
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
What?

191
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Does Mai really like me?

192
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's too late!

193
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I've always wanted to be loved by people.

194
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
But I'm not special in my life.

195
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I can't do anything special.

196
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
My friends are not natural.

197
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
They work hard to make things.

198
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Even if someone gives me a special favor,

199
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I can't swallow that lump.

200
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You've been so pale since morning.

201
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Yeah.

202
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Well, a little.

203
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's so cold.

204
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
They say that when the end of the cold is cold, you think of bad things.

205
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Does AjiSai-san like me too?

206
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
No, I'm not a body type.

207
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
AjiSai-san is not only mine.

208
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I want to go out with you, but I'm afraid that you'll refuse.

209
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's getting colder again.

210
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

211
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Okay, see you later.

212
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's different from the usual.

213
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
That's why I don't like love.

214
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm being too much.

215
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I want you to sort it out.

216
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Sort it out?

217
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
What do you want from your lover?

218
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'll write down what I want to do when I become a best friend.

219
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You try it too.

220
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Yeah, but I can't write it all down with this one piece of paper.

221
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I want a representative one!

222
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I want to write it down.

223
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I want to write it down.

224
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I want to write it down.

225
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I want to write it down.

226
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Are you ready?

227
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Then, ready, set, go!

228
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'll pat your head, hold your hand, kiss you, and go to the bathroom together.

229
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'll wash your body, wash your hair, and...

230
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
What's with you?

231
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You've been washing your body since the beginning?

232
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
If I were to tell you an objective fact that doesn't mix with time,

233
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I wouldn't choose you if it was for my body.

234
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
That would hurt!

235
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I have an F!

236
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I want to touch the person I've become a lover with.

237
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Of course, I want to be connected to their bodies.

238
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Was it that unexpected?

239
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I thought it was a kind of pleasure to want to be with a woman.

240
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Oh?

241
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It's like, I'm a woman because I'm tired of men.

242
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Well, you're living a luxurious life.

243
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:10,000
So, I was touched by the feeling of love, and I was quite touched.

244
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I don't know what love is anymore.

245
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Can I have your hand?

246
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Why?

247
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It's not just my hand, it's connected to my heart.

248
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I want to touch the person I love.

249
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Because the relationship that includes physical contact is my lover.

250
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm prepared to be more than a kiss with you.

251
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You can't do that with a woman!

252
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
If you want to know how to do it, let's talk about it all night.

253
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I don't have a best friend!

254
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
By the way, he was a model and rich on a post-dating post!

255
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I'm sure he'll be very happy about that!

256
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Then let's go out this weekend.

257
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Not on a date, but as a best friend.

258
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It's your request. Of course I won't refuse.

259
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I'll let you know before you go out next time.

260
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
What I want is not a difficult bomb to handle with a lover.

261
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It's the best friend that can support each other when they're in pain or sad.

262
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Thank you for coming all the way here today.

263
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I've been on a schedule, so let's have a lot of fun.

264
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

265
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's kind of strange.

266
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm the only one who's wearing a very popular dance in school right now.

267
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
What's wrong, Renako?

268
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Are you happy to go out with me that much?

269
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Yeah, that might be true.

270
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I see. Well, it's an honor.

271
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You can change the dance a lot.

272
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Yeah, if you're a model, you can call out to a lot of people.

273
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
So I don't go out to places that are too crowded.

274
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It's hard to be a celebrity with a good face.

275
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Hey, that blonde girl.

276
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
What's wrong, Renako?

277
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'll protect you today.

278
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Protect me?

279
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Yeah, leave it to me.

280
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It's okay. I think I'll do it when I do it.

281
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
No, that's not what I meant.

282
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Yeah, then let's enjoy the heroine mood today.

283
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Not heroine, but friend, best friend?

284
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Oh, well, I'll forgive you because this is within the range of best friends.

285
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Then let's go to today's main event.

286
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
What's that?

287
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
VR attraction!

288
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It's a two-hour limit, so I'm going to go hard.

289
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Wow, this is pretty...

290
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
All right, can you keep up with me, Mai?

291
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm going to lose.

292
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm tired.

293
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I laugh too much that my cheeks hurt.

294
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:31,000
But I bought a VR device at my house, so I don't think I can experience today's fun.

295
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It's fun to have a certain amount of freedom and time limits, and to have friends to go out with.

296
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Yeah, you know that, Mai!

297
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
But then you don't mind being a lover, do you?

298
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I don't know.

299
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You're being careful with your lover.

300
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You don't want to be looked at or hated, you want to be loved more.

301
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I've never had a lover.

302
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
That's why best friends are the most important.

303
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
If we were lovers, we wouldn't have had such a fun time.

304
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
That's right.

305
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
That might be true.

306
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
All right, let's go shopping next.

307
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'll make you have more fun.

308
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Best friends are...

309
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I see.

310
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I see.

311
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
What kind of friend are you?

312
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Huh?

313
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
No, it's nothing.

314
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Wait!

315
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I could've taken the train if I'd been 5 minutes off!

316
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Are you all right, Mai?

317
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It's so cold.

318
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Oh, no!

319
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Let's go to the corner, Irari-chan.

320
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Sorry, but can I have a little call?

321
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Huh?

322
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Yeah, sure.

323
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Oh, Mama.

324
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
A little call?

325
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Do you want to go out with me?

326
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Sure, but where?

327
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
At the hotel.

328
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Huh?

329
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Why am I here with you?

330
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You should be the one to return your wet-ass best friend.

331
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Here, this is for you.

332
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Huh?

333
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Take it off.

334
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Oh, no.

335
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,180
I'll ask the

336
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:25,000
Beldesk to dry it.

337
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'm a best friend now.

338
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Look, your face is getting redder and redder.

339
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
No, that's not the reason.

340
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,000
And it's really hard to take it off in front of a friend or a girlfriend.

341
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
What?

342
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Nothing.

343
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
No, it's the cute pink undercoat.

344
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Huh?

345
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It's 2000 yen for the sale.

346
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
No one's asking about the price.

347
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Now, it's time for you to go.

348
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Oh, then, Ozuka-san, you go first.

349
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Don't be stupid.

350
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Do you think I can be the only one who can stay with a best friend?

351
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Let's go in together.

352
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Together?

353
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Together with Mai?

354
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It's strange to be conscious of a best friend.

355
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
It's strange, so this is a emotional bug.

356
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I'm sorry.

357
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I suddenly invited you to the hotel.

358
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
That's why I said it like that.

359
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Mai is always the one who's forced to do it.

360
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I can't help but break my physical condition.

361
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Next week, I'm going abroad to help my mother with her work.

362
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,000
There are so many beautiful models in the world, but I need myself more than ever.

363
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I'm going to France after school.

364
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
France?

365
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I'm blessed with the environment.

366
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It's natural to respond to your mother's requests.

367
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Mai is having a hard time, too.

368
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
What?

369
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Oh, no.

370
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Oh, no. I made a wrong reaction.

371
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Why did you think that?

372
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,000
No, I mean, I told you to see the real me before.

373
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It's hard to respond to people's expectations.

374
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I'm not even being answered to my expectations.

375
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I remember.

376
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I like that about you.

377
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I see.

378
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
But no one's ever done this.

379
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
No one has.

380
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I've been quiet since I was born.

381
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I've been envied by everyone.

382
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
It was best for anyone to behave like a princess.

383
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I've been thinking about myself again.

384
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
That's amazing.

385
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Mai is really amazing.

386
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Don't worry.

387
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I'll know that you're a real person who's full of lust even if someone else is holding a fantasy.

388
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
You're the only one who says that about me.

389
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I'm your best friend.

390
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Only this person can understand me.

391
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
You're always with me when I'm in trouble.

392
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
That's my ideal best friend.

393
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
That's your best friend?

394
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
That's right.

395
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I've never been with you before, but I want to be your best friend.

396
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
That's amazing.

397
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Right?

398
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Best friend is the best.

399
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I want to be your best friend.

400
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:35,000
But if you ask me, that relationship is what you should call a lover.

401
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
What?

402
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I understand you well.

403
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
We have fun and have fun together when we're having a hard time.

404
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Is there a difference?

405
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
But...

406
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Well...

407
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Of course, there are big differences between best friends and lovers.

408
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
What?

409
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Suddenly?

410
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Today is a good day, right?

411
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
It's natural to wash your hair after taking a bath, right?

412
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
What's with this hand?

413
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Why are you pushing me into the bathtub?

414
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Wait...

415
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I can't touch it.

416
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
You're a cute little dog.

417
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Let go of me.

418
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Let go.

419
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Wait!

420
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
It's my first time getting a kiss.

421
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Me too.

422
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
It's a good thing to have a kiss with your destiny.

423
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I'm satisfied.

424
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I'm not satisfied!

425
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Mai's feet are touching the water.

426
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
No!

427
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
If this continues, my everything will be dyed in Mai's color.

428
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I will be able to achieve a love list from the top.

429
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
If this continues...

430
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Menaka.

431
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I have no idea.

432
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
What?

433
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Because...

434
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I'm a best friend.

435
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
You're still a baby.

436
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I sometimes hear friends kissing each other.

437
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I'm satisfied.

438
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I see.

439
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Yeah, that's why I'm saying...

440
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Then...

441
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I'm satisfied.

442
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
You're satisfied because you kissed your friend.

443
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Yeah.

444
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I love you, Renako.

445
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
What are you saying to your friend?

446
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
You said you wouldn't force yourself.

447
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:43,000
If I had done it a week ago, I would have forced myself.

448
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
But this time, it wasn't like that, right?

449
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Oh...

450
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Ah...

451
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
That's not true.

452
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I don't like it.

453
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
All the fun memories of best friends are replaced.

454
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It's all like a bonus to a kiss.

455
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
It's frustrating.

456
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:10,000
That day, I spent a night that I couldn't sleep because I was so excited.

457
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I'm sorry.

458
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I'm sorry.

459
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I'm sorry.

460
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I'm sorry.

461
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I'm sorry.

462
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I'm sorry.

463
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I'm sorry.

464
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I'm sorry.

465
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I'm sorry.

466
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I'm sorry.

467
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I'm sorry.

468
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I'm sorry.

469
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I'm sorry.

470
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I'm sorry.

471
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I'm sorry.

472
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I'm sorry.

473
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I'm sorry.

474
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I'm sorry.

475
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I'm sorry.

476
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I'm sorry.

477
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I'm sorry.

478
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I'm sorry.

479
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I'm sorry.

480
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I'm sorry.

481
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I'm sorry.

482
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I'm sorry.

483
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I'm sorry.

484
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I'm sorry.

485
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I'm sorry.

486
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I'm sorry.

487
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I'm sorry.

488
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I'm sorry.

489
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I'm sorry.

490
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I'm sorry.

491
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I'm sorry.

492
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I'm sorry.

493
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I'm sorry.

494
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I'm sorry.

495
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I'm sorry.

496
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I'm sorry.

497
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I'm sorry.

498
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I'm sorry.

499
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I'm sorry.

500
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I'm sorry.

501
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I'm sorry.

502
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I'm sorry.

503
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I'm sorry.

504
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I'm sorry.

505
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I'm sorry.

506
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I'm sorry.

507
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I'm sorry.

508
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I'm sorry.

509
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I'm sorry.

510
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I'm sorry.

511
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I'm sorry.

512
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I'm sorry.

513
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I'm sorry.

514
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I'm sorry.

515
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I'm sorry.

516
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I'm sorry.

517
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I'm sorry.

518
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I'm sorry.

519
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I'm sorry.

520
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I'm sorry.

521
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I'm sorry.

522
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I'm sorry.

523
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I'm sorry.

524
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I'm sorry.

525
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I'm sorry.

526
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I'm sorry.

527
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I'm sorry.

528
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I'm sorry.

529
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I'm sorry.

530
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I'm sorry.

531
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I'm sorry.

532
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I'm sorry.

533
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I'm sorry.

534
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I'm sorry.

535
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I'm sorry.

536
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I'm sorry.

537
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I'm sorry.

538
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I'm sorry.

539
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I'm sorry.

540
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I'm sorry.

541
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I'm sorry.

542
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
