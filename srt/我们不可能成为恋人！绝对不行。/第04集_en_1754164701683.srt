00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Chapter 3

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,400
I thought I could just let it flow for a moment.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,200
Maybe I should talk to Mai...

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,800
No, I mean...

5
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,000
Onee-chan?

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,800
Onee-chan, is that the kind of relationship you have with Ozuka?

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,100
That's right. It's exactly as you see.

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,100
I see...

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,100
Wow! That's amazing!

10
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,800
Why me and Ozuka? I want to know!

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,100
Onee-chan was tricked by a guy who's not even good at rock.

12
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,400
I thought I could make a terrible big brother.

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,100
But he's turning into onee-san. That's the opposite of being a home run!

14
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,800
That's not true!

15
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,100
People are people, and people are people.

16
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,600
They're more than two people.

17
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,100
Even if you stare at them, they won't do anything.

18
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,100
Welcome to the palace.

19
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,100
I've been looking around lately.

20
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,100
I've been aiming for that.

21
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,100
That's right. I'm going to grab the life of a true evolutionist.

22
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,100
And now it suddenly started!

23
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,100
I'm going to get a lot of money.

24
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,100
I'm going to get a lot of money.

25
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,100
I'm going to get a lot of money.

26
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,100
I'm going to get a lot of money.

27
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,100
I'm going to get a lot of money.

28
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,100
I'm going to get a lot of money.

29
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,100
I'm going to get a lot of money.

30
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,100
I'm going to get a lot of money.

31
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,100
I'm going to get a lot of money.

32
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,100
I'm going to get a lot of money.

33
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,100
I'm going to get a lot of money.

34
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,100
I'm going to get a lot of money.

35
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,100
I'm going to get a lot of money.

36
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,100
I'm going to get a lot of money.

37
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,100
The feeling of being encouraged by the sun is growing.

38
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,100
I'm going to get a lot of money.

39
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,100
I'm going to get a lot of money.

40
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,100
I'm going to get a lot of money.

41
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,100
I'm going to get a lot of money.

42
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,100
I'm going to get a lot of money.

43
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,100
I'm going to get a lot of money.

44
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,100
I'm going to get a lot of money.

45
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,100
I'm going to get a lot of money.

46
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,100
I'm going to get a lot of money.

47
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,100
I'm going to get a lot of money.

48
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,100
I'm going to get a lot of money.

49
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,100
I'm going to get a lot of money.

50
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,100
I'm going to get a lot of money.

51
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,100
What should I do?

52
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,100
It's hard to make eye contact.

53
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,100
I thought so, but Mai was on a break.

54
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,100
Is she still busy with work?

55
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,100
Let's eat!

56
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,100
Did something good happen?

57
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,100
Do you know?

58
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,100
Actually, it's after school.

59
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,100
Mai?

60
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,100
What?

61
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,100
It's still a secret, isn't it?

62
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:47,100
Can we get back to a good relationship like this?

63
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,100
Can we get back to a good relationship like this?

64
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,100
With Mai?

65
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,100
What kind of relationship is Mai in?

66
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,100
Is she a group friend?

67
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,100
Or is she a friend?

68
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,100
Or is she a friend?

69
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,100
Hey, Amaori.

70
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,100
Can you go out with me after school?

71
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,100
I have something to talk to you about.

72
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,100
What?

73
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,100
I'll be waiting.

74
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,100
I'll be waiting.

75
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,100
What does Satsuki know about the roof?

76
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,100
Huh?

77
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:24,100
I thought Mai and I were the only ones who had the key.

78
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,100
It's simple.

79
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,100
You can make any key you want.

80
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:32,100
Satsuki, why are you on the roof?

81
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,100
It's a friend-lover game.

82
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,100
Pool cafe.

83
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,100
Um...

84
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,100
Odaiba Plaza.

85
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,100
Staying in a hotel.

86
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,100
How do you know?

87
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,100
I don't know.

88
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,100
Why do you think?

89
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:52,100
Ousaka Mai came over yesterday and talked about everything.

90
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,100
Everything?

91
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,100
She was crying.

92
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,100
Mai cries?

93
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,100
She cries.

94
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,100
Thanks to her, I'm not sleepy enough.

95
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,100
Everything?

96
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,100
It's not like we're a girl group.

97
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,100
I don't have any prejudice.

98
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,100
That's not the problem!

99
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,100
No, it's not!

100
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,100
I can't get over it.

101
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,100
I guess so.

102
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,100
Huh?

103
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:22,100
She said she hurt you.

104
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,100
Mai?

105
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:33,100
I was wondering why she called you Amaori.

106
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,100
Amaori is plain, always showing off her face,

107
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:43,100
and her grades, athleticism, and her face are all bad.

108
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,100
I know.

109
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,100
You must have been thinking that.

110
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,100
You're with Mai, so I'm treating you like a friend,

111
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,100
but you don't accept it.

112
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,100
I thought the same.

113
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,100
You never get along with Mai.

114
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,100
You're right.

115
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,100
Huh?

116
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,100
You'll understand.

117
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,100
Amaori is just showing off her body,

118
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,100
or rather, she's just like a turtle.

119
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,100
Um...

120
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,100
I don't like it.

121
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,100
That Mai is with me.

122
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,100
What do you mean?

123
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,100
I don't care.

124
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,100
I'm not going to hurt her.

125
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,100
I'm not going to hurt her.

126
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,100
Amaori can't do that.

127
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,100
She's not a good person.

128
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,100
You know me well.

129
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,100
You're the type to say things like human observation.

130
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,100
I won't.

131
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,100
Don't read my mind! It's scary!

132
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,100
Are you angry?

133
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,100
I'm angry.

134
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,100
I was forced to sleep and study at a stupid place.

135
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,100
Is this a good way to vent your anger?

136
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,100
Half of it.

137
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,100
You know what I mean.

138
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,100
But...

139
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,100
I feel like Satsuki is getting closer to me.

140
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:01,100
Maybe we feel the same way about Mai.

141
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,100
I'm sure she's not my enemy.

142
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,100
Then...

143
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,100
Satsuki!

144
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,100
I'm sorry!

145
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,100
I'm sorry.

146
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,100
What are you apologizing for?

147
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,100
I hurt a friend you care about.

148
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,100
I want to get along with Mai.

149
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,100
I see.

150
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,100
So can you tell me where to go?

151
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,100
Amaori, you've changed.

152
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,100
I-I have?

153
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:30,100
You're getting closer to Mai because you want to.

154
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,100
I don't like it.

155
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,100
Don't worry.

156
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,100
I'm always in the air when I'm with a group.

157
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,100
I was crying when I talked to you.

158
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,100
I thought the group was over.

159
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:48,100
You called me out for Mai because of your selfishness.

160
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,100
You like Mai a lot!

161
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,100
I'm sorry.

162
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,100
I don't know where he is.

163
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,100
But I know what he's trying to do.

164
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,100
He said he'd come after the conversation.

165
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,100
He said he'd hug me.

166
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,100
What?

167
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,100
He hurt me.

168
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,100
He wants to know how it feels to be hugged by someone he doesn't like.

169
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,100
So, Satsuki, hug me.

170
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,100
Because you like me.

171
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,100
And then?

172
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,100
I've been bullied so many times,

173
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:31,100
but this is the first time I've been made a fool of.

174
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,100
I started this morning at 5.30.

175
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,100
You're working hard.

176
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,100
That means Mai is...

177
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,100
Yes.

178
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,100
That's right.

179
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,100
You're looking for someone to hug you.

180
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:47,100
Why didn't you stop me?

181
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,100
If that idiot is that stupid,

182
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,100
he can't help it anymore.

183
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,100
If you're so selfish that you don't even listen to your friends,

184
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:01,100
you should try to get to the bottom of it.

185
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,100
You won't get a call or reply to messages.

186
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,100
Satsuki...

187
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:11,100
Satsuki called me out half out of anger.

188
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,100
What about the other half?

189
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,100
Satsuki,

190
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:20,100
I'm the one who stopped Mai for my own sake.

191
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,100
That's right.

192
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,100
But is it okay?

193
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,100
Didn't you get hurt by him?

194
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,100
That's...

195
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,100
But we're friends.

196
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,100
You get hurt and get hurt, right?

197
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,100
He's selfish.

198
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,100
He won't listen to anyone.

199
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,100
I'll stop him if you do that again.

200
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,100
I see.

201
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,100
Then it might be okay.

202
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,100
Amaori.

203
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,100
Yes?

204
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,100
Take care of that idiot.

205
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:03,100
Tell him that she's not a great woman like he thinks.

206
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,100
Yes, I'll tell him.

207
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,100
Thank you.

208
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,100
He looks so young.

209
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,100
But where is Mai?

210
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,100
He's not in my heart at all.

211
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,100
Welcome home, Rena.

212
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,100
Oh, yeah.

213
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,100
What's wrong?

214
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,100
I left your bag.

215
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,100
You waited for me?

216
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,100
Yeah. How are you today?

217
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,100
What?

218
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,100
Do you want to come over?

219
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,100
No.

220
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,100
I'm sorry, Ajisai.

221
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,100
What about today?

222
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,100
Did you have something to do?

223
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,100
Oh no, I have to say no.

224
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,100
My stomach hurts.

225
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,100
I'm the only one who can stop Mai.

226
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,100
But I can't refuse someone's invitation.

227
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:54,100
If I refuse, I'll be left all alone again.

228
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,100
I can't get over this trauma.

229
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,100
I want to go, but...

230
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,100
Rena?

231
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,100
I want to fall down right now.

232
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,100
But then...

233
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,100
I feel like I'm in some kind of situation again.

234
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,100
I'm sorry.

235
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,100
Invite me again.

236
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,100
Are you crying, Rena?

237
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,100
I don't believe in people not refusing me.

238
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,100
You're not the type to make people your hub.

239
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,100
You have to tell me how you feel.

240
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,100
Listen.

241
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,100
I love you, Ajisai.

242
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,100
I love you so much!

243
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,100
What?

244
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,100
I want to play with you every day.

245
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,100
But I have something important to do today.

246
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,100
I'm sorry.

247
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,100
I'll definitely invite you.

248
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,100
Ajisai is my important person.

249
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,100
I've been teaching you.

250
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:48,100
I can move people's hearts without thinking about them.

251
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,100
I've always thought of you as cute.

252
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,100
I had so much fun playing with you.

253
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,100
I love you from now on!

254
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,100
Y-Yeah...

255
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:01,100
I love you too, Rena.

256
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,100
What's this magic?

257
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,100
Um...

258
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,100
R-Rena?

259
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:20,100
I'd like to invite you and Kaho.

260
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,100
I see.

261
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,100
You're busy, Rena.

262
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,100
But Kaho has something to do today.

263
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,100
A part-time job?

264
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,100
No, it's in Akasaka.

265
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,100
I was invited to a luxury hotel.

266
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,100
Akasaka?

267
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,100
Wait, that's the same place.

268
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,100
Akasaka, as I thought!

269
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,100
Thank you, Ajisai!

270
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,100
Yeah.

271
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,100
See you tomorrow.

272
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,100
Yeah, see you tomorrow.

273
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,100
Damn you!

274
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:55,100
It's all your fault that I couldn't play with you!

275
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,100
Kaho, it's all your fault!

276
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,100
What's this?

277
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,100
What's that?

278
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,100
Yeah.

279
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,100
Kaho's here!

280
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,100
You came, Rena?

281
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,100
What do you mean, I came?

282
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,100
What's this gathering?

283
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,100
You didn't know you were here?

284
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,100
Can you show me that envelope?

285
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,100
Sure.

286
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,100
What's this?

287
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,100
I think I invited everyone who came to the hotel.

288
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,100
Kaho, have you ever confessed to Ozuka?

289
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,100
You're so bold!

290
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,100
You're crazy! What's wrong with him?

291
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:48,100
Kaho, do you want to be my girlfriend?

292
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,100
You were a rich, talented, and handsome guy!

293
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,100
I was so greedy!

294
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:57,100
Kaho, I'm sorry. I'll cancel this party no matter what!

295
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,100
What's that?

296
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,100
I'm in trouble!

297
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,100
Kaho, do you like someone who can make that sign?

298
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,100
He's a humor!

299
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,100
He's a natural!

300
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,100
I think he's cute when he's like that!

301
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,100
Listen, Kaho!

302
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,100
No, I won't listen!

303
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,100
Only one person can be your girlfriend.

304
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,100
Do you have the confidence to be chosen?

305
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,100
Everyone can be chosen!

306
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,100
You're so mean!

307
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:26,100
If the party is canceled, you'll be free before the election.

308
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,100
Then you'll have the advantage of being in the same group!

309
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,100
That's true!

310
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,100
You understand?

311
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,100
Yes, I understand.

312
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,100
I know one more thing.

313
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,100
You like Mai, don't you?

314
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:46,100
I can't believe a girl like her can be in a party!

315
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,100
I know!

316
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,100
Let's do our best together!

317
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,100
I don't know anything!

318
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,100
I'm not going!

319
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,100
It's about time to start.

320
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,100
I'm really sorry, Renako.

321
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:09,100
I have no way to atone for my sins.

322
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,100
Please forgive me.

323
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,100
Then...

324
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,100
Then apologize!

325
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,100
Renako, why are you here?

326
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,100
Why are you in a swimsuit?

327
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,100
Mai wasn't in the same group.

328
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,100
She told me not to wear uniforms.

329
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,100
I see. It suits you.

330
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,100
I'll take a picture.

331
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,100
Huh? Where's my phone?

332
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,100
I don't know, idiot!

333
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,100
You're a locker, aren't you?

334
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,100
I called you so many times!

335
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,100
You're angry, aren't you?

336
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,100
I heard everything from Satsuki.

337
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,100
I see.

338
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,100
She's talking to you unexpectedly.

339
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:52,100
Hey, don't you want to stop the party?

340
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,100
I refuse.

341
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,100
I hurt you.

342
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,100
I'll pour water on you.

343
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,100
I'll pour water on you.

344
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,100
So stop it.

345
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,100
I'm sorry for hitting you on the cheek.

346
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,100
Is she a kid?

347
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:11,100
It's rude to date someone like that.

348
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,100
If you're in love, you should date someone you really like.

349
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:18,100
I can't date someone I really like anymore.

350
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:24,100
Then I have to find someone I can love.

351
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,100
Mai...

352
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,100
Thank you.

353
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,100
I had a great time with you.

354
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,100
Please pray for my next love to come true

355
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:36,100
so that we can be good friends in the end.

356
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,100
Wait.

357
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,100
What about the match between Mai and me?

358
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,100
We're not lovers or best friends.

359
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,100
You and I are just classmates.

360
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,100
I hate it.

361
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,100
Renako...

362
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,100
It's not over yet.

363
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,100
Don't decide it on your own!

364
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,100
Satsuki said it.

365
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:09,100
Oozuka Mai isn't a great woman like she thinks she is.

366
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,100
I agree.

367
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:14,100
Even if it's true, I'm doing my best to be great.

368
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,100
You didn't show your desire.

369
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,100
I'm not a great woman.

370
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,100
I'm doing my best.

371
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,100
Even though you didn't show your desire...

372
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,100
That's why I...

373
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,100
I don't want to hurt you again.

374
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,100
I don't want to fail.

375
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,100
That's why I...

376
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:38,100
I tried to give up on you.

377
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,100
It's okay.

378
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,100
I've failed many times.

379
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,100
But I still said I'd accept it.

380
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,100
You don't believe me.

381
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,100
You're the same as Mai.

382
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,100
But I...

383
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,100
The moment I was rejected by you...

384
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,100
I'm sorry.

385
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,100
I wasn't fair either.

386
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,100
I should've said it sooner.

387
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,100
What?

388
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:06,100
Actually, I'm quite interested in you.

389
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,100
Ever since you kissed me in the bath...

390
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,100
I've been thinking of you as my love partner.

391
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,100
Is that so?

392
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,100
You don't hate me anymore?

393
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,100
That's why you hit me, right?

394
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,100
Mai went too far.

395
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,100
She should've spent more time and space with you.

396
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,100
I can't believe it.

397
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,100
I've failed at everything.

398
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,100
You just had a fight.

399
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,100
I'm sorry, Mai.

400
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:38,100
I like you quite a lot.

401
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,100
Renako.

402
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,100
I hurt you like that.

403
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,100
Oh, come on!

404
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:50,100
I can't jump off the roof like you did.

405
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:55,100
But I can do things like rain or get wet or dive with you.

406
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,100
I'm not one-sided.

407
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,100
That's what you call a lover.

408
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,100
And that's what I call a best friend.

409
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:07,100
If you're Mai Oozuka, I'm Renako Amaori!

410
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,100
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

411
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,100
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

412
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,100
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

413
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,100
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

414
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,100
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

415
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,100
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

416
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,100
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

417
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,100
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

418
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,100
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

419
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,100
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

420
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:49,100
You can feel it, right, Mai?

421
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,100
Yeah.

422
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,100
Hey, what's wrong?

423
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,100
Stay like that for a while.

424
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,100
I'm Mai Oozuka.

425
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,100
I can't show you my tears here.

426
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,100
It's okay.

427
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,100
You're kind and strong.

428
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,100
Thank you so much.

429
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,100
That's...

430
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,100
...a crime.

431
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:24,100
And of course, the party was cancelled.

432
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:30,100
For some reason, Mai apologized and played the guitar, and it was really exciting.

433
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,100
Is this okay?

434
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:39,100
Kaho-chan still misunderstands Mai's relationship.

435
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,100
She hasn't been able to go to Ajisai's house yet.

436
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,100
She hasn't been able to go to Ajisai's house yet.

437
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,100
Satsuki and Mai are in a calm state.

438
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,100
Hahaha.

439
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,100
But...

440
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:59,100
But I'm not trying to make up for it.

441
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:04,100
I think I finally made my high school debut in the real sense.

442
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:10,100
And then, at the end of June, the day of the match with Mai came.

443
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,100
Mai's house.

444
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,100
The penthouse of the largest apartment in the area.

445
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:20,100
It's like a private elevator from the parking lot, and the place you arrive is just like a room.

446
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,100
I've never seen a guest house before.

447
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,100
I feel like I'm swallowed up by Mai's body.

448
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,100
We can stay together forever.

449
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,100
Psychopaths?

450
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,100
Psychopaths?

451
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,100
Then, let me hear your answer.

452
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,100
Yeah, well...

453
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,100
Yeah.

454
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,100
I still don't know what a lover is.

455
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,100
What?

456
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,100
You stole my heart and you're a femme fatale?

457
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,100
No, I mean...

458
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,100
I like Shinya more than Mai.

459
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,100
I see.

460
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:13,100
But I like Mai, and I want to do what I want as her best friend.

461
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,100
So...

462
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,100
I'm not more than a best friend, and I'm not more than a lover.

463
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,100
How about a romance?

464
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,100
A romance?

465
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,100
A new relationship between you and Mai.

466
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,100
That's a pretty big deal, isn't it?

467
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:36,100
I didn't expect you to make the third choice.

468
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,100
You did it too!

469
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,100
You said you were a classmate.

470
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:50,100
Seriously, I've never had a partner as tough as you in my life.

471
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,100
Then, let's have another match.

472
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,100
A match?

473
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,100
Yeah.

474
00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:00,100
You'll be the one to propose to me and I'll be your girlfriend.

475
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,100
I'm not going to give up on you.

476
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,100
That's the deadline.

477
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,100
Until we graduate.

478
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,100
Okay, I'll take it.
