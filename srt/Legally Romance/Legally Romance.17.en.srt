1
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:03,070
Well...

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:04,480
Check the back of the couch

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,590
and the crack.

4
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:05,920
Okay?

5
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:06,840
Take it seriously.

6
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,150
Maybe

7
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:09,110
it's because of the dim light.

8
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:09,920
We all drank a lot.

9
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,430
Maybe someone

10
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:10,800
put it

11
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,520
in her own bag

12
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,680
by mistake.

13
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,600
Check your bag

14
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,310
and see if it's in it.

15
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:15,000
Look closely.

16
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,720
Open your bag

17
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,600
and check it.

18
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,550
(It happened just as I expected.)

19
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:21,360
(It was not)

20
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,310
(a victory party,)

21
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:24,040
(but a class reunion.)

22
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,200
(Liu's jade pendant)

23
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,150
(somehow)

24
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:27,870
(popped up in my bag.)

25
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:31,390
It's in my bag.

26
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:34,880
How could you

27
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,080
steal from your roommate?

28
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:37,790
No, I...

29
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,240
I didn't take it.

30
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,080
I don't know

31
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,040
why it's in my bag.

32
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,520
It can't be Qian Wei.

33
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,520
It's a misunderstanding.

34
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,240
It's obviously a misunderstanding.

35
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,520
We all drank a lot.

36
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:49,950
And the light

37
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:50,840
is dim.

38
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,880
She must've taken it

39
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,110
by mistake.

40
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:53,750
All right. All right.

41
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:54,720
It's okay. It's okay.

42
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,430
It's just a misunderstanding.

43
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,200
(Liu certainly trusts me.)

44
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:59,470
(But the scary thing is)

45
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,630
(that after that night,)

46
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,000
(people started
to spread rumors at school)

47
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,880
(that I was caught stealing)

48
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,870
(because my father is sick)

49
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,550
(and my family has no money.)

50
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,230
(Liu Shiyun)

51
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,630
(forgave me in the spirit
of being a bigger person.)

52
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,590
What is she doing here?

53
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,800
As a thief, she still joined
the Municipal Merit Student Selection.

54
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,720
Does she have no shame?

55
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:20,760
What happened?

56
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,440
She is the one

57
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,120
who stole stuff.

58
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,230
Why would she do that?

59
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:27,310
(There were even people)

60
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,310
(posting blogs anonymously
on Renren.com.)

61
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,000
(The story gets weirder.)

62
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,550
(I want to clarify it,)

63
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,160
(but it's hard to prove
that I didn't do anything.)

64
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:36,080
(How should I prove)

65
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,360
(that I didn't?)

66
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,680
(Qian Chuan)
(What to do now?)

67
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,720
(We have to do something about it.)

68
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:55,550
She's the one who stole stuff.

69
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,320
(You won't know how scary)

70
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,720
(rumors or cyberbullying are)

71
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,080
(until you experience it.)

72
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,000
(I quit)

73
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,720
(the Municipal Merit Student Selection)

74
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,830
(of that year.)

75
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,360
(I almost got depressive
and hid at home.)

76
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,960
(Rumors ran wild.)

77
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,390
(But there were still people
who can tell the truth.)

78
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,670
(Clarification)
(They secretly put up a notice for me.)

79
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,440
(It was the only light)

80
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,080
(in those dark days.)

81
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,060
(Clarification)

82
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,020
=Legally Romance=

83
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:25,420
=Episode 17=
=Fight Back Rumors=

84
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,320
Not in the toilet.

85
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:30,920
No?

86
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,230
That's weird.

87
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,510
The jade pendant was lost twice

88
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,510
with different causes,

89
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,390
at different times,

90
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,160
and different locations.

91
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,720
The people involved are different, too.

92
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,160
But the same thing

93
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,720
is that Liu met Mo Tao,

94
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,950
and Mo Tao gave Liu a hand.

95
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,550
The 18-year-old Qian Wei

96
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,440
was an innocent girl

97
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,830
who just swallowed it.

98
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:51,550
But now

99
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,760
I won't let this happen again.

100
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,200
I'll teach him a lesson this time.

101
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,160
Qian Chuan.

102
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,110
Pass me the bag.

103
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:00,720
Here.

104
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,440
If I'm guessing it right,

105
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:06,880
the jade pendant

106
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,350
should be in my bag.

107
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,670
You know what,

108
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:10,070
the strange thing is

109
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,200
when I left home this morning,

110
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,350
I just felt that the universe

111
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,000
snapped its fingers again

112
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,350
in my head.

113
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,270
I knew someone

114
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,440
would set me up

115
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,230
today.

116
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,830
Liu, do you trust me?

117
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:32,160
Of course

118
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,480
I trust you.

119
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,440
What happened?

120
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,270
I don't know.

121
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,040
But I think

122
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,390
we'll find it out soon.

123
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:40,880
Little girl.

124
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,480
You're a law school student.

125
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,480
Don't be so superstitious.

126
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,550
You sound like a fortune teller.

127
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,350
Since we found it,

128
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,230
you should have fun now.

129
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,070
Everything is just fine.

130
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:47,550
All right?

131
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,270
I have other things to do.

132
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:48,760
I got

133
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,790
to leave.

134
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:50,510
Mo Tao.

135
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,320
You didn't do it, did you?

136
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,480
Zixin.

137
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,320
What are you talking about?

138
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,390
What does this have to do with me?

139
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,040
I

140
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,110
met you

141
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,200
and bought you and your classmates
drinks with good intentions.

142
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,350
What's wrong with that?

143
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,230
The two of them

144
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,600
went to the toilet together.

145
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,790
How would I know

146
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:08,760
what they were doing in the toilet?

147
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,070
Watch your mouth!

148
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,550
Young man.

149
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,350
Don't be so angry.

150
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,510
I still have

151
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,440
a business meeting.

152
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,830
You can't afford to delay me.

153
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,670
Business is not important.

154
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,480
So

155
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,880
there is still no one to admit

156
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,110
putting the jade pendant

157
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,550
in my bag, right?

158
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,350
It's okay.

159
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,480
Let's call the police.

160
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,040
With the camera and the fingerprints,

161
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,640
it's easy to find out.

162
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,510
This is a victory party.

163
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,760
There's no need to do that.

164
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,000
It's just a misunderstanding.

165
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,390
If the police come,

166
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,230
we're not going

167
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,200
to be able to sleep tonight.

168
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,640
I think

169
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,720
you law school kids

170
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,600
are just

171
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,390
melodramatic

172
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,200
and troublesome.

173
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,320
We've found the jade.

174
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,440
We all drank a lot.

175
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,600
It's very normal.

176
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,350
It should be a happy thing

177
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,200
for you to hang out together!

178
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,480
Why do you have to

179
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,320
make it awkward?

180
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,040
All right. All right.

181
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,160
Have fun.

182
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,440
Don't bother with such a little thing.

183
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,070
No way.

184
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,480
No one can leave this room

185
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,640
before we find out

186
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,790
who did it.

187
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,040
Otherwise, this misunderstanding today

188
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,830
will become the story
that has been spread for long

189
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,670
in school tomorrow.

190
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:14,510
Sir.

191
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,270
Especially you.

192
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,880
You can't leave this room.

193
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,320
Little brother.

194
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,000
I have a business to deal with.

195
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,510
Don't be childish.

196
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,390
I said you can't leave.

197
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,070
Qian Chuan, close the door.

198
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,320
Check it carefully.

199
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,270
The crack and other places.

200
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,440
Look closely.

201
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,230
And the back

202
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,110
of the couch.

203
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,600
See if it's in there.

204
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,040
Look closely.

205
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,670
Maybe it's too dark here,

206
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,040
and someone put it in the bag

207
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,950
by mistake.

208
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:07,350
Or

209
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,790
you can check your bags.

210
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,040
Mo Tao!

211
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,320
Do you have no shame?

212
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,790
You stole from my friend!

213
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:24,390
No.

214
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,830
I didn't steal.

215
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:26,440
Well,

216
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:26,920
how can you

217
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,550
call it

218
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,640
stealing?

219
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,110
Her jade pendant got loose

220
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,230
and fell off.

221
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,080
I took it

222
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,030
so it wouldn't break.

223
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:33,790
But she got drunk.

224
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:34,200
I worried she would lose it.

225
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,590
So I put it back.

226
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,150
How can that be stealing?

227
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,280
Stop making excuses!

228
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,080
I'm not making excuses.

229
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,590
All right.

230
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:40,640
Don't give me that look.

231
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,590
Listen,

232
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,440
Mo Zixin,

233
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,960
if you promised

234
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,030
to give me my money back,

235
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,150
would we be
in such an awkward situation?

236
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,640
- Are you trying to hit me?
- Don't move! Don't move!

237
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,030
See?

238
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:49,590
He started first.

239
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:50,590
I'm going to defend myself!

240
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:51,790
How dare you

241
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,080
sling mud at me!

242
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,280
You are a criminal suspect now.

243
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:54,790
You can talk

244
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,710
after I bring you to the police station!

245
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:55,910
No,

246
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,320
wait!

247
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:56,910
Sir.

248
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,110
Sir.

249
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,110
How am I

250
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,110
a criminal suspect?

251
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:00,840
You must be kidding.

252
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,910
Mo Zixin is my younger sister.

253
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,230
My biological sister.

254
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,080
I don't know him.

255
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,400
Wait,

256
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,080
wait!

257
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,440
Speak up for me!

258
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,150
Listen,

259
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,470
if I go to jail,

260
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:10,320
your father will call you from jail

261
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:10,880
and ask you

262
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,640
to get me out.

263
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,440
Say something!

264
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,280
You deserve it!

265
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:13,440
Come on.

266
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,640
We're family. Stop the nonsense!

267
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,440
That's embarrassing!

268
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,030
Are you okay?

269
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,030
I'm fine.

270
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,400
Don't worry about me.

271
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,710
It's Mo Tao's fault.

272
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,110
He deserves

273
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,200
to be punished.

274
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,710
Fortunately,
you didn't lose the pendant.

275
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,760
Otherwise,

276
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,280
I really don't know

277
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,670
how to face you.

278
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:57,670
It's fine

279
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:58,640
that Mo Tao

280
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,520
acts like a rascal to me.

281
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,200
I can't believe he did this to you guys.

282
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,000
If our classmates

283
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,520
know it,

284
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,080
what would they think of me?

285
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:10,760
You are

286
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,840
not him.

287
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,230
This has nothing to do with you.

288
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,790
But they will know

289
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,470
that I'm no longer

290
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,710
a rich girl,

291
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,080
but the daughter
of an economic criminal.

292
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,670
Isn't your father

293
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,030
a stock market expert
who published a book?

294
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,470
He was.

295
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,710
But later

296
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,150
my father was convicted of bribery

297
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,440
and manipulation of securities markets.

298
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,760
He got arrested.

299
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,030
The perfect life

300
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:42,030
I used to have

301
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,030
just burst

302
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,080
like a bubble

303
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:48,840
on that day.

304
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,590
Because

305
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,150
he was arrested abroad,

306
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:55,030
and it involved trade secrets,

307
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,760
the case wasn't released to the public.

308
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,200
Plus, news didn't spread

309
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,400
as quickly as nowadays,

310
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,110
so a lot of people

311
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:02,910
don't know it.

312
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,910
But I didn't mean to lie to you.

313
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,910
I just don't want too much attention.

314
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,350
I don't want to tell other people.

315
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:13,350
I don't want them

316
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:15,550
to take pity on me

317
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,840
or look down on me because of that.

318
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,080
It's your privacy

319
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,350
anyway.

320
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,080
You have every right not to tell us.

321
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,760
What's more,

322
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,280
you are so sweet and beautiful,

323
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,440
and you have good grades.

324
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,030
You made your first bucket of gold
in college

325
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,670
by investing in stocks.

326
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,910
Even without a great family background,

327
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,440
you're still an excellent person.

328
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,000
Who are we

329
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
to take pity on you?

330
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,590
Yes.

331
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:43,640
I'm not going to hold him accountable.

332
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,710
No.

333
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,350
It's not fair

334
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,400
to you and Qian Wei.

335
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,550
I'm okay.

336
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,000
I have no hard feelings.

337
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,640
You know what,

338
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,640
I have an accurate sixth sense.

339
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,280
I'm one of those people

340
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,760
who can make lemonade
when life gives me lemons.

341
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,320
Don't think

342
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,670
that I have hard feelings.

343
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,910
Listen,

344
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:00,840
don't be sad.

345
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,280
Right now

346
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,080
my sixth sense

347
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,150
is telling me something

348
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,470
again.

349
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:05,670
I'm telling you

350
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,910
that you will become

351
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,110
an extremely

352
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,280
excellent woman one day,

353
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:09,910
a gentle,

354
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,710
beautiful and generous woman.

355
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:12,550
And

356
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,200
you don't even need a rich boy,

357
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,230
you can be rich

358
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,550
on your own.

359
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,350
You'll be a strong woman.

360
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,350
That's right.

361
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,470
Thank you.

362
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:22,350
Thank you, Shiyun.

363
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,350
You're welcome.

364
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,000
How's it?

365
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Who stole it?

366
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:33,880
Xun.

367
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,910
What's going on now?

368
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:35,960
Can we leave?

369
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,590
I have classes tomorrow.

370
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:40,880
Actually,

371
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,320
no one stole anything.

372
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,230
Sorry

373
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,320
that I kept you waiting.

374
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,520
Then why did you call the police?

375
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,550
Such a hypocrite.

376
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,030
What do you mean?

377
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,110
Who are you calling a hypocrite?

378
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:50,440
Calm down.

379
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,230
Who stole it?

380
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,840
Not your sister.

381
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,790
Liu Shiyun decides to let it go.

382
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,790
Just forget it.

383
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,230
Just forget it?

384
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:06,760
The jade

385
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,550
was found in my sister's bag.

386
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:09,520
If we don't find the thief,

387
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:09,960
what will they

388
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,030
think of my sister?

389
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:12,960
I'll talk to Liu.

390
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,440
It's your sister's decision.

391
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,030
Can we control

392
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,230
what other people say or do?

393
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,200
Trust me.

394
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,880
I'll do everything I can in my own way

395
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,640
to protect her.

396
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,400
I won't let her get hurt.

397
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,580
(The merit student-to-be
turns out to be a thief.)

398
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,420
(Reveal the true colors of Qian Wei,
a top student of grade 11 in law school.)

399
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:43,960
Stop.

400
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,760
Stop watching it.

401
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,760
What are you watching it for?

402
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,230
I haven't replied yet.

403
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,760
Why would you reply?

404
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,760
I'm not even angry.

405
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,080
What are you angry about?

406
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,670
Well,

407
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,110
follow me.

408
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,760
Don't be angry.

409
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,840
Don't be angry.

410
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,550
If you get angry, devils get hungry.

411
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:03,880
How can I not be angry

412
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,030
about it?

413
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,910
Not only that I should be angry,

414
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,000
I'm also going

415
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,520
to vent your anger for you.

416
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,910
It's fine that it affected

417
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:10,640
the Municipal Merit Student Selection,

418
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,400
now rumors are spreading on the Internet

419
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,280
that you stole stuff

420
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,440
because your father is sick
and your family is poor.

421
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,280
Your family

422
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:15,840
has been brought into this.

423
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,280
How can you still be so calm?

424
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,910
And Fawei Online...

425
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,150
I know.

426
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,200
Professor Zhang and Mr. Zhen

427
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,550
told me about it.

428
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,400
In this case,

429
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,710
if I don't fix this,

430
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,710
it will affect teachers' opinions of me.

431
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:27,280
What's more,

432
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:27,880
it will also affect

433
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,470
the Fawei Online review.

434
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,520
Then why are you still so calm?

435
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,790
What can I do?

436
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:33,440
I can't be sad

437
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,550
about something

438
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,960
I didn't do.

439
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:37,790
Listen,

440
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:38,670
you can't

441
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,520
let these things

442
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,440
affect your moods.

443
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,670
These bystanders

444
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,960
are just fence-sitters.

445
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,710
Especially those who started the rumors.

446
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:46,640
They want me

447
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,350
to be upset

448
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,470
and in a bad state,

449
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,400
so I will quit the selection.

450
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,280
But I won't.

451
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,230
If I knew the public opinion
would become like this,

452
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,470
I wouldn't have let you drop the case.

453
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,960
I know you're worried...

454
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,000
All right.

455
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,470
Now that I've dropped the case,

456
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:01,280
it means

457
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,320
I'm ready

458
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,760
to take the consequences.

459
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,960
I also hope

460
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,760
you won't let this

461
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,030
affect your moods.

462
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,030
How can I not be affected?

463
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,280
It's hard not to be affected

464
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,230
when there are rumors.

465
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:11,840
You, Qian Chuan, Liu, and me,

466
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,030
which one of us is not going to be hurt?

467
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,760
It's a good thing

468
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,520
that you don't let
public opinion influence you.

469
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,590
But we can't let it

470
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:17,760
escalate

471
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,670
in the wrong direction.

472
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,590
Right?

473
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:28,200
All right.

474
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,350
Time is up.

475
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:31,080
Now I'll explain these questions.

476
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,880
Come on, everyone.

477
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,910
Keep your heads up.

478
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,670
In this multiple-choice question
of theft,

479
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:37,790
many of you

480
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,910
missed choice A.

481
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:42,030
Let's see what choice A is.

482
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,470
(Which of the acts constitutes theft)
A college student

483
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,080
was eating in the canteen.

484
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:48,080
Student A usually saves the seat

485
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,440
with phone and wallet first

486
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,470
before going to buy meals.

487
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,150
Student A's friend, student B,

488
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:57,080
took the wallet used to save the seat,

489
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,590
which of course constitutes theft.

490
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,910
Therefore, everyone,

491
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,280
don't be misled

492
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,710
by the so-called friendship

493
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,030
in this question.

494
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,080
Sir.

495
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,320
I have a question.

496
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,080
Does it need

497
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,960
behavioral evidence

498
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,760
and outcome evidence

499
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,880
to convict student B of theft?

500
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,640
Of course.

501
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:16,960
If someone spreads rumors

502
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,350
about student B

503
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,760
committing theft

504
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,110
without evidence,

505
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,440
does it constitute

506
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,440
an infringement of reputation right,

507
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,030
even defamation in serious cases?

508
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:26,790
That's right.

509
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:27,590
What's wrong?

510
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,710
Nothing.

511
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:30,710
I just think

512
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:31,880
this could be

513
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,670
a key point in the Judicial Examination
next year.

514
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:35,320
I hope you don't forget.

515
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:37,520
Okay.

516
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,000
That's it for this question.

517
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,200
Let's see the next one.

518
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,230
This is the Qian Wei I know.

519
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,080
Everyone, look at it.

520
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,080
Listen to me.

521
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,590
It's really a key point
of next year's Judicial Examination.

522
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,960
It's the most important right

523
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,470
in the property right in work.

524
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,960
When the copyright legal system

525
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,030
was built...

526
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,150
The right to privacy...

527
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,920
I posted a clarification online.

528
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,920
But an anonymous account

529
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,400
opened a new topic

530
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,520
and said

531
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,110
Qian Wei not only
stole the jade pendant,

532
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,110
but also stole my phone

533
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:23,160
to whitewash what she did.

534
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:24,560
What's wrong

535
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,880
with that person's brain?

536
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,070
There she is.

537
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:28,760
That's the one.

538
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,040
Let's go.

539
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:31,590
Wait.

540
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,830
She's not a thief!

541
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:40,950
What are you looking at?

542
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,560
Come back!

543
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,580
(Clarification)

544
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,580
(The truth is as follows...)

545
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,180
(A witness of the event.)

546
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,640
It's this clarification again.

547
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,040
Again?

548
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,070
I mean,

549
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,280
how can

550
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,230
there be such a kind person?

551
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,710
It's a friend.

552
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:14,950
Looks like

553
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:16,520
there are sensible people in our school.

554
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,070
What?

555
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:27,830
After my analysis,

556
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,470
I think

557
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:31,560
this statement

558
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,920
is logical

559
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,880
and sharp.

560
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,680
His

561
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,920
written communication skills

562
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,920
are excellent.

563
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,470
The style of writing

564
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:39,680
is also great.

565
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,880
I believe this kind man

566
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,710
will become

567
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:42,800
a great lawyer

568
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,070
one day.

569
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:46,760
Cool.

570
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:49,190
Right?

571
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,140
(Clarification)

572
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:00,540
(Printing Center)

573
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,520
Stop.

574
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,230
I knew it was you.

575
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,230
Great style of writing.

576
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:11,040
Logical and sharp.

577
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:11,800
Don't you hate

578
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,590
street posters the most?

579
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,800
Now you put them up everywhere.

580
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,350
I'm helping our classmates review

581
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,470
the General Principles of the Civil Law
and the Criminal Law.

582
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:18,230
Fine.

583
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:18,880
You're stubborn.

584
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,070
Sop putting up posters.

585
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,280
I'll turn you in right now.

586
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,710
As the light of law school,

587
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,110
you took the lead
in breaking the school rules.

588
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,920
I mean,

589
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,470
it's fine
that you don't want to explain.

590
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,710
But how can I not explain?

591
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,160
I'm your boyfriend.

592
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,070
Can I watch those people

593
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,400
throw dirt at you,

594
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,070
spread rumors about you

595
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,160
and make jokes?

596
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,000
No matter how terrible the rumor is,

597
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,830
just give it two weeks.

598
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:38,350
Two weeks later,

599
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,640
people will lose interest.

600
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,470
Then they'll look for

601
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,190
new rumors.

602
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,590
I think

603
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:43,350
the most important thing right now

604
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,470
is to focus on

605
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:46,070
finding the person
who started the rumor.

606
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:48,950
All right.

607
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,070
I'll keep putting up posters

608
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,190
for another two weeks.

609
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,560
Overruled!

610
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,070
It was you

611
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,070
who clarified the truth for me silently

612
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,590
at that time.

613
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:04,800
It has always

614
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,590
been you.

615
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,680
Don't be too grateful.

616
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,830
Just buy me milk tea.

617
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:16,760
Okay.

618
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,470
I'll buy you milk tea.

619
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,280
How many cups?

620
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,070
Half a cup.

621
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,920
I went to the teacher

622
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,520
and thought maybe the school

623
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,280
could issue an official clarification.

624
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,760
But the teacher asked me

625
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,070
why I dropped the case

626
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,350
and what happened exactly.

627
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:31,800
Who stole it?

628
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,430
I can't tell you.

629
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,070
But it has nothing to do with Qian Wei.

630
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:37,710
I dropped the case

631
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:38,880
because I didn't want it

632
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,640
to become complicated.

633
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,000
But I didn't expect

634
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,230
it to turn out like this.

635
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,040
Do you know Les Misérables?

636
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:46,640
It's Victor Hugo's work.

637
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:47,920
A world classic.

638
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:49,590
Jean Valjean

639
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:49,920
stole a loaf of bread

640
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,040
in order not

641
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,310
to starve his sister's child.

642
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,070
Later,

643
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,280
he stole silver and escaped from jail.

644
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,560
What is stealing

645
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,880
compared to survival?

646
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,310
Hugo would turn over in his grave

647
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:02,070
if he heard what you just said!

648
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,560
I'm the one who lost a jade pendant,

649
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,680
which was put on renren.com.

650
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,160
I've posted a clarification.

651
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,040
Why are you still

652
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:08,800
stirring up trouble?

653
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,680
Liu.

654
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,830
Please be civilized in public.

655
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,110
Liu.

656
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:14,560
We are having an academic exchange.

657
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,760
Do you want to join us?

658
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,110
Do you know

659
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:17,710
Bakerhaas's swan experiment?

660
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,760
A swan placed in a flock of geese

661
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,920
couldn't fly up

662
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,000
from the ground.

663
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,310
Because opportunities and environment

664
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:25,310
would determine a person's

665
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,400
room for growth

666
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:27,920
and the way he behaves.

667
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,710
Family background

668
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,950
often determines fate.

669
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:32,590
You...!

670
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:34,110
Liu.

671
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,800
You're too simple

672
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,040
and you always trust
the people around you.

673
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,560
You don't know that humans
are complicated in nature.

674
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,560
You...!

675
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,160
Qian Wei's father is ill

676
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:43,710
and her family needs money badly.

677
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,230
We feel sorry for her.

678
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:46,310
But,

679
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,230
she stole from her roommate

680
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,520
to deal with her emergency.

681
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:49,950
She should pay the price.

682
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:50,640
The worst case

683
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,640
is that she gets disqualified

684
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,640
from the Municipal
Merit Student Selection.

685
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,560
Nonsense!

686
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,190
I think you want to get a hit!

687
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:09,230
Apologize.

688
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:11,000
Why should I apologize?

689
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:14,710
Go away!

690
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:15,760
Apologize!

691
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,190
Go away!

692
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:21,070
What does it have to do with you?

693
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,000
You won't apologize?

694
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:24,640
Then you're responsible

695
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,760
for what you said,

696
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,190
this classmate.

697
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,190
Apologize?

698
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:54,430
You want me to apologize?

699
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:56,920
Ms. Wu.

700
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,640
If he

701
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,760
doesn't apologize first,

702
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:01,680
to Qian Wei,

703
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,640
and to all the students

704
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,680
who believe

705
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,560
that knowledge can change their fate,

706
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,230
I'm not going to apologize.

707
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,190
Li Chongwen.

708
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,110
What's wrong with you?

709
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,640
All the teachers and students

710
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,230
who know you told me

711
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,070
that you're

712
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,000
a gentle

713
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:19,680
and mature student.

714
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:21,350
What's wrong with you today?

715
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,190
If you can't come to an understanding

716
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,680
with the student who was beaten,

717
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,400
you'll get a demerit.

718
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,070
With your resume,

719
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,800
it's a done deal for you

720
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,710
to graduate
as the Municipal Outstanding Graduate.

721
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:34,400
I can give up

722
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,400
honors and scholarships,

723
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,640
but he

724
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,880
must apologize!

725
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:53,070
I'll call your parents.

726
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,040
Ms. Wu.

727
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,560
There is no need to make a phone call.

728
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,310
No one will answer it.

729
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,310
His father died young.

730
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,110
His mother

731
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,350
is working elsewhere

732
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,160
and not at home.

733
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,430
Over these years,

734
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,350
I've been taking care of him.

735
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,880
I'm kind of his parent.

736
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,760
Just talk to me.

737
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:24,680
Mr. Zhang.

738
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:29,110
Li Chongwen is a promising student.

739
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,560
But hitting people

740
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,280
is against the school rules.

741
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,350
Ms. Wu.

742
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,520
What about that guy?

743
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,040
He spread false statements

744
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,310
and defamed Qian Wei.

745
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,640
Is that in accordance
with the school rules?

746
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,640
Lu Xun!

747
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,680
How can you use a mistake

748
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,040
to cover up another mistake?

749
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,040
Then it depends on

750
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,520
which mistake

751
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,470
is more serious.

752
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,110
It would determine a person's

753
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,110
room for growth

754
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:52,760
and the way he behaves.

755
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,000
Family background

756
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:56,190
often determines fate.

757
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,280
This video

758
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,800
wasn't just posted on renren.com,

759
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:02,040
but also on Weibo.

760
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:03,880
Many people are waiting

761
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,710
for the school's response.

762
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,280
Our school launched

763
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,760
humanized subsidies
for poor students earlier,

764
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,350
and it had an overwhelming response.

765
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,280
But if this event

766
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,560
is handled sloppily,

767
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,880
if you only punish Li Chongwen

768
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,110
and turn a deaf ear

769
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,190
to the allegedly discriminatory remarks

770
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,590
that magnify the gap

771
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,310
between the rich and the poor,

772
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,310
what do you think
those netizens will react?

773
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,470
I also came from a poor family.

774
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:27,560
I need to talk

775
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,110
to this student.

776
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:31,880
I've been teaching for years,

777
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,680
but I've never done anything immoral

778
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:34,800
for fame and money.

779
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,160
What's more,

780
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,830
Qian Wei is also my student.

781
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:38,920
He accused Qian Wei

782
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,190
of stealing without any evidence

783
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:41,880
and even got her sick father in this.

784
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:43,350
In this case,

785
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,680
you should also ask

786
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,760
his parents to come.

787
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,680
Did he

788
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,000
start the rumors

789
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,830
on the Internet first?

790
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:50,280
No.

791
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,400
Mr. Zhang.

792
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:51,950
I heard about it

793
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,310
from my students.

794
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:55,400
He followed suit and made comments.

795
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,950
But he didn't start the rumors.

796
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,190
Ms. Wu.

797
00:25:58,950 --> 00:25:59,680
If that person

798
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,110
wants to hold Li Chongwen responsible
for civil liability,

799
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:02,920
tell them to contact me.

800
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,280
I'll get Li Chongwen

801
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,350
the best lawyer.

802
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,430
What are you thinking?

803
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:20,000
Let's go.

804
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,000
Goodbye, Ms. Wu.

805
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:54,680
So cool.

806
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,350
Thanks.

807
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,520
For what?

808
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,470
I should thank you.

809
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:08,760
Isn't it your style

810
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,280
not to give others

811
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,430
a break?

812
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,640
You two said everything.

813
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,560
What should I say?

814
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,070
It wasn't the guy who posted it.

815
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,880
I know.

816
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,190
But it's okay.

817
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:21,710
We're gonna find out who did it.

818
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,710
I got water into your computer earlier,

819
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:26,190
and your glasses were broken today
because of me.

820
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:27,230
Sorry.

821
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,590
Let me help you.

822
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:42,830

823
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,760

873
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:04,880
Come on, Qian Wei!

874
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,310
Come on!

875
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,230
Come on, Qian Wei!

876
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:07,230
You can do it!

877
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:12,310
Come on, Qian Wei!

878
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,700
(The wise doesn't buy rumors,
but should we stop the rumors?)

879
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:16,400
(Law students)

880
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,430
(all have a strong sense of justice
and they are ready to help the weak.)

881
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,470
(We can't)

882
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:20,920
(pull out a knife
when we see injustice,)

883
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:22,680
(because it's against the law
to use a knife.)

884
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:23,950
(But if we can't even)

885
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:24,800
(make sounds,)

886
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,590
(if we can't tell what's right
and what's wrong,)

887
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:26,920
(if we let the rumors run rampant,)

888
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:29,190
(how can we face our conscience)

889
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,680
(and say we believe in justice?)

890
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:40,640
(Clarification)
(Qian Wei.)

891
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,800
(Mo Zixin)
(I also want to help.)

892
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,230
(I can afford to suffer some damage)

893
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,350
(in order to fight with them.)

894
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,000
(But if it will hurt you,)

895
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:48,800
(I'd rather not fight
this public opinion war.)

896
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,230
(Don't get yourself in this.)

897
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:51,880
(I'll leave the debate team to you.)

898
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:53,310
(You got my back.)

899
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,400
(We are in this together.)

900
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:04,560
Mr. Zhang.

901
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,560
Here is a document for you.

902
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,520
Why are you

903
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,110
delivering the debate team's

904
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,400
training records recently?

905
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,400
Where is your team leader, Qian Wei?

906
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,680
Is she fooling around in school

907
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,040
with the team members again?

908
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:22,040
They are busy putting out fires.

909
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,000
As for the debate team,

910
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I'll do as much as I can

911
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,880
to help.

912
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,000
What?

913
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,070
There are people

914
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,000
putting up posters in school?

915
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,830
Tell me where it is.

916
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,430
I don't have a choice.

917
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,070
Now that I'm on your boat,

918
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,950
I have to work with you guys.

919
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:40,280
Hurry.

920
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,830
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

921
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:48,430
Mr. Zhang!

922
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:48,950
Mr. Zhang!

923
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,400
I'm on my way out to catch them.

924
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,680
Why did you lock the door?

925
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,040
Well,

926
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:52,760
my bad.

927
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,470
That student

928
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:54,230
just got me

929
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:55,040
all confused.

930
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,760
I thought there was no one in there.

931
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,310
Wait a moment.

932
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,430
Let me find the key.

933
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,190
Hurry up, Mr. Zhang.

934
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,830
I just put it here.

935
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,350
Where is it?

936
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:07,800
Wait.

937
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,880
Hold on a second.

938
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:12,710
Hello.

939
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:13,680
Shiyun.

940
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,280
You should leave now.

941
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,040
Stop putting up posters.

942
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,040
We've been reported.

943
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,430
I'm going to tell Qian Wei

944
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:19,110
and others now.

945
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,230
Don't worry.

946
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:21,950
I know what to do.

947
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,110
Lu Xun.

948
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,350
We've been reported.

949
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,800
They're coming now.

950
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:34,680
Where is Qian Wei?

951
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,230
Qian Wei!

952
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,560
Hurry up.

953
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,160
All right.

954
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,040
Don't rush me.

955
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:40,400
Hold on!

956
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:40,950
The teacher is coming.

957
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:41,560
Hurry.

958
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,110
Get in there.

959
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:42,920
I haven't put it up yet.

960
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,040
Where?

961
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,470
Are you sure
we should hide in the toilet?

962
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:47,070
It's the ladies' room.

963
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,520
I don't think you should be here.

964
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,830
What can I do?

965
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:50,190
Get in.

966
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:51,280
Stop talking.

967
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,160
There's a door.

968
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,040
Get in there and hide yourselves.

969
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:55,470
Don't worry.

970
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:56,040
Don't make any noise.

971
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,160
I'll deal with the teacher.

972
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:57,400
No,

973
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:57,800
wait.

974
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:59,040
Mo... Mo Zixin...

975
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,980
(Cleaning Tools Room)

976
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,040
Ms. Wu.

977
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:32,160
You...

978
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,710
Mo Zixin?

979
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:38,280
What are you doing here?

980
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,710
Our club has an activity today.

981
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:42,710
I'm putting up

982
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,230
(Guanghua Comics and Animation Club)
posters for the Comics and Animation Club

983
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:45,880
(Guanghua Comics and Animation Club)
in the Art Festival.

984
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,920
Ms. Wu, take a look.

985
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:47,950
In this way,

986
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:48,800
we can let more people

987
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,000
know about the two-dimensional world.

988
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,000
Are you here alone?

989
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,400
The other students

990
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,280
are changing in there.

991
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,470
We'll have a rehearsal later.

992
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,310
Well, Ms. Wu.

993
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,400
You seem to be interested

994
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,070
in comics and animation, too.

995
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:01,520
Mr. Zhang

996
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,160
has promised us

997
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,160
to be a guest actor.

998
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,950
Do you want to try

999
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:05,800
the Shana of the Blazing Eyes?

1000
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,640
I'll dress you up.

1001
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,110
Have a try!

1002
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,230
Your hair will look good

1003
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:12,520
in that look.

1004
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,160
I don't think so.

1005
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,070
No, no, no.

1006
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:15,470
Ms. Wu!

1007
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:16,230
Ms. Wu!

1008
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,560
Don't you want to try it?

1009
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,430
Is she gone?

1010
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,190
What?

1011
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:27,880
I...

1012
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,280
Well.

1013
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:29,710
Listen.

1014
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:30,230
We should

1015
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:31,310
find a way

1016
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:33,000
to get rid of these things,

1017
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,880
or we can hide them on us.

1018
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,470
Well,

1019
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:36,350
you have a thick waist.

1020
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,350
Hide them on you.

1021
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,230
Then even if

1022
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:39,400
the teacher finds us,

1023
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,230
there will be no witness

1024
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:41,040
and no proof.

1025
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:41,590
Right?

1026
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:43,160
Otherwise, we will get caught
with the posters.

1027
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:43,680
Look.

1028
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,110
Well...

1029
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,430
Hurry up.

1030
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:47,280
My waist is thick?

1031
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:47,830
Hurry!

1032
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:48,310
Don't talk.

1033
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,110
Cover them with your clothes.

1034
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:49,950
Okay, okay.

1035
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:50,680
I can do it.

1036
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,230
I'll do it myself.

1037
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:51,920
Hurry!

1038
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,760
Hold this for me.

1039
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,000
You must be quick.

1040
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,110
You know.

1041
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:56,920
Listen,

1042
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,280
you can

1043
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,350
also loosen the belt

1044
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:00,310
and put some in there.

1045
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:01,520
Is there no other way?

1046
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,520
There is no other way.

1047
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:02,830
What else can we do?

1048
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:03,560
To eat them?

1049
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,160
Isn't this too much?

1050
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,310
Can you put them in the back?

1051
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,190
In the back?

1052
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:07,520
I won't watch.

1053
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,360
When I walk on the street,
it will make me look...

1054
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,600
You won't walk on the street.

1055
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:10,950
You can cover it up

1056
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:12,320
with your coat.

1057
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,360
My butt will look bigger.

1058
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,280
Am I entering a beauty contest?

1059
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:14,870
You can do it.

1060
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:15,390
You'll look sexy.

1061
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:16,000
Hurry.

1062
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,600
Just tell the teacher

1063
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,910
you've been working out.

1064
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,430
Hurry.

1065
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,320
Do you have to

1066
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,230
insult me

1067
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,150
when you put things on me?

1068
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:25,670
Qian Wei.

1069
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:25,950
I won't watch.

1070
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:26,870
I won't watch. Hurry.

1071
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,150
I think it's enough.

1072
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:28,560
It can't fit more?

1073
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:29,080
Let me do it.

1074
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:29,670
Come on.

1075
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:31,000
No.

1076
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:31,430
Listen.

1077
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:31,600
Don't move.

1078
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,320
It's here.

1079
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,000
Here!

1080
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,080
Come out. The teacher has gone.

1081
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,040
Well...

1082
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,150
We're destroying the evidence.

1083
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:42,520
Yes.

1084
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,710
I'm also

1085
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:44,560
working out my cute butt.

1086
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,000
Zixin.

1087
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,280
Thank you today.

1088
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:55,710
Otherwise,

1089
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,430
the whole debate team

1090
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:58,950
would be caught.

1091
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:00,120
It happened

1092
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,670
because of me.

1093
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:02,950
Actually, I owe you

1094
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:04,190
an apology.

1095
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,040
But putting up posters

1096
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,360
won't solve the problem for good.

1097
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,080
What are you going to do next?

1098
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,630
We put up posters

1099
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:13,320
to let these rumormongers

1100
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,360
feel that this event

1101
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,760
is beyond their expectations now.

1102
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,280
They're flustered now,

1103
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,910
and they will create
more rumors crazily.

1104
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:20,150
If that person continues
to spread rumors,

1105
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,870
these rumors

1106
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,870
will become less credible.

1107
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:24,390
If he still doesn't

1108
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:25,670
want to give up,

1109
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:26,670
he will have to

1110
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:28,600
stand out and find a way to stop me.

1111
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:28,950
Look.

1112
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:29,600
We flushed

1113
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,280
this rumormonger

1114
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:30,910
out today.

1115
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:32,390
We have the number of the person
who reported us,

1116
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:33,710
and we know when and where

1117
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:34,710
he made the call.

1118
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:35,670
It's probably someone
in the debate team.

1119
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,000
It's very possible

1120
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,710
that the person who reported us
is the one who posted rumors online.

1121
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:40,520
Anyway, Liu

1122
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,000
went to check

1123
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,630
the Internet protocol address.

1124
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:43,840
The Education Department

1125
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,080
should also have caller ID.

1126
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,360
If we follow the clues,

1127
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,120
we will find him anyway.

1128
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,800
The rumor counterattack

1129
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,950
is going to succeed!

1130
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:52,360
If that person

1131
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,710
is in the debate team,

1132
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:54,950
I think I know who it is.

1133
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:58,870
Hello.

1134
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,800
Okay, I'll be right there.

1135
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:03,630
Well,

1136
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:05,120
I'll go to the police station first.

1137
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:19,800
Wu Zhongyou was transferred
to the detention center?

1138
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,670
The police told me
the results of the investigation.

1139
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:23,520
Wu Zhongyou

1140
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,950
contacted me

1141
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:26,120
after he saw the information
on Fawei Online.

1142
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,000
But he didn't see it

1143
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,950
from the website.

1144
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:30,080
Someone gave it to him.

1145
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:31,560
It's Yu Tian.

1146
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:35,630
Mo Zixin and Liu

1147
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:36,630
also found out

1148
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:38,600
the number of the person
who called the Moral Education office,

1149
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,190
and the Internet protocol address

1150
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:40,120
of the rumormonger.

1151
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:41,840
It's also Yu Tian.

1152
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,230
I just don't get it.

1153
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,230
There is no grudge

1154
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:46,040
between us.

1155
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:46,600
Why would she

1156
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,870
try to hurt me

1157
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:49,230
again and again?

1158
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:51,040
On the other hand,

1159
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:51,840
I mean,

1160
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,800
she is my superior

1161
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,040
in the debate team.

1162
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,470
There's no conflict between us.

1163
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,630
Could it be an emotional motive?

1164
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:05,560
Wait.

1165
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:05,870
She...

1166
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:06,470
I...

1167
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:06,950
We...

1168
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:07,150
I...

1169
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:08,190
She is jealous

1170
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:08,870
because she likes me...

1171
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:10,120
I don't think it's possible.

1172
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:10,630
After all, I don't know her

1173
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:11,600
very well.

1174
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,080
She only tutored me.

1175
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:13,840
Do you know what I mean?

1176
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,950
During the debate.

1177
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:15,320
But if she did that

1178
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:15,560
because she likes me

1179
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,560
as you said...

1180
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,600
Not you.

1181
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,280
What is it?

1182
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,520
A love letter from my teammate

1183
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,190
in the debate team.

1184
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,430
She put it in my file.

1185
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,670
You're popular.

1186
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:36,190
I'll send it back anyway.

1187
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,840
Here.

1188
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,040
Well,

1189
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:49,710
I should go.

1190
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:03,470
It's Li Chongwen.

1191
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:04,600
Which means

1192
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,760
it was also Yu Tian

1193
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,520
who put a love letter for him

1194
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,430
in the file.

1195
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:13,670
I have an idea.

1196
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:24,800
You asked me out on the weekend.

1197
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,760
Are you ashamed to see others?

1198
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:30,190
See it by yourself.

1199
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:39,180
(Saturday)

1200
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,780
(Police Blotter)

1201
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,900
(Guanghua University)

1202
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:50,040
What do you mean?

1203
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,000
You have every right to hate me.

1204
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:56,120
But you introduced me to a fraud,

1205
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,000
spread rumors on the Internet,

1206
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,390
and reported your teammates

1207
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:00,630
who have been working with you,

1208
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,840
don't you think you've gone too far?

1209
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,600
Are you not afraid

1210
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,670
that they will get punishment?

1211
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:09,280
Didn't the police tell you

1212
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,950
that I only gave
your contact information

1213
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:12,040
to Wu Zhongyou?

1214
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,760
I didn't ask him to hurt you.

1215
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,280
I thought you would be late

1216
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,150
for the show at worst

1217
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,470
and have a fight with Lu Xun.

1218
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:19,000
I didn't know he would do that to you.

1219
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,280
Besides,

1220
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,840
the law does not punish
numerous offenders.

1221
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:25,630
Even if they

1222
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:26,840
get caught by the dean,

1223
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:27,560
you're the one to be punished

1224
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,870
as the leader.

1225
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:30,760
You dragged everyone into this

1226
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,230
because you want
to keep your qualification

1227
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,390
for the Municipal
Merit Student Selection.

1228
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,120
If you really care about them,

1229
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,800
you shouldn't get them involved.

1230
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:37,630
The debate team

1231
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:38,910
is not your harem.

1232
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,120
I'm not withdrawing the application,

1233
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,470
because I'm not a thief.

1234
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:45,120
I deserve the honor.

1235
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:45,950
They help me

1236
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,120
because they trust me,

1237
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:47,910
they know me,

1238
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:49,000
and they see me as a friend.

1239
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:50,840
Have you ever thought about it?

1240
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:52,520
No matter what terrible rumors

1241
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,600
you spread online,

1242
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,040
no matter how serious it becomes,

1243
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,390
those who trust me

1244
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:57,760
will always be on my side.

1245
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:00,910
They are fooled by you,

1246
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:02,190
but I won't.

1247
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,080
Who else could it be?

1248
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:04,470
If you didn't do it,

1249
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:05,670
why did you just let it go?

1250
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,360
Do you think I'm a fool?

1251
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,630
I let it go

1252
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:09,840
and Liu let it go

1253
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:11,520
because there is

1254
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,800
someone we want to protect.

1255
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,280
To be frank with you,

1256
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,040
the one who stole the jade

1257
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,190
wasn't any of my classmates

1258
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,390
that night!

1259
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,600
The debate team

1260
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,430
is the most united club in the school.

1261
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,520
You told me that
when I joined the debate team

1262
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,560
as a freshman.

1263
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:27,520
No matter who's in trouble,

1264
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,470
the rest of the team

1265
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:29,760
won't shirk their responsibility.

1266
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,230
If someone else

1267
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:32,470
is surrounded by rumors,

1268
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:33,800
I would stand out and do the same thing.
