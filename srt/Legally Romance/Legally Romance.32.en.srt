00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:09,640
Qian Wei,

2
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:14,150
thank you and Lu Xun

3
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,280
for making up for my regret

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,310
of not taking the graduation oath.

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,520
After today,

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,680
no matter what decision you make,

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,550
we'll respect it.

8
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:28,280
At least, I see today

9
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,600
that the fire in your eyes

10
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,200
has not turned into smoke.

11
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:53,420
(May…)

12
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,310
This is my belated graduation wish
for you.

13
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:14,740
(May Li Chongwen strive for a lifetime
of progress and enjoy it, without shame.)

14
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:16,760
Li Chongwen.

15
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:18,680
Actually, you do not need

16
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,950
to live so hard.

17
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,270
Unlike before,

18
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:23,480
you're not the same old you
who owns nothing.

19
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,480
It's time to find yourself back.

20
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,360
It's too late.

21
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,830
I have never forgotten

22
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,270
the original intention
of learning the law.

23
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:42,830
But unfortunately,

24
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,160
I can't find it anymore.

25
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,190
If I can still

26
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,270
make a wish,

27
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,760
I just wish you well

28
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,720
in every step you take

29
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:55,630
and don't "fall down" again.

30
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,040
I'm not afraid of falling.

31
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,000
Maybe that's

32
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,160
why we were no longer on the same path.

33
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,030
I gotta go.

34
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,160
Lan He has made a promise

35
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,360
to her father.

36
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,550
She will eliminate all those

37
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:20,470
who stand in her way

38
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,190
and finish the listing.

39
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,240
I don't want

40
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,440
anything to happen to you and Lu Xun.

41
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,520
Thank you for the heads up.

42
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,800
But I've promised Lu Xun.

43
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:34,910
No matter what challenges
we encounter,

44
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,520
we'll face it together

45
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:37,550
and won't give up.

46
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,660
(May Li Chongwen strive for a lifetime
of progress and enjoy it, without shame.)

49
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,160
Why are you here?

50
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:57,440
The police and Lan's men

51
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,510
are hunting for me right now.

52
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,320
I'm so scared.

53
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:01,510
I have no place

54
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,350
to go now.

55
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,230
Can you help me, please?

56
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,070
Easy.

57
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,320
Take your time.

58
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,070
I've worked all these years for them

59
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,640
without any benefits.

60
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,600
I did

61
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,440
whatever Wang Ruogu told me to do.

62
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,350
But how could he ask me,

63
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,110
an ordinary worker,

64
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,510
to take care of all the mess?

65
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,110
Ms. Lan did so

66
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,350
just to ask you

67
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,640
about Wang Ruogu's embezzlement.

68
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,790
Now the evidence in your hand

69
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,950
is your capital when negotiating
with them.

70
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,000
I can talk to her.

71
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,950
I saved the evidence

72
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,040
only for self-protection.

73
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,350
Inside AES,

74
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:47,760
you're the only one

75
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,760
I can trust.

76
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,000
Wang Ruogu has ended up like this,

77
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,390
let alone me?

78
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,950
What should I do?

79
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,670
Do you think I should go to turn myself

80
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:03,950
in for leniency?

81
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,230
But

82
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,270
you will get involved then,

83
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:07,760
right?

84
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:11,440
What if…

85
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,480
What if I leave the country

86
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,720
and live in the shadow from now on?

87
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,600
Can I get away with this?

88
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,950
I can't give you any advice on that.

89
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:23,000
Chongwen.

90
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:25,670
Chongwen.

91
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,000
For the sake of

92
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,440
four years of friendship,

93
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,270
would you please help me?

94
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:29,600
I came to Qingyun to be their finance

95
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,160
because of you.

96
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,640
I know.

97
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,830
I know you don't love me.

98
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,830
But you won't

99
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:37,640
leave me alone and to see me

100
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,640
go to jail, right?

101
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,000
I don't have a choice now.

102
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,720
I'm begging you, please!

103
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,110
Please, just help me.

104
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,440
Alright.

105
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,950
You can drive to and stay at my place
for a few days.

106
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,350
You can make your decision

107
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,720
until Wang Ruogu's trial is over.

108
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,600
And I will find out a way for you.

109
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:01,880
Thank you.

110
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,000
Here are the account books I copied.

111
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:11,760
I knew

112
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,920
that you're different
from the other people

113
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,390
in the company.

114
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,000
Chongwen,

115
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,600
if I can leave this place alive,

116
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,000
would you come with me?

117
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,110
Here's the evidence.
You keep it.

118
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,760
If Lan He suspects you,

119
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:45,670
you can use it

120
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,790
to make a bargain with her.

121
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:45,420
(Amendment of Qingyun Grant)

122
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,350
(I was right.)

123
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,150
(The spinning wheel ring
doesn't have a superpower.)

124
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,840
(The reason why I make dreams)

125
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,400
(is because of the brain therapy.)

126
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:20,670
How do you feel?

127
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,640
Without wearing the ring,

128
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,320
I didn't and I won't have dreams.

129
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,470
That's great.

130
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:28,520
From now on, you don't have to worry

131
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,000
about what happens in your dreams.

132
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,710
I'm still scared

133
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,960
about the fire last time.

134
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,520
I was hoping to use
the precognitive dream

135
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,110
to see

136
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,710
what AES will do later.

137
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:38,790
But

138
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,320
I can't have the dream now.

139
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,840
I became an ordinary person

140
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,790
from a prophet.

141
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:44,790
I feel a little uncomfortable with it.

142
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,030
Then you have to

143
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,520
get used to it,

144
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,080
right?

145
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,230
I was thinking,

146
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,200
even if the case of Lan He

147
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,960
is filed today,

148
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,000
if someone bails her out,

149
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,880
she can still get away,

150
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,110
or find someone to revenge against us.

151
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:00,150
Shall we see

152
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,080
if she has

153
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,000
any other previous charges

154
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,110
and then hold her in custody first?

155
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,230
This way, she won't have time

156
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,030
to make a move.

157
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,520
Why did you think so?

158
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,400
You did have a dream, didn't you?

159
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,840
No.

160
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,960
If I did have a dream,

161
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,590
I wouldn't have been so worried now.

162
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,350
I'm telling you,

163
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,400
we're lawyers.

164
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,880
We can only go far in the industry

165
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,110
if we follow the rules.

166
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:19,320
If you

167
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,150
go like this,

168
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,840
you'll never get your license.

169
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:23,710
I know.

170
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,200
Excuse me.

171
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:28,880
I'm sorry.

172
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,550
There was something wrong
with my wife.

173
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,080
Why did you cover for me again?

174
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,280
Did you get hurt?

175
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,520
No, I'm fine.

176
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,320
Obviously,

177
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,280
I did it

178
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:42,790
out of my instinct.

179
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:43,590
Did you just feel it?

180
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,110
(If I tell you)

181
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,320
(what happened in my dream,)

182
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,470
(you'll go with me.)

183
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,080
(But that's why)

184
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,320
(you would have been there
to protect me)

185
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:54,960
(and get into a car accident.)

186
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,200
(No, I can't.)

187
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,110
(I can't risk your life.)

188
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,230
(I'm sorry. Lu Xun.)

189
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,670
(It's my instinct to protect you too.)

190
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,000
(We're just)

191
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,230
(the tools of capital.)

192
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,320
(But we have to sacrifice our dreams
and lives)

193
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,150
(for their ambitions.)

194
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:17,080
(It's not worth it.)

195
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,080
(Li Chongwen,)

196
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,080
(unlike before,)

197
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,200
(you're not the same old you
who owns nothing.)

198
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,110
(It's time to find yourself back.)

(It's Christmas.)

and hasn't got back yet.)

(The first person to get married is a dog.)
(@Qian Chuan Loves Shiyun)

206
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:48,640
(How are you gonna spend it?)

207
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,760

(Busy. I will do it later.)

211

Qian Wei.

212
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,520
If my guess is correct,

213
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,760
Lu Xun should not have time

214
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,880
to go out with you, right?

215
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,350
Don't worry.

216
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:37,520
You have me,

217
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,520
Lawyer Wu,

218

the most understanding man
in Zhanying.

219
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,110
I and a few colleagues

220
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:44,150
are having a big party

221
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,230
named "No drink,

222
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,280
no return

223
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,030
and drink

224
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,030
till dawn."

225
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,550
Do you wanna join us?

226
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,280
No thanks.

227
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:54,980
(Lu Xun, Merry Christmas!)

228
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,390
(This is the first time)
Lu Xun must have

229
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:55,760
(I've spent the holiday with you in this way.)
Lu Xun must have

230
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,470
(It's always you who prepare surprises for me.)
prepared a surprise for me

231
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:57,470
at home.

232
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,840
You guys

233
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,670
go enjoy your single life.

234
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:00,590
Have fun.

235
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:01,350
Look.

236
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,440
I'm just concerned about you.

237
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,640
Well, you're giving me a hard time

238
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,080
with your lovey-dovey.

239
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:09,790
Alright.

240
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:11,110
Merry Chri…

241
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:15,880
Merry Christmas!

242
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,960
He hasn't called me yet.

243
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,400
Is he in danger?

244
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,020
(Lu Xun)

245
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,030
Hey.

246
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,550
Why are you covering my eyes again?

247
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,200
You're not going to do some magic trick,
are you?

248
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,470
No, I'm not.

249
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:43,590
This is a magic trick

250
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,840
that the gods have sent me to do.

251
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,150
We're almost there.

252
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:47,840
Wait a minute.

253
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,350
Okay. Open your eyes.

254
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:55,760
Do you like it?

255
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:58,880
Can't believe it's snowing in Haizhou.

256
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:03,910
When snowflakes fall into your hand,

257
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:05,840
do you know

258
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,350
how to keep it

259
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,150
from melting?

260
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,440
What are you talking about?

261
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,110
Look!

262
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:14,520
Do you want a pair of gloves?

263
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,200
What gloves?

264
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,640
Really?

265
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,590
You knitted them?

266
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,400
Give me your hand like this.

267
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,590
Got it?

268
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,320
Of course.

269
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,030
Why not?

270
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,400
Did you knit them?

271
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,470
Sure.

272
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,320
With the gloves,

273
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,280
I'm telling you,

274
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,200
the snow won't melt.

275
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,520
What is this?

276
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:51,230
This…

277
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,710
Look.

278
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,710
It's not that hard.

279
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:56,910
As soon as I proposed,

280
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:57,520
this ring

281
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,110
comes to your finger by itself.

282
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:01,470
Looks like she can't wait to say yes.

283
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,670
What?

284
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:07,470
What're you doing?

285
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:08,440
Why…

286
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,350
Why are you putting this on me?

287
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,590
You just tacitly consent

288
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:13,030
to be my wife.

289
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,110
What? No.

290
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,230
That was a scam.

291
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:15,960
You…Take it off…

292
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,760
Alright. I'll tell you what.

293
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,230
I deceived you to be my wife, so what?

294
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,910
Yes, I lied.

295
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,110
But you already have my ring
worn on your finger.

296
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,110
So what can you do now?

297
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,000
But

298
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:25,350
now

299
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:26,670
I

300
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,030
have a serious question

301
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,320
to ask now.

302
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,200
I find that

303
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,520
no matter when

304
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,520
I hold your hand,

305
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,030
I do not want

306
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,030
to let it go.

307
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,350
Let me ask you a question now.

308
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,350
Qian Wei.

309
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,000
Will you marry me?

310
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:00,910
No, I won't.

311
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:01,790
No, I won't.

312
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,320
No, you can't just propose like that.

313
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,160
It's quite different

314
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,680
from what I've expected.

315
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,470
Take it off now! Take it off now!

316
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,590
Why is it different?

317
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:08,040
What do you want then?

318
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,350
Everything is different.

319
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:11,190
And I didn't even wash my hair today.

320
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:13,400
Your hair?

321
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,350
It's okay. I don't care.

322
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:22,640
W-What are you doing?

323
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,070
You're overreacting.

324
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,800
I don't care
whether you've washed your hair or not.

325
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,230
Anyway,

326
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,280
if you don't say yes,

327
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,190
I'll keep proposing to you

328
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,280
until you are not willing to

329
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,000
take off the ring

330
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,040
even I beg you to.

331
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,590
How is that?

332
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,520
But it doesn't count this time.

333
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,560
Actually, I have one more question

334
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,640
to ask.

335
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,800
Do you think me in 2022

336
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,190
is better than

337
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:58,110
the younger Lu Xun in the dream?

338
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,400
Each of you has your own merits.

339
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,640
Each of us has our own merits?

340
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,640
If he's real,

341
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:08,920
he will be

342
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,830
one in a million.

343
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,430
What?

344
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:13,950
Forget it if you didn't hear it.

345
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:14,310
I?

346
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,430
One in a million?

347
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,350
What did you just say?

348
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:22,110
But at least,

349
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,470
I am happy at this moment.

350
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,310
Although you keep

351
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,110
saying "no ",

352
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,280
I know

353
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,280
deep down in your heart,

354
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,640
you must be so happy about it.

355
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,880
I guess the fireworks in your heart

356
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,590
have been lit up.

357
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,310
Look at those two flakes of snow

358
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,160
being together just like us.

359
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,920
The bigger one with the small one.

360
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:10,830
You know,

361
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,760
ever since the day I entered Zhanying,

362
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,520
I've always wanted

363
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,470
to sit in this boss chair

364
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:16,070
and look at you standing still
in front of me.

365
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:16,590
And I'll just

366
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,110
spin and spin around.

367
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:19,310
To be honest,

368
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,430
I'm already dizzy
from your spinning.

369
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,070
In fact,

370
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,190
I've always had a dream too.

371
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:26,710
What?

372
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,040
It's that

373
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,230
when you're sitting

374
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:30,680
in this boss chair,

375
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:33,640
I can…

376
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,710
This is not the conference room,
isn't it?

377
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,590
What?

378
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,710
I'm getting old

379
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,280
so the memories have been fading.

380
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,800
Unlike you guys,

381
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,950
energetic,

382
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,310
enthusiastic,

383
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,040
like fire.

384
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,190
How many times have you done
such things?

385
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:57,560
Do you have something to tell me?
I…

386
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:58,920
Tao.

387
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:11,260
(Lan He)

388
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,860
(Recording)

389
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,500
(Lan He)

390
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:21,230
Hi, Miss Lan.

391
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,950
Lu Xun is occupied at this moment.

392
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,000
This is Qian Wei speaking.

393
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,400
Hi, Miss Qian.

394
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,470
It's the same to talk to you.

395
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:29,680
When do you have time

396
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,230
to come

397
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,920
to Yuhua, my club, this week?

398
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,190
I just received

399
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,560
a bottle of wine
from Chateau d'Yquem,

400
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,040
so we can talk over drinks.

401
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,280
(In the dream, Lu Xun's car accident)

402
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,350
(took place outside of Yuhua Club.)

403
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,950
(What will be, will be.)

404
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:48,590
Mr. Lu

405
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,040
isn't feeling well lately

406
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,920
and can't drink alcohol.

407
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:52,520
The reason why you contacted us

408
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,350
is that you wanna buy

409
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,520
what we have, right?

410
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:56,280
In that case,

411
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,560
why don't you come to the law firm

412
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,470
and we'll talk?

413
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,400
If we make a deal,

414
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,520
we can draw up a contract right away.

415
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,640
It would be more convenient.

416
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,070
You're a smart person.

417
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,310
You know what I'm going to buy.

418
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,590
But I believe it's more appropriate

419
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,830
to come to my place to talk.

420
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,680
Don't worry.

421
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,350
We have surveillance there.

422
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:13,880
You will be safe.

423
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,950
Mr. Lan, you're joking.

424
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,430
I don't mean that.

425
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,230
It's just that

426
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,800
our law firm has been busy lately.

427
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,920
And we may not be able to get away,

428
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,000
so why don't we meet in two weeks?

429
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,590
I don't have the patience for that.

430
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:30,310
If Miss Qian has

431
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,230
any concern,

432
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,160
I will go to Lu Xun.

433
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,830
I'm sure he will find time
in his busy schedule

434
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,280
to meet with me.

435
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,040
Since you are in such a hurry,

436
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,040
why don't we do this Friday?

437
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,470
I will be there with Lu Xun.

438
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,280
The reason why Fawei Online

439
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,400
is willing to cooperate
with universities

440
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,190
is to

441
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,350
win the reputation in the industry.

442
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,430
To put it bluntly,
it's all about money.

443
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,350
If Miss Lan is sincere enough,

444
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,110
we don't mind

445
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,310
giving away

446
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:57,040
this hot potato.

447
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,350
Okay then.

448
00:21:59,110 --> 00:21:59,830
See you on Friday.

449
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,280
See you this Friday, then.

450
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,260
(Recent calls, Lan He, deleted)

451
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:12,460
(All recordings)

452
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,470
(If Lan He could believe)

453
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:17,310
(that I just wanted money,)

454
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,950
(and thus give up killing him,)

455
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:19,560
(it would be the best scenario.)

456
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,590
(If she doesn't fall for it,)

457
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,280
(I'll just have to…)

458
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:28,430
(This time,)

459
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,400
(I will protect Lu Xun.)

460
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:48,000
Don't rush to blame me yet.

461
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,470
Yes.

462
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,000
I did have a dream again.

463
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,520
I dreamt that

464
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:58,400
a car crashed into us

465
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,640
and you pushed me out of the way.

466
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:04,680
I also hope

467
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,950
you won't have to see this video.

468
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,590
I also wish

469
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Lan He hadn't made that call.

470
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,190
Then there wouldn't have been
a car accident.

471
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,640
You can't say I do it on a whim.

472
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,160
I'm telling you,

473
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,830
I've given it a lot of thought.

474
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:22,070
I know,

475
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,520
you said we should face it together.

476
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,040
But in the dream

477
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:27,590
it was because

478
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:28,800
we faced it together

479
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:31,920
that you pushed me away

480
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,590
and got hit by a car yourself.

481
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,040
I would rather sacrifice myself

482
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,880
than let you get hurt.

483
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:45,000
So I am determined

484
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,160
to prevent this dream to come true.

485
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,470
I also thought about

486
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:56,760
taking a break.

487
00:23:59,110 --> 00:23:59,760
But it's true

488
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,070
that we never got the evidence

489
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,590
of Qingyun's money laundry.

490
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,310
So there's no way

491
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,880
to bring Lan He to justice.

492
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:09,230
Besides,

493
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,160
she must have thought
of a way out long ago.

494
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,880
If she ran away,

495
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:16,400
we would have let go

496
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,950
of a time bomb.

497
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,830
We can't let this happen.

498
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,000
So it is not a bad thing

499
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:22,800
for her to ask us out.

500
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,230
Just think about that.

501
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,350
We'll just use

502
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:27,590
the criminal law to control her
when the time comes.

503
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,190
Isn't that exciting?

504
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,520
Only when she's caught

505
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,470
can we be truly safe.

506
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:38,310
Speaking of safety,

507
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,230
I'll tell you this.

508
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,310
I'm not just stupidly

509
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,470
waiting to get hit either.

510
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:42,830
I'm fully

511
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:43,710
prepared.

512
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:44,640
They say

513
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:46,070
that the head is most vulnerable

514
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,190
when getting hit.

515
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:47,880
Look.

516
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:49,310
I got a helmet.

517
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:49,880
And…

518
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,000
Siren suit. See?

519
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,590
I will wear it when the time comes.

520
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,520
With it, I can reduce
a certain impact.

521
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,400
And look.

522
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:58,800
These knee pads, hand pads
and all that.

523
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,920
I'm fully prepared.

524
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:00,680
And this.

525
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,280
See?

526
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,160
I've been practicing it every day.

527
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,310
I'm very strong now.

528
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,640
But just in case,

529
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:22,280
just in case,

530
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,920
I ran out of luck

531
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:28,070
and something

532
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,400
happened to me.

533
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,190
Don't blame yourself then.

534
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:36,680
And don't blame me either.

535
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,430
At that time,

536
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,070
you must…

537
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,590
you must live well.

538
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,680
At least I'll be glad

539
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,350
that I've made the right decision,

540
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,400
not letting this

541
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,640
happen to you,

542
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,110
alright?

543
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,830
I recorded this video

544
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:05,430
just in case,

545
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:06,430
it's not like

546
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:07,800
anything will truly happen.

547
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:08,880
And maybe

548
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,190
you can't even see it,

549
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,470
right?

550
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:17,350
I won't say anything else.

551
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:20,680
We all know what I mean.

552
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,560
I love you.

553
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:40,070
Wei,

554
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,070
time for lunch.

555
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,760
Well.

556
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,470
You should invite Liu's parents

557
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,000
to come here ASAP,

558
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,400
so that we can

559
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,680
have your marriage matter settled.

560
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,040
Okay. I know.

561
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,430
Just come out.

562
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:26,520
Well,

563
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,280
the first meeting of both parents

564
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,350
is arranged in the bathing center.

565
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,800
Your family is kind of weird.

566
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,070
We happen to run a bath center.

567
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,400
His father and I have long

568
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,470
wanted to invite you guys
to come over

569
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:38,880
and have a relaxing experience.

570
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,000
Let's go pick ears

571
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,830
after the foot massage, okay?

572
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:42,760
It's very comfortable.

573
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:44,310
Yeah.

574
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,430
This is the first time
we officially meet.

575
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:48,950
And we're naked in the bath,

576
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,430
scrubbing our backs,

577
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:52,920
and doing oil foot massage.

578
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:54,640
We're so relaxed,

579
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,590
not nervous at all.

580
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,560
Thank you for being so sweet.

581
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,680
Shiyun is a generous and decent girl.

582
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,760
We're happy

583
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,760
to have her to be with Chuan.

584
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,430
Chuan is also a nice little guy.

585
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,230
The masseur is a novice.

586
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,560
He scratched Chuan accidentally

587
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,800
when giving a scrub to him.

588
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,590
But Chuan didn't say a word.

589
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:16,920
If her father hadn't told me,

590
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,040
I wouldn't have known about it.

591
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:19,430
Yeah.

592
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:21,560
Uncle has taken Qian Chuan away

593
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,430
for more than an hour,

594
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,000
there won't be any problem, right?

595
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,710
He won't kill my brother, will he?

596
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,000
Mom,

597
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,070
didn't we agree

598
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,190
not to make things difficult
for Qian Chuan before?

599
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:30,950
I can be particularly

600
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:31,400
happy

601
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,350
with Chuan.

602
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,520
We gotta wait to see

603
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,590
if Chuan can get

604
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:35,950
your father's approval.

605
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,430
Take your time.

606
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:40,040
- It's okay.
- These two people…

607
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,620
(Pavilion of Mental Cultivation)

608
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:46,760
Qian Chuan,

609
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:48,760
what did you do to my father?

610
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,000
Does this place look familiar?

611
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,110
I heard

612
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,230
that you've been close

613
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,520
to my daughter.

614
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,070
You've been

615
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,280
to all these boxing gyms.

616
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,310
Come on.

617
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,400
Come on.

618
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:27,680
Come on.

619
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,800
What?

620
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:31,920
No time limit.

621
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,070
No limit to the number of times.

622
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,560
Let's see who can do more.

623
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:35,470
Come on.

624
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:37,160
That's it?

625
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,000
Are you scared?

626
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:40,800
No, I'm...

627
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:42,710
I'm afraid you'll get exhausted.

628
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:43,760
Cut the crap.

629
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:44,760
Just do it.

630
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:46,280
Do the count.

631
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:15,880
Kid,

632
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:17,880
can you still hold on?

633
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:19,800
Yes.

634
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:21,710
Uncle,

635
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,800
you're in good health.

636
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,190
Of course.

637
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,110
I could have done better.

638
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
If you can't do it,

639
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,350
you can take a break.

640
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,400
No.

641
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:43,800
They're counting.

642
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,110
I'm telling you.

643
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:51,430
If you can't continue,

644
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,190
you can choose to give up.

645
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:55,070
It won't affect my impression of you.

646
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:57,760
Uncle,

647
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:00,400
first of all,

648
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,190
as an athlete,

649
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,310
I never give up.

650
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:06,880
I'm telling you.

651
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,680
Keeping fit is like

652
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,400
working.

653
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,680
You have to take one step at a time.

654
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,310
Actually,

655
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:18,710
it's all about breaking through.

656
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,640
Every day you go up a step,

657
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,830
and you'd make a little progress.

658
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,710
I see.

659
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,800
You have a step now.

660
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:29,760
Why not leave a step for the others?

661
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,560
What?

662
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,040
- Brother.
- Boss.

663
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,000
Well…

664
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:41,470
Uncle.

665
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:42,760
Get out of the way!

666
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:44,590
No,

667
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:46,040
your boss needs some air.

668
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:46,680
Get out of the way!

669
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:48,830
Uncle.

670
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:50,830
Get some water.

671
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:52,800
Come on.

672
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:53,760
Are you alright, Uncle?

673
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,110
Get some water.

674
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:56,280
Here.

675
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,800
I'll go get some glucose water.

676
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:58,830
Come back. Come back.

677
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,560
That's not necessary.

678
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:04,640
I found

679
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,350
you're a block-headed guy.

680
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,760
You just won't even let it go.

681
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:11,310
I'm sorry, Uncle.

682
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,160
I didn't know that…

683
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,070
I was…

684
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:13,680
If I leave my daughter

685
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,110
to someone like you…

686
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,560
No, uncle.

687
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,950
I love Shiyun, seriously.

688
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,430
I will take good care of her

689
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:20,350
and you and Auntie as well.

690
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:21,520
I promise that I'll be…

691
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,160
I was gonna say

692
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,520
that if I leave my daughter

693
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,160
to someone like you,

694
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:27,680
I will rest reassured.

695
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:31,800
Listen.

696
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,430
Liu Shiyun

697
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,800
has been simple

698
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,400
since she was a child,

699
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,430
so I can't let her be

700
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:38,070
with a shrewd boy.

701
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:39,760
I am afraid that my little girl

702
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,800
will be cheated by others.

703
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,640
You look

704
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,950
quite honest

705
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:47,760
and don't play mind.

706
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:49,110
Yeah. Uncle.

707
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:50,230
I don't even know how to play mind.

708
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,230
It's always someone else who fools me.

709
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:51,950
Okay.

710
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,710
Then you should also behave yourself.

711
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,430
Got it.

712
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:58,310
I and her mother,

713
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,800
and your elders as well,

714
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,040
all of us will all grow old slowly.

715
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:03,470
So later on,

716
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:05,470
there're many things for you guys
to handle on your own.

717
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,640
Just remember,

718
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,800
from now on,

719
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:10,350
you have to leave adequate leeway
for the others.

720
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:12,190
Yes, Sir.

721
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:12,830
I will…

722
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:13,710
I will leave

723
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:15,040
so much leeway for the others.

724
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,400
I, Uncle…

725
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:17,640
No, Dad.

726
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,680
I'll take good care of Shiyun

727
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,470
and won't let her down

728
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:22,430
and won't burden her.

729
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:22,880
By the way,

730
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,760
I…

731
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,110
If she doesn't want to go up the steps,

732
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:25,800
I'm physically fit

733
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,710
and I can carry her on my back.

734
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:27,110
I will…

735
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:28,310
Enough.

736
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,640
Don't bother me here.

737
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,680
I have to take a break.

738
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,190
Okay.

739
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,680
Listen.

740
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,110
Marriage

741
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,190
is not a competition.

742
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,950
What I need to know now is

743
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:45,950
whether you are worthy
of being Liu Shiyun's husband.

744
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,560
Let me tell you.

745
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,430
Even if you are the world champion,

746
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:50,560
as long as you let my daughter down,

747
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,430
it won't work.

748
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:52,920
Yes.

749
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:55,800
Honey,

750
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:57,950
this kid is quite faithful.

751
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:59,040
I think he's good.

752
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:00,640
I'm always good at reading people.

753
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,000
I guess

754
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,880
he can definitely tolerate
our daughter's

755
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,470
reckless behaviors.

756
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,590
Dad.

757
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:07,830
Who's reckless?

758
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:09,390
Would you please save some face
for me?

759
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:10,630
Sweetheart,

760
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,800
there is a long time ahead.

761
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,280
There will come a time

762
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,520
when your pretense will come to light.

763
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,430
Just be yourself.

764
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,280
Auntie, Uncle.

765
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,120
Don't worry.

766
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,280
I will always

767
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:24,320
make Shiyun happy.

768
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:25,910
Liu,

769
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,190
you don't have to pretend to be a kitty.

770
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:30,360
You can always be a Manchurian Tiger.

771
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:38,430
Your parents are so sweet.

772
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,000
Tell them

773
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,710
that there's no need to arrange any more
programs.

774
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:42,840
It's okay.

775
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:44,470
Just let them do whatever they want.

776
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,000
You…

777
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,430
You'll have more duties

778
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:53,190
on your shoulders in the future.

779
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:53,950
Not only should you take care of Mom,

780
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:55,390
but also Liu's happiness.

781
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,520
Even if you are busy in love,

782
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,360
don't forget to go back
to stay with Mom for a while.

783
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:02,800
You're proposed

784
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,470
and associated with Lu Xun closely,

785
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:05,430
like every day.

786
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,360
The number of times you go home
has dropped dramatically,

787
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:08,560
and you still have the nerve
to talk about me?

788
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,360
Can you come home more often?

789
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,840
What's wrong with you?

790
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,430
You didn't even eat a lot

791
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:23,320
of the buffet just now.

792
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,950
It's not like

793
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:26,520
what you'd do.

794
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,710
What're you talking about?

795
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:28,910
Don't be silly.

796
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,360
Are you feeling bad

797
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:31,360
if I don't scold you?

798
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,560
No wonder you fell in love

799
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,230
with the daughter
of the president of the boxing association.

800
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:35,190
You're so chatty.

801
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:37,910
I'm serious.

802
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:38,710
We're counting on you from now on.

803
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,230
I know.

804
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,760
He is in your hands.

805
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:43,670
Don't worry.

806
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,470
I'll take care of him from now on.

807
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:46,600
No one

808
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,630
dares to bully him except me.

809
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:55,320
Mom,

810
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,390
this is the ticket

811
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:00,710
for the cruise that you want to go on.

812
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:02,150
And the saving card of the supermarket

813
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:03,150
you often go to.

814
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:04,040
And

815
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,190
inside here are

816
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,760
the concert tickets of Jacky Cheung.

817
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,150
It's your birthday soon.

818
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,470
If I don't

819
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:12,280
have time for you then,

820
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,360
don't blame me for that.

821
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:14,840
Oops!

822
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:17,150
Looks like you did get a raise.

823
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,470
I never thought a cheapskate like you

824
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:20,390
would have spent so much money.

825
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,190
That's great.

826
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:28,230
Whether I'm here or not,

827
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:30,280
take care of yourself

828
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:32,760
and be happy.

829
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:36,520
You used to say that Dad was cheesy.

830
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:38,470
But it's good to express one's feelings

831
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:40,080
in time.

832
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,910
I also have to learn from him.

833
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,470
Love you.

834
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,230
It seems that my little girl

835
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:52,390
has indeed grown up.

836
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,760
Is that
because you're you getting married

837
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,040
and can't leave us behind?

838
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:02,360
It's okay.

839
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:03,950
Look.

840
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:05,600
Lu loves you

841
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,040
and spoils you so much.

842
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,390
You can always

843
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,870
come home for dinner.

844
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:15,630
It's just a marriage,

845
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,870
why are you rambling,

846
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:17,870
like you're dying.

847
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,280
Why do you always have that much
to say?

848
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:22,390
Eat your fruit.

849
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:04,560
The weekend is coming.

850
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:05,600
Do you have any plans?

851
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,040
The weekend is coming?

852
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,390
I wish we could both sleep

853
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:14,600
at home

854
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,800
until we wake up.

855
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:20,190
After we get up,

856
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,320
we can

857
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:23,870
go for a walk or something.

858
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:24,430
What do you say?

859
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:25,430
And

860
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:27,150
the Civil Affairs Bureau doesn't seem

861
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:28,080
to be too far from us.

862
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,840
Let's go to the Civil Affairs Bureau
and take a picture

863
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,040
and sign our names or something.

864
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,080
What do you say?

865
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,670
Let's get married.

866
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,600
Nice try.

867
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,910
I was gonna tell you

868
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:49,470
that your proposal
on the Ferris Wheel doesn't count.

869
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,150
How dare you…!

870
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:52,910
Then, give me back the ring.

871
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:54,040
Why are you still wearing it?

872
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:54,800
Take it off for me.

873
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,630
Why?

874
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:57,000
This ring belonged to me.

875
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,950
It was you who insisted

876
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:58,600
on putting a diamond on it.

877
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,470
I'm telling you,

878
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,360
I still have the right

879
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:01,950
to use the evidence itself,

880
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:02,470
you know?

881
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:06,560
Something's wrong with you.

882
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,760
You're definitely up to something.

883
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:11,560
Come on. Tell me.

884
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,390
I'll help you out.

885
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,190
That's what you do every time.

886
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:15,950
As soon as I can't be convinced

887
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:17,950
you start looking for something
else to talk about.

888
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,320
What could be on my mind?

889
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:19,950
Look.

890
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,670
The cooperation
between Fawei and Guanghua

891
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:23,230
is going to be settled soon, right?

892
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,430
The money laundry of Qingyun

893
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:25,390
has also come to a head.

894
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:26,760
The firm is gonna pay
out the year-end bonus.

895
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,150
I'm telling you,

896
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:27,840
the year 2022

897
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,430
is the best year

898
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:29,600
throughout my life.

899
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,430
I can fight monsters

900
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:32,080
by myself.

901
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,120
You mind your own business.

902
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:35,040
I see.

903
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:36,950
You can't forget

904
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:37,910
the younger Lu Xun,

905
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:38,470
can you?

906
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:41,150
I never thought,

907
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,120
oh my God,

908
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,910
that my love rival would be myself.

909
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,190
I can only say that

910
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,600
I have been so charming
since I was a child.

911
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:50,950
Fine.

912
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,360
You know that I like snow.

913
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,470
What about this?

914
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:57,710
Now that your last proposal
doesn't count,

915
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,000
we'll get married

916
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,280
when it snows again.

917
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:03,230
Snowy day in Haizhou?

918
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:04,800
It hasn't snowed in Haizhou for years.

919
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,000
You're

920
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,040
setting me a trap here obviously.

921
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:09,080
Now I have a question to ask you.

922
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,320
The younger Lu Xun and me,

923
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:10,950
if you have to choose one

924
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:11,560
between us,

925
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,120
who would you like to choose?

926
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:15,000
It's not easy to choose.

927
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,710
You know?

928
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:17,950
Although you

929
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:19,470
are mature and steady,

930
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:20,150
he

931
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:20,840
is cute

932
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,120
and obedient.

933
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:22,800
He treated me well

934
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,910
and never got pissed off.

935
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:25,040
And at that time,

936
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,520
his hair was also more luxuriant.

937
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:40,120
I

938
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,390
have loved you longer than him.

939
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,470
Then shouldn't you choose me?

940
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,560
Whether the younger Lu Xun

941
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,630
or the older one,

942
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:56,080
it's you.

943
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,520
You are the best.

944
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,080
Then you're the most important

945
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,870
