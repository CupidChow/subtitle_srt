2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:04,190
Let's welcome

3
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:05,630
performers of 300 Years of Mundane Bond

4
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:07,000
from the Law Department

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,670
to come on stage.

6
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:10,270
- Bravo.
- Come on.

7
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:11,390
Come on.

8
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:12,230
Come on. You can do it.

9
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:17,680
Well,

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,550
girl,

11
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,000
is it a musical?

12
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:22,600
Yes, sir.

13
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,790
This musical

14
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:24,920
tells a story

15
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,310
from the angle of the scorpion spirit.

16
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:27,760
Then...

17
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,950
- Stop, stop.
- They...

18
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:30,040
Explain this later.

19
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,590
Now that it's a musical,

20
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:33,720
music comes first.

21
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,520
Why don't you

22
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,240
sing a little bit for us?

23
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,080
Fine.

27
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:02,520
Girl,

28
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,360
stop, stop.

29
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:04,910
You failed the high pitch

30
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:05,630
as well as the low pitch.

31
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:06,480
You were totally out of tune.

32
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,510
You're messing things up.

33
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:08,080
Aren't you?

34
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:08,480
What?

35
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,160
Sir, wait.

36
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,000
This is

37
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,680
a musical.

38
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,630
However,

39
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:15,310
we mostly act and occasionally sing.

40
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,590
Besides,

41
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,550
we don't judge a musician

42
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:20,910
only upon his singing ability,

43
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:22,400
but also upon

44
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:23,950
his arrangement ability.

45
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,080
Right, right.

46
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:25,950
We will

47
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,360
accept all kinds of talents.

48
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,830
Now that she can arrange songs,

49
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:29,630
she's that kind of talent

50
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:30,830
we need

51
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:31,800
in society.

52
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,590
Let's give her a chance.

00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,880
Girl,

81
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,390
the song you just sang was

82
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,600
beautiful

83
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,000
and touching.

84
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,030
When you were singing,

85
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,320
I felt what you tried

86
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,880
to express.

87
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,720
But I think

88
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,880
the costumes go over budget.

89
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,670
You're short of actors, too.

90
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,160
It's quite risky.

91
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:02,830
Sir, I...

92
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:03,800
I can pay for the costumes.

93
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,270
Okay?

94
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,030
I can pay for them.

95
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,360
But it's against our school rules.

96
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,600
Come on, sir.

97
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,390
There are always more solutions.

98
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:10,960
We can't just give up

99
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,190
without a struggle.

100
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,600
Yeah, sir.

101
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,600
Last year, I hosted

102
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,470
the evening party for the freshmen.

103
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm quite experienced.

104
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,950
I can help them

105
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,390
to minimize the budget.

106
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,760
What will you do

107
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,230
with their costume budget?

108
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:21,720
Their costume...

109
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,830
Sir,

110
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,320
I can offer basic costumes

111
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,640
for the musical.

112
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,950
They only need to be slightly altered.

113
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:27,950
We don't need an extra budget.

114
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:28,920
Zixin,

115
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,600
your father is a stock tycoon,

116
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,830
not a clothing tycoon.

117
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,000
How can you get so many costumes?

118
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,640
Don't worry. I can handle that.

119
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,200
Sir,

120
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,160
I'm from the Department of P.E.

121
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,480
I'm quite strong.

122
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,160
When I help them,

123
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:40,920
I can do the work of two.

124
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,000
They won't be short of actors, then.

125
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,720
That's right.

126
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,440
We'll help.

127
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,000
Now that you guys are

128
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,480
quite active,

129
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,110
I guess the shortage of actors

130
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:48,760
will not be a problem.

131
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,920
Play in the musical together,

132
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,640
all right?

133
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,270
Together?

134
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,160
What?

135
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,230
If you can't,

136
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:55,880
I have to disapprove

137
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,720
of your musical.

138
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,640
No, no.

139

Seriously?

Zixin,

155
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,600
you like cosplay?

156
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,510
I like watching comics.

157
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,160
So,

158
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,000
I've collected

159
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,390
some costumes of anime characters.

160
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,230
But my mother thinks

161
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,880
they're of no use.

I have to

165

collect some costumes secretly

without letting anyone else know.

No, Zixin.

You're our savior.

171

Without you,

172
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,760
how could I

173
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,760
find so many costumes?

174
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,550
I think the costumes can be used

175
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:08,440
after being slightly altered.

176
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,110

on lighting and stage art instead.

178
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,440
Shiyun, come over.

179
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:20,880
Shiyun.

180
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:22,670
Director Liu.

181
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:23,880
Think about it.

182
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,600
We're close friends.

183
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,510
Could you pull some strings

184
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,110
and give me a role

185
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,480
that communicates more with Zixin?

186
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,350
It's too late.

187
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:33,640
The roles have been assigned already.

188
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:34,510
Look.

189
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,110
Me, Chang'e.

190
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,760
Zixin, the Star Lord.

191
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,950
Li Chongwen, Sun Wukong.

192
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:42,790
Qian Wei, the scorpion spirit.

193
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,510
Tang Monk...

194
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:46,670
You're not the right person for it.

195
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,200
Only one role is available.

196
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:48,790
Any role will do,

197
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:49,950
as long as I can see Zixin.

198
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,510
The famous Marshal Tianpeng.

199
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,160
All right.

200
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,350
Isn't that just Zhu Bajie?

201
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,350
You want me to be a pig

202
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,600
in front of my fair lady?

203
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,480
In everyone's life,

204
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,110
he has acted like a pig.

205
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,440
You'll at least be a famous pig.

206
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:01,950
Right?

207
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,510
Don't be sad.

208
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,320
How about this?

209
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,350
I'll provide you

210
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,480
with free river snails
rice noodles forever

211
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,480
as the compensation.

212
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,000
Okay?

213
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:14,480
Fine.

214
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:15,720
Okay.

215
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,640
Lu Xun hasn't made any efforts

216
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,160
to make up with me.

217
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:20,760
He didn't even come to the rehearsal.

218
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:29,550
Actually, I'm not that angry.

219
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,830
Thank you for what happened yesterday.

220
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32,320
I can't say this.

221
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:32,910
I'm indeed angry.

222
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,110
Very angry.

223
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:38,860
(Lu Xun)

224
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,350
The musical is fun.

225
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:44,520
Would you like to come and watch it?

226
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,550
No, no.

227
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,000
I shouldn't sound so cold.

228
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,790
Delete the words

229
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:52,790
and type in "I miss you."

230
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,150
Then you won't sound cold.

231
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,470
In your dream.

232
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:03,080
You know what?

233
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,640
I didn't want to text you.

234
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,790
I just think

235
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:06,470
Mr. Zhen personally

236
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,790
assigned us to this mission.

237
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:08,590
So, we have to

238
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,320
complete it carefully.

239
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,320
I'm sure

240
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,670
I'll be the Municipal Merit Student.

241
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,280
But

242
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,670
I don't want you

243
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,400
to give in before the battle.

244
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,030
Then even if I win,

245
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,110
I'll feel unhappy.

246
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,150
All right, then.

247
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,550
Now that you want so much

248
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,320
to be my rival,

249
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,230
I'll have to

250
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,230
put on a rival show with you.

251
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,150
Never dream of it.

252
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:25,000
You want to be the Tang Monk?

253
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,880
He's a merciful monk.

254
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,880
But look at you.

255
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:28,880
Play your own role.

256
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,590
Wheeze Dog.

257
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,640
Wheeze Dog?

258
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,320
Me?

259
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,670
Well, a girl like you

260
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,790
can play the role

261
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,080
of scorpion spirit, right?

262
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,590
Scorpion spirit?

263
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:40,550
You look more like the scorpion spirit.

264
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,110
You look the most like it.

265
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,440
Director.

266
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,150
Director, Director,

267
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:44,440
come over.

268
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,520
There's no use calling her.

269
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,030
You just can't be the Tang Monk.

270
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:47,670
If you want a role,

271
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,960
be Zhu Bajie or Wheeze Dog.

272
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,150
If I can't be the Tang Monk...

273
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:50,670
I think

274
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:51,280
- if you're so dissatisfied...
- Listen to me.

275
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:51,590
Wait. Wait.

276
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:52,350
Hear me out.

277
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:52,960
Check if she looks like

278
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,590
the scorpion spirit.

279
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,640
- Say no more.
- Exchange your roles then.

280
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,710
Listen to the director.

281
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:56,400
When you...

282
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,280
You're the scorpion spirit.

283
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,320
- ...you're insulting me,
- In my opinion...

284
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,320
you're just like the scorpion spirit.

285
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,790
- If you're both dissatisfied,
- Say no more.

286
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,280
why don't you exchange your roles?

287
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,880
Qian Wei, the Tang Monk.

288
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,760
Lu Xun, the scorpion spirit.

289
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:06,790
Maybe

290
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,280
when you exchange the roles,

291
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,150
you'll do a better job.

292
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,200
No way.

293
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:09,710
No, no, no.

294
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,320
Who said

295
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,150
he would help me without reserve?

296
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:11,670
But I...

297
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,200
If you reject it,

298
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:13,960
I'll have someone else take it over

299
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,910
who wants the Tang Monk.

300
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,400
Fine.

301
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:19,400
It's a deal, then.

302
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:21,280
300 Years of Mundane Bond, here it goes.

303
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,230
It's all your fault.

304
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,590
You should have shut your mouth off.

305
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,550
What bad luck I have!

306
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,110
You two,

307
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,230
mind your states.

308
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,080
In this scene,

309
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,200
the scorpion spirit takes

310
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,000
Golden Cicada down the mountain.

311
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,520
They recall the past.

312
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,110
They should be

313
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,470
very sentimental.

314
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:47,790
But look at you.

315
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,150
You look like you'll have a fight.

316
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,080
This is a very important scene.

317
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,470
Act seriously, will you?

318
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,640
One more time.

319
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,710
Three, two, one.

320
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:55,320
Action.

321
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:02,440
Sanzang,

322
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,150
I'm seeing you off.

323
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,320
Don't be willful anymore.

324
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,320
(I came to realize Liu's dream,)

325
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,080
(instead of quarreling with Lu Xun.)

326
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:17,910
(I'll consider the musical first.)

327
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,790
Who's willful?

328
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,640
You were rude to me first.

329
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,150
Stick to the original lines.

330
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,910
Even if I was wrong,

331
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,470
I meant good.

332
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,590
Let's go downstairs

333
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:35,590
and get back together.

334
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:36,710
What do you think?

335
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,840
Go downstairs if you want.

336
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,520
But I will not.

337
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,670
Before you agree on the apps,

338
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:41,640
I won't talk to you.

339
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,030
If it weren't for the rehearsal,

340
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,080
I wouldn't talk to you, either.

341
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:47,840
It's okay.

342
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,230
Let's not talk to each other.

343
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,440
Whoever talks first will be the dog.

344
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,110
Fall

345
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,200
or talk to me.

346
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,150
Make your choice.

347
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,030
Let's fall together.

348
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,910
Are you out of your mind?

349
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:18,590
You deserve it.

350
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,230
Oh, dear.

351
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,470
Are you all right?

352
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,790
Let's take a rest

353
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,000
and continue the rehearsal after lunch.

354
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:36,000
When on earth

355
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,230
can I act with Zixin?

356
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,350
Supporting roles

357
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,350
can't have the rehearsal

358
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,400
before Qian Wei and Lu Xun finish.

359
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:43,840
But considering

360
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,080
that they don't talk to each other,

361
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,080
I'm afraid you can't rehearse
until next year.

362
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,640
My sister is quite stubborn.

363
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,230
Lu Xun is also more nice than wise.

364
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,110
Why don't you arrange

365
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:54,960
some romantic scenes for them

366
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,550
so that they can get back together?

367
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,470
Then they'll smooth the rehearsal.

368
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,000
You make sense.

369
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,110
Let me find out the romantic scenes.

370
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,520
What's the smell?

371
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:09,000
Is it the smell of a clogged toilet?

372
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,470
Liu,

373
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,150
how's the rehearsal going?

374
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,320
Shall we come and help

375
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,230
this afternoon?

376
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,350
No.

377
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,910
We haven't got any farther
with the rehearsal.

378
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,640
I guess I need you tomorrow.

379
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,400
You're free this afternoon.

380
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:26,790
Let's go and check

381
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:27,670
how the stage art is going.

382
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,350
Fine.

383
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,200
We'll leave you alone.

384
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,030
What?

385
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:38,910
Don't move.

386
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,110
It's my secret weapon.

387
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,400
If you want to get Zixin,

388
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,470
you need it.

389
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,400
When I was in a relationship

390
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,350
with Tang Lyu,

391
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,230
he couldn't stand the smell
of river snails rice noodles, either.

392
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,350
To date him

393
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,520
and have the noodles,

394
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,760
I bought this.

395
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,030
The smell-removing spray.

396
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,520
But I don't need it now.

397
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,350
Take it over.

398
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,710
If I'm in a relationship with Zixin,

399
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,880
do I also have to

400
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,030
conceal what I like to eat

401
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:07,520
and hide my true personality

402
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:08,470
just like how Liu behaved

403
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,520
in front of Tang Lyu?

404
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:13,710
In this scene,

405
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:16,230
the scorpion spirit takes Golden Cicada

406
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,710
to recall the past.

407
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:18,150
Remember.

408
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:20,350
You must be sentimental.

409
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,790
Three, two, one.

410
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:23,440
Action.

411
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,400
Sanzang,

412
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,200
when will you

413
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:31,880
feel my heart?

414
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,910
What you're doing

415
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:38,000
makes me...

416
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,030
What are you doing?

417
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:41,400
Come on.

418
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:41,670
Director,

419
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,200
he's doing undesigned movements.

420
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:44,760
I'm the scorpion spirit.

421
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,000
If I only talk

422
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,030
with no body movements,

423
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,790
I'll look numb.

424
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:48,350
Don't you think so,

425
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:48,880
Director?

426
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,400
I should also do something
to remind her of our previous life.

427
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:50,910
Right?

428
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,470
I think it makes the scene

429
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:53,710
look better.

430
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:54,960
Right?

431
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,230
I agree that the scene will be boring

432
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,000
without such movements.

433
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,840
Exactly.

434
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,520
What are you talking about?

435
00:14:59,520 --> 00:14:59,790
You...

436
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:00,080
You shouldn't

437
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,590
squeeze my face, anyway.

438
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:01,200
It looks rude.

439
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,400
The audiences can't see it either.

440
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,200
But the director said...

441
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,150
Don't stare...

442
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:05,960
What are you doing?

443
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,280
What are you doing?

444
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:07,640
In this way,

445
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,350
the scene looks more attractive.

446
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:08,710
Right.

447
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:09,350
It's fabulous.

448
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:09,670
It's the right way

449
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,440
the scorpion spirit
treats the Tang Monk.

450
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:12,200
Stand away from me.

451
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:13,080
It's not right.

452
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,640
You... you...

453
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,400
Come over.

454
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:14,910
You...

455
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,080
Okay.

456
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:36,590
In this scene,

457
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:37,670
Golden Cicada

458
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,910
should give the magic breath

459
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,350
to the scorpion spirit.

460
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:40,550
Come on.

461
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,200
Magic breath...

462
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,640
This is what I should do.

463
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,280
Do it.

464
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,840
How shall I do it?

465
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,030
I don't know.

466
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:52,710
Haven't you watched the dramas?

467
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,150
Just put your mouth on mine.

468
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,550
Never.

469
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:55,960
Pretend.

470
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,670
In dramas,

471
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,710
actors pretend to kiss.

472
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:58,440
That's not real.

473
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,230
Right, Director?

474
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,520
Not real.

475
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,350
Shut up.

476
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:01,880
Let's just pretend.

477
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,440
You kissed me deliberately, right?

478
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,280
I didn't.

479
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,000
Do you admit you're a dog?

480
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,150
You just got the wrong place.

481
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,000
Are you a dog?

482
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You just failed...

483
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,640
- Director, why is she beating me?
- You did that deliberately.

484
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,760
All of you were tricking me
deliberately.

485
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:25,470
We were?

486
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:25,910
We were?

487
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,670
Believe it or not...

488
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,350
I'll...

489
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:29,440
There must be something wrong.

490
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,110
There must be something wrong with you.

491
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,280
There must be something wrong with you.

492
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:31,910
Something's wrong with you.

493
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,150
Why is it my problem?

494
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:43,710
You're the actress
for the Tang Monk, right?

495
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,030
Before the stage designers come,

496
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,520
you've come already.

497
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:48,280
Don't bother.

498
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,840
I just came to check the stage.

499
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:50,760
Did Director Liu

500
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,710
design a new path

501
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,030
to True Scriptures

502
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,000
from the auditorium

503
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,550
to the stage?

504
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:57,470
Wang,

505
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,760
turn on the follow spot

506
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:00,350
and let's check the path.

507
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,350
This follow spot, right?

508
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:05,800
You should have brought your boyfriend.

509
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,520
When no one else is around,

510
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,280
you can enjoy the romance.

511
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,000
Even if he came,

512
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,430
he would only quarrel with me

513
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,710
and destroy the romance.

514
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,590
I'm glad he didn't come.

515
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:15,830
Or I would be the third wheel.

516
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:17,830
Be careful.

517
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:19,280
There's a hanging point overhead.

518
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:19,920
Watch out for it.

519
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,710
Okay.

520
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,070
Lu Xun,

521
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,110
you're a man.

522
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:27,110
You should be generous.

523
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:28,000
Shouldn't you?

524
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Does it really matter

525
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,880
who is right?

526
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,920
Instead of going to court,

527
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,350
I would rather settle out of court.

528
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,470
There he is.

529
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:53,560
What?

530
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:54,950
You'll admit you're a dog?

531
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:09,830
You're early.

532
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,070
Back off!

533
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,160
I'm sorry,

534
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:41,710
fellows.

535
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:42,830
Um,

536
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,760
Miss Tang,

537
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,880
is your boyfriend all right?

538
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,000
Her boyfriend is all right.

539
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,920
But her senior

540
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,800
was hurt.

541
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,160
What happened?

542
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,160
Be careful.

543
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:52,920
Are you all right?

544
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,710
- How about this, Lu Xun?
- You're hurt?

545
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:57,310
Take Qian Wei

546
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,190
to the infirmary first.

547
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:58,680
No, no.

548
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,800
I'm all right.

549
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,230
But he isn't.

550
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,710
His arm is wounded, I guess.

551
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:02,640
Roll up your sleeve.

552
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,880
Let's see how you're wounded.

553
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,350
It's okay.

554
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:04,920
It's just a flesh wound.

555
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,920
You know?

556
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,110
I learned to bind up a wound
from my mother.

557
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,830
Let me bind up his wound.

558
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,280
What?

559
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:15,000
Looks like

560
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,400
he appears to be tough,

561
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,640
but cares about you a lot.

562
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,230
Or how could he be the scorpion spirit?

563
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,680
I mean your senior.

564
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,580
(Little Chopper: Qian Wei is to blame
for dating them two.)

565
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,100
(Or why would the two handsome guys
from the Law Department have a fight?)

566
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,110
They're just acting in a musical.

567
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,920
Why do others talk nonsense?

568
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,680
Such netizens...

569
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,710
They're just gossipy.

570
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,280
Liu,

571
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,230
I thought of something to do.

572
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,070
I'll take my leave.

573
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:51,520
Okay.

574
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:57,820
(Little Chopper)
(Qian Wei has a boyfriend, but wants another.)

575
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:00,430
It's really you,

576
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:01,950
Yu Tian.

577
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,070
I don't know what you're talking about.

578
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:09,710
Last year, we met at the Comic-Con.

579
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,830
We were visiting the display counter
of When They Cry.

580
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,560
Little Chopper was your name then.

581
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:17,000
You play songs at the radio studio.

582
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,160
You often play the theme song

583
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,430
of When They Cry.

584
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,310
You also want to do this,

585
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,560
don't you?

586
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,310
What?

587
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,640
I hear you and Lu Xun are

588
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,760
childhood sweethearts.

589
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,470
You've loved him for years, don't you?

590
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,280
You look at him differently

591
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,430
from how you look at others.

592
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,680
In my opinion,

593
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,110
you met him first.

594
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,000
Why is Qian Wei so close to him?

595
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:54,950
Let's join hands.

596
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:56,070
What do you think?

597
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,350
What do you want to do?

598
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,620
(Schedule of the Radio Studio)

599
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,060
(Invitation)

600
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,070
Lu Xun asked for leave.

601
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:23,800
He applied for the rehearse at night.

602
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,430
He hasn't made up with Qian Wei yet?

603
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,680
Instead of telling Qian Wei

604
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,520
that he would ask for leave,

605
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,560
he told you directly.

606
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,640
I guess so.

607
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:35,830
Tomorrow afternoon,

608
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,000
he'll give a speech to the freshmen.

609
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:40,830
Good, then.

610
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:41,950
The radio studio staff talked to me.

611
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,590
They want to invite all of us

612
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,920
tomorrow afternoon.

613
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:49,380
(We'd like to invite the team
of 300 Years of Mundane Bond.)

614
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:51,430
It's an interview?

615
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,040
But if we have the interview,

616
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,710
will our plots be spoilt?

617
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:56,920
Don't worry.

618
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,950
They won't be spoilt.

619
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:58,760
In terms of the questions,

620
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,560
we can answer carefully.

621
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,590
It's the radio studio over the campus.

622
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,230
It'll help a lot
to publicize our musical.

623
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,710
By then,

624
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:05,680
let's elaborate

625
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,560
on the features of our play.

626
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,950
When the musical plays to packed houses,

627
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:10,560
won't we stand a bigger chance

628
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,760
to be the best show of the Art Festival?

629
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,070
You make sense.

630
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,350
I'll think about
how to elaborate our features tomorrow.

631
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,740
(Crash Course for Legal Knowledge
of College Students Art Festival)

632
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,560
(Cases of "Zhang San, the Criminal")

635
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,470

636
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:46,710
our team should...

637
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,190
It starts in ten minutes.

638
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,310
Turn off the radio.

639
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:49,710
Okay.

640
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,400
(Don't turn off the radio.)

644
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,880
(the team)

645

composer, and stage director.

654
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,920
Too many jobs, huh?

655
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,560
(Anyway, in the show,)

656
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,110
(I play the role of Chang'e.)

In 300 Years of Mundane Bond,

663

I'm Li Chongwen.

of Sun Wukong.

667
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:35,800
Hello.

668
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,950
I'm Qian Chuan
from the Department of P.E.

669
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:38,950
I play the role

670
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,470
of Marshal Tianpeng,

671
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,590
the handsome guy.

672
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,280
I hear in the play,

673
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,190
the Tang Monk has to

674
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:49,190
make a choice

675
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:49,950
between scriptures and love.

676
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:52,800
Yes.

677
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,430
But now,

678
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:55,110
I must complain

679
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,400
about Director Liu.

680
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,430
Why must the Tang Monk

681
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:00,310
pick one from scriptures and love?

682
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:02,040
An adult should pick both.

683
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:02,590
Right?

684
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:03,680
However,

685
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,920
as for the entire story,

686
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,110
please look forward to our play.

687
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:06,640
By then,

688
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,950
we'll see you at the theater.

689
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:08,350
All right?

690
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,430
Welcome.

691
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:11,430
Pick both?

692
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,110
Qian Wei,

693
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,000
are you saying

694
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,350
that you also want two guys

695
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:17,280
in real life?

696
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,040
What are you talking about?

697
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,310
It's said on the Internet

698
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,430
(that Miss Qian Wei)

699
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:27,830
(dates Lu Xun)

700
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,400
(as well as Li Chongwen.)

701
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,590
(Two handsome guys
of the Law Department.)

702
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:32,190
(She has both of them.)

703
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:32,880
Lu Xun!

704
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,880
Can it be true?

705
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,560
Lu Xun!

706
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:42,000
Qian Wei,

707
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,950
don't be nervous.

708
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,470
I just saw that question

709
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:46,070
when I was

710
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:47,000
collecting the netizens' questions

711
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,040
on the Internet in advance.

712
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,800
What do you think?

713
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,830
Here's the thing.

714
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:58,160
Netizens are

715
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,430
quite imaginative.

716
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:00,640
They have some misunderstandings.

717
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,400
Today, we came

718
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,400
to publicize our new play.

719
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,350
We certainly want the listeners

720
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:06,070
to care more about the play

721
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,830
and less about my privacy.

722
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:08,520
I have to say

723
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,470
that we three are

724
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:10,680
close friends.

725
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:11,280
(Otherwise,)

726
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,040
(we wouldn't act)

727
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,070
(in the same play)

728
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:14,590
(of the Drama Club.)

729
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,590
(There's indeed some misunderstanding.)

730
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,470
(So, Qian Wei,)

731
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:19,800
(you believe you're only the friend)

732
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,280
(of Li Chongwen and Lu Xun.)

733
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,470
(You don't know)

734
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:24,070
(they both like you.)

735
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,470
And you also don't know

736
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:26,280
they had a fight for you?

737
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,190
Yu Tian,

738
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:28,430
you asked it on purpose, right?

739
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,590
It's not a question

740
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:32,280
on the interview draft.

741
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,190
What are you up to?

742
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,520
Qian Wei,

743
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,880
don't feel stressed out.

744
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,520
After all, a clean hand wants no washing

745
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,560
and a clear conscience is a soft pillow.

746
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,470
I also want others

747
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:42,920
to stop misunderstanding you.

748
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:44,520
Look.

749
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,310
Netizens gossip

750
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,430
that you're in a relationship
with Lu Xun

751
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:48,680
but don't tell anyone about it.

752
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,880
Instead, Li Chongwen got hurt for you.

753
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,680
Will such a complicated relation

754
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,830
influence your rehearsal?

755
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,400
I just worry

756
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,520
if your performance

757
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,070
can't be as good as the rehearsal,

758
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,800
the audiences will be disappointed.

759
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,430
I'm Li Chongwen.

760
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,280
(Qian Wei isn't two-timing me.)

761
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:17,880
I admit

762
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,880
that I've adored her

763
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,640
for a long while.

764
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,560
But a long time ago,

765
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,920
she turned me down.

766
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,070
I just have one-sided love for her.

767
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:32,110
I'd like to say thank you to her.

768
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:35,590
Because she

769
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,950
makes me know

770
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,160
how

771
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,800
love feels.

772
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:46,110
Thank you.

773
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,110
I don't want anyone

774
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,470
to destroy the memory

775
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:57,000
in my heart

776
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,710
with misunderstanding.

777
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,160
Chongwen made a great point.

778
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,470
His point of love

779
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:09,470
perfectly accords

780
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:10,640
with the theme of our play.

781
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,070
Why don't we play a song

782
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,280
and take a break?

783
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:19,000
I'll disturb the publicity.

784
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,310
I'll take my leave. I'm okay.

786
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:28,880
What brings you here?

787
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,560
Aren't you supposed to be
in the Crash Course?

788
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,430
Bow-wow.

789
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:35,950
I came to apologize.

790
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,400
I was wrong.

791
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,040
I'm sorry.

792
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,760
What on earth is he doing?

793
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:44,520
- Listen to me.
- You shut up.

794
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,040
I had planned

795
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:49,920

Actually,

I've thought about it.

802
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,560
Whether you like me or not,

803
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,110

But you know what?

807
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,760
A man always has obsessions

808
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,280
that he can't get rid of.

809
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,160
Maybe because of self-esteem

810
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,470
or because of stubbornness.

811
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:24,400
As for me,

812
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,280

814

to being egocentric.

816

that what I've done
can't make you happy.

You used to say I was unrealistic

869
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,880
and fanciful.

870
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,400
Stop.

871
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,950
What's gone is gone.

872
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:45,880
Why do you always

873
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,800
bring it up?

874
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,070
You also said I was aggressive.

875
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,350
You complained a lot...

876
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:50,880
Right?

877
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,280
Fine, fine.

878
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,800
We're both correcting.

879
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,310
Okay?

880
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,520
What about Fawei Online?

881
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,070
Well, that...

882
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,310
To be honest,

883
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,110
I'm not 100% confident in it.

884
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:03,470
But if

885
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:04,800
you have confidence in it,

886
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:06,110
you can give it a try,

887
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,190
regardless of the trouble.

888
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:07,950
But you have to show me

889
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:08,680
your proposal.

890
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,520
In recent days,

891
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,680
I've put it on the investment website.

892
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,000
Those who contacted me claimed

893
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,110
it would be better to do the website.

894
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:17,680
In my opinion,

895
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,590
under the circumstances,

896
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,430
your considerations

897
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:21,800
and scruples turn out to be right.

898
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,920
Let's work on the website first.

899
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,800
You finally realized it.

900
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,350
Could you promise me one thing?

901
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,040
What is it?

902
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,800
You wanted

903
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,880
to tear up the love contract

904
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,830
and break up with me

905
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:34,800
instead of being my girlfriend...

906
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,040
I just said that

907
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,070
in an angry rush.

908
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,470
You asked me not to bring up old scores.

909
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:39,880
Why are you bringing it up?

910
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,760
At work

911
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,470
or in love,

912
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:44,040
giving up halfway hurts more

913
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,230
than not getting what one wants.

914
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:46,070
If you have any idea

915
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:46,950
or any request,

916
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:47,880
just tell me.

917
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,470
I can give it a try with you.

918
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:50,950
I'll believe it,
however ridiculous it sounds.

919
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,350
But don't always talk about

920
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,040
leaving me

921
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,830
or breaking up with me.

922
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,520
I've exhausted all my courage

923
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,190
to be with you.

924
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:59,640
If you take away

925
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,470
all the mints,

926
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:01,350
the cola

927
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,310
will be water

928
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:03,950
without gas.

929
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:04,560
Right?

930
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:05,880
Right?

931
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,520
Got it.

932
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,040
I won't say that again.

933
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:11,640
Are you the man

934
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,560
who just barked?

935
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,430
It was

936
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:15,110
just a misunderstanding.

937
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,350
I am, so what?

938
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:17,470
Shame on you.

939
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,430
Shame on me?

940
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,350
Shall we

941
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:21,470
keep a low profile?

942
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:22,350
Try to

943
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:24,110
rebuild your persona

944
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,070
as the impersonal straight-A student.

945
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:26,710
I...

946
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:27,310
I don't care.

947
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,160
Very well.

948
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:29,680
Awesome guy.

949
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:32,000
Well,

950
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,760
I have

951
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,000
one request.

952
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,230
But in the contract,

953
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,430
no requests are mentioned.

954
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,350
Here I go.

955
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:39,950
From this day on,

956
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:41,160
you must call me Boss.

957
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,830
This is my extra request.

958
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:43,470
Why?

959
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:45,680
When your boss gives an order,

960
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,950
never ask why.

961
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:49,640
Well,

962
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,760
I have one request too.

963
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:52,560
Okay.

964
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,160
How about this?

965
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,710
Bark to me.

966
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:56,190
Then I'll approve your request.

967
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,350
A biting dog never barks.

968
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,560
I deliberately recommended Lu Xun

969
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,110
to give a speech

970
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:34,950
so that he would be lured away.

971
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,110
How did he listen to the radio?

972
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:39,470
You told him?

973
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,920
I texted Lu Xun,

974
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,310
asking him to listen to the radio.

975
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,040
Why did you break our cooperation?

976
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:54,950
I don't think

977
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:55,920
I ever promised to cooperate

978
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,920
with you.

979
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,070
I just asked what you would do.

980
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:01,710
You told me about your plan.

981
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:03,400
Then I decided

982
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,400
whether I would tell others or not.

983
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,520
I really don't understand.

984
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:07,680
What can you get

985
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,910
from helping Qian Wei?

986
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:10,280
I was helping Lu Xun.

987
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,080
If you have

988
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,390
true love for someone,

989
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:15,080
you should understand

990
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,150
that helping him

991
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,280
to live a good life

992
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:18,710
will make you feel happier

993
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:19,430
than frustrating him.

994
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:20,080
Isn't it right?

995
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:24,470
What about you?

996
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,840
Don't you think for yourself?

997
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:36,670
I've known Lu Xun for many years.

998
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,000
It's the first time

999
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,190
I've seen him concede for a girl.

1000
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,280
Doesn't it

1001
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,560
speak for everything already?

1002
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,360
If we were

1003
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,710
in a two-dimensional world,

1004
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,000
I'm sure

1005
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,280
I must be

1006
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,800
the supporting actress.

1007
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,470
But even if I were a supporting actress,

1008
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:03,520
I wouldn't allow a villain

1009
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,390
to make use of me.

1010
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:23,940
(Guanghua University)

1011
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:24,760
You have seen

1012
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,520
the cause in the previous life

1013
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,560
and the result in the next life.

1014
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,840
If you travel on,

1015
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,870
you will see

1016
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:34,710
insubstantial True Scriptures.

1017
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:35,600
All those are just the illusion

1018
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,000
of the Thunderclap Monastery.

1019
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,360
Wrong lines.

1020
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,760
As we meet each other,

1021
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,710
we'll have 300 years of mundane bond.

1022
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:45,870
As long as you look back,

1023
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:47,710
I will

1024
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:48,670
be waiting for you

1025
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:50,390
by the side

1026
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:51,360
of the River of Quicksand.

1027
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,630
I've finally got the love

1028
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,280
after 300 years.

1029
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,320
How can I

1030
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,630
not cherish it?

1031
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:00,280
Right?

1032
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:00,600
Right.

1033
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,760
What is a world?

1034
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,080
You're my world.

1035
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,600
Cut, cut.

1036
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,080
You...

1037
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:08,000
What terrible lines

1038
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,670
were you saying?

1039
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:11,000
In this scene,

1040
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,800
no matter how hard he seduces you,

1041
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,630
you won't shake your resolve

1042
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,800
to get the True Scriptures.

1043
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,000
It's not a scene for PDA, okay?

1044
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:16,670
Come on.

1045
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:18,360
We understand it.

1046
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,760
But we didn't do the PDA.

1047
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,630
In acting,

1048
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:21,630
feelings matter most,

1049
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:21,910
right?

1050
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:23,520
When we had such feelings,

1051
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,150
we just couldn't control them.

1052
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,000
Yeah. We couldn't control them.

1053
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,320
Don't pretend to be experiential.

1054
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:27,910
All right.

1055
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:28,950
I'll go tune the instruments.

1056
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:29,870
No more PDA.

1057
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,470
Be serious.

1058
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:32,560
(Pipa Cave)

1059
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,430
We did a good job, didn't we?

1060
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:33,910
Yeah.

1061
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:34,600
It was good,

1062
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,190
wasn't it?

1063
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:36,390
Wei,

1064
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,520
why hasn't Zixin come yet?

1065
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,360
The boys

1066
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,870
stare at her greedily.

1067
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:42,870
She then doesn't dare to come.

1068
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:45,000
You brought the bad influence.

1069
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:46,800
It's said that

1070
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,870
two handsome guys fought for you

1071
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:51,320
and who barked won.

1072
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,710
Lu Xun,

1073
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:55,120
could you show me the ropes?

1074
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,520
You tamed my sister

1075
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,600
with a simple bark.

1076
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,390
I admire no one,

1077
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:00,840
but you.

1078
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:02,320
Qian Chuan,

1079
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,840
tame is

1080
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,390
a perfect word.

1081
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:06,670
That's great…

1082
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:07,360
What do you mean taming?

1083
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,360
He barked.

1084
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:08,840
I should be the one

1085
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,120
who tamed him.

1086
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:10,630
A great man like him

1087
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:12,320
knows when to yield.

1088
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,320
I know when to yield.

1089
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,430
Here. Hold it.

1090
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:15,390
Yield, huh?

1091
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,040
I'll kick you.

1092
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:18,840
You can yield?

1093
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,560
You can't reach me.

1094
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:21,000
What a pig!

1095
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:30,840
I didn't know

1096
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,230
she could play so many instruments.

1097
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,040
When she plays the violin,

1098
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:36,840
she looks totally different

1099
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,080
from how she argues with me.

1100
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:38,840
If only

1101
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,120
she could sing

1102
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:40,800
as well as she plays the violin!

1103
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:43,120
Even though

1104
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,230
she studies at the Law Department,

1105
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,760
she has a music dream.

1106
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,460
(Calling)

1107
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,280
Well,

1108
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,360
excuse me for a moment.

1109
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,840
Keep rehearsing without me.

1110
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:03,910
What?

1111
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:04,670
Why is she just...?

1112
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:09,190
Liu Shiyun,

1113
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,280
you play the violin so well.

1114
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,710
Can't you practice singing?

1115
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:16,710
Come on.

1116
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:17,910
It was just a flippant comment.

1117
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:20,520
I don't mean you sing terribly.

1118
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,360
Miss Qian,

1119
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,470
(Wu Zhongyou, project director)
this is my card.

1120
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:23,150
(Kebing Capital)

1121
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:24,840
I wonder

1122
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,430
where you got my contact.

1123
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,120
Every year,

1124
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,000
our company looks for

1125
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,390
potential projects

1126
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:33,390
at the venture meetings of universities.

1127
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:33,870
I often

1128
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:35,800
visit Guanghua University, too.

1129
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,870
There are many swindlers.

1130
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:39,630
It's understandable

1131
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:40,760
that you doubt me.

1132
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:41,910
This is the information

1133
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:43,280
of our company.

1134
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,040
Check it out.

1135
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:45,910
Okay.

1136
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,560
In the early days
of building the platform,

1137
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,390
we prefer

1138
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:53,470
free admission

1139
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:55,560
to get more customers.

1140
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,470
After the platform is built,

1141
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:59,840
as for the follow-up management,

1142
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,840
the sharing of advertising revenues,

1143
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,120
the classification of professions,

1144
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,840
and the commission for layers,

1145
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,670
we still need you

1146
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:09,230
to offer

1147
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:10,800
a more detailed proposal.

1148
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:14,040
Considering the rate of return

1149
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,000
and the difficulty of apps,

1150
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,560
I think

1151
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,120
we'd better start from the website.

1152
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,040
I wonder

1153
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,360
if you're okay with it.

1154
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,320
No problem.

1155
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,080
We can

1156
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,630
discuss the apps

1157
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:27,520
after there's a certain foundation

1158
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,430
for the website.

1159
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:30,630
I didn't expect you to be
so professional.

1160
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:31,320
Sounds like

1161
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,430
I haven't been fully prepared.

1162
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:33,760
You flatter me.

1163
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,430
Here's the thing.

1164
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,600
I have one question.

1165
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,910
Do you have

1166
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:39,390
any other partners

1167
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:41,040
in this project?

1168
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:42,430
I get it.

1169
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:43,000
You're afraid

1170
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,870
that we don't coincide in opinion.

1171
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:45,760
But it doesn't matter.

1172
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,560
I'm the boss and he's my employee.

1173
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,630
Also,

1174
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:49,430
I want

1175
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:51,520
to surprise him

1176
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,520
after I succeed in this project.

1177
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,840
That's great, then.

1178
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,670
I think highly of this project.

1179
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:56,760
So,

1180
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,760
could you please

1181
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,560
adjust the proposal quickly

1182
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,910
and meet me again
the day after tomorrow?

1183
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:03,360
The day after tomorrow?

1184
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,390
But that day,

1185
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:06,430
I have to act in a play at school.

1186
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:07,360
I've reviewed

1187
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,560
your PPT.

1188
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,760
There aren't too many problems.

1189
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:11,910
We just need some small adjustments.

1190
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,190
Three days from now,

1191
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:15,430
I've got a company meeting to attend.

1192
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:17,280
I want to present the project

1193
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,760
at the meeting

1194
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,520
so that this project

1195
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,870
can be accelerated.

1196
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:26,080
Fine. Fine, then.

1197
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:26,910
It's a deal.
