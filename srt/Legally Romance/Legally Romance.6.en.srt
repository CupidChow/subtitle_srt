1
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,070
Good.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:05,360
This will definitely

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,400
bring the chemistry to you guys.

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:07,550
Okay.

5
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:30,760
You…

6
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,200
I thought you said you couldn't skate?

7
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:35,840
I was kidding.

8
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:36,720
I just wanted to check

9
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,880
how good you are at this.

10
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:38,950
But I didn't see

11
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:39,880
that you'd fall while doing this.

12
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,360
Go back. Go back.

13
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,150
Come on. Go.

14
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:41,430
What're you doing?

15
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:42,200
Go. Go.

16
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,150
What're you… What…

17
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:43,790
Come on. Go.

18
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:44,520
I'm making a dream.

19
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,110
Just go. Come on.

20
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:46,310
What are you trying to do?

21
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:47,240
Go back. Go back.

22
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,560
You guys continue. Let me…

23
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,200
Let me blow the bubbles for you.

24
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:55,000
Come on.

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,040
You're a better skater than Zixin.

26
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:56,910
I'll take you to skate first.

27
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:57,560
Don't…

30
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,040
(You're my sun and rain)

31
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,320
Are you sure it's all set?

32
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:36,750
You have my word, dude.

33
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,110
All these lockers

34
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,160
have been properly adjusted.

35
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:41,110
Yours…

36
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,520
(Are they talking about Zixin's locker?)

37
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,030
(The brat,)

38
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,390
(why is he sneaking around here?)

39
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,270
The two lockers

40
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,630
are newly changed.

41
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,520
You can count on me.

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,390
Don't worry. It'll be fine.

43
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:54,960
I gotta go.

44
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,720
Hey. What're you doing

45
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,360
here?

46
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:00,880
Qian Chuan,

47
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,320
do you wanna join us?

48
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:04,470
Yeah.

49
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,360
Come on.

50
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:08,800
I'm telling you…

51
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,030
What?

52
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,830
We don't have too much time.

53
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,110
I just saw him

54
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:13,160
sneaking around here.

55
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:13,750
I bet he has prepared some surprises

56
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,880
in the locker.

57
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:15,830
I need you to watch out for me.

58
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:16,360
When I open it,

59
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:16,750
I'll know

60
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,190
what he is up to do.

61
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:17,960
If, by any chance,

62
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,750
he wins Zixin's heart,

63
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,030
there won't be any chance for you

64
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,800
to get her back.

65
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,360
Do you know

66
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,240
what you are doing now?

67
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,360
This is called

68
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,520
theft,

69
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,600
which, in serious cases,

70
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,360
the thief can be sentenced
to up to three years in prison…

71
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,440
Shut up.

72
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,320
I'm helping you

73
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,600
to take out your rival.

74
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,630
And you're judging me right now?

75
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,600
Just turn around
and keep your eyes open.

76
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,550
I'll take care of this.

77
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,440
What you are doing

78
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,080
is wrong.

79
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,550
So,

80
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,110
as

81
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,550
a fair and impartial person,

82
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,160
I gotta stop you from doing this.

83
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,000
- I gotta stop you.
- Don't…

84
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,520
What're you doing?

85
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,440
Is this the surprise
you're gonna give me?

86
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,080
What're you doing?

87
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,360
What…

88
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,750
What kind of surprise is that?

89
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,750
You think this is a surprise?

90
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,160
Don't you think this is stupid?

91
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,080
You're happy with that?

92
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,000
You like it?

93
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,360
I bet

94
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,320
Qian Chuan must have watched

95
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:10,720
romantic drama a lot.

96
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,470
What the heck!

97
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,110
What're you doing?

98
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:12,720
I'm attacking you.

99
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,320
So what?

100
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,110
So what?

101
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,600
I…

102
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:18,950
Look how messy you've made this place.

103
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:19,830
It was you.

104
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,110
Qian Wei!

105
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,640
No, no.

106
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,070
No, no.

107
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,510
Well, well…

108
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,600
Listen. Let me explain.

109
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,670
The lockers popped open themselves.

110
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:27,110
Seriously,

111
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:27,760
it has nothing to do with me.

112
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,640
Do you know

113
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,270
how long I have been preparing this?

114
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,510
You're so outdated.

115
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,480
How rustic you are!

116
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:32,880
Right.

117
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,920
How could you do…?

118
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,480
What's wrong with you?

119
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:00,440
It's getting late.

120
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,480
We're gonna go home.

121
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,670
We'll leave you guys alone.

122
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:03,390
Let's go.

123
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,440
No, I'm not going.

124
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,320
Wei, leave me alone.

125
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:06,920
What're you doing?

126
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,270
Don't play

127
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,320
gooseberry.

128
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,270
I gotta go with Zixin.

129
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,270
I remember,

130
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:10,670
you gotta go

131
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:11,720
to the swimming team place, right?

132
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,920
You and Zixin are

133
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,760
on the same way, aren't you?

134
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,040
You can walk her home, right?

135
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,950
Yeah.

136
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,320
Zixin.

137
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,200
How about

138
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,350
I call a cab to get you home?

139
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,920
Do you have enough money?

140
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,390
No, I don't.

141
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,070
You can lend me some.

142
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:25,510
I don't have any either.

143
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:27,550
So stingy.

144
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,790
Don't bother.

145
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:30,760
I can go back by myself.

146
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,920
Zixin is rich, beautiful
and fair-skinned.

147
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,760
She doesn't need you to get a cab.

148
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,670
She even has her own chauffeur.

149
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,390
You like to take cabs, right?

150
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,000
Come on. Come on.

151
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,600
Follow me.

152
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:40,880
He wants to give her a ride.

153
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,510
Why are you separating them?

154
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,070
By the way,
he doesn't have any money.

155
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:43,760
I wanna go with Zixin.

156
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:44,510
Go. Go.

157
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,350
You're gonna be late for the training.

158
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,110
Just go.

159
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:46,640
Taxi!

160
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,440
Zixin.

161
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:49,640
What are you waiting for?

162
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,270
Hurry up.

163
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,880
Hey, he doesn't have any money
in his pocket.

164
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:52,760
- How can he pay?
- Come on.

165
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,390
Get in the car!

166
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:55,790
Come on.

167
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:56,790
Get your legs in the car.

168
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,320
Go get some money.

169
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,390
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

170
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,200
Or you can't pay for the taxi later.

171
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:01,760
- Zixin.
- You hear me?

172
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:02,950
Bye-bye.

173
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:04,440
Gee,

174
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,760
what kind of childhood friend

175
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,550
would push his friend
into his enemy's rear area?

176
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,790
Don't worry, Zixin.

177
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,830
I'll ask him to stay with you

178
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:10,670
until your chauffeur

179
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:11,510
arrives.

180
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:13,320
It's okay.

181
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,510
Lu Xun has other plans.

182
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,640
I can go by myself.

183
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,110
He's fine.

184
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:16,640
He has nothing to do.

185
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,720
Look how idle he is.

186
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,000
I am idle?

187
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,440
I'm telling you, Qian Wei.

188
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,600
You need a proposal

189
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,480
to run for the Students' Union.

190
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,200
Look at you.

191
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,040
How come you still have time

192
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,070
to mind the others' businesses?

193
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:26,480
How come you favor an outsider

194
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,320
instead of your biological brother?

195
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,040
How come

196
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,550
your brother

197
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:29,480
has a sister like you?

198
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,320
You can't even give him ten yuan

199
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:30,830
for a taxi.

200
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,600
How mean you are!

201
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,600
And listen,

202
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,160
I know

203
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,230
why you're doing this.

204
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,070
You worry you'll lose to me.

205
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:36,920
And then

206
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,320
you can take your little brother out

207
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,440
as a shield to find yourself an excuse.

208
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,200
Smart girl.

209
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:40,720
Amazing.

210
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,510
You are so full of nonsense.

211
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:43,830
I'll lose?

212
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,000
I'll definitely win, okay?

213
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,510
Well…

214
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,720
My chauffeur is here.

215
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,000
But it's not convenient to park here.

216
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:49,790
I gotta go.

217
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,350
It's okay. Lu Xun will see you off.

218
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,440
He'd love to.

219
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,230
Bye-bye.

220
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,070
See her off!

221
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:54,950
What are you doing?

222
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,110
You're hurting me.

223
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,200
Go! See her off.

224
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:57,880
We haven't finished talking yet.

225
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,600
How can I leave?

226
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,200
Finishing the conversation

227
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,160
is my least respect for you.

228
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,670
By the way, the taxi fee,

229
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:03,880
how would he figure this out?

230
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,000
Who will pay for him?

231
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,160
It's none of your business.

232
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:07,790
What a wonderful chance

233
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:08,760
for you guys to spend time alone!

234
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:09,830
How could you waste it?

235
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,110
She and I are just friends.

236
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,950
I'm not into her.

237
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,070
Where did you hear this rumor?

238
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:13,600
Tell me.

239
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:13,950
Well,

240
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,200
you're just not into her at this moment.

241
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:15,640
When you find yourself

242
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,670
falling in love with her in the future,

243
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,760
it will be too late, understand?

244
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,440
Then you will be on your own,

245
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,200
sad and alone,

246
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,480
for ten years.

247
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:23,600
How about this?

248
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,480
Let's make a bet.

249
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,270
If I win

250
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,880
this campaign,

251
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,600
you'll do as I say.

252
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,160
Go ask Zixin out.

253
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,320
Honestly, I don't understand.

254
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:33,790
By doing so,

255
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,830
what benefit can you get from this?

256
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,720
Whatever it is,

257
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,720
I can't tell you.

258
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,110
Just remember

259
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,070
my great kindness for you

260
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:39,920
and I'll be satisfied.

261
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,950
What if I win?

262
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,350
You win?

263
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:45,720
I'll do

264
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,320
whatever you want.

265
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:48,390
Really?

266
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:49,830
Okay.

267
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:50,760
Deal?

268
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,000
Deal.

269
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:00,500
(Villa For Sale)

270
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,340
(People's Court of Haizhou City)

271
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,590
Wei.

272
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,230
What happened?

273
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,760
You sold me out

274
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,350
and then put in hair extensions.

275
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,520
I'm telling you.

276
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,080
You know what?

277
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,960
You almost caused

278
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,710
a love tragedy.

279
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,200
I'm sorry.

280
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,030
My fault.

281
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:44,760
Please forgive me.

282
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,880
Go away. Go away.

283
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,110
Go away. I'm not Tang Lyu.

284
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:47,670
Don't act like a spoiled child.

285
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,000
I'm getting goose bumps.

286
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,280
Do me a favor.

287
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,200
I wanna use these programs

288
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,230
to run for the Associate Trainee

289
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,030
of the President of Students' Union.

290
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,670
Can you look at them
and see if they're good?

291
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:56,230
Sure.

292
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,520
But before that,

293
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,790
would you help me predict

294
00:08:59,230 --> 00:08:59,790
if Tang Lyu would be

295
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:00,590
my future husband?

296
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:02,200
Just because I made

297
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:02,960
a choice different from

298
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,840
the one I made at the time,

299
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:04,400
the knife

300
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,670
that should have been stabbed
at Qian Chuan

301
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,960
is now in my hand.

302
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,350
Liu didn't

303
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,520
attend the class for Lu Xun
at that time.

304
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,350
So,

305
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,590
she had never met Tang Lyu.

306
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,440
But now,

307
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,080
things changed

308
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,350
because I had changed my plans.

309
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,670
So I also have no idea

310
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,880
about how things would turn out.

311
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,470
Now that you've put the moves on him,

312
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:24,550
what's the point of asking me
about the result?

313
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,440
Although forced love doesn't last,

314
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,790
at least you've tried your best
to get it,

315
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:28,440
right?

316
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,910
As long as you are persistent enough,

317
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,320
it shouldn't be a problem, right?

318
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:32,710
Yeah, you're right.

319
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,230
I can't force him to fall in love
with me at first sight,

320
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,590
but I have enough patience.

321
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,200
Let me see.

322
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,000
Let me see your programs.

323
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,550
What're all these?

324
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,520
Shared Campus Bicycles.

325
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,350
Self-service Power Bank Rental.

326
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,140
(Self-service Power Bank Rental
of Guanghua University)

327
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,080
Qian Wei,

328
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,590
why don't you change your last name
to Liu?

329
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:55,910
My parents will definitely like you.

330
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,350
So you're saying,

331
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,440
they are good to go?

332
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,320
But for the Shared Campus Bicycles,

333
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:02,910
one bicycle

334
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,000
costs

335
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,350
two to three hundred yuan at least.

336
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,960
You spend

337
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,200
only one yuan for one use.

338
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,470
That means you have to use it
more than 200 times

339
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:10,400
to make your money back.

340
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,710
But after over 200 times of use,

341
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:12,880
it would break down.

342
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,400
And it's quite complicated

343
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,590
(Shared Campus Bicycle Program)
to manage the business.

344
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:16,520
Human and financial resources

345
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,670
consumption are quite large.

346
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,350
You're right.

347
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:21,230
It is difficult to implement

348
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,590
in the very era.

349
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,760
What about this one?

350
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,030
Look at these.

351
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,840

of Impoverished Students.

352
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,280
This one sounds good.

353
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,110
You bet.

354
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,080
This is great.

355

If the list of poor students
were not disclosed,

356
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,000
those who have high self-esteem

357
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,520
will never feel ashamed to apply.

358
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,520
This is good. I like this idea.

359
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,000
Speaking of poor students,

360
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,520
I remembered,

361
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,400
the senior

362
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,030
Li Chongwen

363
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,030
has been paying a lot of attention

364
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,910
to you lately.

365
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,200
You didn't write

366
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:56,670
this proposal for him,

367
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,640
did you?

368
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,840
It's just a proposal.

369
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,440
But since you said so,

370
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,910
that means it's really easy
for him to misunderstand.

371
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,030
No.

372
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,030

I know Lu Xun

375
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,080
is suspicious in nature.

376
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,640

395
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:08,760
Hilarious.

396
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,760
Let me see.

397
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,760
It's so funny.

398
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,280
Look.

399
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:12,840
It's…

400
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,320
I think it's good.

00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,880
I just came to submit the proposal
for her.

412
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,880

about some of the rules.

414
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,840
Could you please explain it to me?

415
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:43,760

416

420
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:49,880
You don't understand
all three of them?

421
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,640
It's all written here, clearly.

422
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:55,760
Okay.

Okay. Let's take a group photo!

- Look at here.

00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,040
Yeah.

(When I look back,
you're my sun and rain)

587

00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,800
You said you enjoy getting wet.

589
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:35,920
Actually,

590
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,310
it doesn't matter
whether I wear an umbrella or not.

591
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,280
What really matters is

592
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,470
whom I'm standing with
in the rain.

593
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,190
Consider it as a thank you gift

00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,000
for what happened

00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,070
at the store last time

00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:46,740

599
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,640
can help you,

600
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,110
that would be wonderful.

601
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:54,830
But it's not because of you

602
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:55,830
that I proposed this program.

603
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:58,680
I didn't help much

604
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,430
in the store before.

605
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,350
So you don't need to thank me.

606
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,710
But I still wanna thank you.

607

my life goal.

619
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,310
I've read a quote.

620
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:27,190
It says there're many kinds
of emotions in the human world.

621
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:28,950
Some people

622
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,070
can spend their whole lives

623
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,040
living together

624
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,070
without knowing each other's names.

625
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,920
What makes me feel lucky is

626
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:37,230
that I think

627
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:38,000
at this very stage of my life,

628
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,830
I can get to know you.

629
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,350
At least,

630
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,560
you make my youth worth it.

631
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:49,830
I've been avoiding you

632
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,070
because I know you well.

633
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,230
Why?

634
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:58,190
Is that because

635
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,950
the personality test in the store?

636
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,520
You knew the answer

637
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,310
but you didn't tell me?

638
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,710
Yes. People change.

639
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,430
Are you planning

640
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,310
to be

641
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,070
a good lawyer

642
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:15,160
who owns his own law firm

643
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,560
to administer justice

644
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,470
and help the weak.

645
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:19,800
But when you graduate from school,

646
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,920
finding it hard
to pay the rent and utilities

647
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,350
and can't send
out your business card;

648
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,070
when you realize
that justice can't beat capital,

649
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:25,640
and that abilities

650
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,830
are no match
for one's connections,

651
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:27,950
you will change.

652
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:29,400
You said

653
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,430
you're not willing to give the world

654
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:32,000
to those who are not as good as you.

655
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,680
But to put it bluntly,

656
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,830
you've actually chosen

657
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:35,230
a life of fame and fortune.

658
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:38,070
No, I won't.

659
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:38,710
Yes, you will.

660
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:40,110
Because you realize

661
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,350
that justice can't be profitable.

662
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,000
But

663
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,190
by helping these abusers,

664
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,920
you can get a well-paid job.

665
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,680
You can trade

666
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:47,830
what you've learned your whole life

667
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:48,950
for a high legal fee.

668
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:55,430
You will become

669
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,520
the kind of person

670
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,190
you now hate,

671
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,070
who is so selfish

672
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,310
that he'd rather beg

673
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:02,310
for a delicate soup
on the rich's banquet

674
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,430
than give away a bowl of rice

675
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:05,190
to the starved and poor.

676
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,710
Qian Wei.

677
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,310
I realize

678
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,760
that you don't understand me either.

679
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:17,880
If I were to become

680
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,520
the kind of person you say I am,

681
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:19,800
I might as well

682
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,920
be reincarnated.

683
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:25,800
I don't want you

684
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,830
to become one of those people either.

685
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,560
We all dream to be lawyers.

686
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:34,880
But unlike the weather bottle,

687
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,430
our lawyer dreams can't be fragile.

688
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,680
Everyone has his or her vulnerable

689
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,830
and break-down moment.

690
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,110
But we can't have it.

691
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,560
We always have to stay calm
and strong emotionally.

692
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,430
Only in that case can we

693
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,190
give shelter to

694
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:46,110
those who are in trouble.

695
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,800
The rules

696
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,230
are made to confirm obligations
and resolve disputes.

697
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,070
The law

698
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,560
is stipulated to advocate kindness
and remove crimes.

699
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,070
I hope, someday in the future,

700
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,070
if you ever waver about that,

701
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:04,590
just think about the saying.

702
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,830
Don't take the so-called

703
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,430
professional ethics

704
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:09,680
and procedural justice

705
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,760
as your excuses of helping the evil

706
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,000
and hurting the weak.

707
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,110
I remembered.

708
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,590
But I also want you to remember,

709
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,830
I, Li Chongwen,

710
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,430
will never be like that.

711
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:32,710
You can have this.

712
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,640
No matter what,

713
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,680
I have to thank you.

714
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,520
It seems

715
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,000
that you won't need
to rent any umbrella.

716
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,520
Why do I have to see you everywhere?

717
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,310
W-What…

718
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:00,680
What're you doing?

719
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,310
You can't leave without making it clear.

720
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,560
What?

721
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,310
Your proposal.

722
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,310
You put my signature on it.

723
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,190
Are you trying
to avoid arousing suspicion?

724
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:09,710
I was trying to avoid

725
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:10,920
unnecessary misunderstanding.

726
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:12,800
The ginger tea.

727
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,190
The weather bottle.

728
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,470
And the meal.

729
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,760
Is this my misunderstanding?

730
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:19,040
College love wouldn't be counted
as puppy love.

731
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:19,920
So, no worries.

732
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,680
I'll help you keep the secret.

733
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,520
What're you talking about?

734
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,160
What matters to me is nothing

735
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,760
but my career and making money.

736
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,880
Don't spread the rumor.

737
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:30,470
You don't wanna have
a romantic relationship?

738
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,430
It may cause financial loss.

739
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,800
Before I became famous and rich,

740
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,640
I can't consider

741
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,680
these trivial things.

742
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,000
Cool.

743
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:41,280
You tell me.

744
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,710
As for the date thing,

745
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,070
let's forget it.

746
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:47,950
Why?

747
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,400
No, you have to go on the date.

748
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,470
Didn't you say so?

749
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:54,110
It may cause financial loss.

750
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:54,680
That's your loss,

751
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,710
not mine.

752
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:57,560
Yes, yes.

753
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,160
I almost forgot.

754
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:00,430
Here, this is for you.

755
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:02,230
Thirty-nine point eight yuan.

756
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,640
(Love Strategy)

757
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,160
The criminal law states

758
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,590
that anyone forces the other
by means of violence or threat

759
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,190
(Love Strategy)
to buy or sell goods,

760
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,800
in serious cases,

761
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,800
shall be punished by imprisonment
for a term not exceeding three years

762
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,950
or detention.

763
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:13,800
Thanks.

764
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,000
You know what?

765
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,680
It's called "use now and pay later",
understand?

766
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,830
This is an advanced consumption way,

767
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:19,680
which will be born

768
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,000
11 years later.

769
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,070
I'm letting you try it now.

770
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:23,400
Shouldn't you be grateful to me?

771
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,710
You can even know

772
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:25,920
what is going to happen in 11 years?

773
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,430
I am a prophet, aren't I?

774
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,760
I am a prophet, aren't I?

775
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:34,800
Cool.

776
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:41,380
(Make Your Life Sweet)

777
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,710
(Wish you good health.)
Now, it's my turn to teach you.

778
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:43,230
Let's see

779
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:44,640
how we can turn fantasy

780
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,920
into reality.

781
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:47,680
Tomorrow is May 20.

782
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,520
The best time

783
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,310
to cram for your date.

784
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:49,800
Come on.

785
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:56,020
(Love Strategy)

786
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,310
(Love may cause financial loss.)

787
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,520
(Turns out that
she's quite good at dating.)

788
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,710
(She didn't use this as an excuse)

789
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,000
(to date me, did she?)

790
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,560
("I'm not into her.")

791
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:09,040
(Turns out that he pays more attention
to the strategy)

792
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:09,830
(even than the criminal law.)

793
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:12,950
I didn't order this.

794
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:13,680
I did.

795
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,070
Thank you, sir.

796
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:17,640
Come on.

797
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:20,430
Open our textbook.

798
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:21,640
Chapter one.

799
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,590
When you go on a date,

800
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:24,950
and you wanna order coffee for Zixin,

801
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,640
remember, the more foam, the better,
okay?

802
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:28,280
Why?

803
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,000
In this case,

804
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,560
when she finishes drinking,

805
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,280
her upper lip will be covered with foam.

806
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,070
At this moment,

807
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:34,830
you can

808
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:35,880
tenderly reach out

809
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,560
and wipe away

810
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,710
the foam on her lips

811
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:39,400
to make her heart race.

812
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,000
Understand?

813
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,280
You don't?

814
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,590
Come on. Let me show you.

815
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:43,110
When you're there,

816
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,190
you order a cup of coffee
just like this.

817
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:45,280
And then she will drink like this.

818
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:48,430
Tastes good.

819
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:49,110
And then?

820
00:26:59,350 --> 00:26:59,950
Like this?

821
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:02,310
Good for you.

822
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,430
Well done.

823
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:05,640
Tomorrow you gotta do like this.

824
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,680
Understand?

825
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,040
So uncool.

826
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,920
Then you tell me.

827
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:14,920
What about my lips?

828
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,110
Show me.

829
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:18,160
So I'll know how you do this.

830
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,350
You look like being poisoned.

831
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:24,640
Not cute at all.

832
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,800
Can we skip this?

833
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:27,430
Don't talk nonsense.

834
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:28,040
Quickly.

835
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:28,470
Come on.

836
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:29,520
I'm not interested

837
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,310
in playing baseball.

838
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,400
- I'm a study machine.
- I'm telling you.

839
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,800
Chapter two of Love Strategy

840
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,190
is that

841
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,560
after capturing her heart,

842
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,110
you gotta exude your unique

843
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,000
man power.

844
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,400
T-The…

845
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:38,920
The chemistry

846
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,230
and hormone.

847
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,070
At this time,

848
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,710
playing baseball is the best way.

849
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,400
How can you expect a study machine

850
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,280
to stand here,

851
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,710
waving the bat like an athlete?

852
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:47,230
By the way,

853
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:48,520
what if she doesn't like this?

854
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,400
She doesn't know how to play baseball.

855
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,400
And she can't get the hang of it.

856
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:52,520
I won't ask you to teach her
if she knows how to play.

857
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:53,640
Shut up. Hurry.

858
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,070
Come on.

859
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:55,160
Okay.

860
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,230
Try a few times first.

861
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,160
Come on.

862
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,400
Where do you throw it?

863
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:01,880
You...

864
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:08,230
You hit it forward. Hit it forward.

865
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:09,280
I quit. I quit.

866
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,560
You didn't know about the basic rules.

867
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:10,920
Then show me.

868
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,310
Come on. Come on.

869
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:11,950
Come here, now!

870
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,520
First, your feet

871
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,920
should be parallel with the line.

872
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,830
Step back a little.

873
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:19,470
Sorry. Sorry.

874
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,160
Sorry. Sorry.

875
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:20,680
Sorry.

876
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,560
I'll throw away the bat.

877
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,230
Come on.

878
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:23,830
While learning,

879
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:24,760
there're always some twists and turns.

880
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,400
That's alright.

881
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,470
Now listen to me.

882
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,760
Your legs.

883
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,310
Keep your feet parallel, okay?

884
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,520
Bend your knees, bend your hips.

885
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:32,800
Right.

886
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,800
And then...

887
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,350
There.

888
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:36,350
Here, relax your wrists.

889
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:37,280
That's it.

890
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,000
One more time.

891
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,160
Now it's all perfect.

892
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:40,640
My part.

893
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:42,070
I'll throw a particularly good one.

894
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:47,070
You're good.

895
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:47,470
You're on.

896
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,040
I quit.

897
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,800
Let me see

898
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:51,590
how amazing you are.

899
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,680
No problem.

900
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,280
How's that?

901
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,110
Why do you even know
how to play baseball?

902
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,760
You said I should listen to you.

903
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:31,590
I say I should

904
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:32,710
blow off your head,

905
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,640
you idiot.

906
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,310
Back of your head,

907
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:39,680
your incisors,

908
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,520
your arms,

909
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:45,310
your mouth.

910
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:04,110
What's your problem?

911
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,000
Are you out of your mind?

912
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,760
Who're you hitting on?

913
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,880
Now you have to listen to me.

914
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,640
You know that?

915
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,830
I'm the boss now.

916
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:16,760
Stand still. Practice.

917
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:18,710
Come on.

918
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:19,280
Stand still.

919
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,380
(Bagel Court)

920
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,160
Step three.

921
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,160
Make a cake together.

922
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:45,040
While making the cake,

923
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,590
the intimate
physical contact is inevitable.

924
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:47,760
That's needless to say, right?

925
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,590
Then, just think about this.

926
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:50,110
When Zixin goes back at night,

927
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:50,920
eating the cake

928
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,070
you made together,

929
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:53,710
how happy she will be?

930
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:54,110
And then,

931
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,920
I will help put in a good word for you.

932
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,160
Our mission is gonna
be accomplished then.

933
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,040
It's okay.

934
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,230
It's okay if you don't know
how to do it.

935
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,280
I'll show you.

936
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:02,830
Don't worry.

937
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:11,920
Done. Done.

938
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,470
So tomorrow,

939
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:22,880
I'll have to make a cake like this?

940
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,160
This

941
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,230
is called

942
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:28,310
"Homer sometimes nods".

943
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,950
A cooking master could have

944
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:30,920
made mistakes.

945
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,710
That was an accident.

946
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,190
A-An accident.

947
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:35,400
Then I have to

948
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:35,920
let you see

949
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,280
what a cooking genius looks like.

950
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:48,760
Well…

951
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,830
Your cake is

952
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:50,590
just so-so.

953
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,640
Mine

954
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:52,880
looks better

955
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,190
than yours.

956
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:24,230
Does it look good?

957
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,560
Not bad, huh?

958
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:27,880
Come on.

959
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,590
It's been a long day.

960
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:29,640
Come and take a bite.

961
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,350
Amazing.

962
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,640
Yours looks great.

963
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:40,350
You're not asking me to test
if it's poisonous, are you?

964
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:44,070
Am I that kind of person?

965
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,310
Of course I am not.

966
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,920
Liu.

967
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,640
Go. Hurry up.

968
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,430
Aren't you with me?

969
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:41,760
I really have something else
to do today.

970
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,680
What's wrong with you?

971
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,040
Can you…?

972
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:43,400
Can't you just

973
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,310
pick another day to learn swimming?

974
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:44,800
No, I can't.

975
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,680
I just wanna learn

976
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,280
how to swim

977
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,000
on May 20.

978
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,560
From now on,

979
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,640
you've got nothing else going on.

980
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:50,590
Wait.

981
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,640
I see.

982
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:55,590
I never thought

983
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:56,400
a girl who looks innocent

984
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,430
like you

985
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:58,190
will betray me.

986
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:00,680
Did my sister

987
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,590
send you here to stop me?

988
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:04,800
If you really want to learn
how to swim,

989
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,880
I can bring you Tang Lyu.

990
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,150
And I'll leave you alone.

991
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:09,760
Go down.

992
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:12,840
You're wet anyway.

993
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,950
There's nothing else you can do.

994
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,000
Just swim.

995
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:23,600
What're you doing?

996
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:36,390
Thank you for your help today.

997
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,520
Without you,

998
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,040
I wouldn't have been able

999
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,560
to stop Qian Chuan.

1000
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,190
Then, for what happened before,

1001
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:42,360
can we

1002
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,470
just call it even?

1003
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:46,280
Would you please

1004
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,390
take Tang Lyu

1005
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:48,600
to go to the food court now

1006
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,600
to make up for it?

1007
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:53,560
He's an elitist.

1008
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,280
I bet

1009
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,430
he wouldn't spend

1010
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:57,040
such a commercial marketing festival.

1011
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,320
I guess Zixin is the only one

1012
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,390
who may have a big harvest.

1013
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,230
You're back.

1014
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:08,150
Well,

1015
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,190
I heard

1016
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,430
that Lu Xun has made great preparations

1017
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:12,910
for their date.

1018
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,800
Yeah.

1019
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:15,430
Zixin.

1020
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:16,150
How's

1021
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:16,950
your date?

1022
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:21,430
I'm just friends with Lu Xun.

1023
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:23,360
Don't take it the wrong way.

1024
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,120
I also don't want him

1025
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,390
to be embarrassed.

1026
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,360
Did she turn him down?

1027
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,800
(Did Zixin turn you down?)

1028
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:01,560
(Am I being too straightforward?)

1029
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:14,020
(Lu Xun: I failed.)

1030
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:14,950
(I failed.)

1031
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,230
(Tomorrow afternoon,)

1032
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:18,600
(see you at the shop.)

1033
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:22,620
(Lu Xun)

1034
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,320
Tang Lyu.

1035
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,000
He's so handsome.

1036
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,630
I like him.

1037

I like your report.

1040
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:08,190
By the way,

1043

you can find

1044
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:12,360

You keep an eye on the nominees.

1049
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:17,950
Okay.

1050
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:18,520
No problem.

1051

If there's nothing else,

1052

No, thanks.

Just take a look, young lady.

1072
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:45,840
Come on, lady.

1073
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,080
I can tell you a secret.

1074

Use magic to hit on a handsome boy

1075

1076
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,040
very interesting.

1077
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:54,760
Think about it.

1078
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,760
Join the magic club.

1079
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,870
It's only a hundred yuan
for membership.

1080
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,000
No, thanks. Really.

1081
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,760
Yeah. Yeah.

1082
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,390
Your little brother Qian Chuan

1083

is also a member of us.

1084
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:01,040
Why don't you join us too?

1085
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:03,040
Yes. That'll be good.

1086
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:04,150
He really tried so hard

1087
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:05,190
to win Zixin over.

1088
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,390
Well, here's the thing.

1089
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:07,910
I…

1090
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:08,950
I don't have any money.

1091
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:10,120
But helping little animals

1092
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:10,560
is something

1093
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,760
I can help.

1094
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:12,710
Step back.

1095
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:13,600
Step back. Step back.

when others are reading books,

1140
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,670
which part exactly went wrong?

I'll help you figure it out.

1142

It's not where it went wrong.

1143

It just began…

1144
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,190
It hasn't even begun.

1145

It's already over.

it doesn't work

1151
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,320
Don't be upset.

this place today,

1154
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:58,280
is at least a right choice, right?

1155
00:40:58,910 --> 00:40:59,760
The shop

1156
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,600

1160
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,320
and who didn't do well in their exams

1161
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,360
would all come here to have dessert.

1162
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:06,950
Help yourself.

1163
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:08,870
No matter how much you eat,

1164
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:09,600
I'll pay.

1165
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:12,280
Sounds like

1166
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,710
you've got some experiences
of break-up.

1167
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:15,910
Not break-up.

1168
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:16,600
It's just

1169
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,910
that I used to be defeated by someone.

I came here to have sugar water.

the situation

1174
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,280
is not the same,

1175
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,520
it'll kind of work.
