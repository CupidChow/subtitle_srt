1
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,190
(Qian Wei: Don't send these again.)

2
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:08,470
(Don't send these again.)

3
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:21,230
(You passed
the National Bar Examination.)

4
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,790
(I just wanna send you a bouquet
of flowers to say congratulations.)

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,600
(You do civil cases.
Gotta run the field every day.)

6
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:26,790
(I sent someone to give you a ride,)

7
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:27,600
(so that you won't be too tired.)

8
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:29,790
(When you're drowned in work
and don't have time to eat,)

9
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,360
(those meal replacement bars
and vitamins)

10
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,880
(can fuel you up.)

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,840
(Fawei has finally been launched.)

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,950
(That's what you've always dreamed of.)

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,110
(It wasn't me
who helped you to finish the project,)

14
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:40,880
(but I'm happy for you.)

15
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,430
(I'm sorry
that I didn't understand you before.)

16
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,470
(Qian Wei)
(But now I wanna get to know you.)

17
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:47,240
(Even if I've changed,)

18
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:48,560
(you won't)

19
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,720
(fall in love with me this time, right?)

20
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,180
(Qian Wei)

21
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:28,760
Sit down.

22
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,870
You don't have to pretend
to be strong in front of me.

23
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:35,870
I saw

24
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,000
that your assistant

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,800
brought these things back.

26
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,720
In the past few days,

27
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,160
you've been out with me
for the business

28
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,440
and been occupied
with the company stuff.

29
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,680
You're suffering from stomachache again,
aren't you?

30
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,120
I ordered some porridge for you.

31
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,590
You should have it regularly
from now on.

32
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,950
That is old trouble.

33
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,190
It can't be cured by porridge.

34
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,590
Chongwen,

35
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,510
what you can let go of is called love.

36
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,480
What you can't let go of
is just an obsession,

37
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:07,680
or addiction.

38
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,270
When I first took over AES,

39
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,240
in order to prove myself to my father,

40
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,750
we made every attempt,

41
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,270
and paid an untold price

42
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:28,320
for the company

43
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,160
to become what it is now.

44
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,720
The pain I felt

45
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,160
far outweighed the sense
of accomplishment.

46
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:36,670
Even so,

47
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,160
I can't gain my father's approval.

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,910
Just like Qian Wei

49
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,110
who will never

50
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:45,600
come back to you.

51
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,520
I had no choice back then.

52
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,470
But you do.

53
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,720
So stop torturing yourself, okay?

54
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,670
Drink the porridge while it's still hot.

55
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,620

59
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:36,980
(I wanna drink the Cappuccino you made
tomorrow morning. @Qian Wei)

60
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:51,900
(I wish Qian Wei to be pure
and simple as always.)

61
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,640
It's late.
Why hasn't she finished her rehab?

62
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,670
Qian Wei has taken leave from me today

63
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,720
and said she will not come today.

64
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,160
Weren't you

65
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,350
picky about her before?

66
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,830
Why do you get restless

67
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,200
when she's just gone for a while?

68
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,830
If she takes a few months off,

69
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:39,920
will you still be able to live?

70
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:41,000
By the way,

71
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,720
this morning,

72
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,040
Mr. Wu came to me

73
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:45,200
and said he wanted to transfer Qian Wei

74
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,720
to his team.

75
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:47,920
But I told him

76
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,640
that it's totally

77
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,790
up to Qian Wei.

78
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,760
If Qian Wei agrees,

79
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,200
there won't be any problem.

80
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,480
Just keep pretending
that you don't care about her.

81
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,230
If you continue to pretend,

82
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,550
you'll even lose the chance

83
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,600
to work with her.

84
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,390
I'm telling you,

85
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,670
it's absolutely impossible.

86
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,070
I don't agree.

87
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,070
How can she do that?

88
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,270
I can give her a raise.

89
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,110
I can even give her

90
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,440
the revenue share.

91
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,480
How could I

92
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,200
let her go for a month?

93
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,160
No, half a month.

94
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,760
Even half a month is too long.

95
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,160
Absolutely not!

96
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,000
Lu Xun.

97
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,720
Did you grow up

98
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,350
by drinking cat's milk?

99
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,230
What an idiot you are!

100
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,880
Don't you know

101
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,390
what Qian Wei wants?

102
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,670
Can you use your head

103
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,390
a little more

104
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,270
and use some thought

105
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,160
for your relationship?

106
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,160
If you did so,
you wouldn't be single now,

107
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:41,670
right?

108
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:44,760
I heard that

109
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,920
you took Miss Mo

110
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,000
and Qian Wei to

111
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,830
the set yesterday

112
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,230
and even

113
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:49,920
asked Qian Wei

114
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,200
to run errands for you last night.

115
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,000
Are you insane?

116
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,000
Did you forget

117
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,070
what is said

118
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:55,830
on the Male Virtuousness?

119
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:56,790
I…

120
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,670
How many times have I told you

121
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,950
that face is something

122
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,320
to lose?

123
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,000
Just tell her your feelings straight out

124
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,070
and that's it.

125
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,160
Tao.

126
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,720
You know too little about me.

127
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,070
What do you know?

128
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,200
In my world,

129
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,920
my values about romantic love…

130
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,390
Okay, okay, okay.

131
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:16,790
Don't talk to me

132
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,320
about your values.

133
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,270
Hey.

134
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,550
You've made your speech,

135
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,350
but I…

136
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,830
I can't even finish a sentence?

137
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:24,950
How unreasonable!

138
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,200
Can you just listen to me?

139
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,480
Do you know what listening means?

140
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:28,390
Can I talk?

141
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,350
Can you let me finish?

142
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:29,880
Go ahead. Go ahead.

143
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,480
Through

144
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,000
my life,

145
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,270
the core value for love is

146
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,160
that relationship is not up to

147
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,440
how you chase a girl

148
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,880
but something else.

149
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:41,880
It's up to

150
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,760
your charisma

151
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:48,000
and attractiveness as well.

152
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,480
Do you understand what I mean?

153
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,760
It's

154
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,230
hard to describe.

155
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,110
If your concept

156
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,040
works,

157
00:07:58,670 --> 00:07:59,550
would you still

158
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,200
be single until today?

159
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,600
It's just…

160
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,440
Sometimes…

161
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,000
Yeah.

162
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:12,230
Okay.

163
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,390
I'm not gonna probe into this with you.

164
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,350
It doesn't make any sense.

165
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,920
I just wanna ask you one thing.

166
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,640
When Qian Wei asked you for a leave,

167
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,640
did she

168
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,600
mention me?

169
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,880
Look. Look. Look.

170
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,390
You can't pretend anymore.

171
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:25,670
You can't pretend anymore.

172
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,390
It looks like you still care about her,

173
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:28,950
don't you?

174
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:30,920
I tell you what.

175
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,000
Do you know what I'd call this trick?

176
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,440
"There are always fish
willing to be caught

177
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,910
by angler Jiang Tai Gong."

178
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,590
Jesus,

179
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,110
do you have to use the tricks
in the Art of War

180
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,350
to build a romantic relationship?

181
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,350
Besides,

182
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,790
you call yourself

183
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:44,590
the angler Jiang Tai Gong?

184
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:47,670
I say you guys are both
playing hard to get

185
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,000
and you both deserve it.

186
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,590
Lu Xun.

187
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:53,880
I found

188
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,200
that you have grown in ability recently,

189
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:55,710
haven't you?

190
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,670
How dare you

191
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:59,840
challenge me in the field of love?

192
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,590
At first, you didn't listen to me
when I told you what to do.

193
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,030
Then, you didn't follow as I told you.

194
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,320
And when you did it,
you didn't do it well.

195
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,550
What do you mean?

196
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,710
You want to rebel?

197
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:07,440
Good.

198
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:07,960
Lu Xun.

199
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,440
How to fight this battle of love,

200
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:11,400
and how long it will take

201
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,200
are none of my business.

202
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,350
I'll leave you alone.

203
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,640
Let me tell you.

204
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,350
I kind of hate you now.

205
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:18,470
You better

206
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,350
get out of my office.

207
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:19,790
Get out.

208
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,230
Get out. Get out.

209
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,590
This is my office.

210
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,640
Your office.

211
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,080
Fine. I'll go out.

212
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:34,880
Why is it so tiring

213
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,400
to talk to you?

214
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,280
The kid is too big

215
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,400
to manage.

216
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,400
Keep quiet!

217
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:43,400
Tao.

218
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,150
Tao. Tao.

219
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:44,760
Come here.

220
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:45,880
How's it going?

221
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,470
The result of the battle

222
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,960
is coming soon.

223
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,320
Does anyone wanna raise the stakes?

224
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:52,910
Anyone?

225
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,230
Anyone?

226
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,000
Me!

227
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:54,880
Absolutely.

228
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,350
Stop.

229
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,470
I'm gonna go first.

230
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,520
I'd like to sell my car, my house
and my soul

231
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:00,200
to give it a raise.

232
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,440
Lu Xun can't hold it back anymore.

233
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,670
He must say it first.

234
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,000
If he doesn't say it,
I can't even hold it anymore.

235
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,320
Just forget it.

236
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,080
Qian Wei isn't in the right state
of mind either.

237
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,520
To avoid him,
she even hid in the hospital.

238
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,200
And with Miss Mo's help,

239
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,080
I'll definitely bet on Qian Wei

240
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,590
with a year's liquor deposit card.

241
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,550
Then get ready to quit drinking.

242
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,110
Fighting me head to head

243
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,840
is like hitting a rock with an egg.

244
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:22,760
Betting on Qian Wei to win

245
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,590
is not as likely as betting on me

246
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,440
to win.

247
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,080
What do you think?

248
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,790
The older, the wiser.

249
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,350
Even the time as short
as Qian Wei's rehab,

250
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,080
can be used by you

251
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,110
to light a fire
between the two of them.

252
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,670
I guess that Lu Xun

253
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,320
can't hold it any longer.

254
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,880
You. You. You.

255
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,000
Go. Go. Go.

256
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,880
Stay quiet. Stay quiet.

257
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,030
Come on. Come on.

258
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,230
Lu Xun.

259
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,760
Thanks to you…

260
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,110
Even though

261
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,110
I've said these words to you
ten years ago,

262
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,080
I haven't changed my mind

263
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,760
these years.

264
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,590
Lu Xun.

265
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,880
Hold a sec. Hold a sec.

266
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:09,840
Well…

267
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:10,440
Mo Zixin.

268
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,960
Don't say anything.

269
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,280
I'm sorry,

270
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:13,760
but

271
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,960
you've got the chance to say those words
to him ten years ago.

272
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,910
So in order to be fair,

273
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:16,880
I'll say it first this time.

274
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,590
Lu Xun, I love you.

275
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:18,200
I love you particularly,

276
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,880
no matter in my dream,

277
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,640
or in reality.

278
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,400
I love you so much.

279
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,150
What do you think?

280
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,670
You guys set me up.

281
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:47,320
So you've been

282
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,230
having a crush on me for a while.

283
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,030
Now that you love me,

284
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,320
why didn't you tell me earlier?

285
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,320
I…

286
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:53,960
I was going to but…

287
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,000
(Zhuge Liang invites Zhou Yu
to come out.)

288
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,150
(Provocation works better
than invitation.)

289
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,200
Fine. Lu Xun.

290
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,200
Playing Art of Love with me,

291
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:12,880
huh?

292
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,150
Whoever says it first is a dog, huh?

293
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,710
You'll definitely be the dog.

294
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:17,710
How's that?

295
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,640
Are you still

296
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,710
in the same condition as before?

297
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,470
Mr. Lu calls me

298
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,230
every now and then

299
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,590
to check on your recovery.

300
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,880
I'll tell him

301
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,840
about the after-effects too.

302
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,760
Don't say anything.

303
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,910
I have a feeling that this time

304
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:32,670
the dream will come true.

305
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,230
But this time I have to find a way

306
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,030
to see how to take back the initiative.

307
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,230
Why am I here?

308
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:44,110
I was actually just

309
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,440
wandering around.

310
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:45,960
And accidentally,

311
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,030
I don't know how

312
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,000
I g-got…

313
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,590
…got here.

314
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:50,320
By the way…

315
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,790
No.

316
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,030
Actually,

317
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,670
I took a day off

318
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,200
for you today

319
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,640
just to pick you up.

320
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,910
That's too attentive.

321
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,960
Never thought a good-looking man
like him

322
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,440
will get sick this bad.

323
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,640
Yeah, you bet.

324
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,200
Poor man.

325
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,030
Don't look over there, let's go.

326
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,760
But

327
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:17,910
why has your rehab taken so long

328
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,960
and still not finished?

329
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:20,910
I've been standing here

330
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:21,840
waiting for you

331
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:23,280
for an hour.

332
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:24,400
Too bossy.

333
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,320
Too bossy.

334
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,350
No, no, no.

335
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,440
Investigating a case.

336
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,350
I happen

337
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:47,640
to investigate a case nearby

338
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:50,520
and come by to pick you up

339
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,200
after I finish the job.

340
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,320
Did Tao send you here?

341
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,470
Yes, yes.

342
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,520
Don't worry, I can still breathe.

343
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,230
I'm okay.
I won't ask the firm for compensation.

344
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:00,840
No, no, no.

345
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,550
It's just that…

346
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:03,080
That

347
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,640
Mo Zixin asked me

348
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,080
to go to the café downstairs

349
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,590
from our firm

350
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,030
this weekend

351
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,520
to discuss a case

352
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,790
and check out an agreement.

353
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:13,760
What do you think?

354
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,710
Just to confirm some details.

355
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,760
I think it's good.

356
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,110
I wish you a happy marriage

357
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:20,280
and have a baby soon.

358
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:20,790
I have

359
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:21,760
some personal matters to deal with.

360
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,230
I gotta go.

361
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:22,960
No, no.

362
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,440
Why are you always
in such a hurry to leave?

363
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,640
Didn't you say you'd assist me

364
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,030
in finishing and confirming

365
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:30,030
the details of the contract

366
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,030
and putting efforts to work on this?

367
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,520
What is that happy marriage about?

368
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:32,790
And…

369
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:33,400
I'm your boss.

370
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,550
Why don't I know

371
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:35,790
what you're supposed to do?

372
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:36,670
How come I don't know?

373
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,520
Mr. Lu, have you forgotten

374
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,110
that I'm an intern lawyer now

375
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,150
who's about to become a full member?

376
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,200
I'm not your assistant anymore.

377
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,470
You're not my boss either.

378
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:43,960
Besides,

379
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,550
haven't you always been

380
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,520
dissatisfied

381
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,550
with my work attitude?

382
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,320
I've just told Mr. Tao

383
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,520
to find you a new assistant.

384
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:51,110
When I finally

385
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,760
get my real lawyer's license,

386
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,470
I'll go to Mr. Wu's team.

387
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:55,760
The conditions in his team
are quite good.

388
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,440
What are you thinking?

389
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,840
To join Mr. Wu's group?

390
00:14:59,110 --> 00:14:59,640
Nice try.

391
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,350
No way.

392
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,880
Absolutely no.

393
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,470
It doesn't matter if you agree or not.

394
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,400
I didn't disobey the rules
of the law firm.

395
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,080
Besides,

396
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:06,640
from now on,

397
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,470
I really have some personal things

398
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:08,960
to take care of.

399
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:10,760
From now on,

400
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,960
I'm going on a blind date
every lunch break.

401
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:13,520
Coincidentally,

402
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,880
it's also at the cafe

403
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,960
downstairs from the office.

404
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,110
You should have no problem
with that, right?

405
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:23,400
Why?

406
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,960
Why what?

407
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,400
I am also at the age of marriage.

408
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,350
My mother has

409
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,840
too many resources

410
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,520
of young talented people.

411
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:30,590
It is good for me

412
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,320
to pick one from them,

413
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,440
right?

414
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,350
Fine.

415
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:34,350
Yeah, right.

416
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,550
I've taken the day off.

417
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,230
I'm going to the mall

418
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:38,440
to buy some new things.

419
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:38,910
See you later.

420
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:47,910
Am I allowed

421
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,520
to see such things?

422
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,520
Isn't this what you put

423
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,000
in your wish bottle?

424
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,790
And now you're giving it to me?
I feel a little awkward.

425
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:55,440
You

426
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,670
feel awkward?

427
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,000
How can you say this?

428
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,030
You can go now.

429
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:00,960
Take your time to read it on the way.

430
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,590
See you.

431
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,550
Then I'll go?

432
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,640
I'm leaving and won't come back.

433
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:10,960
Don't come back.

434
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,960
Go, go, go.

435
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,230
I'm leaving for real.

436
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,030
Just go, go.

437
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,000
See you.

438
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,640
"I'm going on a blind date."

439
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,030
"At the café downstairs
from the office."

440
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,590
It's too hard.

441
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,280
Revenue Share Agreement.

442
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,020
(Revenue Share Agreement, Lu Xun)

443
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:46,470
Thirty percent!

444
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,150
Wow!

445
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,280
My dream of becoming rich overnight

446
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,320
has finally come true.

447
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,400
No, it's not right.

448
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,590
If I do this,
it'll do harm to my image.

449
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,880
How can I be greedy for money
at this time?

450
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,430
(Revenue Share Agreement, Lu Xun)
How vain you are!

451
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:05,680
You'd rather lose money

452
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,920
than tell me your feelings for me.

453
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,190
You won over me in weighed planks,

454
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,160
so it's my treat.

455
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,350
But at least you won the runner-up
of the universe,

456
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,710
are you sure you want me to buy you
river snails rice noodles?

457
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,310
Do I look like the kind of person

458
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,070
who's particular to western food

459
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,710
and red wine?

460
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:24,830
What do you mean?

461
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:26,070
Okay, I won't tease you.

462
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,350
This is my restaurant.

463
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,920
I don't know why.

464
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,350
(Liu's River Snails Rice Noodles)
Ever since I took it over,

465
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,680
the business has been going down.

466
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:33,830
Aren't you an expert on
river snails rice noodles?

467
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:35,310
You can help me take a look.

468
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,000
Let's go.

469
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,920
(I've been eating at this restaurant
for ten years.)

470
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,160
(When I say the taste has changed,
it has changed.)

471
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,110
Ma'am,

472
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,950
we do have a new owner now.

473
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,520
But it's the taste that has changed,

474
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,590
not the quality.

475
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,070
You can't get the refund

476
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:53,000
even if you report us
to the Industrial and Commercial Bureau.

477
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:53,880
Come here

478
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,160
and take a bite,

479
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,520
you'll see if it's good to eat.

480
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,560
This is not authentic at all.

481
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,400
Well…

482
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,830
What's going on?

483
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,000
Young lady,

484
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,760
you can't run a business like that.

485
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,040
I was wondering

486
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:06,830
why this place

487
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:07,830
is not doing well,

488
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,350
today I see.

489
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,040
Even if you pay me back later,

490
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,520
I will never be able to come back.

491
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:14,230
Let me see.

492
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:14,920
Take a look.

493
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,680
Take a look at those noodles

494
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,310
and the soup and the ingredients.

495
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,680
All of them are far from desirable.

496
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:21,560
Please take a rest first.

497
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:24,520
Boss,

498
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,000
the original owner didn't leave a chef

499
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,350
nor the source of goods.

500
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,280
We used some connections to order

501
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,160
these ingredients.

502
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:30,920
The taste must be different.

503
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,350
But the quality is absolutely fine.

504
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,470
The problem is not in the quality.

505
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:38,830
Then what's the problem?

506
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,070
You love river snails rice noodles,

507
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,280
but it doesn't mean you know
how to taste it.

508
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,000
And the waitress hasn't done
her part of homework either.

509
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,230
Don't be ridiculous.

510
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,110
Are you a native of Liuzhou City?

511
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,310
Have your ancestors been doing this
for generations?

512
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:49,830
After my father died,

513
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,590
I traveled a lot with my mother.

514
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,310
I've stayed in Liuzhou for half a year.

515
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,070
That's where I learned
how to cook this.

516
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,560
"One minute on stage takes ten years
of practice." (Liuzhou Accent)

517
00:18:59,350 --> 00:18:59,800
What?

518
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,190
There's no use

519
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:01,760
to pay lip service.

520
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:02,950
Liu.

521
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,160
Ma'am.

522
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,880
Wait for me here.

523
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,680
I'll go and buy the ingredients

524
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,640
to make a new one.

525
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,280
Whether it's authentic or not,

526
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,190
you'll know after taking a bite.

527
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,100
(Sour, fresh and spicy.)

528
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,220
(Today's offer)

529
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:16,230
Your current source of rice noodles

530
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:17,470
is not the powder used in
river snails rice noodles,

531
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,400
but the powder used
in Guilin rice noodles.

532
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:22,230
Those are too thick and glutinous to eat

533
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,110
and without elasticity.

534
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:25,430
The proportion of snails in this soup

535
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,830
is also rare.

536
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,950
And the boiling time is not enough.

537
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,040
That's why it's tasteless.

538
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,350
Right.

539
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:33,710
And

540
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,310
the essence

541
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:36,470
is this sour bamboo shoot.

542
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,280
But you use pickled beans instead.

543
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,590
This is the biggest mistake.

544
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,000
Done.

545
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,190
It seems to be the right flavor!

546
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,800
Go and bring it up to her.

547
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:58,640
Give it a try.

548
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,710
In fact, eating

549
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,350
is just like dating.

550
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,710
When you eat something,

551
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,680
you think it's fine,

552
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:11,880
not bad.

553
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,110
But only when you meet the right one,

554
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,710
you'll hear the voice in your heart.

555
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:20,110
This is it.

556
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:33,590
How's that?

557
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,070
This is it.

558
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,760
This is the flavor.

559
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,070
Young lady,

560
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:46,110
you have to keep this young man

561
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,230
close.

562
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:48,400
Don't let him get away.

563
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:49,880
This young man

564
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,280
is a perfect match for you.

565
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,800
For your restaurant.

566
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,560
She can't afford to hire me.

567
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,470
Come back as often as you like, Ma'am.

568
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,710
And help us to promote the restaurant.

569
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:02,760
We'll continue working
on improving the flavor.

570
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,000
No problem.

571
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,920
As long as it tastes the same,

572
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,590
I'll come back.

573
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,830
Thank you, Ma'am.

574
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:07,430
Okay. See you.

575
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:08,000
See you.

576
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,430
I'll see you off.

577
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,070
Boss,

578
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:13,560
you gotta keep him with you.

579
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,110
In this case, you will not be lonely

580
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,950
and we'll have a new long-term worker

581
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,230
for free.

582
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,280
What're you talking about?

583
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,470
You'd better go
and learn Liuzhou dialect.

584
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,590
Don't speak like an amateur.

585
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,160
A blind date?

586
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,830
Even if you are single
for your whole life,

587
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,040
I can afford the living expenses
of yours.

588
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:37,560
Did your aunt force you

589
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,830
to get married

590
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,070
when she came to visit last time?

591
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,000
Does it mean
that a woman has no value

592
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,800
if she doesn't have children
or get married?

593
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,560
It's modern time now.

594
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:46,520
No.

595
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,040
I gotta talk

596
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,710
to your aunt and uncle.

597
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,230
What're you doing?

598
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:52,520
It's not my aunt's problem.

599
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:53,800
How can I tell you

600
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,430
that you can believe

601
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:54,880
that it is really me

602
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,230
who wants to go on a blind date?

603
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:01,400
Lu Xun?

604
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,230
(Auntie,)

605
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:06,350
(although Qian Wei has recovered,)

606
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,430
(she was having neurotic disorder)

607
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,710
(every now and then.)

608
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,280
(I suspect that she has severe)

609
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,230
(age anxiety)

610
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,110
(and the sudden urge to get married.)

611
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,830
(This is a manifestation of avoidance)

612
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,710
(of peer competition,)

613
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,680
(which may make her highly vulnerable
to emotional scams.)

614
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:21,470
Why are you doing this?

615
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:22,830
You're playing Mission Impossible
with me,

616
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:23,470
aren't you?

617
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,000
I'll tell you what.

618
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,280
I want to fall in love

619
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:25,880
and get married with somebody.

620
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,950
I will get the marriage certificate

621
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:27,800
before the end of 2022

622
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,640
and dump it right into your face.

623
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,310
I'm determined to date someone now.

624
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:30,760
I'll tell you what,

625
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,590
even the Godness of Justice

626
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,160
can't stop me.

627
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:32,830
Goodbye.

628
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,880
I'm so pissed!

629
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:38,220
(Blacklisted)

630
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,710
I'll tell you what.

631
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:41,400
Tonight,

632
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,470
either I run away from home,

633
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,920
or you make him your godson,

634
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:45,190
or tomorrow morning,

635
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:46,590
you'll make a group chat consisting

636
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:48,040
of 100 elites for me.

637
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:49,800
Hey.

638
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,470
Qian Wei.

639
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,040
We're living in
a civilized human society,

640
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,640
not a tribe of lions

641
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,400
on the African savannah.

642
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,880
How can you ask Mom

643
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,190
to find a hundred excellent men

644
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,070
suitable for marriage for you overnight?

645
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,190
I don't care.

646
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:02,040
"It takes a thousand days
to raise a soldier."

647
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,760
Just mobilize

648
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,760
your mahjong partners

649
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,830
to help me find a date.

650
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,160
I guess you're having

651
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,400
a neurotic disorder.

652
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,590
I mean it!

653
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,560
One hundred men

654
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,040
is not difficult to find.

655
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:19,400
But for the excellent,

656
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,560
you gotta give me a reference.

657
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,800
He should be better than Lu Xun
at least.

658
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,000
Then why not go find Lu?

659
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,560
Mom, isn't it obvious?

660
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,110
Lu Xun is a tough target

661
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,350
for her to get.

662
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,310
She's trying to do something about it.

663
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:33,920
What're you talking about?

664
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,710
He's in and you're out.

665
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:39,070
This is a good deal.

666
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,350
I have a bunch of mahjong partners

667
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,880
who have both sons and daughters.

668
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,590
Why don't I bring

669
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,590
Qian Chuan in as well?

670
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,880
You guys can make a double date.

671
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,830
Thus, you two can also
give each other some advice.

672
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,070
I think it's good.

673
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,640
Absolutely not.

674
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,230
Mom.

675
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,760
You should focus on Qian Wei

676
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,070
if you have nothing else to do.

677
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,590
As for me,

678
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,680
you don't have to worry.

679
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,520
You're reacting so strongly.

680
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,590
Are you seeing someone?

681
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:04,430
No.

682
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,000
What?

683
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:08,000
Are you still thinking of Zixin?

684
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:09,760
Just beg me.

685
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,160
I can be your matchmaker.

686
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,560
No.

687
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:13,470
Then who is it?

688
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,920
Is that…?

689
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,590
No.

690
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:20,830
Stop guessing.

691
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:22,920
I'm full.

692
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:23,710
I gotta go.

693
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,160
You wanna know who it is?

694
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:34,350
Fine.

695
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,040
Find me a man.

696
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:39,350
Okay, okay, okay.

697
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,590
I'm gonna make some calls for you now.

698
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,430
That's right.

699
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:10,470
These two points are crucial.

700
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:11,560
As long as
you make these two points clear,

701
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,280
you are good to go.

702
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:14,470
So,

703
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,230
being real is the most important thing.

704
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:17,680
What?

705
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,590
How can I know?

706
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:19,190
Don't ask me.

707
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,350
Excuse me.

708
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:41,710
Excuse me.

709
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:42,230
Excuse…

710
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,280
I…

711
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:46,310
What do you think?

712
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,070
Well…

713
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:52,760
I need...

714
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:53,880
your help

715
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,680
with a bunch of papers.

716
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:55,950
I'm a little busy.

717
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:56,430
You

718
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:59,000
rarely dress up.

719
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,160
Y-Y-You look gorgeous.

720
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,640
Yeah, I think so.

721
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,400
Where are you looking at?

722
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,190
Can you sit down

723
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:07,950
and focus on your work?

724
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:11,160
Excuse me.

725
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:11,680
I'm sorry.

726
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,470
It's so embarrassing.

727
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,040
I'm a little out of control today.

728
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:14,590
It's okay.

729
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,110
I understand, right?

730
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,680
Who doesn't like a beautiful woman,

731
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,310
right?

732
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,470
Yes, I like beautiful women.

733
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:21,680
But…

734
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,680
Qian Wei. Today, you look…

735
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:24,830
I got a little anemic.

736
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:25,640
I'm sorry.

737
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,640
I'm going out for a cup of coffee

738
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,190
to replenish my blood sugar.

739
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:28,280
Have some sugar.

740
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,070
Sorry, sorry.

741
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:29,800
Qian Wei, go for it.

742
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,590
I'll raise my bet.

743
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,070
I dressed up like this,

744
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,400
not to have dinner with you,

745
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,310
but for my

746
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:37,520
excellent dates.

747
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:40,800
How many excellent dates do you have?

748
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:41,800
Who are they?

749
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,040
Quite a lot.

750
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,000
One of them has arrived anyway.

751
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:45,350
That won't work.

752
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,000
I'm telling you,

753
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:47,830
you won't have time this month,

754
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,680
because Fawei will be keeping you busy.

755
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,000
I have to be with you

756
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,190
every minute of every day

757
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:53,040
to do the work together.

758
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,310
You can't go anywhere.

759
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,920
I don't think I can cooperate.

760
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,520
I don't have to work late today.

761
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,000
And I've already

762
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,040
made a deal with Tao.

763
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,880
If you think there's a problem,

764
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,400
go talk to him.

765
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:04,430
You're holding Tao…

766
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,230
It's okay.

767
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:05,760
…against me?

768
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,920
Take your time to talk, right?

769
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:08,350
Anyway, I can go on my date first.

770
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:08,880
If Tao regrets it

771
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,070
later,

772
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:11,040
you can come back to me.

773
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,040
Maybe two hours later,

774
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,830
I will find

775
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,160
my Mr. Right.

776
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,980
(Zhanying Law Firm)

777
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,830
What a small world!

778
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,160
I happen

779
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,110
to be on my way to that cafe too.

780
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:30,520
Is that so?

781
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,350
Hey,

782
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,350
you're dressing like that.

783
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:37,800
Have you thought about the image

784
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:40,040
of our law firm?

785
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,920
You represent the team,

786
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,830
and me.

787
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:44,110
Besides,

788
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,070
don't you think

789
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:45,800
you're overdressed

790
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,160
for a blind date?

791
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,560
No, I don't.

792
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:50,800
It's not like I'm on a blind date
at the office.

793
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:52,280
I'm meeting the right man for me.

794
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,710
Of course, I have to dress nicely.

795
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:55,760
I can go without any makeup
when I meet you.

796
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:59,110
You put it on.

797
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,040
No, I won't.

798
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:00,920
That's part of my look.

799
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,920
Let go of it.

800
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,560
You put it on.

801
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,160
You let go of it.

802
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,000
That's part of my look.

803
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,340
(21 persons, 1,600 kilograms)

804
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:12,710
I think

805
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,400
you have to wear this.

806
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,110
I'm doing this

807
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,830
to protect

808
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:21,190
the image of our firm.

809
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:22,830
What an ugly thing!

810
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:23,430
I won't wear it. Take it away.

811
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,710
Come back with me now.

812
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:29,000
I'll raise your salary by 2,000 yuan.

813
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,310
I'll talk to Tao.

814
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:31,310
Four thousand.

815
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,590
Four thousand, after tax deductions.

816
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,710
Nothing else is negotiable.

817
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,920
You come to work with me now.

818
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:44,760
Fifteen thousand yuan
after tax deductions.

819
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:46,190
Fifteen months of salary.

820
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,160
Seven more days of annual leave.

821
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:51,310
Why?

822
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:55,950
Because

823
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,160
I really need you

824
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,350
to work with me together.

825
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:01,830
Think about it.

826
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,190
This firm is big

827
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:05,070
and we take so many cases every year,

828
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:06,070
right?

829
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:08,000
The workload is so intensive.

830
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:10,400
I can't handle it all alone.

831
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,470
I definitely need

832
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:13,110
a caring assistant

833
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,430
like you.

834
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,430
And we've been working together

835
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:17,000
for so many years,

836
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,350
I know what you can do.

837
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,190
You've helped me a lot with work,

838
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:20,880
right?

839
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,230
So,

840
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:23,160
without such a good

841
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,110
paralegal,

842
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,310
what would I do with all my work?

843
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,590
You worked hard on that case.

844
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:30,560
I have nothing to do with it…

845
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,280
It's a job requirement, isn't it?

846
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,950
Then 4,000 yuan after tax deductions.

847
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,800
Nothing else is negotiable.

848
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,000
And

849
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,350
I deserve this raise.

850
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,590
Who am I?

851
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:47,640
Where am I?

852
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,560
I didn't see anything.

853
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,830
We didn't see anything.

854
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:52,350
We didn't see anything.

855
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,040
What's going on?

856
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:00,040
Ummm...

857
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,640
I didn't see anything.

858
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,310
Go, go, go!

859
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,800
Don't say anything.

860
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:06,950
Two bank cards.

861
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:07,950
One bus card.

862
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:08,920
All in.

863
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,040
Lu Xun must lose. I'll raise the bet.

864
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:12,920
What's wrong with you?

865
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:13,920
Let's talk upstairs.

866
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:14,710
Well… Dude.

867
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:15,400
You're in my way.

868
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,280
Hey. You…

869
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:17,070
You…

870
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,470
How dare you!

871
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,350
Qian Wei.

872
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,190
It's been a long time.

873
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,040
Hi, sir.

874
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:27,110
What would you like to order?

875
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:27,950
Do I know you?

876
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:33,040
(Lu Xun)
(Don't you need to meet a client?)

877
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,040
(Where is the client?)

878
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:35,920
(Why are you watching me so closely?)

879
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,230
I'm your younger schoolmate,

880
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:37,950
from the rap club.

881
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,310
Sir,

882
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,310
what would you like to order?

883
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:43,800
Well...

884
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:44,680
Just

885
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,230
give me a drink

886
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:46,160
on the menu.

887
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:46,950
I don't care if it's hot or iced.

888
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:47,470
Thank you.

889
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,920
You're from the rap club.

890
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,760
I remembered
that you were quite optimistic

891
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,560
(Apple cider vinegar)

892
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,560
(Apple cider vinegar)
and interesting.

893
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,950
Why are you here on a blind date?

894
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,710
Life after graduation

895
00:30:58,710 --> 00:30:59,760
is like a movie.

896
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:01,430
I have a small dream

897
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:02,280
but I gotta make money.

898
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:04,800
Pursuing a career is like pursuing love.

899
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:05,880
No matter how hard you try,

900
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,000
you still need someone to listen to you.

901
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:08,830
All I can do now

902
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:09,760
is to chase my rap dreams

903
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,760
on the stage of stand-up comedy.

904
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,680
Wouldn't that be nice?

905
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,190
Aren't you supposed to be the type

906
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:16,590
that many young ladies like?

907
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:17,920
Nice?

908
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,560
Not as good as I can sing,

909
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:20,920
and you call this rap?

910
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:22,400
The most important thing for rappers

911
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,160
is to be real.

912
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,040
I can't lie to you,

913
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,520
but I don't want blind dates.

914
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:28,590
Then why are you…

915
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:34,110
I lose my muse to write a song.

916
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,190
I can't come up with a single word.

917
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,800
Aren't you a lawyer?

918
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:38,110
Would you please

919
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:39,160
give me some topics and inspirations?

920
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,920
Why do you come to a café for a date?

921
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,430
You can come to our hospital

922
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,800
and we can talk

923
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,000
while doing Thermage.

924
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:52,760
Do you wanna try

925
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,920
our essence spray?

926
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,520
Our hospital is really good.

927
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:57,520
I'll give you a 30% discount
if you open an account through me.

928
00:31:58,470 --> 00:31:58,880
Thank you.

929
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,280
Sister.

930
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:03,110
You

931
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:04,760
look beautiful.

932
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,280
Let me introduce myself to you.

933
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:09,560
I

934
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,560
don't have many hobbies.

935
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,400
I just like to go out traveling.

936
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:16,400
When I'm free, I'll go to Alba

937
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,830
and taste the fresh white truffles.

938
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,160
By the way,

939
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,710
my father just bought

940
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,640
five new houses there,

941
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:25,680
one-off.

942
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:28,280
Girl,

943
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:30,560
you know what white truffle is?

944
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,070
What is it?

945
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,040
Just remember

946
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,190
the two major features of it.

947
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:39,470
First, it's nutrient.

948
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,950
Second, it's expensive.

949
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:41,950
It's true.

950
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,110
But that's not the point.

951
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:44,470
As long as you choose to be with me,

952
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,950
you can eat as much as you want
in the future.

953
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:47,710
Thank you.

954
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:48,640
I'm not bragging.

955
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,640
Gold necklaces, luxury watches for look.

956
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,830
Three times barbecues a day for food.

957
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:53,040
You don't have to worry
about necessities

958
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,400
and anything else except for pleasure.

959
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,590
Your life will be filled

960
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:56,920
with comfortableness and happiness.

961
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,040
All set.

962
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:03,520
Go.

963
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,760
Are you having an outing in the jungle?

964
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,110
Excuse me.

965
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,710
Just give me five more minutes.

966
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,160
From now on,

967
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,760
I'll take care of

968
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,000
all your tournaments.

969
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:16,070
Okay. Okay.

970
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:20,520
My mom won't let me play
the Honor of Kings.

971
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,560
Lady,

972
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,190
what kind of games do you play?

973
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,880
I…

974
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,470
I don't play games.

975
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,520
I know all the things

976
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,400
you young people play.

977
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,680
Good for you.

978
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,880
You look great.

979
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:39,950
It's time.

980
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,430
I'm going to do the square dance.

981
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:43,070
Okay, okay.

982
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:44,350
P-Please be careful.

983
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:45,190
Okay.

984
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:45,710
Take your time.

985
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:46,800
Y-Your fan...

986
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,310
Okay.

987
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:47,880
Thank you.

988
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:48,520
Bye.

989
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,040
Be careful on your way.

990
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:51,680
See you.

991
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,430
See you next time.

992
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:59,800
(It is not reliable
to find true love on a blind date.)

993
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,470
(I suggest)

994
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,110
(you'd better)

995
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,800
(pay more attention to the person
who's around you.)

996
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:09,360
Excuse me.

997
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:11,280
Same time tomorrow,

998
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,520
can you still reserve this table for me?

999
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:13,870
Okay.

1000
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:18,230
You're coming back tomorrow?
Are you crazy?

1001
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,910
Mind your own business.

1002
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,800
No, no, no.

1003
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:26,600
I can't do this. I can't do this.

1004
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,120
I'm too passive-aggressive.

1005
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,040
I need to take another way.

1006
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,150
I have to change…

1007
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,190
I need to take the initiative.

1008
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,710
But in what way

1009
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:47,120
should I take the initiative?

1010
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,360
(Auntie, I'm Lu Xun.)

1011
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,320
(This is my side account.
I got something to discuss with you.)

1012
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,140
(Jiang Tai Gong)

1013
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:20,460
(Jiang Tai Gong)

1014
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:22,530
Hi,

1015
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:23,870
Lu.

1016
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,950
It doesn't help to talk to me.

1017
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,040
Qian Wei is determined
to go on blind dates.

1018
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:33,360
I can't stop her.

1019
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,150
No, no.

1020
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,360
Auntie.

1021
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,390
You got me wrong.

1022
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:38,520
In fact, I think

1023
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:40,630
Qian Wei's blind date is fine.

1024
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,280
I have a presumptuous request.

1025
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:47,040
Could you please do me a favor?

1026
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,080
Well…

1027
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,840
Yes,

1028
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:55,710
but I feel a bit weird.

1029
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:05,870
Let's go to dinner.

1030
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,150
Okay.

1031
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:16,630
(Miss Qian.)

1032
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,470
(Tomorrow I may)

1033
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:18,000
(be a little late.)

1034
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,280
(Can you do 1:00 PM?)

1035
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:20,800
(Then I'll meet you at 2:00 PM.)

1036
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,520
(The marvelous fate)

1037
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,120
(Tomorrow morning,)

1038
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:23,840
(I wanna wake up and drink)

1039
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,360
(the Cappuccino you made for me.)

1040
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:31,020
(Quit the group chat)

1041
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:34,940
(Jiang Tai Gong)

1042
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,670
(Jiang Tai Gong)
I knew it was you.

1043
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,040
You idiot.

1044
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,280
What…

1045
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,150
What did I do?

1046
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,840
Are you slandering me?

1047
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,950
Do you know
you are legally responsible

1048
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:01,430
if you slander me?

1049
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:02,950
Why are you messing

1050
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:04,600
with my dating group?

1051
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,760
That is a blind date group.

1052
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,000
What else am I supposed to do

1053
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,630
in the group?

1054
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:09,600
Am I right?

1055
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,470
Auntie also said

1056
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:12,230
she'd get me

1057
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,280
some high quality women

1058
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,280
who are suitable for marriage.

1059
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:15,710
She knew I had such a need,

1060
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:16,280
that's why

1061
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,430
she invited me in.

1062
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:18,760
She also said

1063
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,840
that I met the standard

1064
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,230
of a high quality

1065
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,360
marriageable man.

1066
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,120
Then why did you

1067
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,950
say something

1068
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:26,600
about the first cup of coffee

1069
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,120
every morning,

1070
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,190
blah blah?

1071
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:29,320
You're burning my boats.

1072
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:29,870
You know that?

1073
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:30,840
You're smearing me.

1074
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,230
Every day when I open my eyes,

1075
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:34,320
the place where I am

1076
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,280
is my office.

1077
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:37,000
You did make the first cup of coffee

1078
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,760
for me.

1079
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,670
What's wrong with that?

1080
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:42,320
You said
someone has burnt your boats.

1081
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:44,190
Then who's your way out?

1082
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:45,950
Me?

1083
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,080
Then why did you send

1084
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:52,760
those weird

1085
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,390
and disgusting words?

1086
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,080
It was an accident.

1087
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,040
Fine.

1088
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,520
You're playing tricks with me, right?

1089
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,190
Okay.

1090
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,000
I'll have my mother

1091
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:03,760
kick you out

1092
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,040
and see how you will affect my dates.

1093
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,040
You can kick me out.

1094
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:06,760
Anyway,

1095
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,800
I've added

1096
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,840
all the marriageable men in the group.

1097
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,150
(Mr. Jiang,)

1098
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,870
(you and Miss Qian are…)

1099
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:16,840
(She just went out of my room.)

1100
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,670
(She's been miffed with me lately.)

1101
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:19,800
(Another way of flirting.)

1102
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,600
(We're gonna be together.)

1103
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,560
(I hope you can find your girl someday)

1104
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,280
(and don't waste your time on her.)

1105
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:34,950
You naughty girl.

1106
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,560
It's been a long time
since I've been here.

1107
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,600
This food street has changed so much.

1108
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,820
(Rocky)

1109
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,470
I used to come here

1110
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,000
to have a drink

1111
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,080
when I was in college.

1112
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,320
I even had a secret audition
for a resident singer.

1113
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,040
Oh yeah?

1114
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:52,280
I used to come here

1115
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,600
to drink orange juice
and satisfy my craving.

1116
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,390
How come I never saw you here?

1117
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:58,120
You were

1118
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,710
paying all attention to Zixin
at that time.

1119
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,080
What's the difference
even if you saw me?

1120
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:04,670
What?

1121
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:05,910
Do you regret it now?

1122
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:09,600
Since we're revisiting the place today,

1123
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:11,320
how about

1124
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,430
I buy you a drink?

1125
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:19,840
You can just lend me one person.

1126
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,840
I'm busy here.

1127
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,950
I just need a person to play the music.

1128
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:23,190
Can you see if there is a suitable…

1129
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:23,520
Wait.

1130
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,080
Qian Chuan.

1131
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:28,080
It's really you!

1132
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:30,190
Your fiancée?

1133
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:31,840
No.

1134
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:32,520
It's a misunderstanding.

1135
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:35,320
I'm your sister's colleague.

1136
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,390
Zhen Meiqiao.

1137
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,560
Qian Wei showed me your picture.

1138
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,520
You're as handsome
as you look in the picture.

1139
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:43,670
Can I

1140
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:45,080
ask you guys

1141
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:45,710
to do me a favor later?

1142
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:46,760
When we finish the job,

1143
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,630
I'll buy you a drink.

1144
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,040
You can enjoy it until tomorrow.

1145
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,080
H-he can't drink until tomorrow.

1146
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,840
Meiqiao, give me a chance

1147
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,120
to show you guys

1148
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,430
what a real man is like.

1149
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:58,760
Come on, you addicted rookie.

1150
00:39:59,080 --> 00:39:59,670
Thank you.

1151
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:01,950
Only one flaw in my plan.

1152
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,040
I have so many friends

1153
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,670
but no one can play the music for me.

1154
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,150
The song is his favorite.

1155
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,840
I'll be counting on you later.

1156
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:09,470
Sister-in-law.

1157
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,910
I'm not the sister-in-law.

1158
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:14,360
Dude.

1159
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:16,190
Then, dude,

1160
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:17,120
would you please

1161
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,150
just play it

1162
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,320
from two minutes and thirty seconds,

1163
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:20,520
the chorus part?

1164
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:22,430
As long as the atmosphere is there,
he'll say yes.

1165
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:23,630
Don't worry. No problem.

1166
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:24,360
Come on.

1167
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,320
You can do it!

1168
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,080
I can do it!

1169
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:27,840
Here comes the groom.

1170
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:29,120
Come on, get ready. Come on.

1171
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:29,670
Get ready. Get ready.

1172
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:45,670
What's going on?

1173
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,630
Jesus Christ.

1174
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:53,320
What's going on?

1175
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,000
It's a great merit
to help people get married.

1176
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,840
What is the karma
for ruining someone's marriage?

1177
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:57,760
Where should I press?

1178
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,600
Qin Zaizai.

1179
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,470
I've known you for seven years.

1180
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,910
Since the first day I met you,

1181
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:12,360
I've wanted you to be my husband.

1182
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:14,910
Until the second year,

1183
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:16,430
I pulled up my courage
to hold your hand.

1184
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:18,360
But I accidentally

1185
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,470
spanked your ass.

1186
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:20,800
You called me a pervert.

1187
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:41,230
In fact, I've been…

1188
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:46,670
♪You said
this wish is like a flower♪

1189
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:58,870
Take a deep breath.

1190
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:04,120
I'm sorry.

1191
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,600
I can't even perform well
in my proposal ceremony.

1192
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,000
I feel like

1193
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,630
I am not a successful person.

1194
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,230
When it comes to working,

1195
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:14,600
all the projects I've worked on
have ended in vain,

1196
