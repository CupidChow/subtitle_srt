173
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,550
Really?

174
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:47,030
Then we can go together.

175
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,150
It's such a rare opportunity.

176
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,470
There must be only one spot.

177
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:50,840
How can we go together?

178
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,520
Did you give it to me?

179
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,590
How come?

180
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:55,320
I'm just too busy.

181
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,080
And Fawei Online

182
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,440
has officially started.

183
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,910
Next term, the law school still

184
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,280
has community assistance to do.

185
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:00,880
Therefore,

186
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,710
I can't juggle all these works.

187
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:03,710
There's lots of preliminary work.

188
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,230
So I can only let the law firm go.

189
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,670
And I'll get a six-month internship

190
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,910
in a court

191
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,840
to accumulate my practical experience.

192
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:14,910
But that way, I won't have you

193
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,000
as my rival,

194
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,550
I may lose the feeling

195
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,350
of defeating you.

196
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,840
You're being too modest.

197
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,150
In my world,

198
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,670
you,

199
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:25,790
are the winner forever.

200
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,280
Woodpecker?

201
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,150
Qian Wei.

202
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,350
Are you…?

203
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:20,470
(Father.)

204
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:24,440
(After actress KiKi Kilin died,)

205
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,550
(Hirokazu Koreeda wrote her a eulogy.)

206
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,030
(It says, after death,)

207
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,790
(people will exist in all beings)

208
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:33,320
(and everywhere.)

209
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,400
(You may pass them in the street.)

210
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,910
(You may find his figure)

211
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,760
(suddenly among strangers.)

212
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,000
(Perhaps to lose)

213
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,000
(is to forever have.)

214
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,230
(About this sentence,)

215
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,350
(I didn't understand it until today.)

216
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,280
(I want to forever)

217
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,550
(stay in this world.)

218
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,840
(No return to 2022.)

219
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,670
(Dad.)

220
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,030
(Goodbye.)

221
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,470
(When you're free,)

222
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:03,000
(come to visit me in my dream.)

223
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,150
(I miss you forever.)

224
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,200
Wei,

225
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,400
why are you staying up again?

226
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,280
I've told you

227
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,470
that it does harm to your liver.

228
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,790
Drink some tea.

229
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,780
(Qian Wei)

230
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,080
(What a small world!)

231
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,590
(I've tried to put the past behind.)

232
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,550
(But you appear again.)

233
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,590
Chongwen,

234
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,200
I know that you haven't left.

235
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,670
Help me send a document to the client.

236
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:37,590
Okay.

237
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,470
I've texted you the address.

238
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,470
Let me have a look.

239
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,940
(Star Club, Zhaoyang Road 124,
Haizhou City)

240
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,320
Nightclub?

241
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,150
A returned rich second generation kid.

242
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,640
The girl just likes that place.

243
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,960
Her family doesn't like her.

244
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,080
She'll be happy to see you.

245
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,440
She likes young and handsome boys.

246
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,520
Ms. Lan, let me hold you.

247
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:05,910
Hello.

248
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:06,760
I'm not drunk.

249
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:07,550
Hello.

250
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,000
Excuse me,

251
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
who's Ms. Lan He

252
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,400
in the presidential suite?

253
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:12,960
She is Ms. Lan He.

254
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,080
- When she came with her friends,
- I…

255
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,350
- she already drank a lot.
- I…

256
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:17,710
Problem?

257
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:19,640
Thank you.

258
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,470
Open my wine.

259
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:24,030
My wine. Be quick.

260
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,400
Hello, Ms. Lan He.

261
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:27,550
I…

262
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,280
Cheers!

263
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,200
Drink with me. We'll be happy.

264
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:33,440
Hello!

265
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,880
I'm here to give you the contract.

266
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,230
Are you all right?

267
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,080
Ms. Lan.

268
00:15:59,200 --> 00:15:59,910
Ms. Lan.

269
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,640
Here, Ms. Lan.

270
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,110
Thanks.

271
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:17,150
Who are you?

272
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,000
I… I am

273
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,550
Li Chongwen from Jinyuan Law Firm.

274
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,550
I'm here to give you the contract.

275
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,910
You were drunk just now.

276
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,320
Why am I on the bus?

277
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,110
Um, well…

278
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,200
You were drunk just now.

279
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,350
Maybe you don't remember.

280
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:38,910
I took the liberty to use your phone

281
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,320
and call your father and your brother.

282
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,710
But they didn't answer.

283
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:42,710
I had no other choices.

284
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,000
I thought it would be unsafe for you

285
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,910
to go home alone.

286
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:45,960
And the subway has stopped running.

287
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,960
There are only buses left.

288
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:48,840
My father?

289
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,200
My brother?

290
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,790
They hope that they won't see me

291
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,030
till they die.

292
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,670
Why would they answer the phone?

293
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,350
You know what?

294
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:01,910
If the call

295
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,550
is from the police station

296
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:04,680
or the funeral parlor,

297
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,230
they will definitely answer it at once.

298
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,000
Next time you meet me

299
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,350
and get into this situation,

300
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,880
you just need to call my driver.

301
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,640
In this world,

302
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,520
only my driver

303
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,000
will come to pick me up.

304
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,230
Only he will come.

305
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:29,830
I'm sorry.

306
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:33,830
Contract?

307
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:34,420
(Joint Land Development Agreement)

308
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,430
Yes.

309
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,590
You drank too much

310
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,920
and threw up on it.

311
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,000
So I opened it to check

312
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,280
whether it got dirty.

313
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,830
It looks fine.

314
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:48,350
Is there any problem with this contract?

315
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,230
Of course no.

316
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,950
This contract was drawn up

317
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,070
by Lawyer Zhang himself.

318
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:56,800
It's absolutely fine.

319
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,470
Don't worry about it.

320
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,400
Are you still a student?

321
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,920
Little friend,

322
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,560
you are such a cute liar.

323
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,040
Please take the contract.

324
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,310
I've finished my task.

325
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,000
I'm leaving now.

326
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,070
My father

327
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,190
gave me this project.

328
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,280
And then my brother meddled in it

329
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,230
and said

330
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,920
that he was helping me.

331
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,590
He told me that all previous contracts

332
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,520
used the template of your law firm.

333
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,880
Just a little change would do.

334
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,280
But you know what?

335
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,350
If I lose again this time,

336
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:38,830
my father will never

337
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:39,830
trust me.

338
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,760
My brother is the client

339
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,280
of your law firm.

340
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,920
Aren't I?

341
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,000
Could you please help me

342
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,520
to safeguard my own interests?

343
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,800
Actually, in this contract,

344
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,430
there are many vague provisions.

345
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,230
About the land,

346
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,920
the contract stipulates

347
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,920
your respective area available

348
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,110
but says

349
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,280
that if necessary,

350
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,520
your brother can apply

351
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,830
to expand the original area.

352
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,590
Once your brother applies for expansion,

353
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:55,710
he will

354
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,160
be the provider of the land needed.

355
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,830
As a result, for the expanded area,

356
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,590
you need to pay him the difference

357
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,190
based on market price.

358
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,220
(Li Chongwen)

359
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,110
Thank you.

360
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,500
(Jinyuan Law Firm)

361
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,640
Are you an LLM

362
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,710
of UCB?

363
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:24,880
I also want to apply

364
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,400
for JD of UCB

365
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,110
this year.

366
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:26,800
Then I will

367
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,560
lend my class notes

368
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,230
to you.

369
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:28,920
It may help.

370
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:29,710
Okay.

371
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,470
This internship

372
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:35,560
is a new instance.

373
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,640
My previous life experience

374
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,640
is useless here.

375
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,070
Without the buff of beneficial spell,

376
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,760
I'm on my own for everything.

377
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,000
But with an IQ in my late 20s,

378
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:45,680
plus the hairline

379
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,040
of youth,

380
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,230
I believe I'll manage it.

381
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:48,800
I can do this.

382
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,710
Qian Wei.

383
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:56,230
Are you an intern or a shop owner?

384
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:58,640
Trust me.

385
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,520
One day you'll know

386
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,640
how useful they are.

387
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,280
And this.

388
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,190
It can treat heel abrasion.

389
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,040
This is also very useful.

390
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,310
When getting hungry outside,

391
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:06,520
we can eat the meal replacement.

392
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,800
It will fill your stomach.

393
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,800
And band aids.

394
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,230
Wow, you seem to have

395
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,400
rich work experience.

396
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,830
Do you know

397
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:13,350
whether they have

398
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:14,400
the coffee machine here?

399
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,830
I also brought instant coffee.

400
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,110
If you feel sleepy,

401
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,400
we'll drink together.

402
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:18,950
You can all drink mine.

403
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:19,590
It's okay.

404
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:20,560
Don't bother.

405
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,070
The Teaching Lawyer brought us

406
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,040
Yongpu Coffee.

407
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:24,680
(I almost forgot)

408
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,800
(that Li Chongwen was already an intern)

409
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,160
(in Jinyuan at that time.)

410
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,470
(It looks like this internship instance)

411
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:28,950
(is harder to brush.)

412
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:29,760
Thank you, Lawyer Zhang.

413
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:32,880
Do you know me?

414
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:36,310
I looked at the information

415
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,950
of partners and paralegals

416
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:39,520
at the entrance hall.

417
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,640
So I know it.

418
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,350
Very smart.

419
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,560
You must be Qian Wei

420
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,070
introduced by Mr. Zhang Zihan,

421
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:47,710
right?

422
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:48,470
Yes.

423
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,800
Class 2011, No.1 in your department.

424
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,110
Impressive resume.

425
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,160
You got good grades in bar exam.

426
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,880
Here, let me introduce you two.

427
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,400
This is Li Chongwen

428
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,760
from Class 2010 of Guanghua.

429
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,110
After getting
a postgraduate recommendation,

430
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:02,640
he got an internship here in Jinyuan.

431
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,310
It's been a year.

432
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,190
So he's familiar with the work here.

433
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,920
You can ask him

434
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,070
if there's any problem.

435
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,880
I'm aware

436
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,110
that you all are

437
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,470
top students at school.

438
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:14,800
Otherwise,

439
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:15,760
you wouldn't have

440
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,920
got the internship in Jinyuan.

441
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,400
But Jinyuan has no lack of talents.

442
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,400
Please show me your core value

443
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,000
in this short period.

444
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:24,950
Among all these interns,

445
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:25,950
in the end,

446
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:27,680
only one can stay here.

447
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,400
Don't be nervous, everyone.

448
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,230
After all, it's your first day here.

449
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,040
How about this?

450
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,950
Let's start with simple cases.

451
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,800
Now there is

452
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,400
a civil case of loan dispute.

453
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,000
I've sent the basic facts

454
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,230
to your mailboxes.

455
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:47,190
You can have a look.

456
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,000
Then every one of you

457
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
needs to make a work plan for the client

458
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,040
and send it to me.

459
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:53,640
Okay?

460
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:54,520
Okay.

461
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:54,880
Qian Wei,

462
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,470
finish it before work and send me it.

463
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:58,640
Is that okay?

464
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,880
But it's already 3 PM.

465
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:01,310
Yeah.

466
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,000
Yeah.

467
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,950
It's so late.

468
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:03,710
It's fine with me.

469
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:05,760
See?

470
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:07,310
Qian Wei has no problem.

471
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,310
Do you have any problems?

472
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,680
Come on.

473
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,760
Distribute the coffee.

474
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,190
Thank you.

475
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,880
Have coffee and get refreshed.

476
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,590
Qian Wei.

477
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,710
What?

478
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:27,800
I didn't put poison in it.

479
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,470
Everyone's coffee is the same.

480
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:31,880
Hello,

481
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:34,280
this flash brew black coffee

482
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,190
is sugar free.

Girls won't get fat after drinking it.

484
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:37,760
Drink as much as you like.

485
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,230
Don't expect me

486
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:42,280
to take special care of you

487
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:43,520
because we're both from Guanghua.

488
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,070
Relax.

489
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:47,470
I will finish the task on time.

490
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:48,520
Good.

491
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,160
Keep the coffee.

492
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,160
Thank you.

493

Lu Xun,

494
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,040
it's late, why are you still here?

495
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,760
Too many materials from the session.

00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,230
do you have a girlfriend?

499
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:16,430
You're so busy
just during the internship.

500
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,400
How to find a girl?

501
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,400
Do you have time to date?

502
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:20,760
You don't understand.

503
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,800
My girlfriend

504
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,520
enjoys work so much.

505
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:26,830
That's what

506
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,110
my ex-girlfriend said

507
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,110
the year I graduated.

508
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:30,680
Good luck.

509
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,590
Well, I'll go first.

510
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,070
Bye-bye.

00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,160
(Do you still remember)

520
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,680
(what the New Year's day is?)

521
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:25,000
(You've said it yourself.)

522
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
(Qian Wei)
(The day to welcome a new year!)

523
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,300
(Judge Chief Judge)

524
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,260
(Lu Xun)

525
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:33,680
Tsundere.

526
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:35,950
Is he so worried I forget his birthday?

527
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:37,160
You can remind me,

528
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,470
but I'll just ignore you.

529
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,520
It's boring to be straightforward.

530
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:00,920
Well,

531
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,880
I've sent you the opinion letter.

532
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:05,280
This is materials for tomorrow

533
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,520
I printed for the colleagues.

534
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,880
I'm not distracted.

535
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,950
I just read your plan.

536
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,160
Falsified contract loan

537
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,520
is a civil liability.

538
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,070
Why did you make it a crossed case
of civil and criminal law?

539
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,000
Loan sharking must be a criminal case.

540
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,760
Loan sharking?

541
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,070
I forgot that it was after 2018

542
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:25,230
that this kind of civil loans

543
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:26,950
was categorized as loan sharking.

544
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:30,190
This will be the law in the future.

545
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,430
Again?

546
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:34,190
Listen to me.

547
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:35,160
This kind of thing

548
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,710
will happen more frequently.

549
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,680
Shell companies like them

550
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,110
practice usury

551
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,920
in the name of borrowing

552
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,880
and then blackmail the debtors.

553
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,590
When there is

554
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:44,560
any legal dispute,

555
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,190
they'll just go bankrupt and run away.

556
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:46,920
Because,

557
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,880
P2P platforms will be involved
into fabricated sales.

558
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,110
After 2018,

559
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,230
this kind of behavior

560
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:51,920
will all be dealt with

561
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,830
as loan sharking.

562
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,110
Believe it nor not, the lender,

563
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,160
will not only compensate

564
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,280
but also go to jail.

565
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:59,190
Right, things will change in the future.

566
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,280
But that's in the future.

567
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,190
If you do it like that now,

568
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:04,800
your internship…

569
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:06,590
I got it.

570
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:07,400
I'll change it now.

571
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:23,000
Yours.

572
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:24,040
Thank you.

573
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,520
Take it easy.

574
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,430
Everything else is fine.

575
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:45,760
I've heard

576
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,190
about your father.

577
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,590
I thought you would be depressed
for long.

578
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,590
It's beyond my expectation

579
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,560
that you've recovered so fast.

580
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,310
It's not easy.

581
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,880
Maybe I've come around.

582
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:03,560
Even if I can start over,

583
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,950
the result of some things

584
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,950
remains the same.

585
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,040
Are you saying

586
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,830
that last time you father also…?

587
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,350
Right, also last time.

588
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:22,040
But that time it was too late

589
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,000
when he was sent to hospital,

590
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:25,710
he didn't get to say a word.

591
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,110
This time is much better.

592
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,560
He left me five words.

593
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:32,830
What words?

594
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:37,760
Wei, goodbye.

595
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:40,230
I love you.

596
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,590
(Is it true)

597
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:47,350
(that she's not
from this time and space?)

598
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,280
That's great.

599
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,310
I really envy you.

600
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,280
And you?

601
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,760
What about the debt your father left?

602
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,560
During this year of internship,

603
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,830
in addition to salary,

604
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,680
Lawyer Zhang will also give me

605
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,430
some legal fee.

606
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,590
So I paid off part of the debt.

607
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:18,040
And Lawyer Zhang also intends

608
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,760
to make me a regular worker here.

609
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:22,950
I'm kind of

610
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:23,920
getting closer to my dream.

611
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,310
Good then.

612
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:36,070
Cheers.

613
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:51,590
Qian Wei,

614
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:54,520
are you getting back to school?

615
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,680
Me, too. Let's go together.

616
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:57,590
It's okay.

617
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:58,880
I can go myself.

618
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:01,350
Why didn't you take the umbrella?

619
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:02,110
I saw one

620
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,110
in your cubicle.

621
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:07,310
Didn't you say that you like
to get wet in the rain?

622
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,830
He, will come to pick you up?

623
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,800
Chongwen,

624
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,920
how about joining us?

625
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,680
It's the same direction.

626
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,230
Yeah, come with us.

627
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,640
Um, it's all right.

628
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,880
I'll take the bus.

629
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,950
I'm used to it.

630
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:43,920
No worries.

631
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,710
The backseat of my car

632
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:45,640
is still vacant.

633
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,950
Come on. Let's go together.

634
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:48,280
Well, it's all right.

635
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,040
You go first.

636
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,070
Then we'll go.

637
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,640
Be careful, Chongwen.

638
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,310
Bye-bye.

639
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,400
Bye-bye.

640
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:25,880
I'm such an idiot.

641
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:27,830
How could anyone

642
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:29,070
like getting wet in the rain?

643
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,160
I was working in the courthouse

644
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,520
and found that it showered.

645
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,350
So I borrowed my father's car.

646
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,470
I should have arrived earlier.

647
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:47,640
But I went shopping

648
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,760
to give you a surprise.

649
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,590
What surprise?

650
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:52,110
Have a look.

651
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:54,230
Bag?

652
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,230
It's not something valuable.

653
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:59,310
I bought it mainly because yours

654
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:00,350
is a canvas bag.

655
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:01,160
If it rains

656
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,160
and wets your computer inside,

657
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,280
your file will be ruined.

658
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:04,520
So here it is.

659
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:08,160
Two same bags.

660
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,190
They must be for couples.

661
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:10,760
I'm not sure about that.

662
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,520
Anyway, the shop assistant told me

663
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,710
that your bag was half price,

664
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:16,190
so I bought it

665
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:16,950
to save some money.

666
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:20,640
Stop it. I'm driving.

667
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,350
Be serious.

668
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,710
I'll come to pick you up every day.

669
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,000
What do you think?

670
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,160
No.

671
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,950
All the other interns

672
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:29,230
take the bus or subway.

673
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:30,400
I can't be different.

674
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,230
Isn't it raining today?

675
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:33,590
It's a special situation.

676
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:35,230
Then I'll pick you up by bike.

677
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:38,160
I can get to school by bus directly.

678
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,430
Why do you go to the trouble?

679
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,160
Oh, are you jealous?

680
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,040
Of course, I'm jealous.

681
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,520
I'm jealous of your work.

682
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,110
What if…?

683
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,710
If we only meet when free,

684
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:48,430
I guess I can barely see you

685
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:50,920
for this whole month.

686
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,160
It looks like someone is eager

687
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,470
to spend the New Year with me.

688
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,950
Anyway, do you like that bag?

689
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,590
Just so-so. A half-price bag.

690
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,760

about your salary rise,

721
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:15,520
I know

722
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,760
that you want
to get the license quickly.

But,

729
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,950
you must be clear

00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:28,670
of your position

731
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:29,950

and physical condition.

Qin Fen has chronic nephritis.

769
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:03,800
I proposed

770
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,560
transferring him to a tiring position

00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,390
under high radiation

772
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:09,150
to let him leave voluntarily.

773
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:11,630
But the client wants to do it fast.

774
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,470
Qin Fen has made no mistake

775
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:14,280
to be held accountable

776
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,870
during his work.

777
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:18,230
No annual leave for the nine years.

778
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:19,910
And based on his working hours

779
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:22,080
and number of business trips,

780
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:22,600
plus his physical

781
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,950
examination report,

782
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,430
his nephritis

783
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:26,800
is clearly caused

784
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,520
by overwork.

785
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,710
This is a work-related injury.

786
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:30,150
Why should he be fired?

787
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:31,150
There is no why.

788
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,840
The client has no obligation

789
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,910
to explain to us

790
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:36,040
his real reason for the dismission.

791
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:37,430
If he doesn't tell us,

792
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:38,190
then we have

793
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,000
no legitimate reason

794
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,670
to dismiss an employee

795
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:41,000
with nine working years.

796
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,040
Qian Wei.

797
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,710
There are many possibilities.

798
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,360
Maybe it's because

799
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,230
he failed in the factional struggle.

800
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,520
Or maybe it's because

801
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,520
that his health

802
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,760
or his family

803
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:54,360
can't support him to work efficiently.

804
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,190
Anyway,

805
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,040
the client has made this decision.

806
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,230
The reason doesn't matter now.

807
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,630
The most important thing

808
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:02,230
is how to meet our client's need

809
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:03,800
to dismiss him at a low price.

810
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,470
Then well…

811
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:10,390
How about

812
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:11,230
making a compromise?

813
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:12,950
We let them pay for his overtime

814
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:14,470
and year-end bonus first.

815
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:15,710
Then we change his employment contract

816
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:16,870
into a labor agreement.

817
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,760
And about his salary,

818
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,470
maybe double or…

819
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:22,080
The client doesn't want a compromise.

820
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:22,910
They're unwilling to pay him

821
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:23,800
for his past work and the dismissing.

822
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,950
So they won't compensate

823
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:25,520
the cumulative overtime pay

824
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,670
and year-end bonus they owe him.

825
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:28,430
We're not sitting here

826
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:29,190
to work out

827
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:30,040
a compromised plan.

828
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:32,630
Are you really

829
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:33,320
Mr. Zhang's student?

830
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:38,760
I have an idea.

831
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,120
We might need the clients' cooperation.

832
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:42,560
It's a little complicated.

833
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:44,670
Tell us.

834
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,600
We can let a C-level employee

835
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,710
tell him to take a vacation orally.

836
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,760
For big companies like Leda Group,

837
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,760
there's usually an internal procedure

838
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:53,040
for taking a long leave.

839
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,360
Half a month later,

840
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,800
the company can say

841
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,150
that he takes a leave

842
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,470
without approval.

843
00:38:58,470 --> 00:38:59,390
That will be absenteeism.

844
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,840
It also will avoid compensation

845
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,000
of past work and dismissing.

846
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:03,910
Good.

847
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,320
What about the annual leave payment

848
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:07,910
and his cumulative year-end bonus

849
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:08,760
the company owes him?

850
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,470
Doesn't Leda always advocate

851
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:13,280
a corporate culture of striving hard?

852
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,910
We can

853
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:16,360
draft an internal agreement

854
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,190
with equity dividends,

855
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:19,600
increases in year-end bonus

856
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:21,760
and quicker promotions

857
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,430
to tempt their employees
to give up their annual leaves,

858
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:25,430
overtime pay

859
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:27,320
and their previous year-end bonuses.

860
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,670
It'll be issued to and signed with
the middle and senior management.

861
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:30,760
Finally,

862
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,760
we give this agreement

863
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,520
a high-sounding name,

864
