1
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:08,680
Have you got anything?

2
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:10,000
Is the Morris the major client

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,030
of the tea garden?

4
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:12,800
(Yes, I have.)

5
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:14,680
(Ma Lun does the purchase every year)

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,360
(at high prices using another name.)

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,360
(Or else,)

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,150
(the tea garden)

9
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:19,310
(wouldn't have made it till this day.)

10
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:22,520
Okay.

11
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,040
I see.

12
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,440
Thank you.

13
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,070
(Come here.)

14
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:29,950
(Hold it for me.)

15
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:31,150
(You need to toss it.)

16
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:33,950
(This. This is good.)

17
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,150
(You have it.)

18
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:35,910
(There you go.)

19
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:39,470
(I got it. I got it.)

20
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,240
(Look at me.)

21
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:43,950
(Take it.)

22
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,240
(Give mine back to me.)

23
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,400
(This is mine. That is yours.)

24
00:00:53,860 --> 00:01:02,460
(In tea blossoms fragrance in green mountains,
Lun is waiting for the one from the past.)

25
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,360
I still think

26
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,680
SnowNoah ends

27
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,590
in a sorry way.

28
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,190
The protagonist went through

29
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:50,950
rigors and difficulties

30
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,040
to finally manage
to rescue the princess.

31
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,360
But one of them

32
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,440
was an adventurer

33
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,310
while the other enjoyed freedom.

34
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:56,910
They ended up going separated ways.

35
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,760
The aftertaste

36
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,000
of a realistic

37
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,720
work of art lasts longer.

38
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,550
But if this is how you feel,

39
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,880
I can graciously

40
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,320
add a stinger

41
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:12,630
to fulfill your wish.

42
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,960
What will it be like?

43
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,750
You'll see when the game comes out.

44
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,270
By then,

45
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,390
we return to this place for celebration.

46
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:21,360
Hi.

47
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,470
Can you take a picture of us, please?

48
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:25,240
Thank you.

49
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,110
Come here.

50
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,720
This is so beautiful.

51
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:35,910
So are you.

(Qian Wei Trainee Lawyer)

56
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,640
Be honest with me.

57
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,670
The paralegal who you said

58
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,110
you'd defend last night.

59
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:20,880
Was she my sister?

60
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,440
You have feelings for my sister, right?

61
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:25,670
I…

62
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,510
I wanted

63
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,040
to defend Zhanying's reputation.

64
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,270
I couldn't let your sister

65
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,200
discredit Zhanying's reputation,

66
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:31,880
could I?

67
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,000
And you.

68
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I told you to not come.

69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,440
Why did you have to tag along?

70
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,880
You're still very much sick.

71
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,200
Why don't you go home
and get some rest?

72
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,320
Mind your tone
when you talk to my sister.

73
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,040
You're a jock,

74
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,440
so you're grumpy all the time?

75
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,350
We are just communicating.

76
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,230
Why do you have to be grumpy?

77
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,040
You want

78
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,440
to beat me, huh?

79
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,350
You'll get yourself
in trouble sooner or later,

80
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:51,950
you know?

81
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,510
Stay out of it.

82
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,760
Let them talk.

83
00:04:59,270 --> 00:04:59,790
Can't you tell

84
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:00,070
that Lu Xun

85
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,390
is worried about your sister?

86
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:03,920
I can't tell.

87
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,790
I say this is

88
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:06,720
workplace PUA.

89
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,640
There are many things you can't tell.

90
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,790
Can't you tell

91
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:10,760
that ever since your sister
was out of hospital,

92
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,600
she's been in love with Lu Xun?

93
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:14,600
For real?

94
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,880
Is my sister stricken

95
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,350
with Stockholm syndrome?

96
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,230
No.

97
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,480
I don't approve it.

98
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,440
You don't approve it?

99
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,390
Do you have a say in it?

100
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,950
You told Sheng Kai

101
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,640
that you dreamed of your ex last night?

102
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,160
Then what?

103
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:34,950
What?

104
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:35,640
Are you jealous?

105
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,600
No, I'm not.

106
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,160
You're not.

107
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,320
Then why did you ask?

108
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,160
I'm…

109
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,200
I care about your life

110
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,070
as your boss.

111
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:47,600
What's wrong with that?

112
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,790
You have a crush on me, huh?

113
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,950
Let's keep a distance.

114
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:53,830
I don't want

115
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:54,550
to be infected

116
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,720
with your brain disease.

117
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:56,950
Fine.

118
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,320
Keep a distance, right?

119
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,070
I think

120
00:05:59,110 --> 00:05:59,830
you just don't want

121
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:00,920
me to see your flushed face.

122
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,390
No flush at all.

123
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,350
This is all

124
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,040
but your misinterpretation.

125
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,230
Come on.

126
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,320
I was only kidding.

127
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,230
I'll get you back on feet.

128
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:27,880
No, no, no.

129
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,600
Don't touch me.

130
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,880
I was just kidding.

131
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,070
Come on.

132
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:31,790
No, no, no.

133
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:32,390
Distance.

134
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:32,880
Distance, please.

135
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,110
I…

136
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:33,670
Stay away from my sister.

137
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:34,230
I was just kidding.

138
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,390
I... I'm okay.

139
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:35,880
Please don't…

140
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,040
I tell you what.

141
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,950
I put up with you for a long time.

142
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:46,950
Because you…

143
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,320
You keep depreciating her,

144
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:48,950
and you want to date her.

145
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:49,830
Also, because of you,

146
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:50,350
I lost my job.

147
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,640
Control yourself!

148
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,070
Behave!

149
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,480
What do you think you are doing?

150
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,270
What are you doing?

151
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,160
You're unbelievable.

152
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,480
What are you doing?

153
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,760
You two really are a pair of something.

154
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,600
One is ungrateful,

155
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,270
the other has a brain full of nonsense.

156
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,110
Do you have any idea

157
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,000
how much compensation
I can ask you for?

158
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:18,480
I…

159
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,440
Sit there.

160
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,600
I can easily put you in jail

161
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,640
and make you compensate me.

162
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,040
Take it.

163
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,670
(I didn't expect
that Lu Xun was hit in the face)

164
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,480
(because I got)

165
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,440
(Qian Chuan here.)

166
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,950
(Could it be the precognitive dreams)

167
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,350
(all those movies describe?)

168
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,390
(Or is there something wrong
with my head?)

169
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,160
Am I…?

170
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,830
Heavy?

171
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,070
Just right

172
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:08,920
for me.

173
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,070
Am I heavy?

174
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,390
Just right

175
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:16,920
for me.

176
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,160
You asked me who

177
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,390
I dated in my dream, right?

178
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,640
I know it wasn't me.

179
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:23,950
You?

180
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,110
It could be you if you like.

181
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,040
I mean.

182
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,200
I… I… I, em…

183
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,160
Em…

184
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,340
(Sheng Kai)

185
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,520

authorization document.)

189

(I have signed my name on it.)

190
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,520
(Like you said,)

191
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,840
(I haven't forgiven him.)

192
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,710
(I just let myself off.)

193
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,230

(we owe each other nothing.")

197
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,400
The authorization document?

198
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,520
She signed it.

199
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,400
We did it.

200
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,760
We did it!

201
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:03,400
Stop beating me.

202
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:04,590
Yes, we did it,

203
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,960
but you don't have to beat me, do you?

204
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,590
I mean, look.

205
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:07,840
Just take a look at it.

206
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:13,790
I tell you what.

207
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,320
Sneak attack is cheating.

208
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,000
Let's have a fair game.

209
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,150
You take it quite seriously, huh?

210
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,200
Are you a three-year-old?

211
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,110
Squat hold.

212
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:21,790
I challenge you.

213
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:22,280
Childish.

214
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,320
Game on.

215
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,080
Let's do weighted plank.

216
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,280
How did you find out
about the tea garden?

217
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,470
Panoramic map nowadays

218
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,840
keeps a record of the previous images.

219
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:34,880
Look.

220
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,150
I saw Ma Lun several times.

221
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,000
He drank the same tea

222
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
as what he treated

223
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,960
to the guests.

224
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,320
And I thought

225
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,960
it couldn't be that much
of a coincidence.

226
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,000
I looked it up,

227
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:46,080
and just as I expected.

228
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,790
This is cheating.

229
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:50,230
I tell you what,

230
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,200
our bet doesn't count.

231
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:53,640
Do you

232
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,230
wish to see anyone else?

233
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,110
Last time in the hospital,

234
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:02,790
I saw

235
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,150
you cry.

236
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:04,790
Is it because

237
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,880
you dreamed of your father?

238
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:38,280
I don't care.

239
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,030
To return the favor,

240
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,080
I need your shoulder.

241
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:56,710
Slanted.

242
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,000
It's slanted.

243
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,400
Still slanted.

244
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,280
I did a bad job

245
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,470
on the Morris case.

246
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,840
But it wasn't because of Qian Wei.

247
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,840
At the start,

248
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,320
I didn't have anyone on my side

249
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,550
at AES.

250
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:27,790
Later, I met you.

251
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,110
The company paid off

252
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,110
your debt,

253
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,080
and you

254
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:34,960
doctored the company's

255
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,150
account book

256
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,640
in return.

257
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,000
But afterwards,

258
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,840
when my brother forced me
out of the country,

259
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,880
you went abroad with me.

260
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,400
Together, we were through
quite some difficulties.

261
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,320
We bided our time

262
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,880
for this opportunity

263
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,520
to run domestic business.

264
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,840
I did all I could

265
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,790
to promote you to the director position.

266
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,030
Things haven't been easy.

267
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,350
The company now puts me

268
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,550
in charge of the IPO.

269
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,470
I need to take over

270
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,440
a clean-slate company.

271
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,840
Only by relisting the company,

272
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,440
a total change,

273
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:20,910
can we make sure

274
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,080
that no one will investigate
what you did.

275
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:28,790
I know

276
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,840
I have no way back.

277
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,710
But I don't mean to turn back anyway.

278
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,230
The counsel fee

279
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,710
won't be enough to support your life.

280
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,590
Can you still live

281
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,350
a life when you need
to work overnight and take buses?

282
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:04,960
I may reminisce about the past

283
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,280
because of Qian Wei,

284
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:08,960
but it doesn't mean

285
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,470
I reminisce about the person I was.

286
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,960
I promised you

287
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,110
that I'd do everything I could

288
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,230
to ensure your firm footing,

289
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,320
to enable you

290
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,000
to grasp what you desire.

291
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,790
And I won't eat my word.

292
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,110
Like that specimen.

293
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,960
I didn't mean to slant it.

294
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,710
It's because

295
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,280
the nail itself is slanted.

296
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,280
But that's fine.

297
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,400
I'll put it on the shelf.

298
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,150
Then it's evenly placed.

299
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,590
Ruomei has no value anymore.

300
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,670
Dispose of it.

301
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,280
Keep the public voice under control.

302
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:02,960
I'm on it right away.

303
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:34,670
Keep going.

304
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:35,400
Keep going.

305
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:36,670
Chuan, hold it.

306
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,080
Chuan, hold it.

307
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,280
Qian Chuan, keep going.

308
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:39,880
Hold it.

309
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,230
Good work. Keep going.

310
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,150
Hold it.

311
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,760
You can do it.

312
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,440
Good work.

313
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,320
Hold it.

314
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:48,760
Hold it.

315
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:50,840
Add another ten kilograms.

316
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,110
Bring it on.

317
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:54,640
I won't lose to you.

318
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,470
Keep going. Keep going.

319
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,200

Let's go.

Forever No.2?

Good for you.

I didn't know our Forever No.2

344
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,640
won so many championships.

345

347
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,640
weren't for your horrible singing,

350
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,710
Be happy with your achievements.

351

You won a second place,

352
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,280
I, the horrible singer,

353
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,110
never won any place.

354
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,840
I'm Forever No.2, right?

355
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,030
You defeated me,

356
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,590
then you won the first place.

357
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,280
That's true.

358
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,320
How are you,

359
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,110
Forever No.2,

360
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,150
going to congratulate me,

361
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:46,960
the winner?

362
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,110
What?

363
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:07,710
Qian Wei,

364
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:12,430
we've only known
each other so shortly.

365
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:13,640
I didn't expect that…

366
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,160
Sorry. Let me get myself together.

367
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,920
What's happening?

368
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,040
Your bar examination result is out.

369
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,520
Take a look.

Congratulations.

373
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,000
Congratulations.

Stop.

376
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:05,110
Stop clapping.

377
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:09,950
Look.

378
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,430
Pure workplace friendship.

379
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,160
Right?

380
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:14,430
Yes.

381
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,230
Come on.

382
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:16,430
Stop what you are doing.

383
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,070
I'd like to make a speech.

384
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,400
Today

385
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,400
is a good day.

386
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,560
I have two announcements to make.

387
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,520
The first one is,

388
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,950
Ruomei lost.

389
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,560
Zhanying and Morris

390
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,830
signed a contract

391
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:31,230
of ten years of legal counsel service.

392
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,590
Terrific.

393
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,280
The second thing is

394
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,040
about Qian Wei.

395
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:38,520
Qian Wei

396
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,000
has finally passed the bar exam,

397
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,520
and she's now only one step

398
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,310
away from becoming a licensed lawyer.

399
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,430
Great.

400
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,070
Qian Wei.

401
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,110
Give us a speech.

402
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,160
Make a speech.

403
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,230
- Speech.
- Speech.

404
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:51,800
Make a speech.

405
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:57,590
Feels great.

406
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,760
Pretty concise.

407
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:02,520
Wonderful.

408
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,430
I appreciate conciseness.

409
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:05,520
Good. Good.

410
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,560
She's finished?

411
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:09,590
Feels great.

412

413
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:10,680
Present time.

416
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,160
congratulations.

417
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,430
I

418
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,400
admit defeat.

419
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,350
Thank you, Mr. Tao.

Don't thank me.

422
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,110
If you will,

423
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,110
you thank Lu Xun.

424
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,520
The moment Lu Xun

425
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,400
learned about it,

426
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,040
he confidently told me

427
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,040
that you'd pass the exam,

428
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:39,920
and asked me

429
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:40,590
to prepare the name badge

430
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,430
in advance.

431
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:42,110
Tao,

432
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,680
did I?

433
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,640
Don't you

434
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,070
impute it to me

435
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,190
every time you lose a bet.

436
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,350
He's shy.

437
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,350
He's right.

438
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,310
Actually,

439
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,710
I've prepared another reward.

440
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:56,760
I personally made it

441
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,920
for you.

442
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,040
Anyway.

443
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:01,230
Just try it.

444
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:02,760
One sip at a time, though.

445
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,230
I won't make another cup
of coffee for you.

446
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:05,880
Hold on.

447
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,800
I remember you got

448
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,230
a little higher than 470 points.

449
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:09,000
But now

450
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,400
the exam was reformed,

451
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,880
the total points are 480.

452
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,400
Percentage speaking,

453
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,880
I got more points than you did.

454
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,920
And your reward

455
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,710
is a cup of coffee?

456
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:18,590
It seems stingy, isn't it?

457
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:20,950
Wait a minute.

458
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,680
What's the deal

459
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,830

Well, he's a killjoy, isn't he?

Fine.

has been working on it over a year.

It's a costly project,

but he managed
to get investments.

486
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:07,110
He even rebuilt

487
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,070
its profit model

488
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,160
to make it sustainable.

489
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,520
I asked him,

490

"Hold on,

491
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
wasn't it proposed

"Keep it a secret."

525
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,560
The bathroom card.

526
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,350
Look.

527
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,160
Lucky, huh?

528
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:27,430
I also

529
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,400
invited a major client

530
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:28,920
who saved our law firm

531
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,800
out of distress

532
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,830
to be here tonight.

533
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:32,710
When she's here,

534
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:33,710
let's give her a warm welcome.

535
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:36,760
Come on.

536
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,920
Let me check my luck.

537
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,160
Yeah.

538
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:38,800
You try one.

539
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:44,880
A four.

540
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,190
This is called Psycho.

541
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,280
After you pick this card,

542
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,160
no matter what you do,

543
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,590
no one responds to you.

544
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,110
If anyone does, he loses.

545
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,110
But don't you worry.

546
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,350
I will respond to you.

547
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,280
(Well, I'm in luck.)

548
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,710
I don't want to speak to you.

549
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:06,800
Mr. Lu,

550
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,640
who was the assistant

551
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,830
that you mentioned to Sheng Kai?

552
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,520
It was you who furtively

553
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,590
got the note out
of the wishing bottle, didn't you?

554
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:19,880
Wait a minute.

555
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,350
Something's up.

556
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,760
I heard about drift bottle,

557
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,280
but this is the first time
I've ever heard about wishing bottle.

558
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:25,950
Lu Xun,

559
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:26,760
what wishing bottle?

560
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:29,950
You keep taking anti-allergic pills

561
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:30,800
because you never

562
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,590
threw away

563
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:33,560
the dog that I won for you.

564
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:37,310
The light board on the way
to the hospital

565
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,470
was a work of yours, right?

566
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:39,920
Speak.

567
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,680
Don't keep your lips sealed.

568
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,640
Look at me.

569
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,830
Feeling guilty?

570
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:47,520
Why can't you let it out?

571
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,830
Look at me and speak.

572
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,160
You are avoiding the questions.

573
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,230
Come on, speak.

574
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:57,950
I lose.

575
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:01,830
Do you need more alcohol?

576
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:04,110
Wait.

577
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,920
Did you name

578
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,000
Fawei Online

579
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,590
after me?

580
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,000
I chose it from the dictionary.

581
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,640
Nonsense.

582
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,880
This is what I always wanted

583
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,950
to do when I was in the university,

584
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:17,280
but I didn't have
enough resource back then.

585
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,310
Hadn't Mr. Tao told me about it,

586
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,830
I'd never find out.

587
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:21,760
Listen.

588
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,110
Why do you have to act like this?

589
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:23,710
Why can't you admit

590
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,110
that you're nice to me?

591
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:26,280
Has what I did

592
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,310
got anything to do with you?

593
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,280
Answer my question.

594
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:41,880
Qian Wei.

595
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,040
Zixin.

596
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,640
The last time we met,

597
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,560
you were in a coma

598
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,590
in the hospital.

599
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:48,680
How are you doing now?

600
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:53,590
It's so good to see you in real life.

601
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,400
You silly.

602
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:55,800
As if

603
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,350
I live in a virtual world.

604
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:01,680
What were

605
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,950
you two talking about?

606
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,590
We were talking about work.

607
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,310
Miss Mo,

608
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,400
you're here at last.

609
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,160
Lu Xun.

610
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:16,190
Qian Wei.

611
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,560
This is the major client

612
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,710
I mentioned.

613
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:20,280
Her Cool Visitor

614
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,040
is now an up-and-coming company

615
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,070
in the film industry.

616
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,350
Thanks to Miss Mo's trust,

617
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,470
we got through the crisis

618
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:26,920
during the first instance

619
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,590
of the Morris case.

620
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,040
Years have passed,

621
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:30,830
Zixin's beauty

622
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:31,520
and hairline

623
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,920
remain the way she looked
at the age of 18.

624
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:33,760
Her disposition

625
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,710
feels much lightened up, though.

626
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,160
I was just going to celebrate

627
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:37,920
my first triumph,

628
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,680
and right before that,

629
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,400
here comes a gorgeous interloper.

630
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,400
I'm sick of this trial.

631
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:43,070
Death sentence it is.

632
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,190
You overrated me, Mr. Tao.

633
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,350
But Zixin

634
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:49,190
isn't wearing

635
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:49,950
her crystal necklace.

636
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,830
So she and Lu Xun…

Quickly,

review the contract for me.

646
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,640
Have you prepared

the material I asked for?

648
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,280
Boss,

649
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,160
I'm no longer a paralegal now.

650
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:18,710
I'm now a trainee lawyer.

651
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,230
I'm glad you still call me boss.

652
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:24,350
You're a trainee lawyer/paralegal.

653
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:25,920
You passed the bar exam,

654
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,640
but it's only the first step

655
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,310

you are to make no mistake,

658
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:31,520
pass the assessment,

659
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,710
get your license

660
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,800
to become

661
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,800
a real lawyer.

662
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,040
So before that,

663
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,070
I need to keep my eyes

664
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:37,680
on you

665
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,950
in case you make those

666
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,230
rookie mistakes again.

667
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,800

No excuses.

Besides,

I've been in the business for years,

after passing the bar exam.

674
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,400
I am not that stupid

675
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,640
to commit hit-and-run

676
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,640
or break social peace

677
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,560
or practice usury.

678
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,800
You want me to be your assistant

679
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,950
and a trainee lawyer at the same time?

680
00:26:58,950 --> 00:26:59,680
Aren't you supposed

681
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,160
to give me a pay raise?

682
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:01,710
Also,

683
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:03,310
we haven't got a chance

684
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:03,830
to finish our conversation
from yesterday.

685

I tell you what,

686
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,190
don't mention the pay raise to me.

687
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:11,920
Go talk to Tao.

688

691

Lu Xun

692
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,160
is so cheap.

693
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,070
A typical cheap boss.

694
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:30,160
When you proposed to join his team,

695
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,470
he should know

696
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:32,230
that your name

697

698
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,400
that you are a money person.

699
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:36,710
There's nothing wrong
with a little pay raise.

700
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,590
If you're under too much pressure,

701
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,000
you can join us,

702
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:40,880
Team Wu.

703
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,350
You're welcome

704
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,110
to our team.

705
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,430
Come on.

706
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,230
Oops, you fell.

707
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:51,430
I'll give you a hand.

708
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,430
Just... Just a mistake.

709
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,400
Sit over there.

710
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,110
There you go.

711
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,350
Work harder.

712
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:05,710
Come in.

713
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,280
Mr. Lu.

714
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,190
Your coffee.

715
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,520
You said you were
no longer a paralegal,

716
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,710
but you still made the coffee.

717
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:32,590
What are you doing?

718
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,470
Help me clean my lips.

719
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,560
I think your brain

720
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,190
hasn't fully recovered.

721
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,400
I don't get why

722
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,590
you flirted with me
like a teenage girl.

723
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,070
Be honest with me,

724
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,000
do you have a crush on me?

725
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:00,230
No.

726
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:01,880
Then why did you fawn on me
for no reason?

727
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,710
I got a little tipsy last night.

728
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:08,590
Do you have something

729
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:09,760
that you'd like to say to me?

730
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,760
Do you expect me

731
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,310
to say anything to you?

732
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,230
Not really.

733
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,880
When you picked the psycho card,

734
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,070
why did you get so close to me?

735
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,800
And the dream you mentioned.

736
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:32,070
What did you mean?

737
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:32,760
Who did you have a relationship with

738
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,430
in your dream?

739
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:34,590
Who did you have a crush on?

740
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,000
No one.

741
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,040
I asked you first this time.

742
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:40,950
You must give me the answers.

743
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:41,950
After I get the answers,

744
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,520
I'll answer your questions.

745
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,280
I will, then.

746
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:48,880
In my dream,

747
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,040
the one I fell for was…

748
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:52,830
No paper.

749
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:53,560
Lu…

750
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,280
Who sent the gifts?

751
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:09,640
She's here.

752
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,190
Let's go back to our seats.

753
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:24,560
(Hello.)

754
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,590
(This is Love-you Pie.)

755
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,560
(We're doing)

756
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,590
(a lucky draw event for our members.)

757
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,560
(Congratulations.)

758
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,680
(You're a lucky customer.)

759
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:30,760
(It shows)

760
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,040
(that the
Pumped-Up-for-Work gift pack)

761
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,190
(has been received.)

762
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:34,310
(I hope you enjoy.)

763
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,160
(I'm not a member of the shop.)

764
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,350
(First, the take-away.)

765
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:39,280
(Then, the prize.)

766
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:40,800
(I got it.)

767
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,070
(In the dream, Lu Xun said)

768
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,920
(he'd collect all the luck for me.)

769
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:47,280
(He's doing it in real life)

770
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,230
(though he's in denial.)

771
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:52,590
Qian Wei,

772
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,950
congratulations on your exam result.

773
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,350
I've prepared…

774
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,350
It seems unnecessary now, I suppose.

775
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,920
Flowers, snacks, and vitamins.

776
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:04,160
Leave me chanceless.

777
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:07,160
Qian Wei,

778
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:08,920
judging from

779
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,560
all these things,

780
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,590
I can tell

781
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,760
that this dude

782
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,230
must have invested a lot

783
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:14,590
in you.

784
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:16,560
However,

785
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:17,920
I think

786
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,350
it's more important

787
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,560
that you work under

788
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,800
a cute, kind,

789
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,160
talented,

790
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,000
and smart boss.

791
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:25,590
Here.

792
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,800
The gift for you.

793
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,710
Come in, please.

794
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:34,680
Zixin?

795
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,000
Come on in.

796
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,160
I tell you what.

797
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:41,350
Recently,

798
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,470
Mo Zixin

799
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:45,280
and Lu Xun have meetings every day.

800
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,110
Every single day.

801
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,350
Days and nights.

802
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,070
During the daytime, that's okay.

803
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,760
But on the nights?

804
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,760
That's questionable.

805
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:53,560
If you ask me,

806
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,160
Lu Xun

807
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,000
will be a part
of her rich family sooner or later.

808
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:57,350
I suggest

809
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,470
you make a backup plan.

810
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,520
For example, me…

811
00:31:59,520 --> 00:31:59,950
Hey, I say…

812
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:02,110
Romance permeates

813
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,520
our law firm recently, huh?

814
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,950
Qian Wei is being wooed,

815
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:05,950
so is Mr. Lu.

816
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:07,040
You see that?

817
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,040
Even a fool can tell.

818
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:08,760
Are you calling me a fool?

819
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,190
(I think Zixin)

820
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,680
(isn't over Lu Xun.)

821
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:17,070
Lu Xun.

822
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,230
You've handled

823
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,470
my projects well

824
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:20,710
in this month.

825
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:22,280
I'd like

826
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,350
to sign a long-term contract
of our legal counsel service

827
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,430
with you.

828
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:26,430
We were college mates.

829
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,830
If you have any concerns

830
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,070
or requests,

831
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,000
just let me know.

832
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:31,430
I'll do what I can to meet your need.

833
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,400
I can do

834
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:35,280
short-term.

835
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,520
Long-term?

836
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,590
I'm afraid I can't.

837
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,800
I have been booked

838
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,430
for this year

839
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:41,430
and the next.

840
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,640
I know you're a busy man,

841
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,160
but I personally founded
and developed

842
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,760
Cool Visitor.

843
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,190
Currently, the most important thing

844
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:49,280
is copyright operation.

845
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,520
When it comes to copyright issues,
you're an expert.

846
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:53,310
I won't feel reassured

847
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,520
if someone else counsels me.

848
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,430
Lu Xun.

849
00:32:58,430 --> 00:32:59,040
How about this?

850
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,470
Go through your schedule

851
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:01,560
for the latter half of the year.

852
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:03,880
See if you can make some time.

853
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:05,350
Miss Mo

854
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:05,880
has provided

855
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,560
for our firm

856
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,110
with many cases in recent times.

857
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,470
If Miss Mo asks for our help,

858
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,520
we do what we can.

859
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:11,560
Listen.

860
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,160
You'll treat

861
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:13,760
us to lunch

862
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:14,830
at noon.

863
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,640
We'll talk over some nice dishes.

864
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:31,160
You didn't agree

865
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,590
because you are afraid someone may
misunderstand the situation, right?

866
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:34,830
Don't worry.

867
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:36,110
Many years have passed.

868
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:38,230
I'm over it.

869
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:39,830
The No.1 priority in my life

870
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:41,070
now is my career.

871
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:43,680
Yes.

872
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,430
I know.

873
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:46,880
We keep things professional,

874
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,800
but the one out there

875
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:50,920
is still confused.

876
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:53,590
What are you doing?

877
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,160
Do you think I'm blind?

878
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,070
Get in here.

879
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,430
You kept sticking

880
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:01,160
your head in and out.

881
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,310
Do you think I didn't see you?

882
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,830
I... I didn't.

883
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,400
I just…

884
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,070
I won some snacks,

885
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:07,950
and I wanted

886
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:08,910
to share with you.

887
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:13,430
These are

888
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:14,910
all your favorite snacks.

889
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:18,000
Were you that lucky?

890
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,800
I was wondering, too.

891
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,630
How could

892
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:21,320
I be so lucky, right?

893
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,670
I'm sure someone

894
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:24,600
intentionally prepared these.

895
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:26,040
Do you want

896
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,280
some coffee?

897
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:27,870
Zixin, would you like

898
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:28,800
some healthy herbal tea?

899
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,230
I've got some.

900
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:30,600
No, thank you.

901
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:30,950
I suggest

902
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:32,230
you drink more of that.

903
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,430
It's good for your brain.

904
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:34,150
Also,

905
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,360
how many times

906
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,120
have I caught you

907
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,080
eavesdropping outside my office?

908
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,230
Tell me.

909
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:39,320
I wasn't eavesdropping.

910
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,120
I was learning project information.

911
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,710
Learning project information, huh?

912
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:44,280
Besides,

913
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,560
Zixin said

914
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,560
that we were college mates.

915
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,000
What are you, SpongeBob?

916
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,150
You can always make time

917
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,040
if you really want to.

918
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,320
As my assistant,

919
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:53,040
you should know the best
whether I have time or not.

920
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:54,950
What?

921
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:57,520
You want me to accept the offer?

922
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,430
Long as you won't

923
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:02,360
do it single-handed,

924
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:02,910
I'll be

925
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:04,670
100% supportive,

926
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:06,120
and would like to be a part of it.

927
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,950
I, too, would like
to help my old college mate.

928
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,910
How about this, Mr. Tao?

929
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:13,630
Qian Wei can participate in it

930
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:14,470
so that

931
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:15,320
Lu Xun

932
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,430
can spend less time on it.

933
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,630
I... I think that's a good idea.

934
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:19,760
I agree.

935
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:22,630
It happens that I've got

936
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:23,430
an urgent project.

937
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:25,760
Enpei Works just bought

938
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,600
the copyright of an animation of ours

939
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,560
called Court of Law.

940
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,040
The filming has begun,

941
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,670
but the filming crew
is in dire need for money,

942
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:31,910
so they hope

943
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:33,040
I can invest in the project

944
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,040
as one of the producers.

945
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,630
I personally

946
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:36,360
quite like the animation,

947
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,600
so I incline to be an investor.

948
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:39,630
Oh, Qian Wei.

949
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:41,470
I'll send you the contract.

950
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:42,760
Tomorrow, we'll go

951
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,430
visit the filming site together.

952
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:44,840
Please do a risk evaluation for me.

953
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:45,520
Sure.

954
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,150
No problem.

955
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:46,840
She can't.

956
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,320
She can't go.

957
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:49,710
You need rest.

958
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,150
Why can't I go?

959
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:52,800
I'm fine now.

960
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,870
I'm healed, they said.

961
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:55,870
Wait.

962
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:56,600
You were never this enthusiastic

963
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,840
in normal times.

964
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,800
And the contract.

965
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,840
Can you complete the contract

966
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,760
overnight?

967
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,150
I'm always enthusiastic.

968
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,000
And of course,
I can complete the contract.

969
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:08,950
It looks like

970
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:09,800
I should make

971
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,760
some herbal tea for you.

972
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,870
The client needs to do nothing.

973
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:13,800
I'll go make the tea.

974
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:14,430
Um,

975
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:15,080
I don't want tea.

976
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,390
I want a coffee.

977
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:17,800
No coffee.

978
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,120
I'll go help her.

979
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,710
Look at your assistant.

980
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,280
She's completely defiant

981
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,360
as a paralegal.

982
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:33,120
I mean…

983
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,320
She is your assistant, right?

984
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:36,910
Or what?

985
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:38,800
She doesn't even make coffee

986
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,390
for me now.

987
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:40,600
I…

988
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:41,710
Um…

989
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,040
Let me do it.

990
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,280
No formality between us, please.

991
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,190
Yes, we're at the law firm,

992
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,670
but it isn't

993
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:00,710
just a client-lawyer relationship

994
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:01,630
between us.

995
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:05,840
Qian Wei.

996
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,280
There's something

997
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,390
I've been meaning to say to you.

998
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:10,230
(Oh, no.)

999
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:11,390
(Is this really going)

1000
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:12,390
(to be a confrontation?)

1001
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:13,670
(Her feelings for Lu Xun…)

1002
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,080
I have to apologize to you in person.

1003
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,670
At that party in university,

1004
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:21,840
it was my cousin Mo Tao

1005
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,870
who stole Liu's jade pendant

1006
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:23,710
and put it in your bag.

1007
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:24,950
I never

1008
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:25,840
knew the story

1009
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,600
until many years later.

1010
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,630
It's fine.

1011
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:31,430
I have put

1012
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,390
it behind me

1013
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:33,280
long ago.

1014
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:35,910
But I'm really sorry.

1015
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:37,910
It is

1016
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:38,560
one of my wishes

1017
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,150
that I came back

1018
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:40,390
to clear the air with you in person.

1019
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:42,390
But it's good

1020
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:43,470
that your illness is cured.

1021
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:44,600
I finally get

1022
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,080
to say sorry to you face to face.

1023
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:49,360
It's been so many years.

1024
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,670
You finally overcame
your mental obstacle

1025
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:51,390
and passed the bar examination.

1026
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,230
You're one step closer

1027
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:53,950
to your goal.

1028
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,800
I feel really happy for you.

1029
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,000
Me, too.

1030
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,470
I see you are

1031
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,910
doing what you wanted to do.

1032
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,320
I feel happy for you as well.

1033
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,230
Um,

1034
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,390
you said,

1035
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:09,150
this is

1036
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:10,670
one of your wishes.

1037
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:11,600
So do you

1038
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,670
have other wishes?

1039
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,760
You mean my wishes
in the wishing bottle?

1040
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,120
I keep it with me all the time.

1041
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,540
(Be a startup entrepreneur
to have my own career!)

1042
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,900
(Pursue the person I love,
and be with him.)

1043
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:29,040
Looking back at us in the past.

1044
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:31,120
How childish I was!

1045
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:34,360
At the time, I always thought

1046
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:36,230
having a relationship
was the most important thing.

1047
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,560
But now that I think about it,

1048
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,600
the saying

1049
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:43,000
"Your effort will pay off" only

1050
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:44,560
applies to your career

1051
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,190
or your job.

1052
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,280
Romance-wise,

1053
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:49,870
the case may be

1054
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,800
that your effort
gains nothing in return.

1055
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:53,840
Is that so?

1056
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,190
Romance

1057
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,520
is about timing and luck.

1058
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,630
Maybe you never got the chance
to be together in the past years,

1059
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,600
but when the time is right,

1060
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,800
the lovers will get their happy ending.

1061
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,470
The lovers will get their happy ending?

1062
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:18,470
It sounds like

1063
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:19,520
Zixin is still in love with Lu Xun.

1064
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,320
I'm caught in between my bestie

1065
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,600
and the love of my dream.

1066
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,870
This is such a cliché.

1067
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,040
That's true. That is true.

1068
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,840
Do you like him?

1069
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,040
Who?

1070
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:39,950
You know what?

1071
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,080
Let's finish making the tea,

1072
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,630
and head back to the office.

1073
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:43,470
Or else, Lu Xun will

1074
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:45,000
blame me for wasting his time again.
