1
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,280
Very good.

2
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,100
=Legally Romance=

3
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:37,460
=Episode 25=
=Put the Past Behind and Move On=

4
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,160
Surprise!

5
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,360
Your little assistant is back

6
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,190
with high morale.

7
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:45,950
I'm officially applying
to join your team.

8
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,510
No.

9
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,080
Not a chance.

10
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,310
I prefer solo alone.

11
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,830
Let's talk about it after you recover.

12
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,480
No.

13
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:52,230
Mr. Tao sent me here.

14
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,120
You!

15
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,080
(The setting is the same
as in my dream.)

16
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:10,830
Mr. Tao has agreed

17
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,240
to let me follow the case of Morris.

18
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,110
Boss,

19
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,830
why do you need allergy medicines?

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,320
I'm not physically well.

21
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,110
I must eat them

22
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,320
at the turn of season.

23
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,720
Is this

24
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,750
jerky?

25
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:33,320
Well,

26
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,320
when I play games,

27
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:37,670
I need snacks.

28
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,960
It's really delicious.

29
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,750
Try one?

30
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:43,670
Delicious?

31
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,800
Fabulous.

32
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,030
This snack is good.

33
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:46,960
You can try it.

34
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:49,960
I suddenly find

35
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,240
that I've never looked around your house

36
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,910
though we've known each other for long.

37
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,440
How about having a good look

38
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,470
before work today?

39
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,080
Listen carefully, Qian Wei,

40
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,800
don't walk around in my house.

41
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,800
Did I ask you to look around?

42
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,910
You can talk about business here,

43
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,960
but you can't walk around.

44
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,800
You don't have my permission.

45
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,470
Get seated.

46
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,470
Is this the game,

47
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,520
SnowNoah,

48
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,600
which Morris hasn't released yet?

49
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,190
After Lawyer Wei's accident,

50
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,240
Morris's staff said that they couldn't

51
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,360
find the concept design artist.

52
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,600
Therefore,

53
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:19,320
I have no choice

54
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,550
but to try to find a breakthrough

55
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,390
from this game.

56
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:22,520
However,

57
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,880
I found a problem

58
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:25,880
after I made a comparison

59
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,880
between this game

60
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,670
with all other games

61
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,750
they issued before,

62
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,750
no matter in the art style,

63
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,080
the NPC,

64
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,270
or the main story line
of the whole game.

65
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,830
This game is entirely
different from them.

66
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,030
There must be a special reason.

67
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,390
Only a mind as sharp as mine

68
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,270
can figure it out.

69
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,240
As for you, humph.

70
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,600
You suck at this game.

71
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,240
What breakthrough can you find?

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,800
You're an excellent player.

73
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,880
I'm about to

74
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,880
see the breakthrough.

75
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,720
It's right ahead of us.

76
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:52,320
Very soon.

77
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:52,960
Immediately.

78
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,520
Get your hands off me.

79
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,360
You play.

80
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,390
Move over.

81
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:59,240
I suck at it?

82
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,380
(Game Over)

83
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,550
Well.

84
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:06,960
You…

85
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,910
Now you know the investigation progress.

86
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,800
As for the things

87
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,110
Mr. Tao asked,

88
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:12,910
you are also clear

89
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,270
and can give him an answer.

90
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,750
Could you leave now, please?

91
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,720
I don't think so.

92
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,160
I still haven't

93
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,670
understood the whole thing.

94
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,000
Do you need to understand it?

95
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:21,880
Boss,

96
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,440
is it because you suck at the game

97
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,000
that you don't want me to see it?

98
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,670
I suck at it?

99
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,160
Just this one handle.

100
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,320
Up, down, left, right.

101
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,040
Triangle.

102
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,920
Circle.

103
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,600
Diamond.

104
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,350
Cross.

105
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,160
I?

106
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,040
Just eight buttons.

107
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:39,760
You're so funny.

108
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,350
This is

109
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,390
the biggest insult to me ever.

110
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,230
Now watch this.

111
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,160
- I can move ahead.
- Okay.

112
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:43,440
Good.

113
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,320
I can jump up.

114
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,480
This distance is a little far.

115
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,510
Let me do a run-up.

116
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,390
One, two, three, jump!

117
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,510
You fell.

118
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,060
(Game over)

119
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:54,950
Yes.

120
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,270
I fell. So what?

121
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,480
I can start over.

122
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:58,950
You're good.

123
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,600
Do you think you're very good?

124
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,390
Laugh?

125
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,510
What are you laughing at?

126
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,480
If you're good, you play it.

127
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,200
Then I'll have a try.

128
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:08,600
Okay.

129
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,390
Come on, you play it.

130
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:10,600
Show me.

131
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,480
I don't know how to play.

132
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,640
So why did you laugh at me?

133
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:14,720
Aren't you embarrassed?

134
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:27,760
Let me tell you,

135
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,670
you'll die in three seconds.

136
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:29,270
Three.

137
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,390
Two.

138
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:31,790
Two.

139
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,440
One point five.

140
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,110
One point…

141
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,200
I got to the end!

142
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:59,640
It's so simple.

143
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,270
Let me tell you…

144
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,200
Wait, hold on.

145
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:16,820
(Princess: This is Tea Island,)

146
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,380
(Princess: the place
I've been looking for.)

147
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,780
(Princess: Will you give up
the hard-earned treasure)

148
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,220
(Princess: and stay here
with me forever?)

149
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,620
(Warrior: I will, forever.)

150
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:37,020
(In tea blossoms fragrance in green mountains,
Lun is waiting for the one from the past.)

151
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,720
The one from the past.

152
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,040
It's said that

153
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,880
this kind of designers

154
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,040
like to show their original intention

155
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,200
for creating this game

156
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,640
in the Easter egg.

157
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:48,390
Look here.

158
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,880
(In tea blossoms fragrance in green mountains,
Lun is waiting for the one from the past.)

159
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,640
Lun. Blossoms.

160
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:52,670
"Blossoms" refers to Sheng Kai,

161
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,390
the concept design artist of this game.

162
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,670
I'm so smart.

163
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:58,880
You can't figure it out.

164
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,270
That is to say,

165
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,880
Ma Lun and Sheng Kai

166
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,830
are the protagonists of the game.

167
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,110
So they two are

168
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,600
not just cooperative partners

169
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:08,830
but

170
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:10,880
a couple.

171
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,110
But Ma Lun

172
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:15,920
has never mentioned it.

173
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:16,830
Well, that's reasonable.

174
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,040
Maybe they broke up

175
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,830
in an unpleasant way

176
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:19,720
that year.

177
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,880
So he doesn't want to mention it.

178
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,480
If your guess is right,

179
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,320
then why would he

180
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,270
put her in the Easter egg?

181
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,790
It can be tricky.

182
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,790
If the client refuses to cooperate,

183
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,350
it will be extremely difficult

184
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,390
to continue the investigation.

185
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,350
But it's lawyers' duty

186
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,110
to find solutions to problems.

187
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,270
Let's go to Morris

188
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,600
and ask Ma Lun about it.

189
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,670
Try our luck again.

190
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,070
Li Chongwen is the legal director

191
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,320
of AES.

192
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,510
You two once were lovers.

193
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,270
Did you forget that?

194
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,720
If you must interfere,

195
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,790
how should Party A

196
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:50,720
explain it?

197
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,670
And what about

198
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,550
your emotional connection?

199
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,350
I have no emotional connection with him.

200
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,110
Look,

201
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,200
no matter what the outcome

202
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:57,670
of the case is,

203
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:58,200
it's impossible

204
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,600
for me to reunite with him ever again.

205
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:01,760
Well,

206
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,950
at least eight out of ten
divorced couples

207
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,320
will get back together in the end.

208
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,510
Besides,

209
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,000
the second instance of this case

210
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,160
is to start soon.

211
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,040
And I allow no mistake at all

212
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,920
for the second instance.

213
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,480
I'm no longer

214
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,320
the emotional Qian Wei

215
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,550
as I was before.

216
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:18,350
Now all my focus

217
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:19,270
is on my career

218
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,230
and the case.

219
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,000
Now that Mr. Tao

220
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,480
has given me his chance,

221
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,790
I'll seize it and do well.

222
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,040
If you want to be a court lawyer,

223
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,760
you must pass the bar exam.

224
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:30,760
In order to prove to you

225
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,350
that I'm now

226
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,710
a changed person,

227
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,320
I've signed up for this year's bar exam.

228
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,520
At this time next year,

229
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,960
I can stand by your side

230
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,320
and fight with you together as a team.

231
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:43,880
Are you sure?

232
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,910
In the past,

233
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,030
I can't participate in this exam

234
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,710
because I can't move on.

235
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,030
Because of my fathers' death,

236
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,110
every time I entered the exam room,

237
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,790
I can't concentrate on the questions.

238
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,590
However,

239
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:57,350
when I fainted,

240
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,030
I dreamed of another youth,

241
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,440
where I overcame this barrier,

242
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,350
so I can take the exam now.

243
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,840
If I pass the exam,

244
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,400
you must take me with you

245
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,640
to convince Ma Lun.

246
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,320
All right.

247
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,960
But you must keep your promise.

248
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,520
I don't want to take you with me

249
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:17,880
to embarrass myself.

250
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,400
Okay?

251
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,030
I promise.

252
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,320
Boss, you…

253
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,350
You enjoy the game.

254
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:22,910
Well,

255
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:24,590
I think

256
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:25,910
that for such an important day,

257
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:26,910
shouldn't you send me

258
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,280
to the examination site?

259
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:28,790
You know what?

260
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:30,440
You are a top student, right?

261
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:30,960
If you go with me,

262
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,550
the God of Exams

263
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,230
will take good care of me.

264
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,550
Why are you touching me again?

265
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:35,840
Massage.

266
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,080
Don't put your hands on me.

267
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,790
Don't get so close.

268
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:38,790
Move over.

269
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:40,470
Just stop it.

270
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,080
Your little trick is useless.

271
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:42,880
You know?

272
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:44,470
Listen,

273
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,520
that day,

274
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,880
I need to meet an important client

275
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,030
and we will hold a key meeting.

276
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,350
As for you,

277
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,400
wish you good luck.

278
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,470
Do you understand?

279
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:56,470
Yeah.

280
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,320
Okay.

281
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,470
You can leave now.

282
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,230
But if I pass it,

283
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:01,840
can we go to

284
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,230
persuade Ma Lun together?

285
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:06,760
Yes.

286
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,320
Pinky swear?

287
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,520
Leave or not?

288
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,470
Pinky swear.

289
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,200
Leave or not?

290
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,150
Pinky swear.

291
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:13,910
Pinky swear.

292
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,550
I'm asking you to leave.

293
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,030
Boss, bye.

294
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,940
(October)

295
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,860
(October)

296
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,880
I suck at games?

297
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,320
I just need a little practice.

298
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:42,940

301
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:03,910
Father,

302
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:04,880
I will pass it this time.

303
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,320
Who's that?

304
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:13,790
Hello.

305
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:14,440
Your takeout.

306
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,200
I didn't order any.

307
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:17,520
Have a nice day.

308
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,350
Good luck with your exam!

367
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,150
Did you do well in the exam?

368
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,590
You are losing your bet.

369
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,520
A senior partner

370
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,790
loses to the paralegal.

371
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,000
What a lovely story!

372
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,540
(Morris Network Technology Co., Ltd)

373
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,590
(I don't know where Sheng Kai is.)

374
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,400
(I can't provide you)

375
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,440
(with her contact information.)

376
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:04,550
It's not that you don't know

377
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,640
where she is.

378
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,590
It's because you dare not face her.

379
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,350
You and Miss Sheng Kai

380
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,550
were a couple before.

381
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,280
You co-founded Morris

382
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,520
and successfully developed

383
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,030
the project of SnowNoah.

384
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,910
But later,

385
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,960
for a lack of funds,

386
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,000
you sold the copyright of the game

387
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,080
to another big company.

388
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,350
Because of that deal,

389
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:28,520
Miss Sheng Kai left angrily

390
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,470
without saying goodbye.

391
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,790
I hired you

392
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,000
to win the lawsuit for me.

393
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,320
I didn't hire you to investigate me.

394
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:37,910
Mr. Ma,

395
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
every successful lawsuit

396
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,640
is based on

397
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,520
the mutual trust

398
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,710
between the client and the lawyer.

399
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,030
We just did

400
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,550
a proper background check

401
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,030
while searching for clues.

402
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,470
That way, we can have

403
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,550
the most effective counterattack.

404
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,000
Besides,

405
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,760
if we can find it out,

406
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,640
so does

407
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,710
AES

408
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:55,790
and Ruomei.

409
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,350
After the company was back on track,

410
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:00,150
the first thing you did

411
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,400
was to buy the copyright back

412
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,760
and redevelop the game.

413
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:03,880
Thus,

414
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:04,710
it's clear

415
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,000
that the project means a lot to you.

416
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,110
In the meantime,

417
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,350
you put the names of you two

418
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,550
in the Easter egg.

419
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,520
Mr. Ma,

420
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,230
actually,

421
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:14,400
this case is not that hard.

422
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,880
As long as we find Miss Sheng Kai

423
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,320
and persuade her
into testifying in court,

424
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,440
even some rough sketches

425
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,000
can increase our chances to win.

426
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:26,840
Is she the paralegal

427
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,150
who got my evidence lost?

428
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,030
Yes, that was me.

429
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,200
About the loss of evidence,

430
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,110
I seriously apologize to you here.

431
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,400
The reason

432
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,550
why I still want to follow this case,

433
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,550
is that I hope

434
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,320
you can give me another chance.

435
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,320
Please let me help Morris

436
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,640
to turn the tables neatly.

437
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,110
I can accept

438
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,790
whatever methods you use.

439
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:51,790
But this thing is an exception.

440
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,520
I can't cooperate with you.

441
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,470
Are you afraid of being rejected

442
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:04,110
so you don't want to ask her for help?

443
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,080
Apparently,

444
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,230
you two jointly held

445
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,710
the copyright of the game then.

446
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,960
But you forced her

447
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,840
to give up her part

448
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,150
without even a notice.

449
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,520
So you got the exclusive copyright.

450
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:18,840
All these years,

451
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,470
you feel so guilty.

452
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,110
But just to save

453
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,520
your worthless face,

454
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,550
you cowardly put your apology

455
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,590
in the Easter egg.

456
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:30,640
Enough.

457
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,400
Stop it.

458
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,320
Mr. Ma,

459
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,110
you've released this game

460
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,110
in order to

461
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,440
let Miss Sheng Kai know

462
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,470
that you still leave her a pure land.

463
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,150
You want to tell her

464
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:41,910
that you've never forgotten

465
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,520
the dream of you two.

466
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,110
But if you don't

467
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:46,030
ask her for help,

468
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,320
all your works

469
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,200
will be cast a shadow of plagiarism.

470
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,880
That will make it harder for you

471
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,350
to get Miss Sheng Kai's forgiveness.

472
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:03,470
You can leave now.

473
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:06,000
I need some time alone.

474
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:14,060
(Lush Mountains Green Tea)

475
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,070
This is

476
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,160
a transfer agreement

477
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:25,830
of equity.

478
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,110
We both hold

479
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,230
half of the company shares.

480
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,350
If you think it's not enough,

481
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,760
I can give you more shares.

482
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,680
But this game has to be sold.

483
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,760
Up to now,

484

485
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,350
originality,

techniques,

487
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,800
we have them all.

488
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,400
What we need is the money.

489
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,560
It turns out

490
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,310
that we need a contract between us.

491
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,590
Do you think it's clear

492
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,680
to write it down in black and white?

493
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:55,880
I…

494
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,190
I… Aren't I

495
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:58,070
discussing it with you?

496
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,830
We can buy it back

497
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,160
after we have enough money.

498
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,110
What about the contract

499
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,070
in your safe?

There are both parties' stamps on it.

501
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,830
So it has come into effect.

502
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,160
You're not asking for my permission.

You think what's done is done.

506
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,880
And I will accept it in silence

507
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,350
as I did before.

509
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,350
I've never forgotten

510

the future I promised you.

511
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,640
I will realize it.

512
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,040
You sold my paintings to others.

513
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,400
What future do we still have?

the last drawing of character images.

This.

519
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:11,040

00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,470
You can only choose one.

522
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,640
Sheng Kai.

523
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,710
For me, my lover and my career

524
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,760
are never opposite.

525
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:23,590
There's no need to choose.

526
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:25,280
I find that your thought

527
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,680
is so extreme now.

528
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,830
It's not me.

529
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:29,920
It's you who have changed.

530
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,040
Sheng Kai.

531
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:33,400
Well…

532
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:34,640
Listen to me.

533
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,400
Listen to me.

534
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,070
That's not what I meant.

535
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,680
I will never forgive you.

536
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:44,880
Forever.

537
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:52,710
Sheng Kai.

538
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,590
To be honest,

539
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,950
you went a little too far

540
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:06,350
when playing the bad cop.

541
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,110
You ignored the client's feelings

542
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,470
and attacked him fiercely.

543
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:11,800
It goes against

544
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,040
the quality of a professional lawyer.

545
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,560
But didn't you tell me

546
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,000
that he who wins the case

547
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,160
is the most professional?

548
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,110
Besides,

549
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,230
if I didn't touch his raw nerve,

550
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,110
he would never

551
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,310
have the determination to face it.

552
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,800
(Sheng Kai)
See?

553
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,640
(Address and Phone No.)
Ma Lun has texted me

554
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,680
Sheng Kai's address

555
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,110
and contact information.

556
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,640
Thanks to your gift

557
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,560
for game playing.

558
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:35,520
You found a clue

559
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,710
by accident.

560
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:37,800
As for the rest,

561
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,350
I got it.

562
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:41,470
Why?

563
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,040
Didn't you agree

564
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,040
that we fight as a team

565
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,000
and destroy the inhibitor together?

566
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,710
You're leaving

567
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:46,680
at home alone again.

568
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,000
This is your HP.

569
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,880
This little.

570
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,710
If you join the group
with this little HP,

571
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,560
it's intentional feeding.

572
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:53,280
Besides,

573
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,230
Sheng Kai

574
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,880
lives in the suburbs of Haizhou.

575
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:56,830
You are not robust.

576
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,110
Long hours in the car.

577
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:58,640
Then mountain climbing.

578
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,470
Can you take it?

579
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:00,590
I'll be fine.

580
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:01,590
And Mr. Tao

581
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:02,590
has already agreed.

582
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,190
It doesn't work for me.

583
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:04,110
Well,

584
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,160
I really think I can.

585
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:05,710
I know better

586
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:07,230
about my own physical condition.

587
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,070
Please, let me go with you.

588
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,920
I've arranged a rehabilitation tomorrow
for you.

589
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:11,880
You must go.

590
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,560
This is an order.

591
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:13,310
And,

592
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:13,800
open the umbrella.

593
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,190
Let's go

594
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:14,590
now.

595
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,830
Sure, umbrella.

596
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:17,160
But also,

597
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:17,950
we can have a talk

598
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,560
about visiting Sheng Kai.

599
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,470
Come on, come on.

600
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:20,830
Boss,

601
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:21,950
please.

602
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:22,520
I really can do it.

603
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,310
I mean it.

604
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,000
Because…

605
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,520
I… I…

606
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,590
I know myself

607
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,280
and my health best.

608
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:26,760
Right?

609
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,280
So…

610
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,040
I… I… I…

611
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,310
I think I can go with you.

612
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,380
(Outpatient Department)

613
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,230
You can't leave.

614
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,400
If you don't let me go,

615
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,470
you will owe me a big sum of money

616
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:39,920
according to my hourly pay.

617
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:41,400
How about this?

618
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,160
Just wait for me

619
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,160
for the time of a dream.

620
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:43,800
If the doctor says

621
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,760
that there's nothing wrong with my brain

622
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,470
and I can go out,

623
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,830
then you take me to visit Sheng Kai.

624
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,110
If you are

625
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:48,880
discharged now,

626
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,920
the doctor will lose his job.

627
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:52,800
What are you doing?

628
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:53,830
Hey.

629
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:54,830
That's my watch.

630
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:55,560
(Next, Qian Wei.)

631
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:56,680
I'm coming.

632
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,040
You…

633
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:57,950
I don't care.

634
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:58,470
You can't leave.

635
00:21:58,470 --> 00:21:59,400
Whoever leaves in secret

636
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,640
will be a dog single for ten years.

637
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:03,400
Childish!

638
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,040
The ring is okay.

639
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:13,950
It's just for the brain.

640
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:15,710
I just hope

641
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:16,950
that my lucky ring

642
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,230
can bring good news to my dad.

643
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,560
It seems that you're seriously ill.

644
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:23,190
It's all right.

645
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,280
Let's get started.

646
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:26,920
Come on, lie down.

647
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:21,760
What are you doing here?

648
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,280
Your mother said

649
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,710
you broke something

650
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:26,800
in your room two days ago.

651
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,950
She said the light was too dim

652
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,350
and got at me for two days.

653
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,760
Now it's nice.

654
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,310
So bright!

655
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,800
What's the matter, girl?

656
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,230
Father,

657
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:44,640
I have a piece of good news.

658
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,760
I took the bar exam.

659
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:52,110
Really?

660
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,520
Let me show you something.

661
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,110
Wait a minute.

662
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:05,920
Good.

663
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:07,800
Didn't you say that you wanted

664
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,310
to watch me wearing this hat

665
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:09,880
and then

666
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,230
appearing in the court?

667
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:11,800
Look,

668
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,950
I'll wear it in the future.

669
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:14,760
Great.

670
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,520
I used to hope you could
pass the bar exam.

671
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,230
Now that you've realized this dream,

672
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,040
in the future,

673
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:26,760
I'll have nothing

674
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,160
to worry about.

675
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,680
Thanks to your ring.

676
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,710
I went back to the past again.

677
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,710
I planned

678
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:50,470
to prevent you

679
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:51,680
from getting sick.

680
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,230
But strangely,

681
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,070
you got sick again.

682
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,110
Sorry, Dad.

683
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:06,470
I really…

684
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,400
Why couldn't I

685
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,040
save you in the end?

686
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,760
Wei,

687
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,070
Dad is gone.

688
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:23,760
But you still have Mom and Chuan.

689
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,280
I'm right up in the sky.

690
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,000
I'm watching you every day.

691
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:34,190
I'm there for you.

692
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:36,280
And I'll protect you.

693
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:41,070
In the past,
I forced you to take the bar exam

694
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,590
so that you can

695
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,110
walk far away smoothly

696
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,070
on the journey ahead.

697
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,470
Now it's great

698
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:51,880
that you passed the exam.

699
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,590
As an ancient saying has it,

700
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,230
things in the past are
beyond redemption,

701
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,400
but we can pursue what is in the future.

702
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:10,310
Let go of the past

703
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,800
and move on.

704
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,560
But I miss you so much.

705
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,430
What do you think

706
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:44,430
you are doing?

707
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,190
Without my permission,

708
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:47,280
you take my watch away.

709
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,590
This is robbery.

710
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:50,230
What's wrong with you?

711
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:52,760
Have you

712
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,160
made any enemies recently?

713
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:55,640
You are one to talk?

714
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:58,040
What enemy do I have

715
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:58,560
except for you?

716
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,000
The treatment of the instrument

717
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:10,680
will make a few cell activities

718
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,590
lose control and coordination

719
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,000
of the cerebral cortex

720
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,280
which exist under a conscious state.

721
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,880
So it's normal

722
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:18,800
to have whatever strange dream.

723
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:19,710
No need to worry.

724
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,800
Well, does it mean

725
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,590
that I'm fine now?

726
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:21,880
Right?

727
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,520
It can be said that you have recovered.

728
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:24,280
However,

729
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,760
regular rehabilitation
is still necessary

730
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:27,560
to regulate the activity of brain cells.

731
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:28,950
Do you hear that?

732
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,160
I've recovered.

733
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:30,830
The doctor just said that.

734
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:31,560
Right.

735
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,710
The doctor said you're fine.

736
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,590
But you still need rehabilitation.

737
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:35,950
Well, so she hasn't

738
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:37,470
totally recovered, right?

739
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,520
The problem with brain

740
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,520
is relatively complex.

741
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,430
She'd better not get too exhausted

742
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,230
in case of stimulating
the cranial nerve.

743
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,520
I've recovered. I'm fine now.

744
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:48,430
You can't go back on your words.

745
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:49,190
Otherwise, you are a cheating dog.

746
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,470
Here's the thing, doctor.

747
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,680
We planned

748
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,000
to climb mountains.

749
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:56,070
Considering her current situation,

750
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:56,710
it is better for her

751
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,880
to stay at home and have a rest?

752
00:28:58,190 --> 00:28:58,640
Right.

753
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,110
Forget about the climbing.

754
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:01,520
Do you hear that?

755
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,070
The doctor just said that.

756
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:03,950
Don't be a cheating dog.

757
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:06,560
You did it on purpose!

758
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,760
We had a deal.

759
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:08,880
I did it for your good.

760
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:10,470
Just listen to your boyfriend.

761
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,710
Look at him.

762
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,640
He cares about you so much.

763
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:16,350
I'm her boss,

764
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:17,680
not her boyfriend.

765
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,430
He will be soon.

766
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:25,950
Can Lu Xun ever stop

767
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,190
what I want to do

768
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:28,190
as he hopes?

769
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,760
When you are free,

770
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,070
give me the list of inpatients

771
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:32,800
as soon as possible.

772
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,110
Okay.

773
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,040
I'll come after my rounds.

774
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:34,520
Okay.

775
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,590
Can Lu Xun ever stop

776
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:37,950
what I want to do?

777
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:39,350
Is that what you are thinking?

778
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,830
Aren't you my boss?

779
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:42,310
I don't know

780
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,400
that you're a mind reader.

781
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:46,070
AES's lawyers

782
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,310
have talked with Sheng Kai.

783
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:49,040
They must have offered

784
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,560
to buy all evidence she has.

785
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,400
You're a patient.

786
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,310
What can you do about it?

787
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:54,950
What if they get desperate?

788
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,400
Can you handle it?

789
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,430
Don't argue with me.

790
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,000
Trust me.

791
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,070
I can take care of

792
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,430
this kind of thing.

793
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:07,950
Don't follow me.

794
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:08,760
Or you're a dog.

795
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,800
(Is the person in my dream from AES?)

796
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,190
(I must go with him.)

797
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:17,560
What's so bad about dogs?

798
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:39,280
I didn't expect you
to look for Sheng Kai.

799
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:40,160
Nice.

800
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,400
I get a free ride.

801
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,430
Maybe we can meet Sheng Kai

802
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:44,000
before Lu Xun arrives.

803
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,190
Well,

804
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:46,110
a few uncles of mine

805
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:46,680
plan to open an amusement park

806
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,160
by the mountain.

807
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:49,680
The owners of houses on the hillside

808
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,680
have all been settled

809
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:51,800
except for

810
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,430
Sheng Kai.

811
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,470
She won't sell her villa.

812
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,710
It's said that she will

813
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:55,800
have the last work.

814
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:57,160
As I see it,

815
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,230
money doesn't work for her.

816
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,230
It needs a good chat.

817
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,310
See?

818
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,590
Money can't handle it.

819
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,280
But Qian Wei can.

820
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:04,880
Drive safe.

821
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,520
My free ride is not really for nothing.

822
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,880
And I'm taking with me

823
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,950
a touching love story.

824
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,800
Maybe Sheng Kai gets happy

825
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,190
and you know what,

826
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:15,160
she can say yes to anything.

827
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:16,760
Love story?

828
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:17,680
Are you sure

829
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,880
that the guy in the back seat

830
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,950
can help you handle your boss?

831
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,280
My boss?

832
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,110
I didn't bring Qian Chuan here for him.

833
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:22,920
I just

834
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,760
come all the way

835
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,830
to give him an out.

836
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,470
You rich people are wayward.

837
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,070
One of you

838
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:30,400
changes a good tea mountain

839
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:31,880
into a business district.

840
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,680
The other one

841
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,590
worries so many things like a boss

842
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,920
though she's just an assistant.

843
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,110
You paid with your own money

844
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,280
to take two days off

845
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,560
from courses of my private coach.

846
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,950
And the goal is to come here

847
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:41,950
and give your boss an out.

848
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:43,350
Trust me.

849
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,470
Somehow I just feel

850
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:45,400
that I have to come.

851
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,280
If Lu Xun comes by himself,

852
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,920
he will be put in danger

853
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,430
when AES gets desperate.

854
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:53,350
So I'm the bodyguard.

855
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:53,560
Right?

856
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:55,470
Then I suggest that you stop the trip.

857
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:56,590
If you get hurt even a little

858
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:58,280
in the fighting,

859
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,640
Mom will beat me hard

860
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,800
after she knows about it.

861
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:01,640
Anyway,

862
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,800
you will also have a hard time

863
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,560
if Mom knows

864
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,760
that you leave me alone

865
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,070
in the deep mountains.

866
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,040
You…

867
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,230
Finally, we get here.

868
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,470
It's all because of your old car.

869
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:19,800
If it hadn't got a flat tire,

870
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,760
did we have to walk for so long?

871
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:21,880
Would you stop nagging?

872
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,920
Do you prefer a flat tire

873
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,710
or your flat head?

874
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:24,520
Enough.

875
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,040
Both of you.

876
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,000
Save your energy.

877
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,310
Qian Chuan,

878
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:27,430
remember to perform well.

879
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,950
Don't say I didn't warn you.

880
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,640
If Lu Xun gets hit,

881
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,830
I will definitely stand there

882
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:32,640
and applaud.

883
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,230
I dare you!

884
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:34,040
Let me put it this way.

885
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,000
To save people in danger

886
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,230
is a legal responsibility.

887
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:36,920
Well.

888
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:38,280
I'm not an intellectual,
but also not a fool.

889
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,430
He's neither my friend nor family.

890
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,280
Why should I save him?

891
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,160
It's not an obligation.

892
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:42,520
Though it's not your obligation,

893
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,070
you should also help him.

894
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:43,920
Do you hear me?

895
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,880
It may be your obligation in the future.

896
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:50,520
He's here.

897
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:52,680
Boss.

898
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,400
What a coincidence!

899
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:55,950
What are you doing?

900
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:57,590
Didn't I ask you

901
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:58,830
not to come here?

902
00:32:58,830 --> 00:32:59,590
Why did you follow me?

903
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,640
Are you a liar?

904
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,680
I'm not.

905
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,190
We…

906
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:02,710
We come here

907
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,590
for sightseeing.

908
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:03,880
Right?

909
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,310
Yeah, yeah.

910
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:06,110
Yeah?

911
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,000
How did it go?

912
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,190
Did you have a good talk?

913
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,520
AES's lawyers came before us.

914
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:14,160
(Lu Xun)
Sheng Kai

915
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,190
(Lu Xun)
heard that I'm Ma Lun's lawyer.

916
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:16,400
She directly kicked me out

917
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,310
even before I got into her courtyard.

918
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:20,430
(AES's people did come as expected.)

919
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,560
It must be because of Ma Lun

920
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,230
that Sheng Kai doesn't want
to leave here.

921
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:28,920
And look,

922
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:30,230
this place is exactly the same

923
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:30,880
as the scene

924
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,160
in the Easter egg.

925
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,310
Her heart will be softened

926
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:35,880
after I give her this game disc.

927
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,040
Well,

928
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,280
when did you prepare this?

929
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,800
If you hadn't been kicked out,

930
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,160
she would

931
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,280
have seen this.

932
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:42,560
Um…

933
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,800
What makes you think

934
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,160
that you can get inside her villa?

935
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,350
I will find a way.

936
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:48,190
I just haven't come up with one yet.

937
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:49,400
Before you get inside,

938
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,430
would you please

939
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:51,400
deliver on your promise first?

940
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,640
What promise?

941
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,470
- Woof! Woof! Woof!
- You tell me.

942
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,760
That doesn't sound like a dog.

943
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:56,800
Bark again.

944
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,190
Stop bullying him.

945
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:00,760
Binbin.

946
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,160
Yesterday you said

947
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,310
that you could make cakes.

948
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,680
Now you tell me you can't?

949
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,520
The most important thing
about birthday is the cake.

950
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,320
Without the cake,

951
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,630
how to throw a birthday party

952
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:12,560
for Miss Sheng Kai?

953
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,080
I didn't mean it.

954
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,840
The oven is broken.

955
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,430
I asked to order one in advance.

956
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,560
But you had to play a hero
in front of Meimei.

957
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,560
I didn't.

958
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:24,430
Don't blame him now.

959
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:26,280
We all don't have an oven at home.

960
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:27,430
What to do?

961
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,950
The dough has been kneaded.

962
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,280
How about making egg crepes?

963
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,150
Who eats egg crepes for birthday?

964
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:34,800
All right, stop.

965
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:35,950
Don't hit your friends.

966
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:38,800
You want to make a cake,

967
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,470
right?

968
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,150
Which home of yours has a microwave?

969
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:45,320
May I help you with it?

970
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:47,080
Miss, who are you?

971
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,320
Why would you help us?

972
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:49,800
I…

973
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:52,120
I am…

974
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:55,040
Sheng Kai's friend.

975
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:01,080
Miss, you're so cool.

976
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:02,230
I just know that a microwave

977
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:03,120
can be used to make cakes.

978
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:03,870
Next time,

979
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:04,520
I'll make one for Miss Sheng Kai

980
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,520
on my own.

981
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,760
When did you

982
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,120
learn to make cakes?

983
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:20,870
In my dream,

984
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:22,320
I learned it with a big fool.

985
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,800
I'm speechless.

986
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,040
The doctor is right.

987
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:26,950
You should go back

988
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:27,710
to do a good

989
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:28,760
brain rehabilitation.

990
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,760
- Miss Sheng Kai.
- Miss Sheng Kai.

991
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,520
- Miss Sheng Kai.
- Miss Sheng Kai.

992
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,040
Miss Sheng Kai is not at home.

993
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,190
No worries.

994
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:38,430
I know where the spare key is.

995
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:57,870
Look at you.

996
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:58,950
It's mine.

997
00:35:58,950 --> 00:35:59,630
It's not.

998
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,600
I heard you call her Miss Sheng Kai.

999
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,320
Does she usually teach you to paint?

1000
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:12,950
Yeah.

1001
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,560
Miss Sheng Kai has taught us for long.

1002
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:15,670
Look.

1003
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:17,190
This is my painting.

1004
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,630
Miss Sheng Kai

1005
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:21,950
has also taught us to package the tea.

1006
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:22,840
That way,

1007
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,910
our tea in town

1008
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:25,390
can be sold better.

1009
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:27,840
Right.

1010
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,760
All our fathers and mothers

1011
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,560
are tea growers.

1012
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,520
(Lush Mountains Green Tea)
The tea in our town is very good.

1013
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,040
It's a pity that no one knows.

1014
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:37,660
(Lush Mountains Green Tea)

1015
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,670
Go to play.

1016
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:48,670
Okay.

1017
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:51,710
So Sheng Kai

1018
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,430
refuses to leave here

1019
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:54,710
because she wants to be with the kids.

1020
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:58,670
In the case,

1021
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:01,150
she's very kind.

1022
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:02,760
A good person.

1023
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,670
Miss Sheng Kai is back.

1024
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,910
Miss Sheng Kai is back.

1025
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:34,000

You are…?

1036
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,630
To be honest with you,

1037
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:49,710
we're Ma Lun's lawyers.

1038
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:50,430
But we're also admirers

1039
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:52,150
of your works.

1040
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:53,120
Today we're here

1041
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:53,840
to show you

1042
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,910
a video.

1043
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:01,710
Kids,

1044
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:02,520
you go to have fun outside.

1045
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,190
I'll come to play

1046
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,150
with you later, okay?

1047
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:06,080
- Okay.
- Okay.

1048
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:17,430
Ma Lun has been sorry for what he did

1049
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:18,320
to the copyright that year.

1050
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,760
Behind your back

1051
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,120
is a 50%

1052
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:22,950
equity transfer agreement.

1053
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:24,470
He wants to let you know

1054
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,080
that in the future,

1055
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,120
no matter where you are,

1056
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,040
you're a member of the company forever.

1057
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:30,560
I think you got something wrong.

1058
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,430
If I wanted fame or fortune,

1059
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:33,000
seven years ago,

1060
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:33,710
I could have sued him

1061
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:34,710
and let him go bankrupt.

1062
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:37,190
But that is not my thing.

1063
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:39,600
My retaliation against him

1064
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,150
is never to be involved

1065
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,360
in any of his businesses.

1066
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,000
As for you lawyers,

1067
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:48,710
you fight others' cases

1068
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:49,800
to earn your own fame and profit.

1069
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,950
But you still keep saying

1070
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:52,080
what you do is for the clients' good.

1071
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:54,820
The balloon ran away.

1072
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,000
You're the same as Ma Lun and AES.

1073
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,430
Actually, I think

1074
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:04,000
you also got something wrong.

1075
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,280
This was a winning case
in the first place.

1076
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,080
But my paralegal

1077
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:10,470
was framed,

1078
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:11,190
so we lost

1079
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:12,670
the most important evidence.

1080
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:15,910
In fact, we didn't come here

1081
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:17,670
for fame or profit.

1082
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:19,120
I just

1083
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:22,040
want to prove her innocence

1084
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:23,710
and tell AES

1085
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:25,190
that justice will never lose.

1086
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:28,950
Also,

1087
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:30,870
if we lose this case,

1088
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:31,870
it will not only

1089
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:33,000
get Morris involved,

1090
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:35,040
but also do harm to you.

1091
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:36,950
All your character drawings

1092
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,670
will be charged with plagiarism.

1093
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,430
Have you ever thought

1094
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:46,600
what makes the tea plantation

1095
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:48,040
survive till today

1096
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,670
though it doesn't bring many profits?

1097
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,120
Because of the children's paintings.

1098
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:57,150
I still need to celebrate my birthday

1099
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:58,080
with the kids.

1100
00:40:58,470 --> 00:40:59,520
You can leave now.

1101
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:09,230
Miss Sheng,

1102
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:12,280
I'm not a lawyer.

1103
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:13,950
I'm the person in charge

1104
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:15,910
of the business district development.

1105
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:18,670
I want to buy the tea plantation

1106
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:20,320
and your house.

1107
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,760
Then you're worse than the lawyers.

1108
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,630
Please get out.

1109
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:25,760
Miss Sheng,

1110
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,120
aren't these people your friends?

1111
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,040
They're not.

1112
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,630
They are all bad people.

1113
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:31,800
I knew it.

1114
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:32,910
Get rid of these people.

1115
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,470
They made Miss Sheng cry.

1116
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,390
Miss Sheng Kai,

1117
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:38,520
please let me explain.

1118
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,190
I understand your feelings very much.

1119
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:42,280
The copyright matter

1120
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,190
seven years ago

1121
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,870
is neither hatred nor fame for you.

1122
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:46,000
It's a pity.

1123
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:47,120
Like a hole

1124
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,150
in the heart.

1125
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:49,760
I have the same experience.

1126
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:50,670
A while ago,

1127
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:51,800
I had a dream.

1128
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:53,000
In the dream,

1129
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,040
I made up for

1130
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:54,950
all my pities.

1131
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,080
So the hole in my heart

1132
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,040
has also been filled.

1133
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:58,630
And in that dream,

1134
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,230
I still met

1135
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:00,840
my ex-boyfriend who hurt me.

1136
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,470
And I find

1137
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,950
that in this second life,

1138
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,840
I still couldn't agree with his act,

1139
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,710
but at least I could understand him.

1140
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:11,630
It's no use escaping like this.

1141
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,150
Only when one day

1142
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,430
you have the courage

1143
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:17,190
to stand in front of him

1144
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:18,360
and face him directly,

1145
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,630
you can let go of the past.

1146
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:28,560
This is my business card.

1147
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:30,230
My phone number is on it.

1148
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:31,710
If

1149
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:33,360
you change your mind,

1150
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,000
please contact me.
