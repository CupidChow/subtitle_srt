is this your choice?

You will regret it.

Stand... Stand up.

00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:21,390
Okay.

Miss Qian,

24
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,880
we've checked

25
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,800
your PPT.

26
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,190
There are no big problems.

27
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:11,800
But we

28
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,750
still need

29
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,800
to make sure

30
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,670
some details.

31
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:15,550
Okay. No problem.

32
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,110
But look.

33

How about this?

35
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:19,880
Let's talk in my room.

36
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,000
It's handy.

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,190
I don't think it's appropriate.

38
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,830
How about going to another café?

39
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,800
Aren't you in a hurry
for the performance?

Going to another café

42
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,520
will take too much trouble.

43
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,190
During that,

44
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,270
we would be done talking.

45
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:33,390
By the way,

46
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,320
I've modified the PPT

47

48

you're okay with it,

00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,520
Leave it to me.

179
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,080
Let me show you

180
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,760
the Marshal Dance

181
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,670
from the Heavenly Southern Gate.

182
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,790
Bravo! Bravo!

184
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,790

185
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,440
Nice dance!

186
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,640
He's dancing greatly.

187
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,150
Luckily, you came to help.

188
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,520
Bravo!

189

190
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:26,840

191
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,670
Come.

192
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,400
They're back.

193
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,400
Where did you go?

194
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,960
She insisted on going to the hotel.

195
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,470
And...

196
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:39,440
And you insisted on

197
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,200
giving a statement to the police.

198
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,150
This made no sense.

199
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,960
Stop, stop.

200
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,030
Explain it later.

201
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,280
Go get changed first.

202
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,030
Wait.

203
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,280
Did you quarrel again?

204
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,640
It's okay.

205
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,670
It won't influence our performance.

206
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:50,910
No, it won't.

207
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,150
Out of my way. I'll get changed.

208
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,880
I need to get changed, too.

209

Golden Cicada

210
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,550
thought it over.

211
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:02,760
She can't save him

212
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,000
unless she gives him the magic breath.

213
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,030
Thinking of this,

214
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,520
she can no longer
care about her mission.

215
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,200
Get a bit up.

216
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,200
I'm not strong enough.

217
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:20,960
You come closer to me.

218
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:33,110
What is she doing?

219
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:45,760
Tang Sanzang,

220
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,790
what did you do?

221
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,280
I gave you the magic breath.

222
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,320
You once loved me.

223
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,280
You mustn't forget me.

224
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,550
You can't run away from me.

225
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,880
You can't love anyone else, either.

226
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,790
I just want to get the True Scriptures.

227
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:11,350
What's the problem with it?

228
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,760
Give me your hand.

229
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:17,030
Why?

230
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:17,520
Don't touch me.

231
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:17,910
Don't.

232
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:18,520
Come on.

233
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,550
Give me your hand.

234
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,550
You weren't serious just now.

235
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,470
Scorpion spirit, let go of my master!

236
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,200
Scorpion spirit, behave yourself.

237
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,280
Awesome.

238
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,000
Something seems to be wrong.

239
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,710
Get up.

240
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,000
The scorpion spirit...

241
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,710
Get up.

242
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:41,000
Is he using a trick?

243
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:42,440
Trick?

244
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,470
Sage,

245
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:51,520
Marshal,

246
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:54,550
now that the scorpion spirit is
quite deceitful

247
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,110
and he has set a trap,

248
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,280
why don't you go get some helpers

249
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,520
from Heaven?

250
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,080
I hear the Star Lord

251
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,150
from the Light Palace

252
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,880
can be the kryptonite
to the scorpion spirit.

253
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,710
Thank you, fairy.

254
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,320
Bajie,

255
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,550
let's go get the helper.

256
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,280
Nice!

257
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,470
Impressive!

258
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,520
Bravo!

259
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:18,760
Impressive!

260
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:19,880
Good job!

261
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:21,790
Well done!

262
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,080
Come on, you win.

263
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,350
Why don't you just admit your mistake?

264
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,320
I didn't make a mistake.

265
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,280
What would I admit?

266
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,150
What's going on between you?

267
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,710
No matter what happened,

268
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:34,790
the next scene

269
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,440
will be very cruel.

270
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,880
You just quarreled, didn't you?

271
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,640
In the next scene,

272
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,640
be cruel to each other.

273
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,080
If anything goes wrong again,

274
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,960
I'll make Yu Tian

275
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,790

come over.

278
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:50,670
Tang Sanzang,

279
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,030
you can cross the River of Quicksand,

280
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:56,640
but you can't make it through Pipa Cave.

281
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,280
(Pipa Cave)
This time, I won't let you go.

282

Master,

283
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:04,230
I'm here to save you.

284
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:04,960

I'll subdue you,

427
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,070

00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,950
It's yours now.

529
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:01,430
From this day on,

530
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:02,560
you're no longer

531
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:04,880
the unhappy girl.

532
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,110
Let me help you.

533
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:09,640
Let's go.

534
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:10,590
Liu said

535
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:11,040
she could find

536
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,110
my sister and Lu Xun.

537
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,470
Later,

538
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:14,190
we'll meet them

539
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,230
at the karaoke.

540
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:19,920
Smile.

541
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,190
(You will find someone)

542
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:35,230
(who really cares for you.)

543
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,280
(It's not me.)

544
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,950
(But I'm sure he exists.)

545
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,110
(Lu Xun,)

546
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,000
(I no longer have feelings for you.)

547
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,230
(Liu's River Snails Rice Noodles)
Two bowls, extra spicy.

548
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,000
And a pack of duck's feet.

549
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,830
Take-out.

550
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:45,680
Two bowls?

551
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,310
One for your boss.

552
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:09,620
(Liu's River Snails Rice Noodles)

553
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,280
(Mo Zixin)
(Is your swimming pool)

554
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,760
(still open for me?)

555
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:30,800
(Qian Chuan)
(Of course,)

556
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,300
(Qian Chuan)

557
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,160
(Qian Chuan)
(as long as my friend)

558
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,190
(can always be happy)

559
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:34,350
(and don't restrain her feelings)

560
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,710
(for anyone else)

561
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,350
(or sacrifice herself)

562
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,520
(simply because she's moved.)

563
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,230
Your food, sir.

564
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,110
I no longer

565
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,040
need this.

566
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,430
Give it to someone who needs it.

567
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:35,140
(Liu's River Snails Rice Noodles)

568
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,540
(Mei)

569
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:43,880
At the Art Festival,

570
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,400
our play was

571
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,400
the best.

572
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,800
Lu Xun and Qian Wei

573
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,560
won many awards before.

574
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,310
With the success

575
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:53,710
of such a big show,

576
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,400
they will be Triple-A Students.

577
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:55,950
Let's just

578
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:57,310
celebrate for them in advance.

579
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,430
Nice.

580
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:00,640
Thank you for your blessing.

581
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,280
You know what?

582
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,470
190 yuan for one night.

583
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:03,520
Sing as many songs as you can.

584
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,350
Do you hear me?

585
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,310
Only singing?

586
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,350
You made such a big mistake.

587
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:07,830
Shouldn't you buy us some beer?

588
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:09,310
You know what?

589
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,710
I'm indeed a miser.

590
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:11,560
I've prepared it for you.

591
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,070
Take it.

592
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:12,590
Let me check.

593
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:13,880
I asked about it.

594
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,640
The water and ice are

595
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,400
free of charge.

596
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,070
Chew some ice
when you want something to eat.

597
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:18,560
Also,

598
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,070
I've brought some tea and wolfberries.

599
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:20,920
If you want some,

600
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,800
come and get them.

601
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:24,280
Only a few bottles?

602
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,950
You've even brought the tea?

603
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:26,520
Yeah.

604
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,230
I don't have money.

605
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,760
Lu Xun,

606
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,160
restrain her, will you?

607
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:30,880
Right.

608
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,430
I don't think

609
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:32,880
the beer is

610
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:34,400
too...

611
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,520
I can't restrain her.

612
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,040
I'll do it, then.

613
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,110
Qian Wei,

614
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:43,920
do you dare to play the dice game?

615
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,400
If you lose once,

616
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,350
drink a bottle of beer

617
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:48,160
and get punished.

618
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,310
If I lose,

619
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,880
I'll pay the bill.

620
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,680
Everyone can order

621
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,350
whatever he wants.

622
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,590
You'll just pay the bill, then.

623
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:58,190
Don't underestimate me.

624
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,000
Time to show you

625
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,310
who I really am.

626
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:02,950
Dice Queen of Northeast China.

627
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,590
Dice Queen of Northeast China?

628
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:05,640
I'm the Dice Queen of the South, then.

629
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,190
You know what?

630
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:06,760
In a dice game,

631
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,950
I'm always the winner. Got it?

632
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:08,710
Come on.

633
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,400
Five 5s.

634
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:21,560
Open.

635
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,230
I don't have any 5.

636
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,590
You lost.

637
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,950
You should thank me for the beer.

638
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:33,950
It's not time to celebrate yet.

639
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:34,400
You know what?

640
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,070
It's just a bottle of beer.

641
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,560
I'll win soon.

642
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,070
I didn't say
the beer was the punishment.

643
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,160
What's the punishment, then?

644
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,280
Sell the punishment to me

645
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,830
at a price.

646
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:45,950
What about ten bottles of beer?

647
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,470
One case of beer at least.

648
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:49,280
How greedy!

649
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:49,950
Deal.

650
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:50,830
Deal.

651
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,190
Whose side are you on?

652
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,680
Girl,

653
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,230
could you please not hit me

654
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:56,230
when you talk?

655
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:57,110
What's wrong with that?

656
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:58,880
Looks like a relationship

657
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,560
wastes luck and money.

658
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,430
Not really.

659
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:03,710
There's still fun to see.

660
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:06,190
Boss,

661
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:06,950
what do you think?

662
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:08,560
Is it appropriate?

663
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,070
What?

664
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:10,830
Be louder.

665
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:12,000
I can't hear you.

666
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:13,800
You can't hear me?

667
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,520
I'm also good

668
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,310
at ear-cleaning?

669
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,190
Would you like to experience

670
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:17,430
the broken eardrums?

671
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,590
When a couple quarrel with each other,

672
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:20,560
third wheels like us get benefits.

673
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:34,350
Sir,

674
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,000
here's the bill.

675
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,350
I quit.

676
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:36,760
I quit.

677
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,350
You know what?

678
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:38,070
I'm no longer

679
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:38,920
Dice Queen of the South.

680
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,350
I won't play this game ever again.

681
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:42,710
Punishment. Punishment.

682
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:43,470
Yeah.

683
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:45,070
You must be punished.

684
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,110
You lose, after all.

685
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:46,950
How about

686
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:48,590
calling me

687
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:49,590
Big Brother?

688
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:50,710
What Big Brother?

689
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:51,520
You're just a little brother

690
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,350
who takes the wrong side.

691
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:54,950
You hit me?

692
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:55,830
How could you hit me?

693
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:56,470
I did, so what?

694
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:57,760
I'll then squeeze...

695
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:01,350
This isn't unpacked yet, right?

696
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,880
Then refund it.

697
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,280
No way.

698
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:03,590
It's unpacked.

699
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:04,590
We ate some.

700
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,920
It can't be refunded.

701
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,280
Zixin.

702
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:07,830
Thank you.

703
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:09,310
What a waste!

704
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,160
Waitress.

705
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,470
Waitress,

706
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:12,710
we ordered a big fruit platter
for the next room.

707
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:13,430
Where is it?

708
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:14,280
Is it gone?

709
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,070
Did you serve it to the wrong room?

710
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:15,880
We've been waiting.

711
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,680
Please wait a minute, sir.

712
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,800
I'll check it for you.

713
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,560
Be quick.

714
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:22,430
Zixin?

715
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:24,950
Why are you here?

716
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:26,040
What a coincidence!

717
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,070
I'm in the next room.

718
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:27,830
I am

719
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:28,640
talking business

720
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,590
with several partners.

721
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,040
Well, well.

722
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:32,430
They must be

723
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:33,430
your classmates.

724
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,760
What a wonderful atmosphere!

725
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,880
So young.

726
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,800
It's totally different

727
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,760
from that in our room.

728
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,640
Come on.

729
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,430
A toast to you.

730
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,880
I'm Zixin's cousin,

731
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,470
Mo Tao.

732
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:47,710
I'm Mo Tao.

733
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:48,070
Come on.

734
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:49,350
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello, Mr. Mo.

735
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,470
What a wonderful atmosphere!

736
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:55,880
I wondered

737
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,760
why I couldn't reach you recently.

738
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,190
So, you've been hanging around
with your classmate.

739
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:59,560
You're quite busy.

740
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,160
Sir,

741
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:00,880
I'm sorry.

742
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,800
We indeed served the fruit

743
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,560
to the wrong room.

744
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,040
It's okay.

745
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:03,640
Leave the fruit

746
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,830
in this room.

747
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:05,350
Guys,

748
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,190
have some fruit

749
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:06,760
to sober up.

750
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,830
You've drunk a lot, boys.

751
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:08,670
Well,

752
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:09,190
waitress,

753
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:11,230
get a bottle of whisky

754
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:12,520
and a bottle of champagne.

755
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,150
They're on me.

756
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:13,840
Serve them to this room.

757
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,230
Okay?

758
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:14,950
Wait a minute, sir.

759
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:15,320
If you want

760
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,280
anything to drink or eat,

761
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,230
just order it.

762
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,320
It's on me.

763
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,470
I'd like

764
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:21,520
to thank

765
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,670
all of you

766
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,280
for taking care

767
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,910
of Zixin

768
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:26,470
for such a long time.

769
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:27,000
Thank you, guys.

770
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,360
Thank you.

771
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,390
Cheers.

772
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:30,000
If you have other guests

773
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,120
to entertain,

774
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,630
get to your business.

775
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:33,000
It's okay.

776
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:33,840
It won't waste a lot of time.

777
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,840
I'm already here.

778
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,520
To be polite,

779
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,630
I should drink some
with your classmates.

780
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:38,840
Come on. Cheers.

781
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,040
I'll have a talk with my cousin.

782
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:45,080
Enjoy yourselves.

783
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,230
Okay.

784
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:47,000
Bye-bye.

785
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,710
Zixin has a cousin.

786
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,910
We've never heard about him.

787
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,120
When he treats us,

788
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,470
he'll pay thousands of yuan.

789
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:58,520
And he only drinks whisky.

790
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,760
He's rich.

791
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:02,910
What's wrong?

792
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:04,710
Nothing.

793
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:05,910
Her cousin

794
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:07,760
keeps calling her recently.

795
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:10,560
We don't drink whisky.

796
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,560
Let's drink beer.

797
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,520
Drink with me.

798
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,360
All right. All right.

799
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,190
Stop drinking.

800
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:14,470
Don't drink too much.

801
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:15,120
Come on, drink it.

802
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:22,840
You'll pay the bill?

803
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,760
How do you get the money?

804
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,560
After you pay back the money,

805
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,630
I'll have it.

806
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:28,950
Why do you bother to ask?

807
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,040
I'm your cousin.

808
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,040
After you pay back the money,

809
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:32,760
I will

810
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,360
win credit for you like this more often.

811
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:36,710
If

812
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,840
I didn't meet you here today,

813
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:38,870
would you never

814
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,040
call me back?

815
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,710
Like I said,

816
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,000
when my father speculated
on the stock market,

817
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,800
your family insisted
on doing it with him.

818
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,710
That was a joint investment.

819
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:50,000
When the investment failed,

820
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:51,760
we should pay the debts separately.

821
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,320
My mother was ignorant of the law.

822
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,600
We saved up a big sum of money

823
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,870
and returned it to you.

824
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,630
It was for sympathy,

825
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:58,760
instead of liability.

826
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,430
Now, you're indeed

827
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:01,190
a top student

828
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:03,430
in the Law Department.

829
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:05,080
You dare to talk about laws with me.

830
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,120
But if it weren't for

831
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,670
your father's error,

832
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:10,670
I needn't have been drinking wine

833
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:12,040
with my clients in the karaoke

834
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:12,950
so humbly.

835
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,670
When your father cheated
my family out of money,

836
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:16,120
you thought we were close relatives.

837
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,320
And now?

838
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,280
You think we're irrelevant

839
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:20,630
and we don't owe each other.

840
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:21,910
What a cheek!

841
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,040
Let me say it again.

842
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,360
We didn't cheat you out of money.

843
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:27,230
We've paid the debts

844
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:28,360
we were asked to pay by law,

845
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,230
with all our family fortunes.

846
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,670
If you're not convinced,

847
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:33,080
go find a lawyer.

848
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:33,840
But you don't need

849
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,470
to swagger in front of my friends.

850
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,800
Swagger?

851
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,190
I learned it from you.

852
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:43,870
Mo Zixin,

853
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,470
are you

854
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:46,600
still pretending

855
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,040
to be a beautiful young girl

856
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:50,430
from a rich family

857
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:52,280
in your university?

858
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,520
That's understandable.

859
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,150
I'm sure your silly classmates

860
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:56,910
don't know

861
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:57,670
your so-called

862
00:36:57,670 --> 00:37:00,000
stock tycoon father

863
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:01,670
turns out to be a swindler.

864
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,910
Don't you dare slander my father!

865
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,600
I'm warning you.

866
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,360
You'd better think it over.

867
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,360
Let go of me!

868
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:26,760
Liu,

869
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,390
are you all right?

870
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,560
Shall I take you home by taxi?

871
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,190
How dare you!

872
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,120
When I'm still here,

873
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,040
no one can leave the KTV

874
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,280
as he wishes.

875
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,150
Fine.

876
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:43,040
Anyway, even if you're drunk,

877
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,390
I can carry you on my back.

878
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:49,520
After the performance,

879
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,040
you've been acting weirdly.

880
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,230
You're hyper

881
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,190
and you're also depressed.

882
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,000
I no longer want to major

883
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,470
in what I don't like.

884
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:01,840
Seriously?

885
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,040
But you're in the third year already.

886
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,080
You can't apply for another major.

887
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,470
Then I'll apply for the second major.

888
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:09,280
Or I'll take the graduate entrance exam
of another major.

889
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:15,150
I'll go get you some water.

890
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:16,120
Wait for me.

891
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:40,000
Are you all right, girl?

892
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:41,630
You're so drunk.

893
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,280
Be careful.

894
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,910
Who made you drink so much?

895
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:55,670
Be careful. Be careful.

896
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,870
Don't get choked.

897
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:03,150
Liu,

898
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,120
are you all right?

899
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:04,600
Dude.

900
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,950
Have some water.

901
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,230
No, I don't want it.

902
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,000
It's just a party.

903
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,120
Who made her drink so much?

904
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:09,760
How dangerous it is

905
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,360
in such a place!

906
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:11,190
Come on.

907
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,120
Get her back home.

908
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,710
I have to go entertain my clients.

909
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,430
What clients?

910
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:15,840
Go.

911
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,150
What?

912
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:16,950
Let's continue the karaoke.

913
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:17,470
What?

914
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:18,000
Go.

915
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,390
I'm back.

916
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:22,840
I'm back.

917
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,080
She's drunk.

918
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,950
At this celebration party,

919
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:30,910
I'd like to announce something.

920
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,040
That is,

921
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:35,320
I can't have the jade pendant
and the microphone at the same time.

922
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,150
So,

923
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:36,870
I will

924
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:37,390
choose...

925
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:37,840
Liu,

926
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,560
where's your jade pendant?

927
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:43,000
Did you leave it in the toilet?

928
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:43,560
No.

929
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:45,280
It was on her when she was vomiting.

930
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:46,870
When you helped her walk,

931
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:47,360
did you see it?

932
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,360
Where's my jade pendant?

933
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,520
What jade pendant?

934
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,000
Mo Tao also helped her walk?

935
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:52,320
Yes.

936
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,670
But how could I

937
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:54,150
notice it?

938
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:55,150
When I walked out of the toilet,

939
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:55,670
she was drunk

940
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,150
and ran into my arms.

941
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:57,430
You know,

942
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:58,390
I shouldn't

943
00:39:58,390 --> 00:39:59,800
stare at the chest

944
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,320
of a girl.

945
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,080
That was inappropriate.

946
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:02,760
I'll go look for it.

947
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:05,760
Everybody, we'd better not move

948
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,950
or leave this room.

949
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:08,230
Let's search the room

950
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:09,080
for it.

951
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:09,950
Right, right.

952
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:11,560
Let's look for it.

953
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:17,630
I had planned to return it to my father.

954
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:19,600
He'll skin me.

955
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:23,120
Well,

956
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,150
and the backrests.

957
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:25,230
You'd better also check

958
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:26,520
the backrests.

959
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,950
Search carefully.

960
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:28,520
Maybe

961
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,760
someone put it in his bag

962
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:31,280
by mistake

963
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:31,950
when he packed things

964
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:32,870
because he was drunk

965
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:34,040
and the room was too dark.

966
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:34,950
Why don't you

967
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:35,710
check your bags?

968
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:36,360
Search carefully.

969
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,870
Open your bags and check.

970
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,670
(It still happened.)
