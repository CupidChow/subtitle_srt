2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:05,190
Morning, Hui.

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:07,070
You come to see the rehearsal again?

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,310
I said I'd be there.

5
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:10,230
So, here I am.

6
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:11,390
Liu has finally stopped

7
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:12,310
singing out of tune recently.

8
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:13,520
Your efforts have paid off.

9
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,110
No kidding.

10
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:15,840
Let go of me!

11
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,230
Let go of me! Get out!

12
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,310
Get off me!

13
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:20,520
Come with us!

14
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,470
I can't leave!

15
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:22,150
What are you doing?

16
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,390
Wait!

17
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:26,710
Let go!

18
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:27,280
Qian Chuan!

19
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:28,760
Stay back!

20
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:29,520
Stay back!

21
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:31,120
Wait! Wait!

22
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,000
Stay back!

23
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,080
Go.

24
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,200
Wait!

25
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:35,720
Go get them!

26
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,240
Go!

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,550
What are you doing?

30
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,510
Are you stupid?

31
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:49,590
I'm saving your life.

32
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,590
Without me, you would have been

33
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,510
kidnapped by the gangsters.

34
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,800
They are employees of my family.

35
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,550
Your family is the gang?

36
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,190
This is a society governed by law.

37
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,400
Then why did they try to kidnap you?

38
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,950
Family marriage?

39
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,160
No.

40
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:05,720
My dad found out about

41
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,680
my job at the bar.

42
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,910
He called the school again.

43
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,320
He found out that I was going to
take a second major.

44
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,190
So, he sent people here to

45
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,320
ask me to explain it.

46
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,600
This is not a small thing.

47
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,440
You didn't discuss it with your family?

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,470
Why?

49
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:18,750
Why?

50
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,670
Why are you afraid to
take the pendulum ride?

51
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:21,270
I…

52
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,160
You're scared.

53
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,190
Everything has its conqueror.

54
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:25,520
And I am scared of my father.

55
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:29,390
I can never

56
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,830
take the pendulum ride.

57
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,080
But you can't stop seeing

58
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,910
your parents for the rest of your life.

59
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,030
Qian Wei told me

60
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:39,000
that once you achieve something

61
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,320
you're scared of,

62
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,240
you'll feel really good.

63
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:43,670
It's easy for you to say.

64
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,080
Why don't you go first?

65
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,190
Come.

66
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,240
Now what?

67
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,440
I'm sacrificing myself for my friend.

68
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,550
Let's go there

69
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,800
and finish this once for all.

70
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:58,600
Come on.

71
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,160
Wait.

72
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,320
Come on!

73
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,160
Dude!

74
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,360
You're not the only

75
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,630
who's afraid of it, OK?

76
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,080
I've already called my sister.

77
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,630
The more, the better.

78
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,160
Let's take a few rounds up there

79
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,670
and be fearless when we get down.

80
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,320
It's too scary!

81
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:14,030
Come on!

82
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,110
What are you doing?

83
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,110
Such a coward.

84
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,360
Where is my sister?

85
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,440
She's busy with

86
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,800
some tests.

87
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,670
So,

88
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,630
she asked me to come

89
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,750
and gave you some pep talk.

90
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,270
No, wait.

91
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:28,880
Other girls fall in love

92
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,080
and leave their studies behind.

93
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,440
My sister is the opposite kind.

94
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,270
She not only left

95
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,240
the three of us behind,

96
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,670
she also even forgot

97
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,360
our anniversary.

98
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,390
What's that look?

99
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:42,830
Back to you two,

100
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,600
why are you being such a chicken?

101
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,270
What is there to be
afraid of this pendulum ride?

102
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,080
The odds of something going wrong

103
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,190
are only one in 1,500,000,000.

104
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:51,440
This thing is, like,

105
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,080
ten stories tall,

106
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,800
and the falling speed should be

107
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,190
about 80km an hour.

108
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,030
The centrifugal force

109
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,670
is about 2.5g.

110
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,270
And,

111
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,320
if something does go wrong,

112
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,800
it hits the ground

113
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,600
in about

114
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,630
five to eight seconds.

115
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,390
You could have the chance

116
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,750
to experience death once.

117
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,750
You could stand up

118
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,600
to your parents without fear then.

119
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:07,960
Dude.

120
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:08,880
Sir.

121
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:10,960
Since you're here,

122
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,750
why don't you take a tour?

123
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,030
Stop trying to get back at society.

124
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:15,470
That merry-go-round does

125
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,000
seem to suit me.

126
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,390
And the…

127
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,640
You need other odds,

128
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,550
and I'll do the math for you.

129
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,070
Don't bother.

130
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,640
The probability of frying the chicken…

131
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,830
- No, no, don't.
- And that one…

132
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:23,440
Or other…

133
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,000
Just go!

134
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,550
OK, then.

135
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,480
It's just a pendulum ride!

136
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,230
What is there to be afraid of?

137
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:38,830
I'll prove it to you.

138
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,000
There is no fear that

139
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,950
cannot be overcome.

140
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,260
(Entry)

141
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:01,950
Miss.

142
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:03,070
If,

143
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,110
I mean, just in case,

144
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,480
please send a message

145
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,920
to my friend.

146
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,000
She can't.

147
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,000
If it happens, we die together.

148
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:02,440
Xun.

149
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,040
Although your parents

150
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,070
- do not have time to come,
- Here, look at me.

151
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,110
Xuan and I are

152
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,040
here for you.

153
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,270
If you want to eat anything,

154
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,070
or play anything,

155
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,160
you let me know.

156
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,670
Don't be shy.

157
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,070
Mom, come on.

158
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,790
Move a little this way.

159
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,070
- OK.
- Sure.

160
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,550
- Coming.
- One more time.

161
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:19,760
Hi,

162
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,390
could you take a picture for us?

163
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,070
OK, OK.

164
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:21,510
Thank you.

165
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:24,880
OK, look at me.

166
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,550
OK.

167
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:27,510
Smile.

168
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,110
That's good.

169
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,600
Congratulations on being chosen

170
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,200
as today's lucky visitor,

171
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,350
and you can be accompanied by

172
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,640
Dancing Bear for a whole day!

173
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:55,600
Thank you,

174
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,510
but

175
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,040
I have a girlfriend.

176
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,440
I wish my girlfriend

177
00:06:59,440 --> 00:06:59,830
could be here with me.

178
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,830
(Look at the pose.)

179
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,320
Mom.

180
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:31,670
That man is bullying the bear.

181
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,830
The bear is beating him up, I guess.

182
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,720
Little girl.

183
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,600
It's not a bear.

184
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,070
This is a staff here.

185
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:43,720
What's wrong?

186
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,760
That's not what I mean.

187
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,550
Don't cry.

188
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,720
It's OK. It's OK.

189
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,670
You scared her.

190
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:48,600
- You know?
- It's alright. It's OK.

191
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,880
I feel so good.

192
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,920
Lu Xun was right.

193
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,600
I'm fearless now.

194
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,600
Let's do it again.

195
00:07:59,600 --> 00:07:59,950
Let's go.

196
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,320
Oh, dear.

197
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:02,950
Are you OK?

198
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,880
Buddy, you feel good,

199
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:08,600
and I'm

200
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,000
the one throwing up.

201
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:12,880
Trust me,

202
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,070
I won't let you
go through this for nothing.

203
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,160
I'm telling

204
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:15,830
my parents tonight.

205
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,070
Make the throw.

206
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:23,670
Make the throw.

207
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,510
This one

208
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,600
is easy.

209
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:28,550
I,

210
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,480
am the master of this.

211
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:32,110
Hear me out.

212
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,150
You gotta use your wrist

213
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,000
to throw this,

214
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,030
not some brute force.

215
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:36,840
Understand?

216
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,470
Check this out.

217
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,200
Enjoy the show.

218
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:42,350
No big deal.

219
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,150
I'm just getting started.

220
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,470
You're so lame.

221
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:57,000
Fine, fine, I'm lame.

222
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,030
You do it. Here.

223
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,320
Bear, come on, give it a shot.

224
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,000
Show me how good you are.

225
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,440
This bear looks new.

226
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,520
I have never seen it before.

227
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:23,200
My boss.

228
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,400
So good, right?

229
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,520
OK, that's it.

230
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,470
Congratulations on winning

231
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,280
our grand prize.

232
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,230
I want this awesome bear

233
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:35,200
to help me win the doll.

234
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:35,840
Listen to me.

235
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,710
You are

236
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,350
a big boy now.

237
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,320
If you want something,

238
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,640
earn it yourself,

239
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,150
am I right?

240
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,350
But you look bigger than us,

241
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,880
so why can't you earn it yourself?

242
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:45,960
Me?

243
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,030
I have a big bear.

244
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,440
Do I need to get it myself?

245
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,470
And this bear

246
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,590
belongs to me forever,

247
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:52,280
got it?

248
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,230
Let's go.

249
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,200
Bear!

250
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,110
The bear.

251
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,000
Come back.

252
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:00,400
We enjoy the game ourselves.

253
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,200
If you don't take off the head,

254
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,400
you're going to miss the firework.

255
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,030
Your

256
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,110
scissor hands pose, as usual.

257
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,350
Your usual strawberry taste
of marshmallow.

258
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,470
When you won the earthbags game,

259
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:46,440
you screamed out.

260
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,230
Your acting skills

261
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,150
are not very good.

262
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,350
I hate you.

263
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:02,840
You've been holding it the whole day,

264
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,670
and can't you hold it
a little bit longer

265
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,640
before you expose me?

266
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,790
Give it back.

267
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,790
What's the look on his face?

268
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,640
He has bad memories
of amusement parks?

269
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,790
No, he doesn't.

270
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,910
Well, he gave bad memories

271
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:23,880
to other kids.

272
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,440
It's actually our fault.

273
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,400
We agreed to spend

274
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,520
Children's Day with him,

275
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,080
but we were so busy at work

276
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:32,350
that we had to ask

277
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,230
the other kids' parents

278
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:33,840
to take him.

279
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:35,230
And…

280
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,550
You've all been duped.

281
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,960
One, it's dry ice, not fairy gas.

282
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,960
Two, fairy tales are all lies.

283
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,400
These are not princesses,

284
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,470
but staffs.

285
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:46,590
They don't live in castles.

286
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:47,550
They live in dorms.

287
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,520
I made an appointment with

288
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,350
you two six months in advance

289
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,030
to take me to the amusement park today,

290
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,200
and you didn't even remember it.

291
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,080
I was never

292
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,470
in your plans!

293
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,280
No need to make excuses.

294
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,030
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

295
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,670
And then,

296
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,110
(Schedule)
he really didn't say a word

297
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:22,960
to me and his father

298
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,840
for three months.

299
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,470
Sounds like Lu Xun.

300
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,000
Whether he is eight or eighteen

301
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,030
or twenty-eight,

302
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,110
he is just as stubborn as ever.

303
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,440
After that, I wanted to take him there,

304
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,150
but he refused to go.

305
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,230
He's been like this
since he was a child,

306
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:42,590
never saying

307
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,030
what he likes.

308
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,200
But it really is our fault.

309
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:49,440
I was in the hospital every day

310
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,440
and his dad was in court all the time.

311
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,230
When he was little,

312
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,550
we didn't have time for him.

313
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,520
As a result, we have
very few family photos.

314
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,760
I just want you to

315
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,710
go back to that day

316
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,520
and be that carefree little boy.

317
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:30,760
You can be tough,

318
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,080
you can be handful,

319
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:33,520
and you can be mean,

320
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,080
but Dancing Bear

321
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,110
won't abandon you.

322
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,590
You'll always be on his schedule.

323
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,110
You know what?

324
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,880
This is the best day I've ever had

325
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,960
at the amusement park.

326
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:03,840
Thank you.

00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:21,840
to Haizhou.

350
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,670
The bath center next door

351
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:23,640
is also my family's.

352
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,640
One-stop service.

353
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,280
Good.

354
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,840
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

355
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,550
I will protect you.

356
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:42,640
That's…

357
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:43,670
Dad.

358
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,080
You found your way home.

359
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:48,280
Wait, you…

360
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:49,670
We got a guest?

361
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,200
Come on in.

362
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,710
Come on in!

363
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,910
Your family is really not a gangster?

364
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:06,520
No.

365
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,110
But my dad is honorary chairman

366
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,590
of the Northeast Boxing Fan Association.

367
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:12,790
Are you scared?

368
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,280
No way.

369
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,760
I'm at least

370
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,840
a national level 2 athlete.

371
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,230
I heard that

372
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,440
you encouraged my daughter

373
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,320
to do music?

374
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,080
No, no.

375
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,760
Actually, to be precise,

376
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,030
it's my sister.

377
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,350
No, sir,

378
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,550
sir, this is a lawful society.

379
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,640
Let's just talk.

380
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,230
Dad, don't scare him.

381
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,470
Let's talk inside.

382
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:42,910
Enjoy.

383
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:14,470
(Oh, no.)

384
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,760
(Domestic violence.)

385
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,400
(If I go up there right now,)

386
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:18,950
(will her dad)

387
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:19,920
(rip my skin off)

388
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,470
(and make clothes out of it?)

389
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:25,590
(I'm dead anyway.)

390
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:26,880
(I'm coming!)

391
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:30,680
Sir!

392
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,590
Be merciful, beat me up if you want!

393
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,920
I'm the one who encouraged her!

394
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,880
I win.

395
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:46,430
I've spoiled you since you were a kid.

396
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:47,950
I made you think

397
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,920
it was easy to do everything.

398
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,640
A bet is a bet.

399
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:53,400
I'll

400
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:55,830
allow you to take a second major,

401
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:58,710
but

402
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,680
from now on,

403
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,800
you can't ask for a penny
from your family.

404
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,430
Can you do that?

405
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:09,830
Deal.

406
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:30,880
Let's go.

407
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,400
I…

408
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,590
Get up. Let's go.

409
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,110
You don't have a car to pick you up.

410
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,950
You don't have the money for the bus,

411
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:58,830
and you're still so happy.

412
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:01,880
Your sister told me my fortune once.

413
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,310
She told me to buy

414
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,280
gold and liquor stocks

415
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,310
with my gift money,

416
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,520
saying that

417
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,470
I could make a big profit in ten years.

418
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,110
I don't know

419
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,000
if I can make a profit in ten years.

420
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,280
But now I can sell it

421
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,640
to meet an emergency

422
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,950
and support my dream.

423
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,160
You believe Qian Wei's words?

424
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,310
I believe every Qian Wei's word.

425
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,400
Are you going to compete soon?

426
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,760
(Liu's River Snails Rice Noodles)
I'm going to train in a couple of days.

427
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,800
Good luck, Chuan.

428
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,070
You've ridden the pendulum.

429
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,350
This time, you'll definitely break

430
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,400
the spell of forever No.2

431
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,520
and win the first place.

432
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,560
Come on, let's go to my restaurant

433
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,880
and celebrate in advance.

434
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,800
Let's have some rice noodles.

435
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:33,190
Yes.

436
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:36,160
Your business is too depressing.

437
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,350
You sure need my help.

438
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:39,680
When you put it that way,

439
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,710
I can't argue with it.

440
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,280
Coming!

441
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,470
(Liu's River Snails Rice Noodles)

442
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:45,310
Let me see.

443
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:36,430
Hello?

444
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:37,760
Coach.

445
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:38,830
Am I right?

446
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:39,920
Did Qian Chuan's

447
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,520
grades slip again?

448
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,470
Qian Chuan's grades are getting

449
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:44,310
worse and worse these days.

450
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:45,880
He's not in the right mind

451
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,760
for training.

452
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,310
If he keeps doing this,

453
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,040
with this score,

454
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,710
he doesn't need to
go on training anymore.

455
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:52,400
Coach, how about this?

456
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,070
Can I ask for a leave

457
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,160
for Qian Chuan tonight?

458
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,520
A leave?

459
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,400
This game is about

460
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,560
getting into the national team.

461
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,160
His performance now is not good enough,

462
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,070
and now he should adjust his state

463
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,310
and practice.

464
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,590
You want to ask for a leave?

465
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,590
Coach.

466
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,680
Qian Chuan is forever No.2.

467
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,160
When it comes to big games,

468
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:10,950
he tends to get nervous

469
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:12,590
and play badly.

470
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,000
I'm sure you're aware of this.

471
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:15,350
This game is so important.

472
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:17,280
He must be under a lot of stress.

473
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:19,230
His problem

474
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,710
is more psychological,

475
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:21,920
not ability, right?

476
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:24,760
Mentality is more important

477
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,640
than technique at this point.

478
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:29,310
The more you fear losing,
the harder it is to win.

479
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,350
How can he beat his opponent

480
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,430
if he doesn't believe

481
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:33,680
he can win?

482
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,800
How can he break through?

483
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:36,920
Please just say yes,

484
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,310
and I promise I'll make Qian Chuan

485
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:40,000
feel new after tonight,

486
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:40,680
OK?

487
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:47,680
This way.

488
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,230
You are not a good player.

489
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,110
Why do you bring me here?

490
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,880
All right, I'll make you a bet.

491
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,710
If I can hit

492
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,680
three balls in a row,

493
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,830
you give me one wish.

494
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,430
What if you lose?

495
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:01,520
You'll be my big brother from now on.

496
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:02,830
Sure.

497
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:04,830
My childhood dream is

498
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:05,710
about to come true.

499
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,880
Step aside.

500
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:28,430
When did you learn how to do that?

501
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,430
2022.

502
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,310
What?

503
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,710
The person standing in front of you

504
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:38,590
is not the Qian Wei in present,

505
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,040
but the 28-year-old Qian Wei.

506
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:46,520
I did not stop you

507
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,800
from learning the law,

508
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:50,280
otherwise, you would not be

509
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,920
forced by study and turn into this.

510
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,760
It's my fault.

511
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:56,230
Are you out of your mind?

512
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:58,000
You are a student of sports.

513
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,430
Why do you like acting so much?

514
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,470
Tell me.

515
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:03,400
How am I supposed to

516
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,110
know so many things?

517
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,430
Trust your hunches?

518
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,280
You fool.

519
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,000
That's because

520
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,830
I've been through it all.

521
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:12,470
Otherwise, how can I, a forever No.2,

522
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:13,830
win Lu Xun?

523
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,160
Qian Wei.

524
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,430
I guess you haven't made

525
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,830
much progress in your ten years.

526
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:24,070
You…

527
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,760
But I think you should

528
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,680
really see a brain specialist.

529
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,190
You don't believe me.

530
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:32,950
I can understand that.

531
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:34,400
How about his?

532
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,280
Do you have any questions

533
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,680
you want to ask about the future?

534
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,680
I'll answer them.

535
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:40,830
The future…

536
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,000
Did Loki and his brother

537
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,640
finally make up?

538
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,040
Yes,

539
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:52,830
but Loki died.

540
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:54,950
Shut up!

541
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:55,920
Don't worry.

542
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:57,430
In 2022,

543
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,160
there will be an extra show.

544
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,400
What about Wolverine?

545
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:00,920
Of course dead.

546
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:01,710
See,

547
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:03,470
for a man with superpowers like him,

548
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,160
after he runs out of energy,

549
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:05,920
he will die

550
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,520
to protect

551
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,590
the new mutants,

552
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:08,230
and it's called sacrifice,

553
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:08,920
understand?

554
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,470
Game of Thrones.

555
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:15,680
Sorry,

556
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,680
a weak ending.

557
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,520
Daenerys slaughtered

558
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,430
King's Landing

559
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:19,920
and got killed by Jon Snow.

560
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,160
My sister is really crazy.

561
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:25,760
If you're not crazy,

562
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,590
then I'll be crazy.

563
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:29,280
The future isn't all bad.

564
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,430
There are good things too.

565
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:31,880
What good things?

566
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,310
Things about you.

567
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:37,950
This tournament,

568
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,110
you'll win the gold medal

569
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,520
you want most

570
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:42,310
and get into the national team.

571
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,590
How is it possible?

572
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,680
I think you really should

573
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,800
see a brain doctor.

574
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,800
You don't believe me

575
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,040
when I told you bad news,

576
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:54,950
and you don't believe
the good news, either.

577
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:56,000
Which one of us should see the doctor?

578
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,160
Go home.

579
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,760
Move.

580
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,280
What now?

581
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,400
(He's in the third lane.)

582
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:14,380
(He has his struggles)

583
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,500
(in the breaststroke.)

584
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,520
Let me tell you,

585
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,230
if this guy can win the first place,

586
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,470
you can fulfill my wish

587
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:24,070
to see you win the championship.

588
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:27,110
Are you addicted to

589
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:27,830
playing the prophet?

590
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,590
Even if what you

591
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,110
said before is true,

592
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:31,430
but I know more than you

593
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,310
in swimming.

594
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,680
These are all famous
athletes on the field today.

595
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,110
Unless he makes a miracle,

596
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:37,430
he can't…

597
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,470
He can't win the championship.

598
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:40,800
We'll see.

599
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:51,060
(National Swimming Championships Live)
(Men's 200m Breaststroke Final)

600
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,310
He's fast.

601
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,540
(National Swimming Championships Live)
(Men's 200m Breaststroke Final)

602
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,830
There's hope.

603
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:06,140
(National Swimming Championships Live)
(Men's 200m Breaststroke Final)

604
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:07,430
Nice!

605
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,800
- What did I tell you?
- Amazing!

606
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,040
I can win the championship?

607
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,920
I really can win the championship?

608
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:14,310
Hey, son,

609
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,430
let go of her.

610
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:16,520
These are the best players

611
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,470
in the country.

612
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:18,190
Calm down.

613
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,110
I believe you.

614
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:20,830
Tell me

615
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,070
what I have to do to get that gold.

616
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:24,430
You know.

617
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,520
I was able to break the curse

618
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,280
of forever No.2

619
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,070
and beat Lu Xun,

620
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,040
because I have

621
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,830
strong confidence.

622
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,000
Your performance is already better

623
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,230
than the guy in the first place.

624
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,350
But you just lack

625
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,520
a little bit of confidence.

626
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,470
I did not praise you before

627
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,400
because I think the time
has not yet come,

628
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,190
but now the time

629
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,280
has come.

630
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,040
Wei,

631
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,590
you've always believed in me?

632
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:49,190
I thought our whole family

633
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,560
had decided that

634
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,470
we were losers.

635
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,760
Maybe before,

636
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:56,520
but not now.

637
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,680
I already know the result.

638
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,310
Just let it come.

639
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:04,760
OK!

640
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,520
No problem, Wei.

641
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,400
I feel like I'm

642
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,710
full of energy now!

643
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:25,760
(They thought my brother
was lacking confidence,)

644
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,520
(but I knew that)

645
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,310
(he just wanted people around him)

646
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,470
(to give him more encouragement)

647
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,280
(and tell him he can do it.)

648
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:40,160
(These invulnerable big boys)

649
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,830
(who seem to have no problem)

650
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:44,000
(are actually in need of )

651
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,800
(attention and love. )

652
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,680
(At that time, )

653
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,190
(I did not understand these, )

654
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,400
(but this time I do.)

655
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,000
Qian Chuan.

656
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:40,950
Why are you still here?

657
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:42,520
Coach,

658
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,070
I'll leave after the last lap.

659
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,470
You're much more positive

660
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,000
since you came back,

661
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,110
but be careful

662
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,470
not to over-train.

663
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:52,590
Your old cramp problem

664
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,880
hasn't returned, has it?

665
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,680
No.

666
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,000
I'm really good.

667
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,950
OK, go on then.

668
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:03,920
Well, that's

669
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,400
all we got now.

670
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,160
End of report.

671
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,780
(Water depth 0.8m)

672
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,680
I don't know

673
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,000
if he is rejuvenated

674
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,230
or he has gone crazy.

675
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:13,040
Did I

676
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,230
go too far?

677
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,350
Well,

678
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:19,590
you can fool people,

679
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:20,710
but in terms of enforcing,

680
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:21,920
you're going to need me.

681
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,310
Just wait.

682
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,590
Hello, hon.

683
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,920
How many times have

684
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,310
I told you not to call me Missy?

685
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,830
And my brain is fine!

686
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,070
Listen.

687
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:38,760
I got a situation here.

688
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,310
It's an emergence.

689
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,280
You must help me.

690
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,310
I'm not borrowing money.

691
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,000
I need your men.

692
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,110
There he is.

693
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:51,520
He's out.

694
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,040

Gentlemen.

00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,190
Can we rain check,

697
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:00,110
please?

698
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,830
Help! Coach!

699
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,230
What is this place?

700
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,190
Sir, sir.

701
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:07,950
Sir.

702
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:08,920
No.

703
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:12,750
Hi,

704
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,470
handsome boy.

705
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,640
It's you.

706
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:20,520
You…

707
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,070
You are…

708
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:23,400
You are

709
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,800
a student of law.

710
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,280
Don't you know that

711
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,160
the rule of law society

712
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,310
does not promote such deals?

713
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,590
Shut it.

714
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,560
Look at you, such a coward.

715
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:32,000
Your sister was worried that

716
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,520
you were overtraining before the race.

717
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,830
I volunteered to come

718
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,560
and relax you.

719
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:38,920
Relax?

720
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,520
What could be more relaxing

721
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,950
than a massage?

722
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,430
What do you want?

723
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:48,070
Come on.

724
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:58,000
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, sir.

Thank you all for your support.

732
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,040
Do you like this?

733
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:27,680
Next debate,

734
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,230
I'll give you a more luxurious one.

735
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,070
Encouragement is not about money.

736
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,470
Clap hard later,

737
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:33,040
you hear me?

738
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,590
Drink some sparkling water
to moisten your throat,

739
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,710
and shout harder later.

740
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,800
- Yes!
- Yes!

741
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:38,880
The following is

00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,920
the men's 100m breaststroke final.

Let's have the athletes.

00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,920
They're coming!

745

Qian Chuan of Guanghua University.

751

752
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,430
Do your best, Qian Chuan!

Go, Qian Chuan!

Your sister said

755
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,310
if you won the game,

756
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,640
she would buy you a PS4.

757
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,070
When did I say that?

758
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:06,950
Ten of them,

759
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,760
she said.

760
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,430
Think about me and Lu Xun.

761
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:11,190
The forever No.2

762
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:12,680
can beat the first place one.

763

The boy of Family Qian is unstoppable.

764
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,350
He got applause

765
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:22,880
and cheers.

766
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,400
He can surpass himself and create glory.

767
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,040

I did it!

790
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,390
Great, son!

791
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:16,600
Good job! Good job!

792
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,470
Our family finally gets rid of the name

793

"forever No.2"!

794
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,360
Perfect!

795
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:21,470
No matter where you are,

796
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,430
you are the best.

797
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,150
You helped

798
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,560
make this champion,

799
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,630
and now I'm giving it to you,

800
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,670
and good luck to you.

801
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:31,760
Thank you.

802
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:37,560
He is no longer your little brother now.

803
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,120
But you still got me.

804
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:39,520
I'll hug you.

805
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,710
Why would I do that?

806
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:44,910
You don't have abs.

807
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:45,630
Why would I hug you?

808
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:46,800
Of course I have.

809
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,520
Your brother won't hug you, so I …

810
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,360
What is this?

811
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,430
You tell me.

812
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:51,430
Don't thank me.

813
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:52,430
Thank the pendulum ride.

814
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,630
He got the champ,

815
00:36:58,630 --> 00:36:59,800
and a girlfriend.

816
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:02,000
I have to say,

817
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,430
if it weren't for your employees,

818
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,560
I could probably swim

819
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,870
two seconds faster.

820
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:10,000
Come on,

821
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,670
music!

822
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:12,560
(Qian Chuan is the best. Good luck!)

823

I'll let you hear how good we are.

824
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,120

827
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,150
- Surpass Sun Yang!
- Surpass Sun Yang!

828
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:37,120
We got two pieces of good news.

829
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,040
First, congratulations to my son for

830
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,230
being selected for the national team.

831
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,230
Thanks, Dad.

832
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:43,230
The national team!

833
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,120
Train hard and

834
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,080
make your country proud.

835
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:46,520
No problem.

836
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,280
I'll do my best.

837
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,470
And congratulations to Qian Wei

838
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:52,280
and Lu Xun for starting

839
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,360
Fawei Online,

840
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,710
which will go online soon.

841
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,230
You are the first entrepreneur
in our family.

842
00:37:58,470 --> 00:37:59,670
No big deal.

843
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:00,950
We just got

844
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:01,710
the subsidies.

845
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,670
But the server is not

846
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:04,910
very stable yet,

847
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:06,430
and it still needs some modifications

848
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:08,190
and some updates.

849
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,430
Take your time.

850
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:10,280
A good start

851
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,520
is half of the success.

852
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:12,870
You're half way through it,

853
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:14,280
so keep doing the rest.

854
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:15,470
Here, here.

855
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:16,800
I'd like to make a toast.

856
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,000
Well…

857
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,320
Where did you learn this?

858
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,600
You sound like a politician.

859
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,560
OK, OK.

860
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,670
Let's just drink.

861
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:28,430
Tong,

862
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:29,710
try the soft-shelled turtle soup.

863
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:30,800
I made it especially for you.

864
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,760
It took me four hours.

865
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:34,800
The soft-shelled turtle
was getting anxious.

866
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,630
That's when I turned off the heat.

867
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:37,800
Come on.

868
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:39,560
The meat is rich here.

869
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,520
Here.

870
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,430
It's hot.

871
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:43,000
The children are watching.

872
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,560
So what?

873
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,390
Sooner or later, we'll be a family.

874
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:47,360
Let him get used to

875
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,360
our family's style.

876
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,390
I'm getting the hang of it.

877
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:50,670
Sanhuang Chicken.

878
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:51,560
Here, Qian Wei.

879
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,600
Try it.

880
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,710
No cilantro.

881
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:54,470
The way you like it.

882
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:56,710
I can eat by myself.

883
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,360
Try it.

884
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:02,320
No one cares to

885
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,430
introduce the dish to the champion?

886
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:05,040
Don't eat that much.

887
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,230
I've never seen any athlete

888
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:07,520
eat as much as you do.

889
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,190
Oh, right.

890
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:10,190
Liu sent me a message

891
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,390
saying she passed the second major exam.

892
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,150
Why didn't you ask her

893
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,560
to come home with you?

894
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,710
She told me as soon as

895
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:15,600
she got the notice.

896
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,600
To celebrate,

897
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,800
the two of us have tried

898
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,520
all kinds of the rice noodles

899
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,520
in the restaurant.

900
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,320
See?

901
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,470
Ever since he has Liu,

902
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:24,600
his sister becomes less
important for him.

903
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,000
Listen.

904
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,520
Next time before
you go to closed training,

905
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,950
bring Liu here.

906
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,150
We have six people in our family,

907
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:31,870
and only one more is not presenting.

908
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:33,520
OK.

909
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:35,870
Oh, right, Wei.

910
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:36,630
You should be preparing for

911
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:38,470
the National Bar Examination
this semester, right?

912
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,740
(2014 National Bar Examination,
Haizhou Examination Area)

913
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,060
(Exam admission ticket)

914
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,910
I'll take it next year.

915
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:00,800
Why?

916
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:01,710
Why?

917
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:06,710
Haven't you heard of it?

918
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:08,360
The mechanism of this exam is that

919
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,040
one year is hard and one year is easy.

920
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,000
It just so happens that

921
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,560
this year is hard.

922
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:14,840
I don't want to compete so hard.

923
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,430
So I think

924
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:18,280
I should take the exam next year.

925
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,840
It will be easier.

926
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,950
I can get

927
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:21,800
the best score.

928
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,760
Maybe get the first place in the school.

929
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,390
Besides,

930
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:25,040
my father

931
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,230
just got out of surgery, right?

932
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:27,670
I can spend more time with him

933
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:28,800
and make him

934
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,870
this turtle soup

935
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:31,600
that he loves.

936
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,150
You're hesitant.

937
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:35,840
It's not like you.

938
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,230
Stop worrying about her.

939
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:44,280
She's his problem now.

940
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,950
Just worry more about

941
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:47,710
where and how we're going to play

942
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,360
on our first stop.

943
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,080
The most important thing is Dad

944
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:54,840
can go through September safely.

945
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,190
Lu Xun can take the advantage this time

946
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:57,040
and be the number one.

947
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,390
After this is over,

948
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:00,800
I'll go create

949
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,950
the highest score in Guanghua's history.

950
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:05,430
