00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:20,870
Hello.

3
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:22,440
Are you looking for me?

4
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,840
If you want to save Qian Wei,

5
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:26,950
come to this place.

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,470
Hello?

7
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:30,550
Lan He!

00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,500
(Hualai Port)

00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:37,840
(Qian Wei,)

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,950
(hope you're still safe.)

11
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,380
(I want 1,000 eyes of the eternal night
to set my eyes on you only.)

12
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,300
(Mr. Tao)

13
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,630
(What do you think of my car?)

14
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,310
(I used it)

15
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,190
(to successfully propose to my wife.)

16
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,760
(Hope it'll bring you good luck.)

17
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,680
Qian Wei!

18
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,190
Qian Wei!

19
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,080
Qian Wei!

20
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:30,960
Qian Wei.

24
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,320
What do you want?

25
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,910
Tell me where Qian Wei is!

26
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,670
Why are you still caring for her?

27
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,000
When she put you in danger

28
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,830
and collected the evidence
for the police,

29
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,040
did she care for you?

30
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,880
She isn't here.

31
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:34,790
She isn't?

32
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,160
Then why did you lie to me?

33
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:41,550
If I hadn't lied to you,

34
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,790
would you leave with me?

35
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,640
I'm trying to save you.

36
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,040
I don't need that.

37
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,600
I'll surrender myself to the police.

38
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,040
Just for Qian Wei?

39
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,350
To give her a good case,

40
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:00,920
you'll destroy a company

41
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,440
that will have its IPO soon

42
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,880
and even ruin your own future?

43
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:08,760
Yes.

44
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,160
Just because of Qian Wei,

45
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,920
I got myself back.

46
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,550
So, I didn't come today

47
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,550
only for her,

48
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:19,790
but also for myself.

49
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,760
What about me?

50
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,440
You...

51
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,760
Go back with me.

52
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:45,550
We can have a new start.

53
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,350
You asked me

54
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,790
whether I would get off the bus

55
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,040
if we went back to the day

56
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:55,920
we met for the first time.

57
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,350
I wouldn't.

58
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,000
But I would drive the bus

59
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,070
towards the right direction.

60
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,320
Unfortunately, in this world,

61
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,200
there are no ifs.

62
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:17,440
But fortunately,

63
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,480
the bus stops at every station.

64
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,110
When it stops,

65
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,320
we still have a chance to get off.

66
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,040
Even you're asking me to give in?

67
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,830
Aren't you

68
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,160
doing the same thing

69
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:45,790
just as my father and brother?

70
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:54,000
I gave you a chance

71
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,320
to get away unscathed.

72
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,600
But you betrayed me.

73
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,480
Like I said,

74
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,070
no one in my way

75
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,110
can survive.

76
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,830
If I can't get something,

77
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:05,920
I'll destroy it

78
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,200
and let no one else get it!

79
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,200
If I lose,

80
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,230
no one else can win.

81
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:14,920
What does that mean?

82
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,720
Qian Wei died.

83
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,720
In a car accident.

84
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,000
Li Chongwen will die, too.

85
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,320
In the sea

86
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,070
during his escape.

87
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,500
(Marry me)

88
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,740
(I want 1,000 eyes of the eternal night
to set my eyes on you only)

89
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:48,910
I love you.

90
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:06,840
This is where I was hit.

91
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:18,880
Hello.

92
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,670
Is that Yuhua Club?

93
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,400
I reserved a room in your club

94
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,760
for 8:00 PM tonight.

95
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,150
Please tell Miss Lan

96
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,910
that I've brought everything

97
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:29,960
and I've arrived, too.

98
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,350
But I'm a little bit timid.

99
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:34,080
If she wants it in good faith,

100
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,030
come out and talk with me.

101
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,840
I don't have the evidence now.

102
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,230
I've called the police.

103
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,230
If you surrender now,

104
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,150
this will only be an attempted crime.

105
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,200
(I didn't expect Lan He
to have lost her mind.)

106
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:42,350
(I won't let her get what she wants.)

107

108
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,000
911?

109
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:57,960
I'll report something.

110
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,200
(Before I met you,)

111
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,840
(I loved to be a loner.)

112

296
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,160

341
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,560
related to this case.

342
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,470
May I answer her?

343
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,160
Yes.

344
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,520
I'm a lawyer.

345
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,040
A lawyer isn't a god.

346
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,830
I am

347
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:30,880
an ordinary

348
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,040
and insignificant guy.

349
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,590
I can't be omniscient.

350
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,640
I can't save people.

351
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,280
I like a good reputation.

352
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,880
In the face of oppression,

353
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,760
I'm also nervous.

354
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,880
And I feel scared.

355
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:50,040
For life, I also

356
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,040
want money,

357
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,590
sway, shrink back or be greedy.

358
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:56,280
Even the darkest side

359
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:56,680
of human nature

360
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,160
sometimes takes root

361
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,520
in my heart, too.

362
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:02,160
If you ask me

363
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,760
what I've learned from the law,

364
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,920
when the darkness of human nature

365
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,950
fights against the goodness,

366
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:11,710
my belief

367
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:12,920
in the justice of law

368
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,800
can support me

369
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,520
in sticking to the bright side.

370
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,830
Even if I'm badly battered,

371
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,710
I must still figure out what is true

372
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,280
and what is just.

373
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,760
That's all.

374
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:25,680
And this is my answer.

375
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,430
What you find cumbersome

376
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:29,920
turns out to be

377
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,680
my indispensable faith.

378
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,760
You'll never understand that.

379
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,430
I do solemnly swear

380
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,160
I do solemnly swear

381
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:40,190
(Think Wisely and Practice Carefully)
I'm dedicated to the practice of law.

382
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,920
I'm dedicated to the practice of law.

383
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,800
I'll support and obey the laws.

384
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,800
I'll uphold justice.

385
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,710
I'll battle evil.

386
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:51,830
I'll maintain law and order.

387
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,710
I'll adhere to humanity.

388
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:55,590
I'll contribute to legal culture.

389
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:57,760
I'll fight for the cause of socialism

390
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,160
and the progress of mankind

391
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,190
(Guanghua University)
all my life.

392
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,760
I will give an honest testimony

393
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,070
without a disguise.

394
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:05,830
If I break my promise,

395
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:07,800
I'm willing to be punished by law.

396
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,020
(Defendant)

397
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,820
(Defendant)

399
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:19,000
accused of homicide.

400
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:21,280
Considering her attempted crime,

of political rights for two years.

404
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,430

405
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,000
and the circumstances were serious.

406
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,160

did the crime of money laundering.

415
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:52,680
For the sake

416
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,040
that they performed deeds of merit,

417
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,590
admitted their crimes and regretted,

(or be returned to related victims.)

436
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:40,160
Everything will be all right.

You're right.

I should thank you.

441

The sun is shining brightly.

442
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,040
Songs ring out.

443
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,280
(Mr. Lu Xun & Ms. Qian Wei, Oct. 15, 2023)
We laugh happily.

444
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,710
(Mr. Lu Xun & Ms. Qian Wei, Oct. 15, 2023)
And good luck floods over us.

00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:21,430
On such

446
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:22,590

a happy day,

00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:24,000
(Welcome to our wedding)
let's welcome the bride and groom

448
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,680
to make their brilliant appearance!

449
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:26,880
This...

450
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,400
I don't need this.

451
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,950
Talk a little bit less.
Don't waste electricity.

452
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:32,110
Come on.

453
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,590
When the wedding officially starts,
you mustn't...

454
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:34,280
Move aside.

455
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:34,920
Don't stand in the way.

456
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,070
Come on.

457
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,190
What are you doing?

458
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,230
You're behaving

459
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:39,950
as if I were the only redundant guy.

460
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:41,190
You mustn't behave like this later.

461
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:43,280
Is it because you're nervous?

462
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,430
Don't be nervous.

463
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:47,310
Is Qian Wei crazy about the regimen?

464
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:49,070
Wolfberries for the wedding?

465
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:50,160
She should have used the sesame.

466
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:50,880
It's at least good for hair growth.

467
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,800
Idiot.

468
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,640
These are red beans,

469
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,680
instead of wolfberries.

470
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,470
Naff guy.

471
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,160
You'll see my sister soon.

472
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,920
She won't fly away.

473
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:04,710
Mind your image, will you?

474
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:05,280
Don't...

475
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:07,230
What's wrong with my image?

476
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:08,680
What's wrong with it?

477
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:10,590
We're wearing the same tie.

478
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:11,760
What makes you criticize me?

479
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,110
What can Boss be up to?

480
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:13,830
He just wants

481
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,760
to show his loyalty all the time.

482
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:17,920
What are you talking about?

483
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,110
What?

484
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:20,680
Here's the thing.

485
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:20,950
I'm going...

486
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:22,680
I'm going to change the tie.

487
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,280
I can't tie it.

488
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:24,230
Qian Wei can tie it.

489
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:24,590
She usually ties it for...

490
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:25,400
Stop talking nonsense.

491
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:26,800
You and I...

492
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,400
We've known each other for 11 years.

493
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:30,560
Why can't you just

494
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,110
let me see her?

495
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:31,710
You know what?

496
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:32,430
Let me see her

497
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,190
and I will take care

498
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,070
of all your lawsuits.

499
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,760
Love indeed makes people stupid.

500
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:39,680
Lu Xun,

501
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,470
I'm Qian Wei's close friend.

502
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:43,070
Even if I don't let you see her,

503
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,520
you still have to take care

504
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,590
of all my lawsuits.

505
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,640
Bear for a moment.

506
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,190
If you see her in advance,
there'll be bad luck.

507
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:49,640
You know what?

508
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,400
Li Chongwen...

509
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:52,760
I heard

510
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,470
that he had a wedding present

511
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:55,560
delivered to Qian Wei.

512
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,280
If I don't check the present

513
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,070
personally,

514
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:00,520
I'll feel very insecure.

515
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,310
Got it?

516
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:03,000
If she has a wild dream again,

517
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,830
what do I do?

518
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:05,070
Oh, come on.

519
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:06,040
Qian Wei has completed

520
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,000
her rehabilitation.

521
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:08,350
She won't have wild dreams anymore.

522
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:10,000
You want to see the bride, huh?

523
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:12,400
Time to let out Mr. Wu.

524
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,710
Come on, Mr. Wu.

525
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:13,920
Come on.

526
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,230
- Why did you let out this mad guy?
- I'm here.

527
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:16,950
Liu,

528
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,430
they're getting married.

529
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:19,560
Why don't you try on the wedding dress

530
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,880
and let me have a look?

531
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,520
Come on.

532
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,310
When you want her to try on the dress,

533
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:23,830
why do you hold my arm?

534
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:25,470
Who else can he hold?

535
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,590
Let me deal with you.

536
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:28,040
They two can't stop you.

537
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,230
I knew I would come.

538
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,160
It serves you right today.

539
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,640
Let me put it this way.

540
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,400
Lu Xun,

541
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,470
before you pass my test,

542
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:39,280
you may not be able to marry Qian Wei.

543
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,920
Crazy guy.

544
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,160
I really don't want to talk to you.

545
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,280
Stop smiling.

546
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,950
Everybody knows

547
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:47,310
that Qian Wei likes red beans.

548
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:48,800
Red beans are good for health.

549
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,110
Then,

550
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:50,880
I'm going to ask you a question.

551
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,760
If you answer it correctly,

552
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,110
I'll let you in.

553
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:56,590
Why isn't the red bean named mung bean?

554
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:03,830
Time to praise me.

555
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:09,110
Where's everybody?

556
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:22,000
(A rose doesn't need to be eternal.)

557
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,560
(A short bloom)

558
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,830
(makes it beautiful enough.)

559
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,520
(I can't be with you forever.)

560
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,280
(It'd be good enough)

561
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,640
(that I accompanied you for a while.)

562
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:32,280
(Hope you'll live a happy life.)

563
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:35,380
(Li Chongwen)

564
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:41,880
He had this wedding present

565
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,760
delivered to you.

566
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,800
Don't be sad.

567
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,800
He's preparing
for a doctor's degree in prison.

568
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,520
Like I said,

569
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,830
a man like Li Chongwen

570
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,640
will be outstanding wherever he is.

571
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:57,430
When he finishes his doctor's degree,

572
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:58,520
he'll be released

573
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,950
and have a new start, right?

574
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:04,560
Lu Xun is so anxious out there.

575
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,710
He tries hard to get in and peek at you.

576
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:06,680
I was stopping him.

577
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,470
He mustn't come in.

578
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,110
You know what?

579
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:10,560
You must stop him.

580
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,000
I'll count on you when the groom comes.

581
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,590
Don't worry.

582
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:14,190
I'm good at tricking the groom.

583
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:19,760
You look so beautiful.

584
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,190
I suddenly don't want you
to get married.

585
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,040
Don't say that.

586
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,280
How about this?

587
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,590
You find the dress gorgeous, right?

588
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:32,160
Put it on, too.

589
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,000
Let's get married at the same time.

590
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,310
The four of us.

591
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:36,920
No, no.

592
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,430
Forget it.

593
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:38,920
Come on.

594
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,560
You just said it was a gorgeous dress.

595
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,160
You regretted it so soon.

596
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:42,760
I didn't regret it.

597
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,280
I'm just scared of marriage.

598
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,760
Marriage would be scared of you.

599
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,070
I'm serious.
I'm scared of having babies.

600
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:51,880
Think about it.

601
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,590
You and Qian Chuan...

602
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:53,800
You're twins, right?

603
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,280
Then your family

604
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,710
has the genes of twins.

605
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,310
If I'm pregnant,

606
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:59,190
I'm likely to have twins.

607
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,280
I may even have two pairs of twins.

608
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,640
If I'm pregnant for the third time,

609
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,680
I'll have six children.

610
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:05,470
How fat will I be?

611
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,880
I haven't made enough money, right?

612
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:09,680
After all the trouble,

613
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,230
I finally no longer need
to be nagged by my parents.

614
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,310
Before I enjoy the freedom,

615
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:13,430
I'll be trapped

616
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:14,470
by so many children.

617
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:14,920
Stop, stop.

618
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,000
What are you thinking of?

619
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:18,160
Your parents,

620
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,640
masters, and disciples

621
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,800
have all failed to restrain you.

622
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,230
What?

623
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:21,920
If you have children,

624
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,070
you'll be the reincarnation
of the tiger killer?

625
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:23,680
But...

626
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,520
When the tiger killer...

627
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,310
When he killed the tiger,

628
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,280
he was single, right?

629
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,230
Did he need to hold the babies?

630
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,470
Did he need to change their diapers?

631
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:34,640
Can you and Lu Xun

632
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,880
change diapers for babies?

633
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:39,040
All right. Stop.

634
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,160
I won't have so many babies.

635
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,230
I'm not the matryoshka

636
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,680
that has a lot of smaller dolls.

637
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:45,800
Think about it.

638
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,110
When you're pregnant,

639
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,680
you'll have to be on maternity leave.

640
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,470
After the maternity leave,

641
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:50,310
your lawyer's license

642
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,920
will be postponed.

643
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:54,160
And after giving birth,

644
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:55,590
you have to nurse the baby.

645
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:56,760
You must do it

646
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,710
every three hours.

647
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:00,230
But sometimes,

648
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:01,560
the court trial lasts eight hours.

649
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:05,430
How can you be in court?

650
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,520
You can hardly
do the fieldwork, either.

651
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,040
Stop. Stop.

652
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:07,830
Say no more.

653
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:08,430
Go... Go out.

654
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:09,040
The groom is coming.

655
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:09,800
Go. Hurry.

656
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,400
Hurry. People are waiting out there.

657
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:11,880
Fine.

658
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:39,350
Mom is back.

659
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:40,280
Don't you come and hug her?

660
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:40,640
Mom.

661
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,110
Mom.

662
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:41,950
I'm coming to you.

663
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:42,680
Mom.

664
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,590
Be right there.

665
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:46,280
Mom.

666
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:46,880
One.

667
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,310
Mom.

668
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:48,920
Two.

669
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,280
Give me a hug, Mom.

670
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:50,880
Three.

671
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,230
Four.

672
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,160
Hug me.

673
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,760
How many children do we have?

674
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:57,950
Have a guess.

675
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:09,920
In front of you,

676
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,280
here's a lucky draw box.

677
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,880
As the compere, I propose

678
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,430
that Qian Chuan can draw it first.

679
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,070
Good.

680
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:19,880
They're doing the lucky draw peacefully.

681
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,920
That's good.

682
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:22,470
Qian Chuan is a junior.

683
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:23,040
Why can he draw it

684
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,350
before us?

685
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,470
Lu Xun's mother and I...

686
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:26,560
And Qian Wei's mother...

687
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,560
Two draws for each of us.

688
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,520
No problem, considering you're elders.

689
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:30,950
Come on.

690
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:32,710
My sister hasn't drawn it yet.
Don't cheat.

691
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:33,560
Swimming is good.

692
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,000
- That's right.
- Isn't it, Mom?

693
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,640
What's the problem with photographing?

694
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,590
It's okay, too.

695
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:38,920
I wrote two votes, anyway.

696
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,830
If someone gets hurt,

697
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:41,280
he can take the treatment
in our hospital.

698
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,400
We end up in a stalemate.

699
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,830
Let's have a further discussion.

700
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:44,070
Come on.

701
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:46,350
I'm not pregnant yet.

702
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:48,070
Why are they drawing lots already?

703
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:49,000
Lu Xun.

704
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,520
Congratulations.

705
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,160
Thank you, Mr. Tao.

706
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:53,680
Mr. Lu,

707
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,310
wish you a happy marriage
and hope you'll have babies soon.

708
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:55,880
Thank you. Thank you.

709
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,640
I'll wish you

710
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,160
a long happy life
and wish you'll have babies soon.

711
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,470
The first wish is important.

712
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:01,800
But most importantly,

713
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,920
hope you'll have babies soon.

714
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,800
We've got a baby already.

715
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,920
That Cupid.

716
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:07,710
No way.

717
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,190
I have to check it out personally.

718
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,040
When will you go meet the bride?

719
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,120
I want to join you.

720
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:20,420
(Wedding)

721
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,000
Liu, Liu.

722
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,560
Open the door!

723
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:28,040
Bad news. Qian Wei is gone.

724
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,600
Only her ring is left in the room.

725
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:31,630
You know what?

726
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:32,390
The bride and the groom

727
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:33,230
have the same temper.

728
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:34,710
When I was

729
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:36,000
tidying up the lucky draw box,

730
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,710
Lu Xun disappeared, too.

731
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,470
He is also gone?

732
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,360
What do we do, then?

733
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,190
Shall we get married instead?

734
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,080
Nonsense.

735
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,320
What are you talking about?

736
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,430
Get married instead?

737
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:52,360
At such a critical moment,

738
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,150
why are you still daydreaming?

739
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:55,280
I guess,

740
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,840
you must have said something wrong

741
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,910
and disturbed them.

742
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:03,080
- I didn't.
- I didn't.

743
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:19,910
Bride,

744
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,360
are you running away from the wedding?

745
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:22,800
No, no, I...

746
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,630
I'll go check the future

747
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:24,360
and come back soon.

748
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:26,230
Future?

749
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:27,910
Where is the car going, then?

750
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:28,670
I don't know.

751
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:33,470
Sir,

752
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:35,000
drive to the hospital
as fast as you can.

753
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:45,430
What...?

754
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:46,670
Why is it you?

755
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:50,190
You know what?

756
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,910
My runaway bride.

757
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:53,150
Now,

758
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:55,120
you're hijacked by your groom.

759
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,040
But...

760
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,710
How did you know I would run away?

761
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:59,670
Like I said,

762
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:01,470
I came here from the future.

763
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:02,470
I know every step

764
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:04,040
you want to take.

765
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,000
I came here,

766
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,910
just to protect myself

767
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:07,390
from losing a beautiful life

768
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,630
ever again.

769
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,520
Come on.

770
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,150
I didn't mean
to run away from the wedding.

771
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,230
I just want to go to the hospital

772
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,870
and have a dream again.

773
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:15,390
According to Liu,

774
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:15,800
our family

775
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,710
has the genes of twins

776
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:18,910
and I'll easily have a lot of children.

777
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:19,630
And today,

778
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:20,870
they will already pick the career

779
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:22,360
for our children at the wedding.

780
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,080
Could you live wisely

781
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,760
before you dream?

782
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,710
Those are presents for the guests.

783
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:29,840
How come?

784
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:31,520
The first prize is

785
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,280
the camera your mother likes.

786
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:33,840
The second prize is

787
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,230
one year's swimming card
from Qian Chuan.

788
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,600
The third prize is

789
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,360
a complete checkup
at my mother's hospital.

790
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,430
I'm sorry.

791
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,870
Then shall we...?

792
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,230
You're not driving back?

793
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:50,120
Of course, I'm not driving back.

794
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,760
There's no turning back for us.

795
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,760
We must keep moving on.

796
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,910
Guess where I'm driving.

797
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,080
I don't know.

798
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,630
The airport, obviously.

799
00:36:58,630 --> 00:36:59,670
You like to run away
from the wedding, huh?

800
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:01,000
I'll make you enjoy it.

801
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,840
Wherever we go,

802
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,630
in every country

803
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:04,470
and every city,

804
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:06,040
I'll get married to you

805
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,040
and get the marriage license.

806
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:07,600
In this way,

807
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,760
no matter where we are,

808
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,910
you'll always be my wife

809
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:12,150
and you can never get away.

810
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:15,150
You know what?

811
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,040
This is the first time I've eloped.

812
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,190
You must be responsible.

813

But this is my second time.

817
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:31,800
The younger Lu Xun is also you.

818
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,870
You mustn't be jealous.

819
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,470
No way.

820
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:36,950
Why can he do this with you too?

821
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:37,670
What have you

822
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,600
experienced together?

823
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,840
Do you have unforgettable memories?

824
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,710
Tell me about them.

825
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:42,840
There are a lot of memories.

826
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,040

833
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,280

838
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:16,820
(A few years later)

839
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:25,800
Are you awake?

840
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:29,910
What did you dream of?

841
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:30,840
You were so soundly asleep.

842
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,840
I dreamed of the 18-year-old Lu Xun

843
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,470
and the 28-year-old Lu Xun.

844
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,760
18 years old and 28 years old?

845
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,280
But they aren't as handsome as you.

846
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,150

(I want 1,000 eyes of the eternal night
to set my eyes on you only.)

866
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,230
I'm back.

867
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,190
Honey, you're back?

868
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:32,600
Come on, kids.

869
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,390
We're home.

870
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:34,040
I'm exhausted.

871
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:36,910
Here we are.

872
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:37,670
Did you have fun during the trip

873
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:38,360
with your father and uncle?

874
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:40,080
Did you have fun?

875
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,320
Aunt.

876
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,000
It was a summer camp for the kids.

877
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,080
But for Lu Xun and me,

878
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,150
it was exactly a devil camp.

879
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,280
Even a world champion

880
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:51,560
wouldn't be able

881
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,280
to take care of these four kids.

882
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,190
You have a lot to complain about, huh?

883
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:56,320
I don't mean that.

884
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,430
Honey, as long as it makes you happy,

885
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:00,150
I can even be a universe champion.

886
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,670
Dad, I want to be held high.

887
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,670
- Here you go.
- Here it goes.

888
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:11,360
Stop, stop.

889
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,230
Don't make them dizzy.

890
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,000
I have a present for you.

891
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:31,840
What, Lawyer Qian?

892
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,000
Isn't reality more beautiful
than the dream?
