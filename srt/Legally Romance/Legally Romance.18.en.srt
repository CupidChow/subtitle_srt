00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,590
"The debate team

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,200
is the most united club on campus".

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,550
This is what you told me

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:09,430
when I was enrolled
in my freshman year.

5
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:11,230
No matter whose fault it is,

6
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:12,150
the entire team

7
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,150
shares the responsibility.

8
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:14,640
If it was someone else

9
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,270
troubled by the rumor,

10
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:17,680
I'd stand up for the person.

11
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,150
Yu Tian,

12
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,760
I don't think

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,880
two girls

14
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,520
should ever be rivals

15
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,880
on account

16
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,280
of any man.

17
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,240
Is it worth it

18
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:35,950
that you lose

19
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:37,360
all your kindness and self-esteem

20
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,430
for someone who doesn't like you.

21
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,150
The reason why you oppose me,

22
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:48,720
and why you hate me

23
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,400
is that Li Chongwen

24
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,840
declined your confession of love, right?

25
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:53,880
Did Li Chongwen

26
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,080
tell you this?

27
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:55,790
Can't believe

28
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:56,990
you still claim
that you are not a two-timer?

29
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,110
Are you here to show off?

30
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,520
He didn't tell me that,

31
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,880
I guessed it by myself.

32
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,110
And I'll never

33
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,360
tell anyone

34
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,400
that you like him.

35
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,030
Li Chongwen may not like you,

36
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:09,560
but at least,

37
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,110
he didn't embarrass you.

38
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,520
Whereas you

39
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,880
emphasized that poverty leads

40
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,240
to a higher chance of being a criminal

41
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,790
while spreading the rumor.

42
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:19,390
You know

43
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:20,670
that he grew up in a poor family.

44
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:22,280
He got into a fight

45
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,710
because of this

46
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:24,880
and received a penalty.

47
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,150
I won't

48
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,200
tell him that, either.

49
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:28,840
I just hope

50
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,200
that you delete the post, end the rumor,

51
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,200
and make a statement of apology.

52
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,600
And we'll forget what happened.

53
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,390
If not,

54
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:36,430
I'll have to sue you

55
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,670
for the violation of reputation right

56
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:39,110
and the crime of defamation.

57
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,030
I'm sure you're aware

58
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,670
that with such a

59
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,200
criminal record,

60
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:43,670
you won't

61
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,030
get hired by

62
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,200
any company or law firm.

63
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,520
We both study law.

64
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,390
Don't try to intimidate me.

65
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,520
Before you asked me out,

66
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:53,840
I have

67
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,320
deleted all the posts,

68
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,640
and had my account closed.

69
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,750
I'm not responsible

70
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,200
for any others' screenshots or posts.

71
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,070
If you wish to sue me,

72
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,150
you'll have to present evidence.

73
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,600
But the civil law

74
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,670
has never acknowledged

75
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,030
online screenshots as evidence.

76
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,030
It was the judicial explanation

77
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,430
of the civil procedural law from 2015

78
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,200
that appeared in my mind.

79
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,920
According to current articles of law,

80
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,360
it is indeed difficult

81
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,750
for the court

82
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,030
to accept the records on social networks

83
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,160
as official evidence.

84
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:16,140
=Legally Romance=

85
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:23,580
=Episode 18=
=Show Off Love to the Entire Campus=

86
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,000
Don't you think you can

87
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,640
scare me with this.

88
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,310
If you don't get off my back,

89
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,470
there will be more new posts.

90
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,310
Without revealing who the thief is,

91
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,310
no one will read or believe

92
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,390
the rumor-dispelling post.

93
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:38,840
In comparison,

94
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,840
the cheesy

95
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,950
love triangle is more attractive,
isn't it?

96
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,280
You defeated Lu Xun

97
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,160
in the Vacation Skills Competition

98
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,640
because he let you win.

99
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,440
I can send a post online

100
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,110
about Li Chongwen
giving away the topic to you.

101
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,360
And if you receive a penalty,

102
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,160
I guess it'll be hard for you

103
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,440
to get the offers
from foreign universities.

104
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,360
The university won't fall for it.

105
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,110
No one will believe your false charge.

106
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:00,870
Also, Li Chongwen

107
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:01,870
never said he would

108
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,230
study abroad.

109
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,200
He always wants to stay
in our university as a postgraduate,

110
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:05,950
gain experience,

111
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,950
and open up his own
law firm in the future.

112
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,840
How did you know that?

113
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,440
I know everything.

114
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,440
Yu Tian,

115
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,230
get real, will you?

116
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,510
I used to be like you.

117
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,950
I, too, was blinded by love.

118
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:18,880
But no one will feel sorry for you

119
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,510
when you lose everything.

120
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,390
A man may abandon you,

121
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,880
but your career, your grades,

122
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,230
or your friends won't.

123
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,630
Instead of scheming

124
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,480
against me,

125
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,160
why don't you study harder?

126
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,950
Otherwise, ten years later,

127
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,510
trust me, you'll be regretful.

128
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:34,670
Don't show any mercy

129
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:35,790
to someone like her.

130
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,160
Chongwen?

131
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,230
We'll pay her back

132
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,510
in kind.

133
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,670
I'll post all the evidence

134
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:48,630
that Qian Wei has collected

135
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,950
on the Internet.

136
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,840
By then, those who judged her

137
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,950
will be your judges.

138
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,510
As for the evidence
of you framing Qian Wei up?

139
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,480
Those love letters
will be more than enough.

140
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,440
You said

141
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,110
people would be interested in

142
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,350
a cheesy love triangle, didn't you?

143
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:03,910
Those are perfect.

144
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,510
You won't be convicted

145
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,000
in court,

146
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,350
but

147
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,480
you'll get the same harm

148
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,110
that you did

149
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,720
to Qian Wei.

150
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,720
Are you seriously going

151
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,840
to do that to me because of her?

152
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,350
Yu Tian.

153
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,880
You crossed the line.

154
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,040
Yes.

155
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:27,600
I hate her.

156
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,510
From the first time I saw her,

157
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,480
I began to hate her.

158
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,560
She's interest-driven and hypocritical.

159
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:33,560
She knew

160
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,560
that Professor Zhang

161
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,040
would arrange her internship
in a good law firm,

162
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,910
and was certain that you'd

163
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,040
offer her help at the club.

164
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,160
I did all these

165
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,950
to show you

166
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:42,510
that she

167
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,880
doesn't deserve your love.

168
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,480
She deserves

169
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,720
everything she has right now,

170
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,630
including my love.

171
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,070
Even without

172
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,320
Professor Zhang

173
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,110
or me,

174
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,880
she'd still be the best on campus.

175
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,230
Because she has

176
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,070
clear goals of her own.

177
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,840
She won't harm

178
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,350
or use anyone.

179
00:05:59,110 --> 00:05:59,760
Yu Tian,

180
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,040
please take a good

181
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,670
look at yourself.

182
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,600
I hope to see

183
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,280
your clarification post tomorrow

184
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,670
and you debate team-quitting

185
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,390
application letter.

186
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,720
Do you really

187
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,910
see me as a despicable person?

188
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:32,880
Qian Wei.

189
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,350
Sorry.

190
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,630
I heard everything at the door.

191
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,320
It's okay.

192
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,110
I'm glad it's sorted out.

193
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:40,950
I'm off.

194
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:41,480
Wait.

195
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,350
Yu Tian's confession of love.

196
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,230
My plan for the future.

197
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,790
The fact that I always drink

198
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,630
red date and peanut soup
when I have a stomachache.

199
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,000
And you even gave me

200
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
the eyeglasses

201
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,040
that match the degree of my myopia.

202
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,950
How did you know all those?

203
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,480
I never told anyone.

204
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,040
I told you

205
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,790
that I'm Prophet, didn't I?

206
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,390
Enough of the Prophet nonsense.

207
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,110
I don't believe it.

208
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,790
You said you don't like me.

209
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:09,760
Fine.

210
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,560
Then tell me

211
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:12,840
why you know

212
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,440
everything

213
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,560
about me?

214
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,110
Seriously, why?

215
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,480
Even if you don't like me,

216
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:20,790
and you won't be with me,

217
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
don't my feelings for you

218
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,790
deserve

219
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:24,950
a single word

220
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,230
of truth from you?

221
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,560
Sometimes,

222
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:35,760
I think you'd better

223
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,000
not know the truth.

224
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,230
I just want the truth,

225
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,510
or I won't give up.

226
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,720
The reason why I know all these

227
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,070
isn't that I'm a prophet.

228
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,910
It's because
I've experienced everything.

229
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,720
I'm from the year 2022.

230
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,160
I'm the 28-year-old Qian Wei.

231
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,040
Come on.

232
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,040
I want the truth, okay?

233
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,950
This is the truth.

234
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:34,000
The last time we met

235
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,430
was when I climbed over the wall

236
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:36,280
in my freshman year.

237
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,990
That's why I asked,

238
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,040
"You again?"

239
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:40,800
and hit you

240
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,190
when we met.

241
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,190
What I told you

242
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,720
was all true.

243
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,280
Last time,

244
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,750
we were together.

245
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,750
But our relationship didn't end well.

246
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,510
So anyway,

247
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,630
I don't want to live it all over again.

248
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,280
You'll be someone

249
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,750
you used to hate the most.

250
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,190
You'll be selfish.

251
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,240
You'll cringingly

252
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:12,950
attend a banquet

253
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:13,720
instead of

254
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,280
sparing those who are stricken
with poverty and hunger

255
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:15,920
a bucket of rice.

256
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,990
I take a trip to the future,

257
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:18,480
and have a quick look

258
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,430
at our ending.

259
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,990
We don't end well.

260
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,550
Li Chongwen,

261
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,510
I loved you,

262
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,800
but it was painful.

263
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,920
So I don't love you anymore.

264
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,120
In a parallel time and space,

265
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:36,750
that Qian Wei

266
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,600
sacrificed all her dreams

267
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,630
and youth

268
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,920
for Li Chongwen.

269
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,600
Her time was yours,

270
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,750
but later

271
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,840
you smashed it into pieces.

272
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:52,240
So,

273
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,190
you knew my name

274
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,550
when the first time you saw me.

275
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,160
You stayed away from me

276
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,390
even though we are teammates.

277
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,550
And you always

278
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,360
say something weird.

279
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,550
You nearly got me.

280
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,190
You've been lying to me for so long.

281
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,510
You're indeed lawyer material.

282
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:19,280
Even your made-up story

283
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,430
is perfectly logical.

284
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,550
I'm not lying to you.

285
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,720
If you still don't believe me,

286
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:31,480
I suggest

287
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,680
you leave a note

288
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,950
on the message board.

289
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,040
I tried many ways

290
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,840
in order for you
to not fall for me again,

291
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,480
but it was useless.

292
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:46,950
If it sounds

293
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,720
unconvincing to you,

294
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:49,920
you can

295
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,280
treat it as my drunk talk.

296
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,870
What did that Li Chongwen

297
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,510
do to you?

298
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,040
It doesn't matter what he did to me.

299
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,750
He and I

300
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,800
broke up actually.

301
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,800
But this time,

302
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,190
at least I see your changes.

303
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:27,750
So I hope you

304
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,240
hold on to your original faith

305
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,630
and your dreams,

306
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,800
and you will become

307
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,280
that righteous, brave lawyer

308
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,840
that you wanted to be.

309
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,430
This time,

310
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,070
none of this

311
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:46,480
has anything to do with me.

312
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,600
Is it because of Lu Xun?

313
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,920
No, it's not that.

314
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,990
Even without Lu Xun,

315
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,720
Qian Wei

316
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,390
wouldn't choose Li Chongwen again.

317
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,430
I've talked a lot,

318
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,360
whether you believe it or not,

319
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,480
please

320
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,390
remain

321
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,600
principled as a lawyer.

322
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,280
I won't deny your love for me

323
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,510
or disown our past,

324
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,390
I just hope

325
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,800
you can see the reality.

326
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:35,870
Don't waste

327
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:36,950
more time on me, please.

328
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,430
Like what you said,

329
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:52,750
it's inevitable that I fall for you

330
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,990
the moment I see you.

331
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,750
But at least,

332
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,510
the other me

333
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,190
once had you.

334
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,120
So it counts, right?

335
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,750
I am not a complete stranger

336
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:10,120
to you,

337
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,750
am I?

338
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,630
I need to go.

339
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,380
(Li Chongwen wants
the best future for Qian Wei.)

340
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,630
I'll be hosting

341
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,240
the closing ceremony
of the Art Festival.

342
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,040
Qian Wei was supposed to be

343
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,360
the one who makes the concluding
speech on behalf of the law school.

344
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,480
But she has to be replaced

345
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,310
because the Students' Union

346
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:18,510
concerns that her incident
may raise a controversy.

347
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,430
Yu Tian has uploaded
a clarification post,

348
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,950
but not many reposts.

349
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,280
Time is the only means

350
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,920
to clear the air.

351
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,160
But the appraisal
of the municipal merit students

352
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,360
and the assessment of Fawei Online

353
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,800
draw near.

354
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:32,920
But the fundamental reason

355
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,990
why Qian Wei can't prove her innocence

356
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:35,600
is that she wants to protect me.

357
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,160
I thought I was fragile,

358
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,160
but when I see

359
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,360
how Qian Wei protects me,

360
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:42,040
I think I, too, need

361
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,040
to pluck up for once.

362
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,990
There's only one last hammering

363
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,630
away from the final victory.

364
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,070
Here's my

365
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:51,160
daring proposal.

366
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:53,480
Are you willing

367
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,510
to speak on stage
in replacement of Qian Wei?

368
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,780
(College Students Art Festival
Closing Ceremony)

369
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,720
It has been

370
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,280
a lively Art Festival.

371
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,070
Not only was the students'

372
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,920
spare time enriched,

373
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,190
but a lot of edutainment

374
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,990
themed activities were held.

375
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:18,480
Now, let's welcome

376
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,390
Lu Xun, the representative
of 2011 law school students

377
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,630
to get on stage

378
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,720
and make his speech.

379
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,430
Hello, everybody. I'm Lu Xun.

380
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,190
I'm honored

381
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:35,070
to make the speech
as the presentative of the law school.

382
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,510
During the Art Festival,

383
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:37,800
Crash Course for Legal Knowledge

384
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,840
was popular

385
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,040
among the students.

386
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,510
Li Si, the Outlaw

387
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,160
short video series

388
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,280
was well-spread as well.

389
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,800
But due to some recent occurrences,

390
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,600
the one who came up with the idea

391
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,070
of Crash Course for Legal Knowledge

392
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,360
has become

393
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,310
an "outlaw".

394
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,280
So, on this special occasion,

395
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:56,430
I'd like

396
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:57,870
to make some clarifications

397
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,390
for the fake outlaw

398
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,510
Qian Wei

399
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,190
to conclude

400
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,800
the closing ceremony
of the Art Festival.

401
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,840
Witness Mo Zixin, please get on stage.

402
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,600
In the theft of the jade pendant case

403
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,120
that is heatedly discussed online,

404
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,480
the real thief

405
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,190
wasn't Qian Wei.

406
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:23,880
It is my cousin,

407
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:25,480
Mo Tao.

408
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,360
You see?

409
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,720
I knew

410
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,270
she wouldn't do such a thing.

411
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,790
Lu Xun and Zixin

412
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:32,950
came up with this?

413
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,520
Brilliant.

414
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:36,840
Many

415
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,430
have mistaken me
for a girl from a rich family.

416
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,070
While in fact,

417
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,430
my family had gone bankrupt

418
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,600
when I was in high school

419
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,400
because of my father's bad investment
in the stock market.

420
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,840
For all this time,

421
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,120
driven by vanity

422
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,880
and pride,

423
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,720
I have been

424
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,120
keeping up the appearance.

425
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,430
In the singing room,

426
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,950
Mo Tao asked me for money

427
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:01,950
because he and my family

428
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,310
had an economic dispute.

429
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,000
After I refused,

430
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,790
an evil thought grew in his mind,

431
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,030
and he tried to steal

432
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,240
my friend's jade pendant.

433
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:13,000
So you agreed to Liu
that you wouldn't put it on the record

434
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,840
on Zixin's account.

435
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,910
Am I your brother or not?

436
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:17,910
Why didn't you tell me that?

437
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,070
It is for my sake

438
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,000
that Qian Wei didn't

439
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,600
clear her name with the footage
from the surveillance camera

440
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,030
and the police response note.

441
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,550
But it led

442
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:27,640
to ill speculations against her

443
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,070
from some ill-informed ones.

444
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,240
But none of those is real.

445
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:32,910
Qian Wei.

446
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,760
I'd like to say sorry to you.

447
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,520
For all this time,

448
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,190
I have been a coward.

449
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,240
But today,

450
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,120
I'd like to make the clarification
in front of everybody right here.

451
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,430
And also, thank you

452
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,880
for letting me realize

453
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,030
that I'm actually braver

454
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,030
than I thought.

455
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:58,880
From today on,

456
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,270
I can be frank and honest

457
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,360
with my own life.

458
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,910
A few days ago,

459
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,880
the one who defamed Qian Wei

460
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,430
has cleared up the rumor online.

461
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,880
But the reposts of the one
that dropped the rumor

462
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,790
were ten times as many as
that of the rumor-dispelling one.

463
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,270
The person who made things up

464
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,790
has apologized to Qian Wei.

465
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,120
But what about the ones
who spread it?

466
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,150
What's Guanghua University's motto?

467
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,240
Value morality and law.

468
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,720
Execute and inquire with care.

469
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,910
Fair judgment and critical thinking.

470
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,640
And were you

471
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,190
thinking rationally

472
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:49,270
and independently?

473
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,120
Everyone who reposted casually,

474
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,480
everyone who spread the rumor

475
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,150
like it was a story

476
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,270
should reflect on themselves

477
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,360
or even make an apology

478
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,520
for their indifference,

479
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,430
selfishness,

480
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:02,150
and irresponsible words and actions,

481
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,150
shouldn't they?

482
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,670
We law school students

483
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:08,670
undertake the burden

484
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:10,070
of the progress of the legal system.

485
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,640
We are to be

486
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,840
fairer, more sympathetic,

487
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,310
insightful, and sensible than others.

488
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,120
If we

489
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,480
don't even check the authenticity,

490
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,760
and be responsible
for our words and actions,

491
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,720
who will be

492
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,070
defending the force
of law in the future?

493
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,640
Who can say

494
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,520
that they won't

495
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,640
be the next Qian Wei?

496
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,190
In the future when the legal system
is ever-progressing,

497
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,150
the reputation right of a citizen

498
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:33,400
shall be better defended.

499
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,720
The network real-name system

500
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,360
shall be implemented.

501
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,950
Rumormongers,

502
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:40,430
those who stir up public opinions,

503
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:42,790
and the platforms
that allow the spread of rumors

504
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:45,150
shall be held accountable.

505
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,310
Any trace left

506
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,600
on the Internet,

507
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,240
even if it's deleted,

508
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,670
shall serve as evidence.

509
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:53,640
(Lu Xun, your vision)

510
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,520
(will soon be realized.)

511
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,720
Crash Course for Legal Knowledge

512
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,000
may be over someday,

513
00:20:58,670 --> 00:20:59,760
(Completion Summary)
but the law never ends,

514
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,360
justice forever exists.

515
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,360
I hope it's an encouragement
for all of us

516
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,400
to prevent us from becoming an outlaw,

517
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,640
or an insignificant drop of snow

518
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,360
that adds up to an avalanche.

519
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,150
Actually,

520
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,310
having experienced this,

521
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,000
I have gained something else.

522
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,640
My previous plan for life

523
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,950
was to be a judge.

524
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,480
But now

525
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,360
I find out that I cannot accept

526
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,270
waiting.

527
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,640
I have to defend

528
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,120
what I love at once.

529
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:34,880
Qian Wei,

530
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:36,640
thank you

531
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,120
for letting me find my aspiration.

532
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:41,950
I'm certain that I will become

533
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:43,000
a good lawyer.

534
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,640
I'll safeguard

535
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,760
the world and the ones

536
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,550
I love with law.

537
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:53,120
This is all

538
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,120
for my speech.

539
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,600
Thank you.

540
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:06,150
Bravo.

541
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,720
This is outrageous.

542
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,150
I know Qian Wei
always acts outrageously.

543
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:27,550
How can

544
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,480
Lu Xun act this way as well?

545
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,240
She's a bad influence.

546
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:31,240
I tell you what.

547
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:31,640
This is

548
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,120
"Bad influence leads one's way",

549
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,120
no, "Bad influence leads one astray".

550
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,310
Actually, my opinion is,

551
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,430
finding aspiration,

552
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,880
learning how to love,

553
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,000
and striving for love

554
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,720
are the exact

555
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,240
purpose

556
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,760
of the Art Festival.

557
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,600
So I think

558
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,400
it is quite meaningful.

559
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,720
I-I agree.

560
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,600
I, too, think that way.

561
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:52,600
You…

562
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,070
Seriously,

563
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,430
you agree to what?

564
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:55,840
You…

565
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,310
Talent is welcomed everywhere.

566
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:01,550
That was a big thing,

567
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:03,520
and you just did it without notice?

568
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,000
Are you out of your mind?

569
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:05,880
Do you know

570
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,600
it's against the university discipline?

571
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,000
You won't be nominated

572
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,270
as a municipal merit student.

573
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:11,720
I don't care.

574
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,880
Lu Xun,

575
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:17,520
you're too opinionated.

576
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,720
It'll be bad for you

577
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,000
when you're out of university.

578
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,760
You chose the law school

579
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,600
because you are going to be a judge.

580
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,400
Now you make a change randomly?

581
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,670
You think

582
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:28,430
you are doing this for love

583
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:29,600
and that it proves you're a real man,

584
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,150
right?

585
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,480
I tell you what,

586
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,310
you'll regret

587
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,760
changing your aspiration for love.

588
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,070
My father

589
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,480
wanted me to be a judge,

590
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,910
but lawyer

591
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:39,640
is a profession

592
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,600
that I genuinely love.

593
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,840
A judge doesn't

594
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,950
get to choose the cases,

595
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:45,000
but a lawyer can.

596
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,360
A lawyer always

597
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,030
has the right to choose

598
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,310
whom he will defend.

599
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,640
You're bossy and stubborn.

600
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,270
Do you think you can be a good lawyer?

601
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:56,640
Lawyer is categorized into
service industry.

602
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,270
A lawyer is Party B.

603
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,430
A lawyer provides service

604
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:02,430
to all kinds of clients.

605
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:04,150
To me,

606
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:06,670
love and career are equally important.

607
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:08,640
I'll be on top of both.

608
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,640
As long as it's something I like,

609
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,720
something I choose to hold onto,

610
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,950
I'm sure

611
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,120
I can do it perfectly.

612
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,270
Because I have the confidence.

613
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,150
Also,

614
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,950
even if I am the party B,

615
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:18,950
I'll be the bossiest

616
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,190
party B.

617
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,840
(If I'm the reason)

618
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,150
(why Lu Xun chooses)

619
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,070
(not to be a judge this time,)

620
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,190
(what about his choice the last time?)

621
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,790
(So, am I doing this all over again)

622
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,880
(to change the future)

623
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,360
(or to facilitate)

624
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,790
(the development
of the predestined future.)

625
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:36,520

You know, I have a strong feeling

643
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:23,360
that what you said

644
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,480
at the closing ceremony

645
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,030

and the reposts are over 500,

650
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,430
it can be defined as defamation.

651
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,360
All right.

652
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,640
Enough of the sweet talks.

653
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,430
You don't believe me?

654
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:39,840
Fine. Let's wait and see.

655
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,120
If that becomes true,

656
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,240
you'll need to call me big sister.

657
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:44,240
Don't you think

658
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,550
I was pretty cool back there?

659
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:46,430
Do you regret

660
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:47,430
that you only signed once?

661
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:49,240
Won't you sign more,

662
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,070
for example, on the residence
registration book, marriage certificate,

663
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,030
and our kid's homework?

664
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:51,790
Enough, enough.

665
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:52,310
I got it.

666
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,910
Signed on my heart, okay?

667
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:57,600
Thank you for everything.

668
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:14,120
Go, go, go.

(Liu Shiyun Major Law
Application of the Second Major Music)

670
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:01,360
Come on.

671
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,070
Let's make a bet.

672
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,000
Let's see who can tolerate

673
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,430
Liu's deadly singing

674
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:05,520
longer?

675
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,000
So?

676
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,120
I can't take it for long.

677
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,240
I'm already dead.

678
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,120
Come, Chuan.

679
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,480
Look.

680
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,670
You know what?

681
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,880
In order to get into the department
of music composition,

682
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:19,480
Liu studies music theory in the daytime,

683
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,000
and pays to gain experience
by singing in clubs.

684
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:23,430
It hasn't been easy for her.

685
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:24,270
Yeah, I bet.

686
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:26,840
When she's off stage,

687
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,600
you mustn't criticize her.

688
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,720
Help her gain confidence.

689
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:30,880
No.

690
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,550
No.

691
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:31,910
We were only joking.

692
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:34,070
It was just a laugh between the boys.

693
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,240
But when the tigress

694
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,150
takes things seriously,

695
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,720
no one is as dedicated as her.

696
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:39,720
Come on, cheers.

697
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,450
♪Once remember♪

698
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,400
Qian Chuan, don't you

699
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,910
and Liu always mock one another?

700
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,030
Why are you defending her?

701
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:49,030
Yeah.

702
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:49,670
What's going on?

703
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:50,240
I always

704
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,840
mock her in front of her,

705
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,190
I never do it behind her back.

706
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:53,840
Is that so?

707
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,950
I see.

708
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,190
Let's drink it up.

709
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:56,720
Come on. Cheers.

710
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,030
Come on.

711
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:07,310
Good job, Liu.

712
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:07,790
Come on.

713
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:08,950
Come on.

714
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:09,840
Come on. Cheers.

715
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:15,880
I say,

716
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,030
where are Qian Wei and Lu Xun?

717
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:18,520
Did she promise

718
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,480
she'd pay tonight

719
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,070
for us helping clear her name

720
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,190
in the past days?

721
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:23,270
Where are they?

722
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:24,120
Qian Wei's birthday

723
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,240
and yours are on the same day.

724
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:25,880
You forget

725
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,720
what day it is tomorrow?

726
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,790
She was here hours ago.

727
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,720
She paid for the table,

728
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,950
and Lu Xun took her away

729
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:32,360
to get her birthday present.

730
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,070
Then you should say

731
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:35,950
happy birthday to me as well, right?

732
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:36,760
Happy birthday.

733
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,430
Come on. Cheers, guys.

734
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:39,120
Thank you for coming.

735
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:39,790
Cheers. Cheers.

736
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,190
No problem.

737
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:46,070
No peeking.

738
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:46,640
Hold on.

739
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,190
Where is this place?

740
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,950
Congratulations, Qian Wei.

741
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,360
You defeated me again.

742
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,520
You got selected
as a municipal merit student.

743
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,310
I appreciate your congratulations,

744
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,430
but why are you covering my eyes?

745
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,910
Because I've got a surprise for you.

746
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,120
When it's past 12 o'clock,

747
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,120
it's your birthday.

748
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,880
I've prepared a birthday present

749
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:07,880
that I really wanted you to have.

750
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:11,430
D-Don't you try to shock me.

751
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:11,720
I tell you what.

752
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,840
You'll be dead if you do.

753
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,310
Open your eyes.

754
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:21,900
(I wish to have a thousand eyes
of the eternal night just to see you.)

755
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:25,270
Due to a misunderstanding,

756
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,480
the light board wasn't on

757
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,400
the last time.

758
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,000
It's on this time,

759
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:33,070
and it will never be off again.

760
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,520
It is a nice present,

761
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,270
but it's stuck here.

762
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,790
I can't take it away.

763
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,310
This is the first present I got for you.

764
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:44,790
It cannot be perfect.

765
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,000
I have to make some leeway

766
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,030
for myself.

767
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:48,070
The leeway for upgrades.

768
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:48,720
Am I right?

769
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,880
So smart.

770
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:53,720
But for real, though.

771
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,950
I do have prepared a present

772
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:55,880
that you can take with you.

773
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:59,000
I learned a trick

774
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,720
from the leader of the magician club.

775
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,550
Forget that.

776
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,120
The leader of the magician club

777
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:04,880
is like a joke.

778
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,550
I learned this magic trick.

779
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,400
I will pick the sky wheel

780
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,270
from the distance.

781
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:26,640
See.

782
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,400
With this sky wheel,

783
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,190
your world

784
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:33,520
will never be dark again.

785
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:36,790
The sky wheel
will always be there for you,

786
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,430
so will I.

787
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,760
Isn't it perfect?

788
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,000
Though the honor
of municipal merit student

789
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,430
means a lot to me,

790
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:01,120
you mean more.

791
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:11,760
Happy birthday.

792
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:32,780
(I wish to have a thousand eyes
of the eternal night just to see you.)

793
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:04,150
You can't be a psycho murderer, can you?

794
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,720
There isn't a monster
inside the room, right?

795
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:08,790
How is it possible.

796
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,310
You'll see when you're inside.

797
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,310
Come. Let me take you there.

798
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,400
Are you ready?

799
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:25,270
Cupid.

800
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,360
Cupid.

801
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,880
You brought him here.

802
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:32,240
Aren't you allergic to dogs?

803
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,480
I had to.

804
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:34,840
You own him

805
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,550
at the amusement park.

806
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:36,790
I won't give him to anyone.

807
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:38,030
Look.

808
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,120
(Loratadine)
I take anti-allergen pills every day.

809
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,030
I have no choice.

810
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:44,360
You gave him to me.

811
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,480
How come you're so nice to me?

812
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,310
It's alright.

813
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,670
Fortunately, this time,

814
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,070
you're not my boss.

815
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:55,670
I didn't know being your girlfriend

816
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:56,840
can be so nice.

817
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,190
What?

818
00:32:59,190 --> 00:32:59,910
Absent-minded again?

819
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:02,480
I'm praising you in my heart.

820
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:08,640
I tell you what.

821
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,550
I must

822
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:12,670
be a very

823
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:13,670
very good lawyer.

824
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:15,480
I will fight side by side with you.

825
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,120
Our future will be better by the day.

826
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,030
I'll protect you.

827
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:20,670
I won't allow

828
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:22,030
you to be aggrieved again.

829
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,430
I wasn't aggrieved.

830
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,310
Let me show you something.

831
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:33,950
It was recently updated.

832
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:34,640
Look.

833
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,150
(The Supreme People's Court)
What did I tell you?

834
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:37,240
(and the Supreme People's Procuratorate)
Your wish comes true, right?

835
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:37,800
(have issued)
Keep it in your mind.

836
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:38,400
(The Judicial Explanation of the Handling)
Keep it in your mind.

837
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,000
(of Crime of Online Defamation)
It'll be a key point in this year's judicial exam.

838
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,400
I'm telling you right now.

839
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,120
You really are a prophet.

840
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:45,240
Sure I am.

841
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:46,550
Call me big sister.

842
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:48,030
Don't try to take advantage of me,

843
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:48,600
you know?

844
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,270
You always say
you've got good hunches.

845
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:52,720
Then what is your hunch

846
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,720
on when our foundation

847
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,790
will be approved?

848
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:57,190
You don't need my hunch.

849
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:58,520
Professor Zhang told me

850
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,000
that there'd be a result

851
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,310
within this month.

852
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:01,480
When our request is approved,

853
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,430
Wei's Online Law Studio

854
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:04,400
will be operational soon.

855
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,240
If we really want to do a good job,

856
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:05,840
we can work

857
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,480
with Women's Federation

858
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,950
and mutual-help organizations

859
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:09,790
out there.

860
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,070
Once you pass

861
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,400
the judicial exam,

862
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:13,790
get your certificate,

863
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:14,960
fulfill your one-year internship,

864
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,750
you'll become

865
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:17,400
a real lawyer.

866
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:17,750
By then,

867
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,440
you'll be sweeping every case.

868
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:23,030
I don't think I'll pass the exam.

869
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:24,360
H-Have you got anything to eat

870
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,200
in your house?

871
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:25,790
I'm hungry.

872
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,230
Food?

873
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:28,440
You want something to eat?

874
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:31,960
Alright.

875
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,070
I'll make something for you.

876
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:42,640
I've got no food at home.

877
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,120
I'll get the moon for you to eat.

878
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:45,440
What is it?

879
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,790
The same trick again?

880
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,270
You don't believe me?

881
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:49,230
Close your eyes.

882
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,790
Keep your eyes shut.

883
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,270
Open your eyes.

884
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:06,840
So?

885
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,680
It does have the shape of the moon.

886
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,400
Pretty good.

887
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:10,920
Come on. I'll feed you.

888
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,680
Are you a dog?

889
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,640
You take food away from me.

890
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:25,990
No.

891
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:27,600
It's just,

892
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,360
you know,

893
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,640
I don't need to keep my manners

894
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,790
when I'm with you.

895
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:32,680
So, whatever.

896
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,960
The rain was so heavy.

897
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,960
What if you
forgot to close the windows?

898
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,710
The floor would be ruined.

899
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:49,550
I promise I've closed the windows.

900
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:54,990
Wait, Mom.

901
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:55,710
Um,

902
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:57,750
why didn't you call me

903
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:58,310
before you came home?

904
00:35:58,310 --> 00:35:59,160
I mean…

905
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,120
We were talking about
the judicial exam.

906
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,200
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Lu.

907
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:03,710
Hello.

908
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,470
She was tutoring me.

909
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,070
We came to check things up

910
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:14,160
because we were worried

911
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,550
that I might have left the windows open

912
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:16,840
in the middle of the typhoon.

913
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,750
Sorry to interrupt.

914
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:18,640
No problem. No problem at all.

915
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:20,230
Mrs. Lu,

916
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:21,200
this is…

917
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:24,920
This is the emergency key of our house.

918
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:26,680
Qian,

919
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,400
your name has long been heard.

920
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,790
Having seen the way

921
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:32,470
you competed
in the Vacation Skills Competition,

922
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:32,920
I knew

923
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,120
that you and Lu Xun

924
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:34,920
could make a perfect match.

925
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,640
I wasn't satisfied with Lu Xun's

926
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,640
choice of becoming a lawyer,

927
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,310
but now I see

928
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:41,120
he's got a girlfriend from law school.

929
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,600
Your kid

930
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,470
will have to study law as well.

931
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:45,310
My robe

932
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:46,160
will have a successor.

933
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:48,960
Things haven't been decided yet,

934
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,960
and you're already making plans.

935
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,270
You're so pertinacious.

936
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:52,400
Miss Qian is still young.

937
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,840
You're scaring her.

938
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,920
W-W-What's wrong with that?

939
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:57,200
I'm just asking.

940
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,310
Don't feel pressured.

941
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:01,120
Do you have

942
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,030
certain expectations

943
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:04,790
for your child?

944
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:08,070
M-My child?

945
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:08,880
Not really.

946
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,990
Just be healthy,

947
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:11,840
and don't get bald.

948
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,680
Great.

949
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,070
Quit law and study medicine!

950
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,680
It's great to study medicine.

951
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,120
A doctor

952
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,750
saves patients

953
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:23,200
and gets a hair transplant
more conveniently.

954
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,600
I don't like the words of that.

955
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:25,840
I studied law,

956
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,840
see how thick my hair is?

957
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,440
Look at my son.

958
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,440
See how thick his hair is?

959
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,120
Studying law won't lead to baldness.

960
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,400
Lu Xun is studying law already,

961
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,400
whey must his child

962
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,440
study the same thing?

963
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,440
They'd be arguing
at home all day long.

964
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,600
Wouldn't that be annoying?

965
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,920
Medicine is great.

966
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:38,640
Minor illnesses

967
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:39,440
can be sorted out easily.

968
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,510
That's called nepotism.

969
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:41,750
Those who play nepotism
in the judicial departments

970
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:42,750
will be arrested undoubtedly.

971
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:44,030
I can't believe
you have no work ethic.

972
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,710
Don't lead Miss Qian astray.

973
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,030
Let's draw lots, then.

974
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:49,270
Draw lots?

975
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:50,400
Let fate make the decision.

976
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,710
Not this time.

977
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:52,440
I tell you what,

978
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,960
it isn't a small thing.

979
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,070
Your parents

980
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:55,880
are really chatty.

981
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,790
- Study medicine.
- I studied law.

982
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:59,680
- My son is studying law. So will my grandchild.
- You now know

983
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,920
why I chose law school?

984
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,510
I grew up

985
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:03,990
in a family

986
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:04,960
full of analytic conversations

987
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,030
like this.

988
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:06,960
Good for you.

989
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,270
Arguing with a woman.

990
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:08,200
Come to think of it.

991
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,960
Do you think it's fun

992
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,070
to never stop arguing with a woman?

993
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:12,360
I don't care. We'll draw lots.

994
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,680
We drew lots last time.
We'll do so again.

995
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,880
It isn't like an issue of principle.

996
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:15,750
Your son is just like you.

997
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:16,680
Dad, Mom.

998
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,360
What?

999
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:19,550
It's late.

1000
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:21,510
Shouldn't you, um…

1001
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:22,680
We should head back.

1002
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,200
Let's go. Let's go.

1003
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:23,790
The roads are slippery.

1004
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:24,510
I'll walk you out.

1005
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,230
No, no, no.

1006
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,680
You do what you need to do.

1007
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,070
Right, right, right.

1008
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:29,030
We're off.
No need to walk us out.

1009
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:31,470
We weren't…

1010
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:32,710
We won't surprise-attack you again.

1011
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:33,550
Right, right, right.

1012
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:34,470
Carry on.

1013
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:35,920
What are you thinking?

1014
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,920
Change your shoes.

1015
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,200
Bye, Mr. and Mrs. Lu.

1016
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:38,920
- Bye. Bye.
- Okay, okay.

1017
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,640
Bye. Bye.

1018
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,030
Carry on.

1019
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:44,510
Keep on studying.

1020
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:46,200
What?

1021
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:46,880
Embarrassed?

1022
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:50,070
No.

1023
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,510
That was nothing.

1024
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:52,510
I'm a big girl.

1025
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:53,470
I'm sophisticated.

1026
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,120
It was no big deal. No big deal.

1027
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:57,030
So?

1028
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:57,790
Let's get back to it?

1029
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,200
What are you doing?

1030
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,030
You'll learn

1031
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,880
the consequence of lying.

1032
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,030
Wait, wait, wait.

1033
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,510
Uh…

1034
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:15,790
Y-Y-You know what, Lu Xun?

1035
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:16,400
So, um…

1036
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,550
I think

1037
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,200
the weather is terrible tonight.

1038
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,400
So rain check, shall we?

1039
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:22,070
Rain check?

1040
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,990
When will

1041
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:24,960
that be?

1042
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,880
It will be

1043
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,310
the next time it rains.

1044
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:30,960
We-we will see each other again.

1045
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:38,160
Qian Wei,

1046
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,960
seriously.

1047
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,790
Lift the cover.

1048
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,160
Don't you know

1049
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,270
that currently,

1050
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,470
Haizhou is in raining season?

1051
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,640
Bro, my bad. My bad.

1052
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,510
I made a mistake.

1053
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:56,840
I made a mistake. I won't do it again.

1054
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,310
You made a mistake?

1055
00:39:58,310 --> 00:39:59,270
What mistake?

1056
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:01,440
I-I-I shouldn't have talked back to you.

1057
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:02,960
Yes, your toughest

1058
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,710
part is

1059
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:05,030
your mouth.

1060
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:22,470
So I

1061
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:26,230
will sleep in the study?

1062
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,440
Goodbye, Boss.

1063
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,600
If you keep staring at me

1064
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,510
that way,

1065
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:31,990
none of us

1066
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:33,200
will be able to sleep tonight.

1067
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:35,510
My bad. My bad.

1068
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:36,510
Go, go, go.

1069
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,510
Boss, bye.

1070
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:39,030
Bye.

1071
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:41,960
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

1072
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:46,790
I'm going to the study, then?

1073
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:47,470
Boss, bye.

1074
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:48,440
Boss, I love you.

1075
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:50,360
Bye-bye.

1076
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,360
Won't you think twice?

1077
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,310
Boss, bye.

1078
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:58,160
Boss, good night.

1079
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:58,600
I mean, I…

1080
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,750
I can sleep on this.

1081
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:06,400
Bye-bye.
