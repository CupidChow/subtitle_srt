13
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:21,600

Could you share with us

15
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,150
the most impressive

16
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,070
winning case?

17
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,950
It's been 11 years

18
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:30,440
since I chose to serve as a lawyer.

19
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,270
When I was in the university,

20
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,040
I thought lawyers could be

21
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,630
chivalrous swordsmen.

22
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:36,590
But later I realized

23
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:37,630
that lawyers like us

24
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:39,150
are only the gatekeepers of laws.

25
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,520
Because of laws,

26
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,360
fairness and justice

27
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,270

can be realized.

29
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:46,750
So, in my eyes,

30
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,400
the progress of laws

31
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,360

00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,570
Keep doing your handwork.

172
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:04,900
If one day,

173
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:05,690
you're no longer a lawyer,

174
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,170
you can still make money on that.

175
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:08,820
Excuse me.

176
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,170
Continue the meeting.

177
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,340
I've got something to attend to.

178
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:16,060
Lu Xun,

179
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:17,570
I don't mean to complain.

180
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,690
When you reminded Lawyer Wu,

181
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:20,780
you meant good.

182
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:21,900
But couldn't you

183
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:22,730
be nice to him?

184
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,730
When I lose a case,

185
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,410
I'll consider being nice.

186
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,500
Forget it, then.

187
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,660
I've never lost

188
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,100
even a single right defending case.

189
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:32,220
Don't worry about

190
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,340
the Morris case.

191
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,540
Count on me.

192
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,570
When the exhibits are identified,

193
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:37,940
we'll get a reply from the court.

194
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:38,850
All right.

195
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:40,690

202
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:48,100
you're working on

203
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,620
and carry forward

204
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:51,850
high-level cases.

205
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:52,570
Let's continue the meeting.

206
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:52,850
Come on.

207

in total.

211
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,780
If Lu Xun shows some mercy

212
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,940
and lets me join him,

213
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:11,500
I'll be free to take taxis

214
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,380
for the second half of the year.

215
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:20,130
You want to be free?

216
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,250
No, no.

217
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:22,940
I... I...

218
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,220
Why do I want to be free?

219
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:24,780
Right?

220
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:26,340
My time

221
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,220
belongs to my boss.

222
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:27,850
What makes you happy

223
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:28,780
will make me happy, too.

224
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,250
If you want

225
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,290
to take the plane,

226
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:31,620
I'll learn to fly a plane.

227
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,780
If you want some fried noodles,

228
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,010
I'll learn to cook.

229
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:34,780
Anyway,

230
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,930
I'll keep working hard

231
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,570
and make you free in all aspects.

232
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,180
Your breakfast...

233
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,120
(Yuanxiong)

234
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:51,860
Come on in.

235
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:02,900
Boss.

236
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,450
No way.

237
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,220
I haven't said anything yet.

238
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,980
When you start a conversation

239
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:08,930
by calling me Boss,

240
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:10,340
it won't be anything nice.

241
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,610
Hear me out.

242
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,930
For the Morris case,

243
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:20,300
we've been working

244
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,180
for extra hours

245
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,660
and obtaining evidence everywhere.

246
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,900
We're going to win the case soon.

247
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:26,900
And this year,

248
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:28,180
it's the fourth year

249
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,610
that I've been your paralegal.

250
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:30,660
I think

251
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,690
on such a special day,

252
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:33,220
shouldn't we

253
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,610
celebrate it

254
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,660
in a special way?

255
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:38,220
For example, a pay rise?

256
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,250
So, I'm thinking...

257
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:42,130
As for the lawyer's fee for this case,

258
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,100
how about...?

259
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,300
Got it.

260
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:51,370
But no.

261
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:55,220
Come on.

262
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,810
How heartless you are!

263
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:57,660
Anyway,

264
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,490
we were college classmates
for four years.

265
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,100
Over the years,

266
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,450
I've been your paralegal.

267
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:02,220
But speaking of capability,

268
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,420
my capability is universally recognized.

269
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,300
Speaking of working hard,

270
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,570
look how far

271
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:06,900
my hairline is receding.

272
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,250
My hair is falling out greatly.

273
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,450
Those post-00s

274
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:10,220
who came to work here after me

275
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,420
even got a pay rise.

276
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,490
Even post-00s have got
lawyer's licenses.

277
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:15,420
What about you?

278
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,930
Have you passed
the National Bar Examination?

279
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,420
When you haven't passed the Examination,

280
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:20,860
how do you have the nerve

281
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,860
to ask me for a pay rise?

282
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,340
Come on, I...

283
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,420
I used to be childish.

284
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,370
But I've grown up.

285
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:27,610
I've changed.

286
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:28,180
Fine.

287
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,450
You've grown up.

288
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:31,540
I charge

289
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,860
5,000 yuan for one hour.

290
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:34,780
What else would you like to say?

291
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,300
Nothing else.

292
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,100
Bye-bye, Boss.

293
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,570
Put him through.

294
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:53,810
Hello.

295
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,450
He always bullies me.

296
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:58,570
(Go west, Lu Xun!)
What a heartless boss!

297
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,220
Every dog has its day.

298
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,050
(Big Sister Liu)

299
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:02,690
One day,

300
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:03,930
I'll smash your annoying timer

301
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:04,810
on your face.

302
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:07,450
Qian Wei,

303
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:09,740
go to the court with me.

304
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:10,370
Now.

305
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:19,220
How's that possible?

306
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:20,660
On March 1,

307
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,340
I personally fetched
the character portraits of Morris

308
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,050
and had them inspected.

309
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,340
I then submitted them to you

310
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,300
with the appraisal report.

311
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,570
How can they be false?

312
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,450
This is

313
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:29,450
the result of the new judicial expertise

314
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,780
(Chief judge)
the opposing lawyer applied for

315
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,570
after you submitted new evidence
in court.

316
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,370
(Judicial Expertise Report)
The character portraits you submitted

317
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:39,250
(Statement)
doesn't accord with the original appraisal.

318
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,610
I don't know

319
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:42,540
how you kept the exhibits.

320
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,180
You're an experienced lawyer.

321
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:45,660
Why could you make

322
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,690
such a diabolical error?

323
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:47,900
I'll also tell Ruomei's lawyer

324
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,900
about the result.

325
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:51,860
If you can't submit

326
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,370
required supplementary evidence,

327
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:54,610
you have to take responsibility

328
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,130
for not adducing evidence.

329
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,860
That's impossible.

330
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,570
I was holding the briefcase

331
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:00,010
all the time that day.

332
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,130
You were there, too.

333
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:01,690
Take it easy.

334
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:02,570
Let's get back and think about it.

335
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:04,690
We get it.

336
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:05,250
Thank you.

337
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,840
(Alarm)

338
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:15,740
(Miss Qian,)

339
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,220
(a package for you at the door.)

340
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:23,450
It's finally done.

341
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,680
(The three years
Li Chongwen owes Qian Wei.)

342
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,220
What?

343
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,740
Every autumn,

344
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,860
this street is covered

345
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,370
with fallen leaves.

346
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,900
We used to be too busy quarreling

347
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,810
to enjoy the leaves.

348
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,610
Now, our firm is gone.

349
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,050
You're leaving, too.

350
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,100
Don't be sad.

351
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:23,130
I'll be away for three
or four years at most.

352
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,420
When I'm back,

353
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,220
I'll make a lot of money.

354
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:28,980
Everything is going to be all right.

355
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,560
(The three years
Li Chongwen owes Qian Wei.)

356
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:21,900
(Chongwen)
(At eight tonight,)

357
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:22,930
(don't forget our date.)

358
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:32,000
(Add a new event.)
(Reunion)

359
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,560
(Days Matter
1,472 days of separation)

360
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,040
(Lu Xun)

361
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:48,540
Hello, Boss.

362
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:49,610
(Qian Wei,)

363
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,100
(you have to do the fieldwork)

364
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,180
(the whole day today.)

365
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:53,340
(If you haven't)

366
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,860
(got on the subway yet,)

367
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,250
in half an hour,

368
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,300
I'm going to deduct your hourly wage.

369
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,450
(Well, Boss,)

370
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:00,370
(don't you remember?)

371
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,100
I asked for leave a month ago.

372
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,300
I have something private to do today.

373
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:04,780
You do?

374
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,740
Shall I ask a trainee

375
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,450
to get the exhibits

376
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,180
of Morris?

377
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,130
The commission of the case...

378
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,050
What you're saying

379
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:16,690
will not change anything.

380
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,660
I'm not...

381
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,050
I'm not money-mad.

382
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,540
Money is important.

383
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,010
But love is more precious. You know?

384
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:22,980
How precious can it be?

385
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:24,570
I was thinking

386
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,100
about letting you claim

387
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,420
your taxi fee

388
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,610
from this day on.

389
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:29,860
Sorry, Boss.

390
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:30,610
I'll be on it.

391
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,340
Bye-bye.

392
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,610
(First, go to Morris)

393
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,010
(Down the stairs of Morris, 9:15 AM)
(to fetch the character portraits)

394
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:37,930
(Down the stairs of Morris, 9:15 AM)
(and the appraisal.)

395
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:40,780
(Haizhou People's Court 11:05 AM)
(In the morning, there is)

396
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,450
(Haizhou People's Court 11:05 AM)
(an infringement case of smartphone patent.)

397
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,740
(It's a useful guideline)

398
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,780
(for the prosecution and counterclaim)

399
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:47,340
(of the Morris case.)

400
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,450
(Go audit in court)

401
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:50,250
(and take the minutes.)

402
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:52,330
All right. All right.

403
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,860
(Café in CBD 3:30 PM)
(Compare the two cases.)

404
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,490
Fine. I'll be right there.

405
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:56,250
- (Sort out the evidence and email it to me.)
- All right.

406
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:57,010
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

407
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:58,100
(And then,)

408
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,420
(revise three contracts.)

409
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:02,220
(Complete them before you get off work.)

410
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,080
(Her location)

411
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,560
(Her location)

412
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,680
(Her location)

413
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,680
(Zhongshan Rd., Haizhou, 6:21 PM)

414
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:35,490
Hello, Lu Xun.

415
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,180
When can I stop

416
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,220
working overtime?

417
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:40,370
When I have a girlfriend.

418
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:42,780
Fine. Fine.

419
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:44,130
I've emailed you

420
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:45,050
the contracts, the minutes of the court,

421
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,010
and the comparison of cases.

422
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,570
I've got the evidence, too.

423
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,010
According to the original

424
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:50,810
character portraits,

425
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,010
it's identified

426
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,370
that the characters were created

427
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:55,250
eight years ago.

428
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:58,100
I assume there won't be a problem.

429
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:00,010
(Let's stick to our plan)

430
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,300
(and submit the evidence in court)

431
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:04,460
(so that Ruomei can't do anything.)

432
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,210
(There won't be any problem.)

433
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,900
Well, Boss,

434
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:10,180
I...

435
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,250
I...

436
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:11,970
Speak properly.

437
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,300
I can balance my life and work.

438
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,010
I asked you for the leave

439
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:17,610
even a month ago.

440
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:18,130
How about this?

441
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:18,660
Let me

442
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,970
handle my problem first.

443
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:21,420
After that,

444
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,460
I'll return to the firm

445
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,780
with the evidence

446
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,250
and throw myself

447
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,010
into work.

448
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,010
I...

449
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:28,090
I feel like

450
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:28,850
I'm ready to fight.

451
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:29,300
What do you think?

452
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,460
Okay.

453
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,460
What's wrong with him?

454
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,370
(Lu Xun)

455
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:35,210
Is he possessed?

456
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:36,300
Or is he out of mind?

457
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,970
It's not like him to let me go.

458
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,970
When Li Chongwen is back,

459
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:42,940
he'll serve
as the legal director of AES.

460
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,370
To show enough respect,

461
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,780
AES has invited
many business celebrities.

462
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:47,700
You...

463
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,250
When you handle your own business,

464
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,730
you'd better take

465
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:52,010
some blank contracts.

466
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:53,970
After all,
you still get the fewest cases

467
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:54,780
for this year.

468
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:56,370
Hope you'll care about your work.

469
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:58,420
You're right.

470
00:17:58,490 --> 00:17:59,460
I'll get going, then.

471
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,610
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

472
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,300
I knew it.

473
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:04,940
A villain like him

474
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,210
would never show any mercy.

475
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,280
(AES Fusion Welcome Celebration 7:55 PM)

476
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,490
(AES Fusion Welcome Celebration 7:55 PM)
Please make an exception.

477
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,580
(Fusion Welcome Celebration)
I'll just get in for someone.

478
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,300
(Fusion Welcome Celebration)
Then I'll...

479
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:13,780
If I go

480
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,730
and change my shoes,

481
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:15,250
it will be too late.

482
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:15,970
This is the rule.

483
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,540
Is it your first time
on an official occasion?

484
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,660
I-I-I know it's an official occasion.

485
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:19,850
But...

486
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:20,490
But I...

487
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:21,850
I'm in a hurry

488
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:22,420
to meet someone.

489
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,250
Sorry, but rules are rules.

490
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:23,820
Qian Wei.

491
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,540
Long time no see.

492
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:33,820
Long time no see.

493
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,490
Hello.

494
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:40,900
This is my...

495
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:45,580
Guest.

496
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,060
She has to wear formal shoes.

497
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,090
Like I said, rules are rules.

498
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:51,610
It's okay.

499
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:51,970
How about this?

500
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,060
Get in first.

501
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,330
I'll go buy shoes in a nearby mall.

502
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:54,730
Don't bother.

503
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,820
Rules, huh?

504
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:58,250
Fine.

505
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,660
Hello, Kevin.

506
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:06,580
(Chongwen, haven't you arrived yet?)

507
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,300
(Ms. Lan is waiting for you.)

508
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,060
I've arrived.

509
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,010
I'm at the door.

510
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,610
But I'm in some trouble.

511
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:14,370
Fine. Here.

512
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:18,970
Hello?

513
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,490
All right.

514
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:22,580
Got it.

515
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:24,900
Director Li,

516
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,060
I'm sorry.

517
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,130
Come in, please.

518
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:28,610
I won't.

519
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:31,210
I don't think this is appropriate.

520
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,420
Actually, I attend such a party

521
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,700
for only once.

522
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,940
You don't need

523
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,540
to buy such a pair of shoes

524
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,660
at a high price.

525
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,420
You haven't changed.

526
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,780
You still don't like high-heeled shoes.

527
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:50,210
You've changed a lot.

528
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,370
I have?

529
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:55,900
Chongwen.

530
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:58,700
Why haven't you gone to the backstage?

531
00:19:58,940 --> 00:19:59,940
Ms. Lan is urging to see you.

532
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:02,010
Can't you see
I'm in the middle of something?

533
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,090
If Ms. Lan wants to say something,

534
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:04,180
she can say it on the stage.

535
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:06,730
It's okay.

536
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:07,370
You can get to your business.

537
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:08,540
I'm okay to be alone.

538
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,180
Don't embarrass me.

539
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,420
Is she from Zhanying Law Firm?

540
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,370
Hello. I'm... I'm Qian Wei.

541
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:15,820
Well,

542
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,300
I mostly work on civil cases.

543
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,180
Do you have a marital dispute,

544
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,010
a property dispute,

545
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:22,210
or...?

546
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:24,090
Or did you have a car crash?

547
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:25,900
Li Chongwen,

548
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,900
what are you thinking of?

549
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:29,820
Tonight, many investors and shareholders

550
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,250
have come here.

551
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:32,820
But you brought someone from Zhanying.

552
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,850
What will Ms. Lan think of?

553
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,460
Tonight, she's only my partner.

554
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,940
If Ms. Lan wants to say something,

555
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,130
leave it after the celebration is over.

556
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:47,420
Go explain to her, then.

557
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,060
Who's Ms. Lan?

558
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,970
You've never told me about her.

559
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:54,610
What does she have

560
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:56,090
against Zhanying?

561
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:57,970
She's just my superior.

562
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:02,180
The shoes suit you well.

563
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:07,250
Come to such parties with me

564
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,900
more often

565
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,250
and you'll get used to
high-heeled shoes.

566
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,700
Can they get cases

567
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,540
at such a party?

568
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,540
If you want cases,

569
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,460
I can introduce some to you.

570
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,420
Let me hold it for you.

571
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:25,300
Enjoy the food.

572
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,060
Let me hold it for you.

573
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,580
Don't bother. I can hold it myself.

574
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,250
Leave it to me.

575
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:29,700
Actually, the bag...

576
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,850
The exhibits are in the bag.

577
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,820
Mr. Li, you're neither the client

578
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,460
nor the lawyer.

579
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:40,700
I don't think you should hold it.

580
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:42,940
Lu Xun,

581
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:45,580
before I congratulate you

582
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,060
on becoming the secondary partner
of Zhanying,

583
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,130
here we meet already.

584
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,660
I hear the plaintiff Fang Ruomei

585
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:52,330
has also come to this party.

586
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,490
I guess I should come, too.

587
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:56,730
Shouldn't I?

588
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:57,700
Don't say that.

589
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,900
I'll just hold my own bag.

590
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,700
How can I have my boss hold it for me?

591
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:02,060
Feel free to talk.

592
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,010
Fine.

593
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:04,820
Your tie...

594
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,420
As you know,

595
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:07,610
my paralegal

596
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:09,130
usually helps me wear a tie.

597
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,610
But since this morning,

598
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:14,250
she has been so busy

599
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,900
that she didn't even go to the firm.

600
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,370
I'm quite helpless, aren't I?

601
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:26,850
I hear the case

602
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:27,660
between Morris and Ruomei

603
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,900
will have the first trial soon.

604
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:31,700
Mr. Lu, you look quite peaceful.

605
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:33,820
You must be certain to win.

606
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,540
That's for sure.

607
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:37,970
For this case,

608
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:40,250
I've acquired

609
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,370
very clear facts

610
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:43,300
and chains of evidence.

611
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,090
I pick lawsuits under conditions.

612
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:47,730
I'm different from you.

613
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:49,780
I pick cases upon people.

614
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:51,820
Right.

615
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,700
Regardless of right or wrong,

616
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,300
both parties have the right to safeguard

617
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,330
their legitimate interests with laws.

618
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:59,780
This is the first lesson

619
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,850
we've learned.

620
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,210
Every lawyer

621
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:03,730
wants to be a chivalrous knight,

622
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:04,970
but...

623
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:06,660
Who would care

624
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,580
about legal directors like us?

625
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:09,940
Right?

626
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,580
Well,

627
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,010
are you hungry, Boss?

628
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,610
I hear when someone is hungry,

629
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:16,300
he'll easily feel upset.

630
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,820
Would you like to stop talking

631
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:18,370
and...

632
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:19,010
And have something to eat?

633
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,130
That is

634
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:27,780
Lan He,

635
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,580
the daughter of the founder of AES

636
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,300
and the present CEO.

637
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:31,010
After she finished her work,

638
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,090
she came back to China

639
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:33,330
with Li Chongwen.

640
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:38,970
After being away from my motherland
for four years,

641
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:40,130
I'm finally back.

642
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,850
All present tonight

643
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:44,210
are old friends of AES.

644
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:45,460
I'd like to

645
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,490
thank you.

646
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:51,820
Tonight,

647
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,970
I'm going to tell you

648
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:53,700
some good news.

649
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:55,780
We have

650
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,610
successfully merged

651
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:59,700
the new game company,

652
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,700
Ruomei.

653
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:03,250
It also

654
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,940
makes up for our weak points

655
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,580
in the gaming industry.

656
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:08,900
Now,

657
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:09,970
you may have some confusion.

658
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:11,180
Recently,

659
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,900
Ruomei just

660
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,900
sued Morris

661
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,090
for plagiarism and infringement.

662
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,700
I've found the best advisor

663
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,540
for Ruomei.

664
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,940
He's Mr. Li Chongwen,

665
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,130
the new legal director

666
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,420
of AES.

667
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:39,060
Nice to meet you, everyone.

668
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:46,850
You know what?

669
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,780
Tonight,

670
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,580
the lawyers for Morris,

671
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:54,250
who are juniors of Chongwen,

672
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,010
have also come.

673
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:57,780
They try to be nice, I guess.

674
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,090
If Morris

675
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:01,660
apologizes in public

676
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:02,490
and sells

677
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:04,060
2% of the shares,

678
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,090
we don't need

679
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:07,180
to go to court.

680
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,660
What do you think, Mr. Lu and Miss Qian?

681
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:11,010
AES has barely lost

682
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,130
even a single case.

683
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,210
Yeah.

684
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,610
Why have lawyers of Zhanying

685
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:16,370
come to this party?

686
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,300
Yeah. Why did they come?

687
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,580
I'm your boss.

688
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:27,370
I'll take care of this.

689
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,060
Hello, everybody.

690
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,420
I'm Lu Xun,

691
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,540
the chief lawyer

692
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,010
for the Morris case.

693
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:41,420
Five years ago,

694
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,580
Ruomei launched its first game.

695
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,300
Because of excessive imitation,

696
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,660
Ruomei was accused of plagiarism
by overseas companies.

697
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,610
In the past five years,

698
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:52,370
Ruomei has been sued again and again.

699
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:54,130
It became more and more famous instead.

700
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:55,300
It launched games

701
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,580
faster and faster.

702
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:00,700
But this time,

703
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,420
Ruomei accused
someone else of plagiarism.

704
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,330
I'm not surprised, though.

705
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:06,940
Because the founder of Ruomei

706
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,820
once said something

707
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:08,900
like this.

708
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:10,130
"Imitation is

709
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:13,130
for better progress."

710
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:16,010
How shameless!

711
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:18,700
Lu Xun,

712
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,780
you're making a slander.

713
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,900
You can try

714
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:24,820
sending a lawyer's letter to me.

715
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,730
I take over

716
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:28,010
every lawsuit

717
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,010
with a clear conscience.

718
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,250
And I have never lost

719
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,130
even a single case.

720
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:37,130
This time,

721
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:40,130
I won't lose, either.

722
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:01,010
You said

723
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:02,610
that my interests always come first.

724
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,250
I also said

725
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,210
no matter what you do,

726
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:07,580
you mustn't get her involved.

727
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,760
(AES Fusion Welcome Celebration 9:05 PM)

728
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,370
(AES Fusion Welcome Celebration 9:05 PM)
Qian Wei!

729
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:16,800
(AES Fusion Welcome Celebration 9:05 PM)

730
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,210
This is between Qian Wei and me.

731
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,210
Let go of her.

732
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:22,600
(Fusion Welcome Celebration)

733
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:24,460
I'm her boss.

734
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,490
Give me two minutes.

735
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:44,610
What happened tonight was

736
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:45,490
quite unexpected.

737
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:47,330
I only planned

738
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:49,090
to have you celebrate my promotion.

739
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:50,780
I didn't know Lu Xun would come.

740
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:53,060
He enraged Lan He

741
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:53,610
so that

742
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:54,370
she blurted out

743
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:55,580
all the things.

744
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:56,660
Lan He and I are

745
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,820
only colleagues.

746
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:02,580
Considering the value of Ruomei,

747
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,370
AES's acquisition plan

748
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:07,300
must have started

749
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,700
two years ago.

750
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:15,090
I called you every week.

751
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:17,010
And you knew

752
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:18,700
I was working on the Morris case.

753
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,060
But you never told me

754
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,490
that you were giving advice to Ruomei.

755
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:28,300
I thought you contacted me

756
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,780
because you cared for our relationship.

757
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,610
But actually,

758
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,250
you were just fishing
for information, huh?

759
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:36,370
Oh, I understand.

760
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:39,540
No wonder

761
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,780
Ruomei managed to know

762
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:41,490
all the strategies

763
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:43,010
and chains of evidence we had.

764
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,660
We?

765
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:50,010
Do you mean you and Lu Xun?

766
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,180
"We" should refer to you and me.

767
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:03,250
Over the years,

768
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:04,010
I've been working so hard.

769
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:04,850
Why?

770
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,820
Just to be with you.

771
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,250
Now I've realized my dream.

772
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,130
I'm back to you.

773
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:10,940
Isn't it enough for you?

774
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:16,130
You have used me

775
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:17,010
in such a terrible way.

776
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:18,210
Why can you still

777
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:19,490
talk about our relationship?

778
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,940
Director Li, let me ask you something.

779
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:25,540
If the evidence I have

780
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,300
can help you

781
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,420
win the case,

782
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,580
what will Ms. Lan give you?

783
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:30,900
Will she make you succeed,

784
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:31,940
get famous

785
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,970
and realize your so-called dream?

786
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,460
Say something!

787
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:40,940
I'm the legal director of AES.

788
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:43,820
I can't decide

789
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:44,660
what company it acquires.

790
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,700
In my mind,

791
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,090
I'm thinking about nothing,

792
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:49,210
but how to make you

793
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:49,970
live a good life

794
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:50,460
and how to be with you

795
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,900
all my life!

796
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:58,780
You said

797
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,370
that you wanted to be a good lawyer.

798
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,010
Fine.

799
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,540
After graduation,

800
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:06,060
I gave up the postgraduate exam,

801
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,010
I took cases with you,

802
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:08,420
and established Chong&Wei.

803
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,060
But now you want me

804
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:10,900
to give up my own career

805
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,180
just because you can't decide your work?

806
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,180
Qian Wei,

807
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:19,780
don't mix business with private life,

808
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:20,460
all right?

809
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:22,580
This isn't

810
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,370
as serious as you think it is.

811
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,610
When you can't pass
the National Bar Examination,

812
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:27,730
you'll never have a chance

813
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:28,900
to be promoted.

814
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:30,370
If you can

815
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,610
exchange a job with 6,000 yuan a month

816
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:33,300
for some shares worth 100 million,

817
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,330
why don't you do that?

818
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,700
Why don't you?

819
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:39,490
It should

820
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:40,180
belong to us.

821
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,540
To you and me.

822
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:43,460
Now,

823
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,540
you're a mere paralegal.

824
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:45,940
So what?

825
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,180
I'll be a lawyer!

826
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:57,210
Time's up.

827
00:30:57,210 --> 00:30:57,940
You're overrunning the time.

828
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:00,820
If you still want a conversation

829
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:01,700
with my paralegal,

830
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,300
make an appointment with me in advance.

831
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:05,540
But you'd better do it

832
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,300
after we win the Morris case.

833
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:10,490
There's something

834
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:11,850
you'd better make clear today.

835
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:14,010
From this day on,

836
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:16,060
you and Lan He will be together.

837
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:18,130
Lu Xun and I will be together.

838
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,580
Why don't I know that?

839
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:26,940
I mean at work.

840
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:30,460
Fine.

841
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,130
Showing off your power, huh?

842
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,490
You even bought shoes there.

843
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:38,820
Do you think it made you cool?

844
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,210
Shoes, huh?

845
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:41,370
I...

846
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:42,820
I never like high-heeled shoes.

847
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,540
I want you to wipe the bag with it.

848
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:21,130
The exhibits are in it.

849
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:22,900
What a man!

850
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,460
I worked for you for four years.

851
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,370
Couldn't you even

852
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:26,490
defend me once

853
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:27,700
in front of my ex-boyfriend?

854
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,940
You protected the exhibits
instead of me.

855
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,460
You know what?

856
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,700
If I were drowned

857
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,730
or electrocuted

858
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:32,490
and became a ghost,

859
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:33,780
I would haunt you.

860
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:35,010
I'm your boss,

861
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:36,490
not your boyfriend.

862
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:37,820
I have no obligation to save you.

863
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,400
(Big Sister Liu)

864
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,460
(How is it going?)

865
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,490
(Are you getting back together?)

866
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:52,700
(Not at all.)

867
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:55,210
(Big Sister Liu)
(I'll work overtime with Lu Xun until I die.)

868
00:32:58,010 --> 00:32:58,580
Forget it.

869
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:00,460
I don't think

870
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,900
you should be too sad.

871
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,610
After all, you have to
work overtime tomorrow.

872
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:10,970
I'm not sad at all.

873
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:11,940
After working for you over the years,

874
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,580
I've been as hard as nails.

875
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,520
(Will you delete "Days Matter"?)

876
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,600
(Will you delete "Days Matter"?)

877
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:52,160
(Down the stairs of Zhanying Law Firm
10:55 PM)

878
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,700
What a man are you!

879
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,780
After what I suffered,

880
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,300
you still want me to brush your shoes?

881
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,060
I want you to put them on.

882
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:06,490
I... I...

883
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:07,090
Don't bother.

884
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:08,220
I'll go upstairs and...

885
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:08,980
They're new.

886
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:15,130
Can you be really so nice?

887
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,460
Don't get me wrong.

888
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,900
What if your feet are punctured

889
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:19,610
and get infected?

890
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:20,770
That'll be a work-related injury.

891
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:22,220
I'm reducing the risk

892
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,290
of making compensations.

893
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:28,850
Thank you, Boss.

894
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,200
(Block B)

895
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,600
(Office zone of Zhanying Law Firm
11:00 PM)

896
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:51,840
(Judicial expertise report)

897
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,020
Mr. Wei,

898
00:34:59,090 --> 00:34:59,900
shall we leave together?

899
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:00,980
We can share a taxi.

900
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:02,980
I have a file to sort.

901
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,180
I guess I'll sleep here tonight.

902
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:07,900
All right, then. I'll take my leave.

903
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:08,530
Take care.

904
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:09,570
All right.

905
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:23,770
When I knew

906
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:24,700
Li Chongwen took over the Ruomei case,

907
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,420
I asked you

908
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:27,260
to expel Qian Wei from the case.

909
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:29,900
How can I

910
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,050
not suspect her?

911
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,420
I know her very well.

912
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:35,810
When she's at work,

913
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,460
she'll never betray me.

914
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,700
Our surveillance videos were erased
out of date.

915
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:40,850
Without evidence,

916
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:42,260
how can you convince me?

917
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,570
Can you prove that Lawyer Wei

918
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:45,460
stole the exhibits from the safe

919
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,700
before he resigned?

920
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:48,500
He has been away

921
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,050
for half a month.

922
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:50,570
Where's he now?

923
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:51,740
Can you still find him?

924
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:53,130
Tell me.

925
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:54,330
It's supposed

926
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:55,850
to be a sure case.

927
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:56,420
But now,

928
00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:57,660
you'll lose.

929
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,260
Listen.

930
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,330
There are always solutions

931
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:02,850
to any case.

932
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:04,810
No matter what solution there is,

933
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:06,330
you have to prove

934
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,090
the originality

935
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:07,940
of the game scenes

936
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,420
and characters!

937
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:10,900
I'll go find new evidence, then.

938
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,500
I will win in the end.

939
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,130
I vouch for that.

940
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:14,020
Lu Xun,

941
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,460
why are you so stubborn?

942
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,020
Then tell me.

943
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,810
In the end...

944
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,770
When is the end?

945
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:21,850
Tell me!

946
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,290
As a lawyer,

947
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:25,850
you must be aware

948
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,570
that once the second trial starts,

949
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:29,090
the court may freeze

950
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:31,050
all the assets of Morris.

951
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:32,770
A lawsuit

952
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:34,090
may take you three years.

953
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,130
But can our client wait for three years?

954
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,770
The key evidence is lost.

955
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:40,050
How can we

956
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:41,260
explain to Morris?

957
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:42,770
How can we explain to Bar Association?

958
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,500
Then don't explain to them.

959
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:46,130
I'm the chief lawyer.

960
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,180
I'll take

961
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:47,850
all the responsibilities

962
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:49,020
and consequences!

963
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:49,980
(Lu Xun,)

964
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:52,940
(even if you want
to take responsibility,)

965
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,330
(are you able to do that?)

966
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:58,770
(Our firm can't keep a partner)

967
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:00,610
(who the clients no longer trust!)

968
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,290
Come on in!

969
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:19,130
Before the trial,

970
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:20,570
I failed to keep

971
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:21,370
or check the exhibits.

972
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:22,330
It was my fault.

973
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:23,980
I should resign.

974
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:25,770
But Director Tao,

975
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:27,740
I swear I didn't do anything

976
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,220
against professional ethics.

977
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:34,290
I'm your boss.

978
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,290
Before I ask you to resign,

979
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:37,130
you can't leave.

980
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:42,090
I am

981
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:43,530
a mere paralegal

982
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:44,530
who hasn't passed
the National Bar Examination.

983
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,420
My resignation is
the lesser of two evils.

984
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:54,330
I'm sorry.

985
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:56,850
You need

986
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:57,810
a better paralegal.

987
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,680
(Qian Wei, the paralegal)

988
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,320
(Qian Wei, the paralegal)

989
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,660
Why did you yell?

990
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,660
It's okay that you yelled at me.

991
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:20,660
When she heard it,

992
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:21,330
how did she feel?

993
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:22,050
Why didn't you care

994
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:22,740
about her feelings?

995
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:23,770
It's such a big office.

996
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:25,090
Do you think no one else can hear you?

997
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,900
I didn't know she was out there.

998
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,700
You were yelling so loudly.

999
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,700
How could she not hear you?

1000
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:29,290
Fine, fine.

1001
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:29,900
I won't argue with you.

1002
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,050
I'll just leave.

1003
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:32,370
Why are you leaving?

1004
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:33,500
This is your office.

1005
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:33,850
Right, right.

1006
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:34,610
I'll leave.

1007
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,460
(When I was traveling)

1008
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,460
(in Tibet,)

1009
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,570
(the tourist guide
recommended it to me.)

1010
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:13,740
(I paid a big price for it.)

1011
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:15,220
(He said,)

1012
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:16,940
(when you are)

1013
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,130
(in trouble,)

1014
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,220
(turn the ring)

1015
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:23,290
(and you will turn the tables.)

1016
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:24,330
Liar.

1017
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,980
It can't turn the tables.

1018
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:30,260
(Don't bet on it.)

1019
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:41,570
The ring may be false.

1020
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,370
But Dad is always by your side.

1021
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:46,260
This is true.

1022
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:57,980
I miss you so much.

1023
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:03,940
When I was little,

1024
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,050
I was eager to be

1025
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:06,260
a successful lawyer.

1026
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:08,050
But now...

1027
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:13,500
I want to help people out of trouble.

1028
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,900
But I am the one

1029
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,220
who's in great trouble.

1030
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:22,330
No one can help me.

1031
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:23,980
My daughter is strong.

1032
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,260
She doesn't need any help.

1033
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:28,980
When you lose your job, find a new one.

1034
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,050
When you lose your boyfriend,

1035
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,330
find a new one, too.

1036
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:35,850
If the worst comes to the worst,

1037
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,900
start all over again.

1038
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:46,180
How can I start all over again?

1039
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,370
I'm already 28.

1040
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:51,330
How can I turn the tables?

1041
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:53,090
Now,

1042
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,610
I don't even have a lawyer's license.

1043
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:57,260
When I worked as a paralegal,

1044
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:59,050
I lost the exhibits.

1045
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:01,050
I wonder

1046
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:02,330
if I had studied

1047
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:03,290
very hard,

1048
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:04,770
instead of messing with Lu Xun,

1049
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,220
and if I had spent more time with you,

1050
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:08,940
would I...?
