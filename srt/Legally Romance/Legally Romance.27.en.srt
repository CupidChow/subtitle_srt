1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:02,720
Wei,

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,280
I heard Zixin is back

3
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:05,070
and has hired people of your law firm

4
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:05,920
as her legal counsels.

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,360
(She's not aiming at)

6
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,110
(Zhanying,)

7
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:09,720
(but Lu Xun.)

8
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,150
(They've also arranged to)

9
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:12,880
(have a one-day tour
to the set tomorrow.)

10
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:14,470
(Don't make more trouble for me)

11
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:15,430
(at such a time.)

12
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,230
(What love triangle?)

13
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:16,840
(I tell you what,)

14
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:17,440
(at such a time,)

15
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,150
(I am not poaching;)

16
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,360
(I am digging an iron wall,
do you know?)

17
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,280
I didn't expect Zixin still hasn't

18
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:23,440
come to her senses after so many years.

19
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:28,150
I don't need you

20
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,470
to poach people for me.

21
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:32,080
I don't have improper thoughts, either.

22
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:33,240
I'm just thinking

23
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,310
since we haven't met for years,

24
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,200
we can go out
to have some river noodles

25
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:36,910
and BBQ skewers

26
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:39,430
to see if she's doing well.

27
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:41,560
If all is well with her,

28
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:44,400
I'll be happy for her.

29
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:45,950
All right, all right.

30
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:47,630
You are the Virgin Mother, OK?

31
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:48,950
I'm the one with evil intentions.

32
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:49,590
I'm gonna hang up.

33
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:50,470
I've got to hail a taxi first.

34
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:55,750
Hello?

35
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,150
Hello, Miss.

36
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:57,750
Thank you

37
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:58,880
for participating in our App's

38
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,000
prize draw for tailored taxi service.

39
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,840
Congratulations on
winning the first prize

40
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:02,630
which is a one-year voucher

41
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:04,080
for free tailored taxi service.

42
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:05,160
We are already

43
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,550
waiting for you downstairs

44
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:07,720
at the pick-up address you filled in.

45
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,120
Here, here, here.

46
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:13,950
Well done,

47
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,270
Lu Xun.

48
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,590
Playing love games with me,

49
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,270
aren't you?

50
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,510
Sending me gifts and ordering taxis.

51
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,630
One day I'll make you

52
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,000
admit you love me yourself.

53
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:23,720
Are you Ms. Qian?

54
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:24,230
Hello.

55
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:25,230
I'm Mr. Xu at your service.

56
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:25,830
Hello.

57
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:26,950
You are carrying so much stuff.

58
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:27,870
From your boyfriend?

59
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:31,590
The one in the past,
also for the future.

60
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:40,360
Lu Xun,

61
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,910
what exactly is your relationship

62
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,310
with Miss Mo at the moment?

63
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,080
Work relationship.

64
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,510
I see.

65
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,400
You don't want to be Cool Visitor's

66
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,270
legal counsel

67
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,270
because you don't want to
make Qian Wei jealous,

68
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:57,830
right?

69
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,720
I don't know what you are talking about.

70
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,480
By the way,

71
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:03,190
during the month of Qian Wei's

72
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,590
hospitalization with suspended pay,

73
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,440
she took the case.

74
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,480
The commission is still to
be paid to her.

75
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,550
At a ratio of 8 to 2.

76
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,390
You push her away on the surface

77
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,600
while being kind to her

78
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,030
secretly behind her back.

79
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,440
Aren't you tired

80
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,520
from being two-faced?

81
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,830
Instead of beating about the bush,

82
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:19,240
why don't you

83
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,550
tell her outright

84
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:21,830
"I like you.

85
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:22,440
I love you.

86
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,160
I need you.".

87
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,080
That's all.

88
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,520
You just know nothing at all.

89
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,000
The love I want

90
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,160
does not come through
courtship and adulation;

91
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,670
rather, it's through mutual attraction.

92
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:34,960
I hope

93
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,390
she doesn't know forever

94
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,600
what I did for her.

95
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,030
I don't want her

96
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:38,910
to choose me

97
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:39,520
because she's moved

98
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,240
or because of pity

99
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,190
or compassion.

100
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:41,960
Do you get it?

101
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,670
What I want…

102
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:46,750
What I want is

103
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,550
the affection that comes from the heart

104
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:49,750
and the love that comes from the heart.

105
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,360
I'd rather not have it if there is none!

106
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Lu Xun, Lu Xun,

107
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,830
in your work,

108
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,190
whatever big names

109
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,110
and big clients you face,

110
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,360
you've never backed away.

111
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,000
How come you become so lame

112
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,000
and coy

113
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,110
when it comes to a relationship?

114
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,830
For the predestined bond between people,

115
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,720
a miss is as good as a mile.

116
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,110
Has it ever occurred to you

117
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:22,960
if you push her away

118
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,670
just when

119
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:24,960
she begins to have feelings for you,

120
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,030
maybe in the future

121
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,750
you'll really have no future.

122
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:44,300
(Let me see you home.
We can talk about the case on the way.)

=We Are Not Together=

126
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,270
Instead of staying in the office,

127
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,880
(Filming in Progress No Photos)
you insist on doing legwork with me.

128
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,920
Don't I also want to

129
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,880
do something for Zhanying?

130
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:06,950
What have you done?

131
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,270
As a partner,

132
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,670
I have to drive you, my assistant.

133
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:10,920
What contributions have you made?

134
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,440
I need to brief Zixin.

135
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:13,950
Besides,

136
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,440
you're a good driver
and I'm an eloquent speaker.

137
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,760
We each have different specialties.

138
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,070
Let's get in first.

139
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,110
Please show your credentials.

140
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,880
OK. You two can get in.

141
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,550
Let's go.

142
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,510
Wait a minute.

143
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:27,390
You can't get in.

144
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,440
The filming crew told me

145
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,510
we'd have two visitors only.

146
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,200
Without a credential, you can't get in.

147
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,440
This is our regulation here.

148
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,320
No, we are a team.

149
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,640
We only look at credentials, not people.

150
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,070
These years, I tell you what,

151
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,070
there are so many stalking fans

152
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:41,790
who pose as staff members

153
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:42,200
to sneak in.

154
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,070
Who's gonna be responsible

155
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:43,830
if anything goes wrong, you or me?

156
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,270
It's my fault.

157
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:45,760
I didn't know

158
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,670
Qian Wei would come,

159
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:47,790
so I didn't inform them.

160
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:48,440
Let's do it this way.

161
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,110
The producers

162
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:49,760
are staying nearby.

163
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:50,720
I'll give them a call

164
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,830
and ask them to send a credential here.

165
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,040
Forget it, forget it.

166
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,040
Don't bother.

167
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:54,950
Leave it to me.

168
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:55,790
Here, hold it for me.

169
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:58,350
Let me tell you,

170
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,880
she works for me.

171
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:01,920
She's my assistant.

172
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,790
Then

173
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,000
I'll let you keep

174
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,670
my lawyer's license.

175
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:11,980
(Lawyer's License
People's Republic of China)

176
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:12,880
I'll take her in

177
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,000
and paste this on her back.

178
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,760
When we come out

179
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:15,270
after getting our business done later,

180
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,000
you can

181
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,160
give the license back to me again.

182
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:18,440
OK. Get in.

183
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:19,390
Thanks.

184
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,110
Let's go.

185
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:21,600
This way.

186
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,670
(I'm watching you.)

187
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,110
(Today I'll never make trouble)

188
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:25,880
(when you guys are talking about work,)

189
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,000
(but I'll be the resistance)

190
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,760
(if you are flirting.)

191
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,260
(Lu Xun's Assistant)

192
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,880
Everybody must hurry up.

193
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,830
We've only rented this place

194
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,640
for half a day.

195
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,270
Mr. Han,

196
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:36,950
you see,

197
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,230
it's been two weeks
since the shooting started.

198
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,480
A lot of the staff members

199
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,230
haven't got paid yet.

200
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:40,880
You see…

201
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,510
Haven't we signed the contracts already?

202
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,320
What's the rush?

203
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,230
It's important to do the jobs well.

204
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,830
Miss Mo, how are you?

205
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,000
What brings you here?

206
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,070
I'm busy with the shooting,

207
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,040
so I didn't go to pick you up.

208
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,230
You come right in time.

209
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,040
Please watch a scene.

210
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,040
And if it's more or less all right,

211
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,160
just make a decision

212
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,070
on the investment.

213
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:00,950
By the way,

214
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:01,720
this is

215
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,110
Mr. Han of Impact Pictures,

216
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:03,920
also Court of Law's

217
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,760
chief producer.

218
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,320
These two are our company's

219
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,160
legal counsels.

220
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:08,550
Hello.

221
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,040
Hello.

222
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:12,480
Go ahead.

223
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,230
Be quiet.

224
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:14,830
All posts on standby.

225
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:15,920
Get the camera rolling.

226
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:16,640
Action!

227
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,640
The plaintiff wins the lawsuit.

228
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,230
Chief Judge, please leave the court.

229
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:25,510
After all these years,

230
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:26,920
I've finally

231
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,720
got the better of you once.

232
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,720
I concede defeat.

233
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,070
Tell me, what do you want?

234
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,320
I want you

235
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,790
not to be my opponent,

236
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,110
but my sweetheart.

237
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,040
Stop.

238
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,440
The props are crude

239
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,830
and the court hearing procedure
is not up to standard.

240
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,230
Is it because the crew

241
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,110
didn't read the original manga

242
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,480
and didn't hire a legal counsel?

243
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,390
We have limited funding,

244
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,320
so we have to

245
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,160
make every penny count.

246
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:15,640
What's more,

247
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,480
a remake

248
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,040
is actually

249
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,200
secondary processing of art.

250
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,390
It's excusable

251
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,000
to have some variations.

252
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,830
The lower the cost,

253
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,440
the more truthful it should be
to the original manga.

254
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,040
Only in this way

255
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,880
can it have a better reputation.

256
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:28,830
Lu Xun,

257
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,070
you have court experience.

258
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,950
Why don't you give some guidance?

259
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,350
Actually, according to

260
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,590
normal sentence-pronouncing procedures,

261
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,640
everybody present

262
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,790
must stand up

263
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:37,230
en masse.

264
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,000
What's more,

265
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,110
the hero of the original manga
is allergic to pollen.

266
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,400
How can there be a rose

267
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,910
in his suit pocket?

268
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,790
The feelings
between the actor and the actress

269
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:45,590
are out of place as well.

270
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,200
In the original manga,

271
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:47,790
you two

272
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,150
have been frenemies for years

273
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,350
and develop from enemies to lovers,

274
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,550
but you even
pretended to be kissing just now.

275
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,840
You didn't show

276
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,670
the nervousness and tentativeness

277
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,000
of their first kiss.

278
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,670
Lu Xun,

279
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:00,960
give them

280
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,910
a demo with me.

281
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,000
Well, I…

282
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,150
This is what I think.

283
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:12,790
Well…

284
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,440
If you see it in another scenario,

285
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,470
it may be reasonable,

286
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,200
right?

287
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,710
But in court,

288
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,000
there are

289
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,710
its own rules,

290
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,520
right?

291
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,550
Besides,

292
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,150
we lawyers

293
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,110
are supposed to be very low-key
and calm,

294
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:26,670
right?

295
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,640
Kissing in court

296
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,000
is really not quite appropriate.

297
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,150
Changing…

298
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,670
Changing it to a hug is OK, I think.

299
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,320
A hug is OK.

300
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,400
I think what Qian Wei says

301
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,230
makes sense.

302
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,280
Lu Xun,

303
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,400
try it with Qian Wei.

304
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,320
No, this is not appropriate.

305
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:43,840
Why?

306
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,150
Are you reluctant?

307
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,910
Even your boss can force himself

308
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:49,910
to do something he doesn't want to do.

309
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,440
Don't you also want to

310
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:52,910
become a licensed lawyer,

311
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:53,910
debate in court

312
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,840
and have a try?

313
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,350
Go.

314
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:11,880
After all these years,

315
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,230
I've finally got the better of you once.

316
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:15,840
I concede defeat.

317
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,520
Tell me, what do you want?

318
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:20,880
I don't want to be your opponent.

319
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:22,880
I want to be your sweetheart.

320
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:27,840
Isn't this much more reasonable?

321
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,910
But the setting

322
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,910
and the props of this scene

323
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:32,550
must be redone.

324
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,840
Make them more elaborate.

325
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:36,080
OK.

326
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,080
(Had I known I could do it myself,)

327
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,670
(I wouldn't change the kissing scene.)

328
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:42,550
Are you taking advantage of me?

329
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,470
You dragged me to act it out.

330
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,150
You just can't tell

331
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:48,960
I am taking advantage of you.

332
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:53,790
Excuse me,

333
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,000
can you guys stay a little longer?

334
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,150
We'll do the lighting again.

335
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,760
You are glistening.

336
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,440
The protagonist's halo.

337
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,080
Even the coin in Fontana di Trevi

338
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,110
is not as pretentious as you.

339
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:18,590
Are you cursing me?

340
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,640
Can't you make it out?

341
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,440
We have to be standing here

342
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,150
to test the lighting.

343
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,960
Why don't we keep acting?

344
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:29,910
OK.

345
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:30,910
Go ahead. Act what?

346
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,230
I'd like to own

347

1,000 eyes

348
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,280
of the eternal night

349
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,150
to set my eyes on you only.

350
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,520
This verse

351
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,790
should sound familiar to you.

352
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,840
Are you all right?

353
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:16,910
How did you do the setting?

354
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,000
There's such a big safety hazard.

355
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
We set up the scene just today.

356
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,350
Maybe the glue is still wet.

357
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,550
If you are gonna

358
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,400
invest in this company,

359
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,550
I suggest you exercise caution.

360
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,230
There is a very big problem

361
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,200
with this company.

362
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,590
Someone must be embezzling the money.

There're many loopholes in the contracts

365
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,080
(TV Series Investment Contract)
which I've marked out.

366
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,080
(TV Series Additional Investment Contract)
Please look them through.

(TV Series Additional Investment Contract)

368
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:37,320
Zixin,

369
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:37,910
we actually

370
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:38,910
don't suggest you

371
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,280
invest in this project.

372
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,640
Although they promise

373
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,280
a sizeable profit,

374
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,880
there are actually great risks.

375
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,030
For one thing,

376
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,440
the producers are delaying payment.

377
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:46,910
And then

378
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,880
they don't pay insurance

379
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,520
for the crew members,

380
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,440
which is also a problem.

381
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:50,880
In addition,

382
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,550
the setting also poses a safety hazard.

383
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:52,960
So I think

384
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,030
you'd better think twice.

385
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:54,590
We actually

386
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:55,910
don't suggest you invest.

387
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,670
Actually, I want more
than to make money.

388
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,590
If the crew has no funding,

389
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,440
it'll do badly in shooting.

so far.

I don't want to let the manga fans down

394

or leave regrets for myself.

395

Do you guys

396
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,760
have a compromise solution?

397
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,760
Don't worry.

398
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,550
Whatever happens,

399
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,640
we are sure to guarantee

400
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,760
your interests and demands.

401
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:25,760
We've been in this line of business

402
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,230
for quite some time.

403
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,400
It is very normal

404
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,520
for such a thing to happen

405
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,790
in a filming crew.

406
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,710
Each line of business has its own rules.

407
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:34,710
Otherwise, how can we make money?

408
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,640
I would say the rules are fake

409
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:37,840
and making money is real.

410
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,840
The disposable funds in the contract

411
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,080
just don't match the actual

412
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,200
day-to-day accounts of the filming crew.

413
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,960
Withholding data and embezzling funds.

414
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,710
Are they part of the rules too,

415
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:47,320
Mr. Han?

416
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,350
I think this

417
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,030
must be an oversight of the accountant.

418
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:51,590
Look,

419
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:52,550
as is written on the contract,

420
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,000
"If our party
makes additional investment

421
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,710
and joins the production,

422
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:55,910
the copyright will be shared

423
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:58,000
between our party and Impact Pictures."

424
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
In that case, our party

425
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,280
will be the primary producer

426
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,440
and the liable party.

427
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:01,960
Yes, yes, yes.

428
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,440
We'll all make money together.

429
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:06,960
On the surface,

430
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,110
such a clause looks like

431
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,840
it's protecting
our party's rights and interests

432
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,200
but it's actually shifting
responsibilities.

433
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,030
As I see it, Mr. Han,

434
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,440
you are looking for

435
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,230
a fallback for yourself.

436
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,110
That's not possible.

437
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,590
I don't think
the investment can go ahead for now.

438
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,440
I will

439
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,000
draft a supplementary agreement
on the basis of

440
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,400
protecting the rights and interests
of both parties.

441
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,640
If this project

442
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,280
is not finished

443
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,150
within the specified time frame

444
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,080
or has any problems

445
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,320
during the production process,

446
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,470
Cool Visitor will

447
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,080
take back the copyright automatically

448
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,000
and our party

449
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,760
will also have the right to look for

450
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,200
a new production team

451
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,200
or to produce it on our own.

452
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,960
But Mr. Han,

453
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,640
we of course understand

454
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,080
your difficulties.

455
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,200
Miss Mo is also very considerate

456
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:54,790
by saying

457
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:55,910
we will not take the copyright payment

458
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,470
for the time being

459
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:58,790
and you can spend the funds

460
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,200
specially on production.

461
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,080
You can pay it back

462
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,470
when you have earnings later.

463
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,030
Mr. Han,

464
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:08,880
actually we both

465
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,110
want the project to go well.

466
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,200
I'm sure

467
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,030
you can handle it well.

468
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,000
Let's be partners again

469
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,520
for the next project.

470
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:18,960
All right.

471
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,590
The filming crew needs people
to be present all the time.

472
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:22,840
I'll take leave for now.

473
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,670
Mr. Han,

474
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:26,550
thank you for your time.

475
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,960
If you have any questions,

476
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,350
you can contact Qian Wei

477
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:29,910
directly.

478
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,400
Awesome.

479
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,230
It surprises me

480
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:40,910
you two used to be

481
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,760
bickering intensely,

482
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,710
but once you team up,

483
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,110
you play along so well.

484
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,960
You played good cop and bad cop so well.

485
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:48,910
Can't help it.

486
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,030
We are both straight-A students,

487
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:51,440
right?

488
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:54,000
All right.

489
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,350
You are No.1 and I'm No.2.

490
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,790
You are right, boss.

491
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,110
You-you are right
in everything you say, boss.

492
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,230
Qian Wei,

493
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:11,790
you are going to the hospital
for rehabilitation tomorrow.

494
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:12,670
Go to bed early.

495
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13,910
Look at the dark circles
under your eyes.

496
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,110
Just leave the supplementary agreement

497
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:16,280
to me and Zixin.

498
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,350
But the company is closed after work.

499
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,470
Where are you guys going to draft it?

500
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,110
Several hundred people of the crew

501
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,550
are waiting for the funds
to be in place.

502
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,590
We'd better finish the agreement tonight

503
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:26,880
so that the crew can put the money
on their account tomorrow.

504
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:28,760
By the way, Lu Xun,

505
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,400
I remember you are not staying
far from here.

506
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,520
Shall we pull an all-nighter?

507
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,840
Yes, OK.

508
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:35,640
Well,

509
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,670
I think actually I…

510
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:37,640
I can also

511
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,590
go with you guys.

512
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,520
Qian Wei, go home to have a rest first.

513
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,790
We must get it done by tomorrow.

514
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:42,710
We are really running out of time.

515
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,000
We've got to go and draft it now.

516
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,080
- It's already so late.
- Well,

517
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,200
let's draft it together.

518
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:46,790
There's really not enough time left.

519
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:47,590
Well, it's OK.

520
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:48,080
Bye.

521
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:48,790
Well…

522
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:49,790
Well…

523
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:50,790
I can draft it with you guys together.

524
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,150
Don't forget
your rehabilitation tomorrow.

525
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,520
I don't want the rehabilitation!

526
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,840
Single man and woman.

527
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,030
The right timing,
location and condition.

528
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,230
Aren't these what Zixin has said?

529
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,260
(Haizhou Impact Pictures Co., Ltd.)

530
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,430
(Q3 of 2022)
Financial report?

531
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:21,470
They need it.

532
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,160
I'm not having a selfish thought.

533
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,710
I'm there to send the financial report.

534
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,590
Hello?

535
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:34,280
Is that
the driver of tailored taxi service?

536
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,280
Well,

537
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,350
I'm in a rush

538
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:36,950
to go somewhere now.

539
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:38,110
Could you come now?

540
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:39,350
Yes.

541
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,230
Whether I can court

542
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,000
my future boyfriend

543
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,830
depends on you.

544
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,880
If overstated figures are removed,

545
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,430
the actual percentage is around 10%

546
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,760
or 15%.

547
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,710
As to the exact figure,

548
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:50,800
I have to double-check.

549
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,040
Impact's financial report.

550
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:58,470
You are still

551
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,880
fond of Qian Wei now, aren't you?

552
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,400
Why don't you tell her?

553
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,680
Now I actually just…

554
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:08,040
I'm used to her being my assistant.

555
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,070
Let's

556
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,400
finish the work first today.

557
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,880
We are tight on time. There's no time.

558
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,920
Hope I remembered it right.

559
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:20,070
The PIN of Lu Xun's house is…

560
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,520
How did you know the PIN of my house?

561
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,520
It appeared in my dreams.

562
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:41,880
I think her brain

563
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,920
hasn't recovered yet.

564
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,470
Well,

565
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,760
I'm not here for fun.

566
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,310
Look,

567
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,710
Impact's

568
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,310
financial statement,

569
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,160
you guys forgot to bring it along.

570
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,400
I happen to need this

571
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,110
to double-check the crew's cash flow.

572
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:59,160
Don't you think I'm smart?

573
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,040
No need to do that.

574
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:00,760
Look.

575
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,710
I've sorted it all out for you

576
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:02,640
on my way here.

577
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:03,950
Come on, boss.

578
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:04,880
Here you are.

579
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,230
I can just read this.

580
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,040
Go home first.

581
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:08,590
Well,

582
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:10,830
I've got something to tell you

583
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,760
when you finish work.

584
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,160
I'll go and make a pot of tea.

585
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,070
Thanks, Zixin.

586
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:19,000
Do you know where the tea is?

587
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,070
(Analysis of the Crew's Financial Report)
It's right under the worktop.

588
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,920
And there are teacups
in the top cabinet.

589
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,070
There's red wine in there.

590
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,190
Be careful.

591
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:26,830
Qian Wei,

592
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:27,800
you know Lu Xun's house

593
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,560
so well.

594
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:30,560
Right.

595
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,230
Why do you know so much

596
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,310
about my house?

597
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,280
I've installed a monitor

598
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:35,920
on your heart which has an opening,

599
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,470
can't I?

600
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,230
Be quick to read.

601
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,190
I think

602
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,590
it should be all right to write

603
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:52,710
how to avoid

604
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:53,800
the joint responsibilities

605
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,800
for the three parts this way.

606
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:03,950
Well,

607
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:04,920
the work is done.

608
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,110
Don't you have something to say?

609
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:06,800
What is it?

610
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:12,190
Are you keeping a dog
without letting me know?

611
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,040
This can of dog food,

612
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,160
this dog leash

613
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,230
and the freshener over there.

614
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,680
What are they for
if not for dog-keeping?

615
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:35,830
This can…

616
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,590
My food.

617
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,680
Your food?

618
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,640
It's your food again.

619
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,800
A snack.

620
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:48,470
Do you even ask about the freshener?

621
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:49,830
It's certainly

622
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:54,190
for purifying the air in the bathroom.

623
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,710
The dog leash

624
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
is an elastic band I use for my workout.

625
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,920
A dog leash as an elastic band?

626
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,710
An elastic band for workout.

627
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,000
What about this?

628
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:15,430
There's hair on it

629
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:16,350
with tooth prints.

630
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,680
Do you use this to train your masseter?

631
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,520
Why don't you show me how to do it?

632
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,110
This is

633
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,110
some merchandise Zixin's company

634
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,760
has made.

635
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,350
You are lying again.

636
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,560
There's nothing like that at all.

637
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:42,070
Since I'm a legal counsel

638
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,310
and Zixin is my Party A,

639
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,400
of course, I must

640
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,400
understand

641
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,830
Party A's demands comprehensively.

642
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,950
This is my specialty.

643
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,950
Your specialty…

644
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,190
They don't have such a thing at all.

645
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:51,190
You are lying indeed.

646
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,160
Are you OK?

647
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,350
Let me get you a towel.

648
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:03,470
Where did you get burned?

649
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,000
I'm OK. Just a little.

650
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,880
Does it hurt?

651
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,160
It's all right. It doesn't matter.

652
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,590
No need. No need to take care of me.

653
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,710
Just take care of Qian Wei.

654
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,470
(In my dreams,)

655
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,040
(every time you took off)

656
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,160
(your suit jacket, you gave it to me.)

657
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:38,520
(I thought)

658
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,470
(your suit jacket only belonged to me.)

659
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,590
Well,

660
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:42,950
wipe the water off with the towel first.

661
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,880
I'll go get the medical kit in the study

662
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,160
and see if
there's any medicine for scalds.

663
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:46,830
Thanks.

664
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,230
There's no medical kit in the study.

665
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,160
How come there isn't?

666
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:56,880
Isn't it just on the second level
of your bookcase?

667
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,640
This is my house.

668
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,520
There's none if I say so.

669
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,070
I've been here

670
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,710
thousands of times in my dreams.

671
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:05,590
To say nothing of the medical kit,

672
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:06,560
I even know

673
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,520
where you put your socks.

674
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:08,950
Is your brain

675
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:09,760
really not functioning?

676
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,350
Can't you tell

677
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:12,560
dreams from reality?

678
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,520
Ever since you came around,

679
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,560
you've been messing things up.

680
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,190
It's OK

681
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16,280
you turn the company into a theater.

682
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,110
Now in my house,

683
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:17,950
you are still like this.

684
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,070
What exactly do you want?

685
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:19,830
What do you want to say?

686
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,230
Can you just say it?

687
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,000
Just leave if you have nothing to say.

688
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:24,800
Lu Xun…

689
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,740
(Law Department 2011
Vocational Skills Competition)

690
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,160
So you mean…

691
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:41,680
dreams are dreams

692
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,070
and reality is reality.

693
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,430
I'm overthinking about everything,

694
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:45,920
right?

695
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,520
No, Qian Wei,

696
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,310
that's not what he meant.

697
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,190
You are certainly not overthinking.

698
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:50,760
Although I don't know

699
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,190
what you dreamed of in your dreams,

700
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,760
I'm sure…

701
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,160
Zixin, this has nothing to do with you.

702
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,590
Lu Xun!

703
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,350
I don't care what you

704
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,920
dreamed of in your dreams.

705
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,040
What on earth are you doing now?

706
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,160
Do you have anything to say?

707
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,460
(I want 1,000 eyes of the eternal night
to set my eyes on you only)

708
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:14,560
You don't, do you?

709
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:16,880
Go.

710
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:18,830
Do you get it?

711
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,800
I've repeated it many times.

712
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,000
Lu Xun,

713
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,920
you'll regret it

714
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:31,880
if you don't say it.

715
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,190
You said

716
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,560
when I was in a coma,

717
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,430
you had been reading out

718
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:41,760
articles of law by my bed all the time.

719
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,350
But was that the only thing you did?

720
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:46,310
Cupid,

721
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,470
crystal lamps and light boards

722
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:48,520
do not exist in reality,

723
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,070
do they?

724
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:49,680
And the good lucks

725
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,710
I've got lately

726
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:51,110
do not exist…

727
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,280
They have nothing to do with me!

728
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,310
They have nothing to do with me.

729
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,710
Do you get it?

730
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,640
Please leave.

731
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,640
I get it.

732
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:20,590
The work is done.

733
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,470
I'm going for now.

734
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,760
I'll let you guys talk.

735
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,560
Qian Wei…

736
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:27,920
There's a noise in the study.

737
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,040
Did you hide anything

738
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:29,800
that you can't let Qian Wei see?

739
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,470
Qian Wei…

740
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,040
Lu Xun.

741
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,110
What exactly

742
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,190
are you hiding in your study

743
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:40,350
that you can't let Qian Wei see?

744
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,110
Lu Xun,

745
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,800
aren't you allergic to dog hair?

746
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,560
Why are you keeping a dog?

747
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,310
This is the dog Qian Wei got

748
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,280
in a ring toss at the amusement park

749
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,310
during the networking event.

750
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,950
It is Cupid.

751
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,430
Over all these years,

752
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,400
you can live with

753
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,040
your dog hair allergy every day

754
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:09,830
just to bring up

755
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:11,040
the dog she gave you.

756
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,110
You obviously

757
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:12,950
like Qian Wei so much.

758
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:14,280
Why don't you tell her?

759
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:16,830
Li Chongwen is the one she likes.

760
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,040
Their

761
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,000
so-called breakup

762
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,520
is nothing but

763
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,680
a spat.

764
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,920
Her good lucks are also brought to her

765
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,880
by Li Chongwen.

766
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:26,230
Once Li Chongwen

767
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:27,160
brings her good lucks,

768
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:27,760
she becomes happy.

769
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,350
Once she's happy,

770
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,310
they will make up.

771
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,000
Do I have to

772
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,950
tell her those things?

773
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:31,470
I know.

774
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:32,800
You have your own pride.

775
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,950
You are afraid if you said it one day,

776
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:34,760
you'd lay your feelings bare

777
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,230
and everything would be gone.

778
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,070
But has it ever occurred to you

779
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:38,680
if one day

780
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,350
you found

781
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,520
you let her go

782
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:41,800
because of your pride,

783
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,950
wouldn't you regret it?

784
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,230
I can see

785
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:47,070
Qian Wei cares a lot about you.

786
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:50,800
I too

787
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,110
once liked someone.

788
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,430
But my pride

789
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,800
made me unable to have the courage

790
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,950
to say those things.

791
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,680
So I don't want to see you

792
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,590
make the same mistake

793
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:00,880
as I did.

794
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,230
You and Qian Wei

795
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:02,830
have brushed past each other

796
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:03,760
so many times.

797
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,000
When your predestined bond is depleted,

798
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,350
there really

799
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,430
won't be the next time.

800
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:09,110
Qian Wei is still downstairs.

801
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,230
You still have time to go for her.

802
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:13,920
Stop wavering.

803
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,880
Get a move on!

804
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:25,830
Thank you.

805
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:42,920
Hello?

806
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,800
(Hello, Ms. Qian.)

807
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,040
(This is Mr. Xu,
your driver of tailored taxi service

808
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,000
who served you just now.)

809
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:47,830
(Do you still need

810
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:48,880
a pick-up or drop-off today?)

811
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,760
Please tell

812
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,400
Mr. Lu that

813
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,680
if there's anything

814
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,710
he wants to say to me,

815
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:55,230
just come to me himself.

816
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:57,760
(Mr. Lu?)

817
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,560
(What Mr. Lu?)

818
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:00,880
(Isn't it Mr. Li?)

819
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,950
(Mr. Li specially asked me)

820
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:06,400
(to be on call)

821
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,590
(and he didn't let me tell you.)

822
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,070
(Well…)

823
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:10,830
(If you have no need today,)

824
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:12,760
(I'll call you next time.)

825
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,950
(Is everything really a coincidence)

826
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,560
(and my wishful thinking?)

827
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,070
(In real life,)

828
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,350
(there has never been Lu Xun)

829
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:24,160
(who likes Qian Wei.)

830
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,070
(In my dreams,)

831
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,000
(you told me you wanted to light up)

832
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,070
(all the stars in the night sky)

833
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,560
(so that I'd never
be afraid of darkness again.)

834
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,470
(Lu Xun,)

835
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:41,470
(tell me,)

836
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:42,880
(do you still mean what you say?)

837
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,640
(Everything is fake.)

838
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:46,640
(My dreams are fake.)

839
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,470
(The crystal ball is fake.)

840
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:50,430
(The prescription, snowfall
and the little gold pig…)

841
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,680
(are all fake.)

842
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,260
