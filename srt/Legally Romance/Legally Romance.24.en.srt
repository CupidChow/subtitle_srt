1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:03,680
In the accident,

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,590
you had a concussion,

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:06,510
and you

4
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:07,920
had a brain treatment for a week.

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:09,470
During the coma,

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,230
illusions and dreams

7
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,560
were normal.

8
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:14,190
Although you're awake,

9
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:14,840
you'll still need some time

10
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:15,960
to adjust yourself.

11
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:17,470
You'll need regular

12
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:18,870
recuperative treatments

13
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,710
to be completely free from headaches,
dizziness, and other symptoms.

14
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:22,790
- That's all.
- Okay. Thank you, doctor.

15
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:23,600
No problem.

16
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:29,840
Isn't the double-layer milk custard

17
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,390
from Make Your Life Sweet your favorite?

18
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,240
I went back to the university
to buy this for you.

19
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,080
Why don't you even take a bite?

20
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,720
Wei, you're awake at last.

21
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:44,560
Don't eat this,

22
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,630
or you won't feel like
eating anything at dinner.

23
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:46,470
Come on.

24
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:47,720
Qian Wei just woke from the coma,

25
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,150
and she can eat whatever she likes.

26
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:49,520
Here.

27
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:49,790
No.

28
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,150
Just because she just
woke from the coma,

29
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:51,910
she needs

30
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:53,080
to eat some nutritious food.

31
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,080
Come, have some.

32
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,080
No.

33
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:55,590
Have some.

34
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,360
No, she can't.

35
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,040
I said, she can't.

36
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,240
It's none of your business,
don't you think?

37
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,110
I'm her brother,

38
00:00:59,110 --> 00:00:59,910
so it has to be my business.

39
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:00,840
What's your relationship?

40
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,560
I'm her bestie.

41
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,630
It has to be my business.

42
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:03,560
You're a bestie, huh?

43
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,120
So what?

44
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:04,760
If she wants to eat something,

45
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,440
why can't she eat it?

46
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,230
No, she can't.

47
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:06,830
Enough.

48
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,910
You two weren't like this before.

49
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:13,160
I'm tired.

50
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:13,680
I need some sleep.

51
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,440
Go.

52
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,400
It's your fault.

53
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,040
Okay.

54
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,360
You get some rest.

55
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:34,510
Wei,

56
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:35,680
you get some proper rest.

57
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:37,870
It's all your fault.

58
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:39,910
What?

59
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:50,870
(I see.)

60
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:52,680
(It was all)

61
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,510
(but a futile dream.)

62
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,000
(Once it's over,)

63
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,190
(I'm back in this cold reality.)

64
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,310
(In this world,)

65
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,760
(there's no such thing)

66
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,830
(as preplanned love)

67
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:03,630
(for me.)

68
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:05,310
(I'm still)

69
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,550
(Qian Wei who has accomplished nothing.)

70
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:06,460
=Legally Romance=

71
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:14,860
=Episode 24=
=Dreams Overlap with Reality=

72
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,160
The court has accepted

73
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,390
and heard Lawyer Wei's case.

74
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,270
The maximum sentence
will be three years in jail.

75
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,320
It has nothing

76
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,440
to do with the dispute

77
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,600
between Morris and Ruomei.

78
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,110
I know

79
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,360
that you have got

80
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,720
Ruomei and Lawyer Wei's

81
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,720
transfer record.

82
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,160
But without

83
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,600
further evidence,

84
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,750
the transfer record alone
isn't going to be enough.

85
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,520
During the cross-examination,

86
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,470
it'll be easy

87
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,910
to refute their relationship.

88
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,600
The fact is,

89
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,880
he just wanted to work at AES,

90
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,360
and used the swapped illustrations

91
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,240
to blackmail us.

92
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,960
It was his personal behavior.

93
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,550
We are completely innocent.

94
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,320
I get it.

95
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,910
Making up facts

96
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,600
is your thing.

97
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,160
Li Chongwen,

98
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,240
the Morris-Ruomei case

99
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,110
has been appealed to the court.

100
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,520
Since you're so sure,

101
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,960
why would you come here

102
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,040
talking about settlement
with me face to face?

103
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,390
Lu Xun,

104
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,600
I have to say,

105
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,000
years have passed,

106
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,350
you're still so naive.

107
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:27,320
You think you got Lawyer Wei,

108
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,000
and you'll win the second instance?

109
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,040
Or do you think

110
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,230
the winner in court

111
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,790
is the winner of the commercial war?

112
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,640
Let me tell you this.

113
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:36,510
If I

114
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,670
want to,

115
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,720
it's likely

116
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,160
that I'll stall the case
longer than three years.

117
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,110
And you know

118
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,270
AES, Ruomei's parent company,

119
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,390
will be listed domestically.

120
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,600
Its market size

121
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,920
has grown by 30%.

122
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,440
Between AES,

123
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,880
a developed group,

124
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,200
and Morris,

125
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,270
an emerging game company,

126
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:00,720
which one will last longer?

127
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,830
Zhanying earned a good reputation

128
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,510
within the legal business circle,

129
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,760
and you don't want to stall it.

130
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,760
Because in the end,

131
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,230
even if you win the case,

132
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,040
the client will be over.

133
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,110
I mean, think about it.

134
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,350
Who would pay for your service again?

135
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,320
People work in legal department like me

136
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,320
believe in "Harmony brings fortune",

137
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,270
"Lower the rick",

138
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:30,920
and "Mutual benefit".

139
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,640
We wouldn't like

140
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,550
to waste everybody's energy

141
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,510
on some petty stuff like this.

142
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,270
You make

143
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,040
a lot of sense.

144
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,380
(Settlement Agreement)

145
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,600
Very true.

146
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,600
You talked a lot

147
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:58,830
because

148
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:59,830
AES wants

149
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:00,880
the problem to be solved hastily

150
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,670
as the listing day draws near.

151
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,720
Yes,

152
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,000
Morris can't afford to stall,

153
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,440
but do you think AES

154
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,600
can afford to lose?

155
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,830
If a copyright infringement case
draws more attention,

156
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,440
I bet it'll lower AES's market value

157
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,440
more than

158
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,550
the estimated value

159
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,390
of ten Morris.

160
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,760
I've filed

161
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,040
the appellate petition to the court.

162
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,880
You'll receive the subpoena
within this week.

163
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,270
Do you honestly think

164
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,790
I won't find any key evidence?

165
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,670
Is that so?

166
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,350
Do you think you will find it

167
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,230
before I do?

168
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,160
Lu Xun,

169
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,550
don't be led by your personal judgment.

170
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,720
You don't want to sign the agreement,

171
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,440
but maybe,

172
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,600
it is what Morris wants.

173
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,700
(Recording)

174
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:53,320
But I admit it's my bad.

175
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,230
It was already late

176
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,320
when I was given the case
after I returned home,

177
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,640
so there are
unnecessary misunderstandings.

178
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:00,790
Yu,

179
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,350
you've been in the room for some time.

180
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,230
Why didn't you get some coffee

181
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,640
for Mr. Lu and his assistant?

182
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,880
Be smart, will you?

183
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,720
No, no, no.

184
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,230
The guests don't make coffee,

185
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:10,950
right?

186
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,350
Miss Luo,
why don't you make some coffee?

187
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:29,880
After Qian Wei had the accident,

188
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,040
you have been quite busy.

189
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,790
I thank you on her behalf.

190
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:36,390
You're an interesting guy.

191
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,670
I'm Qian Wei's boss.

192
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,040
My assistant had an accident.

193
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,270
I should share
her responsibility, shouldn't I?

194
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,160
Who the heck are you?

195
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,670
You don't get to thank me

196
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,320
on her behalf.

197
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,390
I'm her boyfriend.

198
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,760
Qian Wei told me

199
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,510
that you, as her boss,

200
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,640
exploit and oppress her.

201
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,070
How can you do that?

202
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,760
Thankfully,

203
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,270
I often comfort her.

204
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,270
But I didn't expect

205
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,640
you to care about her

206
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,230
after she had the accident.

207
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,950
Now that I'm back in the country,

208
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,830
it is now my duty

209
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,550
to look after Qian Wei.

210
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,480
So it's her boyfriend's duty

211
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:25,880
to look after her, huh?

212
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,110
Getting

213
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,830
back together, huh?

214
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,840
How is that possible?

215
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,670
What's wrong with that?

216
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,880
We were together for so many years.

217
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,200
She just gave up

218
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,520
over some bickers.

219
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,550
After she woke up

220
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,910
from her serious coma,

221
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:42,640
she'll see

222
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,960
what comes first in her life.

223
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,440
Qian Wei used to buy you coffee,

224
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,110
but it isn't something

225
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:48,960
a paralegal should do.

226
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,200
I'll pay for your coffee today.

227
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,230
Also,

228
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,760
spend more time

229
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,080
on the settlement agreement.

230
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,880
Think it over.

231
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,710
Let me know after you make a decision.

232
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,840
Mr. Lu,

233
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,230
AES bought the coffee. Want one?

234
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,230
How does it work?

235
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:56,840
Qian Wei made

236
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,000
coffee for the entire office.

237
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,710
We were used to that.

238
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,000
It's normal that you don't know
how it works.

239
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,350
Just get to the point.

240
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,640
Lawyer Wei is sorted.

241
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,280
When we win the Morris case,

242
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,030
Qian Wei

243
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,280
will probably recuperate
from her illness.

244
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,350
If she likes,

245
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,400
she can come back to work any time.

246
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,960
You tended to her with so much care

247
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,960
for so long.

248
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,960
Now that she's awake,

249
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,960
why don't you give her a call

250
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,320
to ask about her thoughts?

251
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,590
What are you doing?

252
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,960
I have hyperlipidemia.
I'm on a no-sugar diet.

253
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:40,670
Kiddo,

254
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,960
I know what you are thinking

255
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,590
even though you don't say a word.

256
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,710
You're worried

257
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:49,350
that after this thing,

258
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,350
there will be no hard feelings

259
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,880
between Qian Wei and Li Chongwen,

260
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,710
and then they'll get back together

261
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,110
and leave Zhanying.

262
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,280
They can get back together,

263
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,840
but it won't change
anything profession-wise.

264
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,030
I know Qian Wei.

265
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,520
You just make a call,

266
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,400
specify the situation,

267
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,350
and she'll return.

268
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,670
She'll return willingly.

269
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,000
I make the call?

270
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:10,960
Why don't you make the call?

271
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,760
I tell you what.

272
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,590
This is something

273
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,670
between you young folks.

274
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,030
Me? I'm an old dude.

275
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,000
I shouldn't get involved.

276
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,350
I don't care who makes the call.

277
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,790
You can keep saying you won't.

278
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,400
It's much worse than Qian Wei's coffee.

279
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,710
What did you say?

280
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:28,520
Shoo, shoo.

281
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,320
What was that look on your face?

282
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,440
Give the coffee back to me.

283
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,110
I'll dump it.

284
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,660

All indicators

301
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,280
seem okay.

302
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,200
You can get out of the hospital.

303
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,880
Thank you, doctor.

304
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:34,760
You're welcome.

305
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,080
If you do,

306
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,230
thank your boss.

307
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:38,910
If he

308
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,840
hadn't insisted on introducing advanced

309
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,760
foreign medical equipment,

310
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,880
you wouldn't have
come to your senses so soon.

311
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,400
But afterwards,

312
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,710
you'll still need
recuperative treatments

313
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,670
in case of sequelae.

314
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,350
Doctor,

315
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,470
I'd like to ask you a question.

316
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,550
During my coma,

317
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,030
I had a long dream.

318
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,200
I remember every detail

319
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,550
in the dream clearly.

320
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,110
Some,

321
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,910
I experienced before.

322
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,280
Some,

323
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,790
I didn't,

324
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,640
but they were perfectly logical.

325
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,320
How come?

326
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:09,760
I'll put it this way.

327
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,150
Our brain

328
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,350
is made of

329
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,200
nerve cells.

330
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,790
After the concussion,

331
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,110
your nerve cells were disordered.

332
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:17,550
During the treatment,

333
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:18,960
other than the machine,

334
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,400
your friends and family

335
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:22,550
would tell you

336
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,710
many things from the past

337
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,000
in order

338
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,670
to reorder and re-activate

339
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,520
your nerve cells.

340
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:32,030
Tell me things from the past?

341
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,150
Yes.

342
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,110
They might have even

343
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,710
told you something

344
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:36,670
that you didn't know before.

345
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,910
So it means

346
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,910
the blood card, the light board,
and Cupid

347
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,590
could all be real.

348
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,910
They told me those,

349
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,280
so I had the dreams.

350
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,150
I can't really

351
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,000
jump to such a conclusion.

352
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,640
After all, memory can be deceptive.

353
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,150
Especially

354
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:58,960
when your nerve cells are disordered,

355
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,520
certain details will be made up

356
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:03,440
to complete certain stories.

357
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,590
Whether your experiences in your dreams

358
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,520
are real

359
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,590
or made up by your brain,

360
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,840
you'll have to verify them yourself.

361
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:16,760
Doctor,

362
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,080
do you have

363

00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,030
during my coma?

365
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:20,910
I'd like to have a look.

366
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:21,880
Yes, I do.

367
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,400

It needs a matching piece

392
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,670
to fill it.

393
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:03,350
You are

394
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,760
the missing piece of my heart.

395
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,790
What are you doing?

396
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:29,880
In Under the Class Tree,

397
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,030
you said your heart missed a piece.

398
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,110
You meant me

399
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:35,960
instead of Zixin, right?

400
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,440
No.

401
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,550
During my coma,

402
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,320
I dreamed a lot

403
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,400
that I didn't witness in the university.

404
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,790
The doctor told me I knew them

405
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,200
because someone told me those.

406
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,400
I checked the ward-sitter record.

407
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,030
You looked after me every night.

408
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,280
What dreams did you have?

409
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,590
Answer my question first.

410
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:58,670
Did you tell me many things

411
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:59,910
I didn't know before?

412
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,000
Here's the thing.

413
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:03,790
The doctor said

414
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:05,640
you might become a vegetable.

415
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,280
You were still an employee
of the law firm.

416
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,760
Your accident was defined
as a work injury.

417
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,710
So when I didn't have
to work overnight,

418
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:11,800
I'd read some case records

419
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,640
and articles of law

420
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,230
to you by your sickbed

421
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:15,590
to better

422
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:17,400
arouse your professional spirit.

423
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,350
Simple as that.

424
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,590
Only case records?

425
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,680
"I wish

426
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,310
to have a thousand eyes

427
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,680

After Li Chongwen
told me he loved me,

429
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,800
on my way back
to the hospital from the university,

430
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,590
this was

431
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,920
on the light board.

432
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,350
Didn't you prepare that?

433
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:40,800
No.

434
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,710
It was a dream about
you and another man.

435
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,190
I wasn't part of it.

436
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,710
Tell me.

437
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,560
What did you dream of?

438
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:58,880
I dreamed

439
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,430
that I was back in 2011,

440
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,520
and had the most beautiful relationship.

441
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,040
But I woke up

442
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,470
realizing everything was unreal.

443
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,590
But yeah.

444
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,920
I'm not the heroine.

445
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,400
A concussion wouldn't
end a romantic relationship

446
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,830
that I never actually had.

449
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:39,950
Now that you're out of your dreams,

450
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,430
you'd better
get yourself settled in reality.

00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,760

00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,640
Nor with Li Chongwen.

457
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,110
You make sure you get well.

someone else

did those things in your dreams.

461

It has nothing to do with me.

462
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:02,680
Don't bring them up again.

463

Mr. Lu

469
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,800
is too hard on the employees.

470
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,230
It's cold.

471
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,400
I got you a cup of hot tea.

472
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:25,830
Thank you.

473
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,040
Are you busy tonight?

474
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:28,590
I have something

475
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,800
to say to you.

476
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,110
Okay.

477
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,280
I, too, would like

478

to talk about something with you.

a super popular restaurant?

481
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:39,880
How come…?

482
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,070
You like to keep a low profile,

483
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:45,350
and don't want anyone to bother you.

484
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:46,520
So I booked the entire place.

485
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,880
Do you still remember this?

486
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,310
It is the leaf

487
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:02,310
that you took away with you

488
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,350
when we broke up four years ago.

489
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,230
Yes.

490
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,590
When we broke up,

491
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,110
my life

492
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:11,710
froze in the fall

493
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,070
from four years ago.

494
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,800
Qian Wei, I'm very aware

495
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,280
that my life won't move onward

496
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,430
until you return to me.

497
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,040
The future I yearn the most

498
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,520
is a future with you.

499
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,760
After that party,

500
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,110
we had a small fight,

501
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,800
and you gave it back to me.

502
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,280
So today,

503
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,560
I'd like to gift it to you
one more time.

504
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:53,230
Before,

505
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,470
you said you had bad luck

506
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,350
and that you'd never

507
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,520
win any lottery, lucky draw,

508
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,310
or even a scratch ticket.

509
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:03,920
So from that moment on,

510
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,040
I swore to myself

511
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:05,640
that

512
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,470
I must become a man

513
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:09,070
who could bring luck to you.

514
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:11,350
If life disappoints you,

515
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,560
I'll present luck to you.

516
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,070
Please forgive me

517
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,520
for all those harsh words
that I said to you.

518
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,830
Ever since we broke apart,

519
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:22,350
I've been working hard

520
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,400
to earn enough

521
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,880
to be able to provide you with luck.

522
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:27,680
I don't mind dirt and fatigue.

523
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,760
I just need to make sure

524
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,280
that your happiness

525
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,640
is pure and innocent.

526
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:40,280
Please sit.

527
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,280
Actually,

528
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,280
I prepared something

529
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,310
for you, too.

530
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:04,040
This is

531
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,350
the empty box that you gave me

532
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,710
when you confessed your love to me.

533
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:08,830
You said you'd work hard

534
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,470
to fill the box with your own hands.

535
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,040
It's now almost full,

536
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,350
but both of our hearts

537
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:19,950
have changed.

538
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,000
Does Lan He

539
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,640
bother you?

540
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,560
No, seriously.

541
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:32,470
We keep a professional relationship.

542
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:34,190
That's all.

543
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,560
I... I really don't care

544
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:38,230
about what your relationship is.

545
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:44,070
I've moved on.

546
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:48,590
You once said

547
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,680
that

548
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,880
my upright personality

549
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,680
would be a stumbling block on my way
of becoming a lawyer.

550
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,230
But likewise,

551
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,400
I didn't understand

552
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,590
your choices and compromises, either.

553
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:04,880
We have never

554
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,520
wanted the same things.

555
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,310
From the very first day,

556
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,070
we started

557
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,230
walking in different directions.

558
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,280
The longer we walk,

559
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,350
the more distanced we are.

560
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,520
If we forcefully

561
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,950
get back together,

562
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:19,110
things will only be harder
for both of us.

563
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,830
I know

564
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:25,950
what you mean.

565
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,710
During your coma,

566
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:28,710
I thought about

567
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:30,070
what you just said countless times.

568
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,160
I... I admit

569
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:34,680
that sometimes

570
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,880
I make you cherish

571
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,350
what I cherish.

572
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,760
But that won't be a problem anymore.

573
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,680
I'll dump them.

574
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,070
The box is empty now.

575
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:44,560
It's empty.

576
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:45,800
I can throw away

577
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,710
all the things that you don't want.

578
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,350
Okay?

579
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:48,470
I'll give you

580
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:49,520
whatever you want in the future.

581
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:51,110
D... Didn't you mention

582
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:53,160
that you wanted a non-profit platform?

583
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,710
I can help you.

584
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,800
You want to become a lawyer.

585
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,430
I'll help you pass the bar exam.

586
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:58,520
I can register

587
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,590
with an institution

588
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:00,520
to reopen

589
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,950
Chong&Wei Law Firm.

590
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:03,310
We can do all of those things.

591
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:04,760
I won't let you live an inferior life.

592
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,190
I'm not living an inferior life.

593
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:08,800
It's meaningful

594
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,310
if I personally fight

595
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,350
for what I desire.

596
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,710
Chong&Wei Law Firm
won't be reopened.

597
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:17,830
The law firm

598
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,760
was closed permanently four years ago.

599
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:21,560
No one can bring the dead back to life.

600
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,280
You and I both know that.

601
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:23,880
Back then,

602
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,590
we were too young

603
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,000
to make big decisions.

604
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,190
I won't deny

605
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:32,350
our past

606
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:33,830
because without our past,

607
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:34,800
we wouldn't be what we are now.

608
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,800
I won't deny

609
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,920
your feelings for me, either.

610
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,040
It's just

611
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,280
we can't be as blind

612
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,880
as we were anymore.

613
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,190
I know

614
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,760
that you have kind nature.

615
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,800
I'm sure it hasn't been easy

616
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:49,040
for you to get this far.

617
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,400
So I feel sorry for you.

618
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,920
But we can't go back again.

619
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,350
Sorry.

620
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,190
Wei,

621
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:12,680
I know you just got out of the coma.

622
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:13,830
You may be tired.

623
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,190
But my point is,

624
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:18,640
I just want

625
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,880
you to give me another chance.

626
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,000
May I

627
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,400
have your love one more time,

628
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:22,950
please?

629
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:25,400
I will do my best.

630
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:25,920
Seriously.

631
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,280
Do you know
that waking up from a coma

632
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,000
feels like I live a second life.

633
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,280
The coma allowed me

634
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,230
to see the world

635
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,160
from a different angle.

636
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,950
When we broke up four years ago,

637
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,560
we were busy with our own lives.

638
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,710
We didn't realize

639
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:51,160
that we were never

640
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,760
meant for each other.

641
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,470
I have learned to understand you.

642
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:02,350
If you ever attempt

643
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:03,310
to understand me,

644
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:04,350
you'll find out

645
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,520
that we are just
not meant to be together.

646
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,590
Don't you know

647
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:32,710
you aren't allowed to honk downtown?

648
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:33,430
You didn't need

649
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:34,280
to honk so much

650
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,160
to let me know

651
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:35,760
you're driving a vehicle.

652
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,470
You were dawdling

653
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:37,230
in front of me.

654
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,400
I had to honk you.

655
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,640
Or what? Hit you?

656
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,640
I don't have time
for the silly argument.

657
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,040
When Qian Wei gets through,

658
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,710
I'll immediately

659
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:45,230
make way for your stupid car.

660
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:45,950
Fine.

661
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:47,110
I'm going to pick Qian Wei up anyway.

662
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,280
Ask her

663
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,430
if she wants to sit in my car

664
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:50,520
or your scooter?

665
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:51,590
Wei,

666
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:52,350
I'm here.

667
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,350
You now have a tough choice to make.

668
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:57,230
You will sit in Liu Shiyun's stupid car

669
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,710
or

670
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:00,830
you will sit on my fancy scooter?

671
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,560
You've made things clear with him.

672
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,280
Why are your eyebrows still knitted?

673
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,520
Yeah.

674
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,040
It isn't like you.

675
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:18,880
Liu,

676
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,470
if you had a dream

677
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:22,950
where you go back to the age of 18,

678
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,280
and choose to study music,

679
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:26,950
then you wake up

680
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:28,430
realizing it was just a dream,

681
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:29,190
what would you do?

682
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:31,190
It wouldn't bother me.

683
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,310
Before, I had similar dreams every day.

684
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,830
It had always been my regret

685
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:36,230
that I didn't study music.

686
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:36,760
But after

687
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,310
I dug out the wishing bottle,

688
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,310
I let it go.

689
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:40,950
I can't give a concert,

690
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,310
but my passion
for music remains the same.

691
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:42,880
I can still

692
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,830
sing in KTV.

693
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:44,880
Success isn't

694
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,680
the ultimate goal

695
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,760
for us to love someone

696
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,680
or something.

697
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:48,710
Yes.

698
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:50,830
I don't swim

699
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:51,920
to win championships,

700
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,640
I swim because it's
where my passion lies.

701
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,800
You swim because it is
where your passion lies.

702
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:56,760
You don't swim

703
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,190
to win championships.

704
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:02,280
Did Dad

705
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,760
say it to you?

706
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,430
Yes.

707
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:07,880
I didn't get into the national team.

708
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:09,520
It was how Dad comforted me.

709
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,430
(Maybe the dreams aren't
all make-believe after all.)

710
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,310
Give your mind a break.

711
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,950
You are officially discharged
from the hospital today.

712
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:18,880
We need some nice food

713
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,640
to celebrate it.

714
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,070
Right?

715
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,920
How about copper hotpot?

716
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,950
Are you kidding me?

717
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:24,800
She just got out of the hospital.

718
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,000
She can't eat mutton.

719
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,160
Are you an idiot?

720
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:28,950
Follow my advice.

721
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,760
We'll have Canton cuisine. Light food.

722
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,160
Sick people

723
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,280
prefer strong-flavored food.

724
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,160
How about river snails rice noodles?

725
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,640
River snails rice noodles is fine.

726
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,560
I like it.

727
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:41,880
Since when did you enjoy

728
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,350
river snails rice noodles?

729
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,640
A few weeks ago,

730
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,880
I got so addicted to it

731
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:46,800
that I bought

732
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,000
Xingwang River Snails Rice Noodles

733
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,230
on Daxue Road.

734
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,640
Now it's called Liu's
River Snails Rice Noodles.

735
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,280
You've got a good taste.

736
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,800
That one is my favorite.

737
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,830
When my sister was in a coma,

738
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:56,430
my mom and I

739
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:57,760
went to Liuzhou

740
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,430
just to try the authentic rice noodles.

741
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:00,160
Really?

742
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:04,160
So what happened in the dream

743
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,190
can also happen

744
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:06,470
in real life.

745
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,160
If I try harder,

746
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:08,920
maybe Lu Xun

747
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,040
will fall in love with me.

748
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,310

749
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:12,800

Free noodles for you.

751
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,280
My treat.

752
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:14,880

Missing Dad.

806

You said when he was ill,

00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,070
he had turtle soup every day.

Mom,

811
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:16,670
during my coma,

812
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:21,080
I went back to a younger age,

813
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:24,710
and…

814
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,600
And I saw Dad.

815
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,360
I did many things
that I wished I had done.

816
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,910
But it was a shame

817
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:42,360
that I still lost him

818
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,040
in that dream.

819
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:49,560
But

820
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,840
at least, in the dream,

821
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:54,150
I heard him

822
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,190
say goodbye.

823
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:58,670
I felt his love for me.

824
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:03,600
It's so good to be young.

825
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:07,120
If I could be young again,

826
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,840
I'd trade

827
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,600
everything for it.

828
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,000
Mom.

What was

830
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:15,560
your youth like?

831
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,560
Every day with your dad

832
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,520
since I knew him from my 19 to 52.

833
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:29,870
When your dad was alive,

834
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,800
he had two wishes.

835
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
One was to travel around the world

836
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,470
and take pictures
of the greatest landscapes.

837
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:42,320
After he passed away,

838
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,190
I fulfilled this wish for him.

839
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,320
I'm sure he can see it.

840
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:52,670
The other one was,

841
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,870
me passing the bar examination.

842
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:59,120
Weird.

843
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:01,600
You know what?

844
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,520
He didn't stay long

845
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,040
enough to see me

846
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,670
pass the bar examination
in the dream, either.

847
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,430
But what's good was that

848
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,470
he left a gift for me

849
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,360
in the dream.

850
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,040
He prepared a gift for you

851
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:14,950
in the dream, too?

852
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,280
Too?

853
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,360
He asked me

854
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,390
to tell you this

855
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:02,710
after you pass the bar exam.

856
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:05,040
But he didn't expect

857
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,390
that it'd take so long.

858
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:08,760
You discovered it anyway.

859
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:12,230
It's fine.

860
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,800
Now that I've found it,

861
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:17,150
I'm sure I'll pass the exam.

862
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:19,800
The next year.

863
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:22,430
When we go pay respects
to his tomb next year,

864
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,800
I'll put this on.

865
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,360
We'll go visit him together.

866
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:41,000
If you want to drink coffee,

867
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,280
just let me know.

868
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:44,120
I'll make some coffee for you at once.

869
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:45,560
Come on, don't drink that.

870
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,520
Drink this. This is good.

871
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,560
Here.

872
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:50,760
Don't worry.

873
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,670
I'm back.

874
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,000
I'll be on duty 24/7.

875
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,950
I'll make any coffee

876
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:54,870
that you want immediately.

877
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,760
You had to resign, didn't you?

878
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,000
You stormed out

879
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,190
before I even said anything.

880
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:05,120
What's wrong with you now?

881
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,870
Did the car accident fix your head

882
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:08,320
or did you find your conscience

883
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,910
or were you enlightened?

884
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,630
Or maybe you're

885
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,870
just short of money?

886
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:13,430
Neither of those.

887
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:15,040
I was a silly little girl at the time.

888
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,280
I ask to stay

889
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,520
due to my love for Zhanying,

890
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:18,120
and my passion

891
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,870
for the lawyer profession.

892
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:21,080
When I joined the firm, I vowed

893
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,630
that I'd always be a lawyer

894
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:23,710
alive or dead.

895
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:24,910
Trust me.

896
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:25,520
I promise I'll make amends

897
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,630
if I can stay.

898
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:29,760
Aren't you

899
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,280
a sweet talker?

900
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,520
You do nothing

901
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,080
but cause trouble for me.

902
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,560
Do you know

903
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,390
how many clients we have lost

904
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:40,430
due to the Morris case?

905
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,760
You're right.

906
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:45,080
I admit that it was my fault.

907
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:46,190
So as soon as I got out of the hospital,

908
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,390
I dived right

909
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:49,000
back in the Morris case.

910
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,910
However,

911
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,870
Lu Xun

912
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,560
didn't really want me involved.

913
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,150
So I want

914
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,520
to ask for your help.

915
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,560
Please

916
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,670
persuade him.

917
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,040
Once you give the order,

918
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:58,710
I tell you what,

919
00:38:58,710 --> 00:38:59,600
I'll throw myself

920
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,520
into work at once.

921
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,760
Lu Xun didn't

922
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,040
want you involved

923
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,910
because he's trying to protect you.

924
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:10,560
The next day after your accident,

925
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:11,950
Morris's people

926
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:12,800
came over,

927
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,560
asking for compensation

928
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,080
and demanding that we fire you.

929
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:19,120
Lu Xun stood up for you,

930
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,950
promising that he'd sort things out
within a week

931
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:22,390
so that you can stay with us.

932
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:24,280
At first,

933
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,710
I thought it was hopeless.

934
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:27,630
It surprised me

935
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:28,520
that that dude

936
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,230
actually turned the tide.

937
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,710
I have to say

938
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:33,040
my apprentice

939
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:35,800
has got some skills.

940
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:37,630
Yes.

941
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:42,390
Oh, right.

942
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,000
I have been told

943
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,430
when you were in college,

944
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:46,600
you were the second best law student

945
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,800
next to Lu Xun.

946
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,390
Yes.

947
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:49,800
Sure I was.

948
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,230
That's weird.

949
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,710
You graduated from the same university.

950
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:55,520
Look

951
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,470
how he is doing, huh?

952
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:59,040
He's doing so great.

953
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,470
He's now a Level-2 Partner.

954
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:02,760
Look at you.

955
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,840
You aren't doing great, are you?

956
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,190
You're still

957
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:06,560
a minor paralegal.

958
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:07,710
How did you end up like this?

959
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,390
Bad luck, I guess.

960
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:14,630
Bad luck?

961
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:16,470
I say you don't work hard enough.

962
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:17,800
You are

963
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,150
a law major graduate.

964
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,600
Now, even the bar examination

965
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,470
has reformed,

966
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:27,150
and you still don't

967
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:28,230
have a certificate.

968
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:29,600
Isn't that embarrassing, huh?

969
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,230
You tell me.

970
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,120
Even so,

971
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:35,800
Lu Xun

972
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,520
still keeps you on board.

973
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,280
His reasons are, you're pretty,

974
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,950
kind,

975
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:42,520
careful with excel sheets,

976
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,950
a good driver,

977
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:44,870
and most importantly,

978
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:46,430
you make five kinds of coffee.

979
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,560
What's so funny?

980
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:49,630
Get serious.

981
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,910
But you need to know one thing.

982
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:55,000
Zhanying doesn't

983
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,560
need a good secretary,

984
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,950
but a good lawyer.

985
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,040
If you are always

986
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,320
Paralegal Qian,

987
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:05,120
someday,

988
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:06,950
the person who provides you

989
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:08,670
with shelter will be worn out.

990
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:09,360
Do you understand that?

991
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:12,430
Even if something troubled you,

992
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:14,040
it's been so many years, right?

993
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,360
You should be able
to overcome it by now.

994
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:17,910
Trust me.

995
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:18,600
I really have

996
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,630
come back as a new person.

997
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:20,950
I'm different from before.

998
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:22,630
I can provide others

999
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:23,760
with shelter now.

1000
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:25,470
Give me a chance,

1001
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:27,000
and I'll prove it to you.

1002
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:30,560
For real?

1003
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,600
The same old…

1004
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:55,560
Fine.

1005
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,670
It's only you and me here.

1006
00:41:58,670 --> 00:41:59,840
Let's make a bet.

1007
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:02,670
Starting from this day,

1008
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:05,560
if you can turn your life around,

1009
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:07,000
pass the bar examination,

1010
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,230
and handle the Morris case well,

1011
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,560
I'll personally
order a name badge for you.

1012
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:13,600
But if you can't make it,

1013
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,040
I'll give you a hard time.

1014
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:16,190
Don't worry.

1015
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:16,800
I will

1016
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,000
go to see Lu Xun immediately.

1017
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,280
I'll join in his search for evidence.

1018
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,040
I'm on my way.

1019
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:22,190
Come back here.

1020
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:22,670
Sit.

1021
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,630
Lu Xun isn't at the law firm.

1022
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:30,000
He keeps himself at home

1023
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
studying SnowNoah tirelessly.

1024
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:33,520
He left something

1025
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,430
at the firm.

1026
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,120
You take this to him

1027
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,600
if you are going to see him.

1028
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,380
(Loratadine)

1029
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:41,600
Anti-allergy medication.

1030
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,560
I knew this guy

1031
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,870
still keeps Cupid at home.

1032
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:45,600
Will do.

1033
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,150
Trust me.
