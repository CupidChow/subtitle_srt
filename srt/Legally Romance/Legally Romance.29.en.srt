00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,960
Do you need preserved flowers?

00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,110
We have a special offer today!

(Never Fading Love,

00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,070
They are preserved flowers, right?

5
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:20,920
So beautiful!

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,550
The preserved flowers

7
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:22,630
have been popular these days.

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,470
Special offer for Valentine's Day.

9
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:24,550
Only 199 yuan for a bouquet.

10
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:32,910
Forget it.

11
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,560
Just another commercial scam.

12
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:35,560
Let's go. I don't need it.

13

15
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,110
(I should at least fill in)

16
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,150
(the regrets of the past.)

17
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,400
(Only in this case)

18
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,110
(might I let it go then.)

19
00:00:58,910 --> 00:00:59,360
What do you think?

20
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,750
I'll give you a discount if you want.

21
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:01,750
Give me 150 yuan and it'll be yours.

22
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:02,750
Deal.

23
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:03,310
I'll take it.

24
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:04,590
Okay, scan this.

25
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,400
Your WeChat just received 199 yuan.

26
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,080
Done.

27
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,510
You're overpaying,
aren't you, young man?

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,910
That's what it's worth.

29
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,080
I owe her this.

30
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:19,630
By the way, Ma'am,

31
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,310
could you please give me
a greeting card?

34
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,000
Well.

35
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,390
Mr. Li, it's just a blind date.

36
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,360
I don't think it's necessary

37
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,030
to fill out the form.

38
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:38,800
After all, it is not

39
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,080
an interview.

40
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,270
Miss Qian,

41
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,000
you'll only risk

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,160
three to five years

43
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,190
to work for a company.

44
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,630
But marriage is a lifelong matter

45
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,800
and it requires a higher level

46
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:50,800
of match.

47
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,600
To show my full respect to you,

48
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,000
before I came here,

49
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,270
I've prepared

50
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,190
my personal information

51
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,670
(Personal Information)
for your reference.

52
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:58,960
Take your time.

53
00:02:59,440 --> 00:02:59,670
Well,

54
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:00,800
but I can't remember

55
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,080
the GPA,

56
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,470
the scores of CET-4 and CET-6,

57
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,960
the power consumption
of overnight air conditioning,

58
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,910
or allergens!

59
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,390
I just can't!

60
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,960
Write down as much as you can remember.

61
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,190
Her GPA is 3.8.

62
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,270
CET-4, 650 points.

63
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,030
CET-6, 620 points.

64
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,190
Pepper Allergy, Grade 2.

65
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,000
Can't take too many allergy drugs.

66
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,080
That's about it.

67
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,470
Write these down.

68
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:29,830
Excuse me.

69
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:30,720
Don't get me wrong.

70
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,520
I'm her Boss.

71
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,470
So I knew her

72
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,190
very well.

73
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:39,390
Well…

74
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,320
Hold a second.

75
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,910
Trying to make my date work, huh?

76
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,960
Your blind date is kind of special.

77
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,550
But

78
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,110
I think you'll need a judge.

79
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,360
If you want,

80
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,440
I can be there for you.

81
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,270
Don't you have anything else

82
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,390
you wanna say to me?

83
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,390
What do you want me to say?

84
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,190
Have a son as early as you can

85
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,470
and be together forever
till death do you apart.

86
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:08,630
Fine.

87
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,030
We'll see.

88
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,000
You want me to fill out the form?

89
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,360
No problem.

90
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,920
(Fawei Online got a big case.)

91
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,350
(Qian Wei.)
(Go back with me to the firm now.)

92
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,440
(Regret so quickly?)

93
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,320
(Too late.)

94
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:53,720
Mr. Li.

95
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:54,510
I think

96
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,550
you're the most suitable person

97
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:56,200
I've met

98
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,670
in the past few days.

99
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,350
You're young, good looking,

100
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,390
and

101
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,160
have a good job.

102
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,640
Seriously?

103
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:03,200
Yes.

104
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,200
I think we should

105
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,350
stay in touch

106
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,350
and hang out more often.

107
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:06,830
- Okay.
- Great.

108
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:07,350
Fine.

109
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,550
Qian Wei.

110
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,070
I give up.

111
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:19,640
These are not

112
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,480
the three words I wanna hear.

113
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,110
I love you.

114
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,550
So I give up.

115
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,320
The hole in my heart is you.

116
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,380
(Lu Xun)

117
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,760
The light boards, signs,
and wishing bottles

118
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,830
are all real.

119
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,040
The puppy you tossed with a ring

120
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,390
at the amusement park that year,

121
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,550
I've kept it for ten years
while taking allergy medicine.

122
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:01,670
It was behind the door

123
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,440
you didn't push open

124
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,480
that night.

125
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:04,920
I need you,

126
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,670
and it was never because of work.

127
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,390
Even if the hero in your dreams

128
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,350
is not me.

129
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,440
But that's okay.

130
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,920
As long as you promise
to be my girlfriend,

131
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,270
I can wait

132

until you see me.

133

00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,600
Lying only makes it worse.

174
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,880
If you don't tell me the truth today,

175
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,230
I'll tell you what,

176
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,440
I'm gonna push you into the sea.

177
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,670
When did you start
to have a crush on me?

178
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,110
Why didn't you say anything?

179
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,480
It's been ten years.

180
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,920
The lawsuit period has long passed.

181
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,600
It wouldn't work
even if you kept the evidence.

182
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,670
You won't admit it,

183
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:17,000
will you?

184
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,480
Okay then.

185
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,320
We'll die together.

186
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:19,920
Okay, okay, okay.

187
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,000
I admit.

188
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,230
But...

189
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,760
I also have a piece of evidence

190
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,160
for you to identify.

191
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,280
When did you take this photo?

192
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,110
If you say so,

193
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,000
don't you also have a crush on me?

194
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:37,880
So what does this count?

195
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,400
Fine.

196
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,790
Reversing the truth?

197
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:41,760
Okay then.

198
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,520
I'll show you what happens

199
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,640
when you reach out a yard
after taking an inch?

200
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,080
Is that how you understand

201
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,080
the meaning of it?

202
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,760
Then I'm better than you on this.

(I know.)

219
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,030
I told you.

220
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,320
No matter what happened before,

221
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,550
Jack shall have Jill.

222
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,910
You two are finally together.

223
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,030
But the thing about love

224
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,440
is all about timing.

225
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,640
True lovers will not get together

226
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,520
until the right time comes,

227
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,760
even if they've known each other
for many years.

228
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,440
That's what you meant

229
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,710
the other day?

230
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,110
Then what do you think?

231
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,840
You do think that Lu Xun and I...?

232
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,110
That was a long time ago.

233
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,030
I've put it all behind me.

234
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,080
Thanks to Qian Chuan,

235
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,790
who let me let go of it all.

236
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,110
In fact, you never

237
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,320
fell in love with me.

238
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,150
You agreed to be with me

239
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,230
only because you were moved,

240
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:45,910
right?

241
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,590
I'm sorry,

242
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:52,400
Qian Chuan.

243
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,640
I know

244
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,550
you still love Lu Xun

245
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:00,000
just like I still love you.

246
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,590
Zixin,

247
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,200
being with someone who doesn't love you

248
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,840
only makes it more frustrating.

249
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,840
So I don't want you

250
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,670
to be like me.

251
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,320
This is a big world.

252
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:21,640
Just go

253
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,030
after what you really like.

254
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,110
That'll give you

255
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,550
the sense of accomplishment.

256
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,960
All this time,

257
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:35,150
I just wanted you to be happy.

258
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,030
Stop crying.

259
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,030
From now on,

260
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,230
without me making you laugh,

261
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,000
remember

262
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:55,910
to smile more often.

263
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,000
Qian Chuan.

264
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,960
Thank you.

265
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,280
You will definitely meet

266
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,080
the right person.

267
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,520
I'm sure you will.

268
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,520
When we were in college,

269
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:59,280
everyone thought

270
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,640
that the person Lu Xun liked was me.

271
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,350
But in fact,

272
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:03,960
it has always been my unilateral crush
on Lu Xun.

273
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,320
He didn't wanna hurt my feelings.

274
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,150
So he didn't deny the rumor.

275
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,350
I, out of ego,

276
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,110
haven't

277
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,320
clarified it either.

278
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:16,400
Qian Wei,

279
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,000
I'm sorry

280
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,200
for letting you misunderstand
for so many years.

281
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,440
No, it's fine.

282
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,150
At that time, we were too young

283
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:25,470
and hadn't seen

284
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,670
the B side of the world.

285
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,440
But fortunately,

286
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,640
now we've grown up.

287
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,200

288

00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,000
The response

347
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,520
to this mobile App is really good.

348
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,470
This week,

349
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,670
three companies have come
to talk about investment.

350
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,030
By the way,

351
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:50,790
Guanghua University has also

352
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,150
agreed to cooperate with us.

353
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,350
It's all because of her.

354
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,880
Did you guys swift the role?

355
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:08,840
Assistant Lu?

356
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:18,000
Tastes as bad as before.

357
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,200
Go ask Qian Wei

358
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,470
about how to make it.

359
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,440
See you.

360
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:41,620
(I'm done.)

361
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,710
(Hello, Miss Qian.)

362
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,030
(Your boyfriend is dying)

363
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,440
(because someone has left him alone.)

364
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:53,840
(Save him or not?)

365
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,500
(Qian Wei)

366
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,900
(Yes.)

367
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,590
(Your boyfriend has moved
to a new place.)

368
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:07,710
(Please go to the location tonight
to save him)

369
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:09,640
(with artificial respiration.)

370
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,580
(Rongchuang Mansion B)

371
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:25,980
(Qian Wei)

372
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,460
(Qian Wei)

373
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,760
Lu Xun,

374
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,000
your sweetheart

375
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,590
is giving us a presentation right now,

376
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,400
so her phone is connected to the screen.

377
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,950
She went out to grab some documents.

378
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,190
Surprise!

379
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,920
Lu Xun.

380
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,520
The message you just sent to her

381
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,230
is mature and modest

382
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,000
in a playful way.

383
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
And the words are sharp

384
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,640
and inspiring.

385
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,680
Excellent!

386
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,760
Today we don't work overtime,

387
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,800
let's go directly to Lawyer Lu's
after work

388
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,560
to hold a housewarming party

389
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,640
and each of us shall give him…

390
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,590
... Artificial respiration!

391
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,110
Artificial respiration!

392
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:06,000
Artificial respiration!
Artificial respiration!

393
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:08,920
Artificial respiration!
Artificial respiration!

394
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:09,710
Lu Xun,

395
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:10,880
I almost forgot.

396
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:12,950
Look.

397
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,680
(Jurisprudence and Modern Civil Law)
It was from 1951.

398
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,400
Tao, look at you!

399
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,640
How dare you

400
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:23,710
bet such a good wine

401
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:24,520
on me!

402
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,710
(I can't believe it)
(that Lu Xun's paper folding skill)

403
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,920
(is due to it.)

404
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:29,400
(I've only heard)

405
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,190
(that a lawyer teaches the assistant.)

406
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,040
(I was the other way around.)

407
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,280
(So it's not like I lost.)

408
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:35,920
But

409
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,920
they were trying to extract

410
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,880
the details about cooperation
between Fawei

411
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,640
and Guanghua.

412
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,950
(The dog is here. The book is here.)

413
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:46,430
(The crystal ball in my dream
must be here too.)

414
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:47,760
(I don't believe I can't find it.)

415
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,760
You should have known

416
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,760
they had donated labs and facilities
to the university

417
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,590
when you were in college.

418
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,230
Recently,

419
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,920
they have also co-organized a college

420
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:58,350
through this legal aid program.

421
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,070
But there is one thing
I don't understand.

422
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,560
Fawei

423
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,280
is not a threat to Qingyun,

424
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,830
nor does it have any competition
with them.

425
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:08,560
Why?

426
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,950
Why did they wanna ask

427
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:10,950
for such information?

428
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,430
Hey.

429
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:15,190
What are you looking for?

430
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,430
What do you want?

431
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:17,310
We're not married yet.

432
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:19,230
And you've started
to liquidate the joint property.

433
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,400
I think

434
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,680
the decoration of your house

435
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,560
is too monotonous.

436
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,470
I wanna look

437
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:25,230
for something

438
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,070
that is

439
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,350
round and shiny.

440
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,350
Round?

441
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:30,880
And shiny?

442
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,710
Are you looking for a bulb?
[*Bulb means the third person playing gooseberry.]

443
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,230
Look at here.

444
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,800
What are you talking about?

445
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:37,800
What's going on?

446
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,350
Alright,

447
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,160
guys.

448
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,470
I am here

449
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,000
to speak up for you.

450
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,470
Lu Xun.

451
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,560
You're cuing me with that bulb thing.

452
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,230
There's no way

453
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,040
I came to your house without anything.

454
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,950
I've brought you something.

455
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:54,800
Okay, give it to me. Come on.

456
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,110
Let me see

457
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,400
what you've brought for me.

458
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,760
A little talent show.

459
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,070
Qian Wei!

460
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,280
Leave me alone.

461
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,190
Let me finish.

462
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,230
Hurry!

463
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:09,950
Action.

464
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:20,950
Your…

465
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:23,040
Your boyfriend can't breathe.

466
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,560
He needs to take immediate

467
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,110
a-a-artificial…

468
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,040
artificial respiration now!

469
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:28,920
Okay, okay.

470
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,520
Don't try to buy me off
with a bottle of wine.

471
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,350
This is not a cheap one.

472
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,400
It works better than a defibrillator.

473
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,190
I'll take it back if you don't want it.

474
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:43,920
If you'd said that earlier,

475
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,160
I wouldn't have imitated you.

476
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:47,830
Seriously.

477
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:48,950
I didn't expect this

478
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,000
can be that expensive.

479
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,190
Let me see.

480
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:52,830
I propose

481
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,190
we have one last drink

482
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,800
and then we'll pull out.

483
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,310
Someone

484
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,830
is sick of us

485
00:20:58,830 --> 00:20:59,830
being light bulbs.

486
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:00,310
Come on, come on.

487
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,560
Bottoms up!

488
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,830
Come on, come on.

489
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:03,640
Come on, come on.

490
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,830
Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!

491
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,310
Hey.

492
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,190
What're you doing?

493
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,560
I thought it was a gift for me?

494
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:09,710
See you, Lu Xun.

495
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:12,830
The wine…

496
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,190
I know what you're looking for.

497
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:24,640
Come here.

498
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:38,640
Are you ready?

499
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,560
Back then,

500
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,230
the younger me was not able

501
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,310
to give you

502
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,590
such a spectacular Ferris Wheel

503
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,560
but a small version instead.

504
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,560
But after all these years,

505
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,830
it's time to give you a big one.

506
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,880
In fact,

507
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,280
when we were in the hospital,

508
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,000
we were

509
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,430
facing the Ferris Wheel.

510
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,560
That's why it was rotating clockwise.

511
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,880
But the house I bought

512
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,590
is at the back of the Ferris Wheel.

513
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,350
It's rotating counter clockwise.

514
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,590
So I hope

515
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,280
that time can be reversed.

516
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,160
If I had the courage at that time

517
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,920
as I do now,

518
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,280
I might be with you much earlier.

519
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,830
What you didn't have the courage
to do now,

520
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:44,640
the younger Lu Xun has done it

521
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,040
for you in my dreams.

522
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:49,160
He looks much more handsome
than you do.

523
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:54,000
You paid so much

524
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,160
for this suite,

525
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:56,350
what would you do

526
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,590
if the two of us

527
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,470
weren't together?

528
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,800
Then at least we both

529
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,520
see the same direction.

530
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:03,950
No. Wait a minute.

531
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:04,640
Now this

532
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,070
is not the main problem.

533
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,640
You just said that the younger Lu Xun

534
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,920
is better than me now,

535
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:09,560
right?

536
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,350
Yeah.

537
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:11,920
He is

538
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,310
the cute and loyal type

539
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,590
and he apologized to me
when he was wrong.

540
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,830
Unlike you,

541
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,800
he could be gentle

542
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,560
and he even knitted me gloves.

543
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,430
I'm telling you, Qian Wei.

544
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:23,880
I know

545
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,880
you're trying to provoke me again.

546
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:26,830
You know,

547
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,680
the best way to clear a file

548
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,880
is not to delete it.

549
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,680
Do you know what it is?

550
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,280
What?

551
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,040
You overwrite it.

552
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:54,650
Catch him!

553
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,160
Stop!

554
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,640
Beat him!

555
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:18,800
The condition you describe

556
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
is a memory misalignment.

557
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,590
The stage
that people sleep the deepest

558
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,310
is the rapid eye movement period.

559
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:27,590
The brain stores daily information

560
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,880
while people dream.

561
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:31,950
You have had a head injury.

562
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,160
The brain nerves
are also not very stable.

563
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,800
Plus the human brain

564
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,040
has the ability to recognize signals

565
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,470
that we can't recognize

566
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:40,800
in our waking state.

567
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,310
Your subconscious mind

568
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,640
triggered these signals

569
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,040
and thus created
memory misalignments,

570
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:48,400
which are the dreams you mentioned.

571
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:49,950
But the things

572
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:51,400
that happened in my dream before

573
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,190
did happen in reality.

574
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,590
The main thing is that, this time,

575
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:55,560
I dreamed something

576
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,350
particularly bad.

577
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,110
It's serious.

578
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:57,710
So…

579
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,230
We should not deify dreams.

580
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,160
Otherwise, there will be a risk

581
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:05,070
of being affected by them instead.

582
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:06,640
What you read in broad daylight,

583
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,640
is what you dream at night.

584
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:08,830
Dreams

585
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,160
are a projection

586
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:10,590
of the people,

587
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:11,110
things,

588
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,350
and objects you care about most.

589
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:15,310
But some details

590
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:15,800
can be influenced

591
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,310
by your subconscious mind.

592
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:18,880
For example,

593
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,070
a patch of grass.

594
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:24,800
In a pessimist's dream,
it would be for a funeral.

595
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,280
In an optimist's dream,

596
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,190
it would be for a wedding.

597
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,520
(Whether the dream is true or not,)

598
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,560
(I should do something about it,)

599
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,640
(trying to prevent)

600
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:39,310
(the nightmare coming true.)

601
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,400
(The scene in my dream)

602
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,680
(seems to be an underground garage.)

603
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,880
(I have to stop Lu Xun)

604
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,160
(to go to this kind of place.)

605
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,520
Have you ever

606
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,920
made any enemies?

607
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:55,400
Of course I have.

608
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,560
Who is it?

609
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,710
You.

610
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:58,880
But...

611
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,310
I've already admitted defeat.

612
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,110
No, except for me,

613
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,160
is there someone else who hates you?

614
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:04,880
No, not really.

615
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,640
They all use

616
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,950
a dating app these days.

617
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,430
The couple on the software,

618
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:12,920
can watch movies,

619
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,000
listen to music,

620
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,400
and can also share their location
in real-time.

621
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,760
Why don't we download one, too?

622
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:18,800
Wait a minute.

623
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,520
You think I don't know

624
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,430
what you're thinking?

625
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,190
Don't you just wanna check
out my phone?

626
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:23,640
Come on.

627
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,310
Here you are. Here you are.

628
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:25,680
My cellphone,

629
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,590
and my wallet.

630
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,680
Do you want my coat?

631
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,280
Forget it.

632
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:30,880
We're in the hospital.

633
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,680
It's not decent.

634
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,950
I gotta pay attention to my image.

635
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:33,560
I've given them all to you.

636
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,000
What do you worry about?

637
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:37,430
Why bother trying

638
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,190
to find all sorts of ways…

639
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:38,920
No…

640
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,280
…to check me?

641
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:39,760
I just think

642
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,070
that having

643
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:41,760
such a dating app

644
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,280
is good for our relationship.

645
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,540
(Warmly welcome the leader of Qingyun Project,
Prof. Wang visited our school to give a speech)

646
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,070
Okay.

647
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:48,520
Professor Wang,

648
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,920
thank you for your analysis

649
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,230
of the focus of this year's LSAT.

650
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:52,230
I've got a question.

651
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,950
One of the questions in the mock exam
was about

652
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,920
the accounts of the internal affairs dept.
during the Daoguang period.

653
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:57,680
An egg cost 30 taels.

654
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,800
What test point does this involve?

655
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:01,280
Please sit down. Please sit down.

656
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,280
This is a very good question.

657
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,070
Actually, this question is

658
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,920
about Xi Qian.

659
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,430
Xi Qian,

660
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,310
it means "Money Laundry" in English.

661
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,430
It's

662
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:13,190
the act

663
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:15,190
of legalizing illegal gains.

664
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,590
In the 1920s,

665
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:18,920
in Zhi Jia Ge,

666
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,760
Chicago, in English,

667
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,000
the Mafia

668
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,920
set up a laundry.

669
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,470
Every night,

670
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,400
when they counted

671
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,590
the laundry income,

672
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:29,280
they added the illegal proceeds

673
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,310
to the tax returns

674
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,160
and taxed them

675
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,160
so that

676
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:36,070
the dirty money became legal.

677
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:39,560
This is where the name
of "Money Laundry" came from.

678
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:41,760
So,

679
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,230
the egg that was worth three pennies

680
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,830
in the Daoguang period,

681
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,920
was reported as 30 taels.

682
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:48,280
As soon as the accounts were evened out,

683
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:49,950
they would enrich themselves

684
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,280
with the price difference.

685
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:52,520
These two cases

686
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,520
aren't in the same way.

687
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,280
But both of them

688
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,000
are illegal.

689
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,520
The school building

690
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,070
will be completed in a few days.

691
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:15,880
This project

692
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,640
has been going very well.

693
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:18,560
Don't forget

694
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,000
why the buildings were built
in the very beginning.

695
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,230
Don't let the building be completed

696
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:24,590
and other things collapse.

697
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,040
Fawei Online and Guanghua

698
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,230
have reached an agreement.

699
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,000
All these years,

700
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,350
Qingyun

701
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:36,070
has been the exclusive sponsor
for Guanghua.

702
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:39,040
Even the accountants
of the school foundation

703
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,560
were from AES.

704
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,800
If Fawei becomes

705
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,280
a new funder,

706
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:47,000
then they will have the right to check

707
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,800
the school's previous accounts.

708
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:49,950
Like the school labs

709
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:51,160
we donated

710
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,950
and the money used
to build the new school

711
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:54,280
will probably be turned over.

712
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,350
I know.

713
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,640
So I've been very discreet

714
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,110
with the accounts

715
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,230
where Guanghua has never
dipped their fingers in.

716
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,040
On the outside,

717
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,070
they're flawless.

718
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:08,640
AES is going public soon

719
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,760
and I don't wanna hear

720
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,800
about any scandals.

721
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,000
Qingyun project has always been
under your control.

722
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,190
As for how exactly to process,

723
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,640
I'll leave it to you to decide.

724
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,560
I only care about the result.

725
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,470
You guys won't let me down,

726
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:20,920
will you?

727
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,160
Come on.

728
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:34,230
Fawei has just

729
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,230
come online.

730
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,160
It doesn't have any foundation.

731
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,160
A large legal aid case

732
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,040
will definitely get us

733
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:40,950
into trouble.

734
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,470
Not to mention

735
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,280
that Guanghua will never cooperate

736
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,110
with a flawed

737
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,280
and controversial platform.

738
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:50,430
It is easy to be caught

739
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,470
if we take the initiative.

740
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,800
Isn't it the easiest way
to solve the problem

741
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,830
with money?

742
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,280
If we buy out Fawei,

743
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,520
and make it AES's

744
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,190
App,

745
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:04,710
then it wouldn't be

746
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:05,830
a new funder

747
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:07,830
who's able to check the accounts.

748
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,520
If you are sure about this,

749
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,680
you can talk to them.

750
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,400
If not,

751
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:14,800
don't hesitate to break it off.

752
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,350
I know

753
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,710
these people in charge of Fawei

754
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,110
are your classmates.

755
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,680
But in this case,

756
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,190
you must not compromise.

757
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:24,920
Once they find out

758
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,310
that there are problems
with the accounts,

759
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:28,190
they'll know our dirty little secrets

760
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,110
of Qingyun project
for the poor students.

761
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,430
When the time comes,

762
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:35,430
both of us won't be able
to get away with it.

763
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:39,950
Chongwen,

764
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,680
in fact, I trust you the most.

765
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,830
When we were in college,

766
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,800
you helped me
to pacify the poor students,

767
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,560
and privately signed a contract
with them.

768
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,190
The grant is not allowed

769
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:52,520
for those who can't
meet the performance standards.

770
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,110
The amendment got me

771
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:54,920
out of

772
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,230
the potential risks and duties.

773
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,640
You're quite smart.

774
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,310
That's why

775
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,560
I've been helping you.

776
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:04,230
I understand,

777
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:05,190
Professor Wang.

778
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:06,830
A person

779
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,070
who has stumbled out of the gutter

780
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,470
must not wanna look back again.

781
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:12,710
But you gotta

782
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:14,070
get the ability

783
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:16,760
to fill in the gutter.

784
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:21,560
Look,

785
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,160
you take one more step forward,

786
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,760
and you are embraced

787
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,760
with a brand new life

788
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:29,590
without flaws.

789
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:33,310
It's late.

790
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,110
I should go to the hospital

791
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,760
to visit Ms. Yuan.

792
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:39,640
Just work hard.

793
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:08,230
Remember.

794
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,800
You can only go

795
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:11,280
when I tell you to.

796
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,880
Mr. Wang.

797
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,590
Glad to see you here again.

798
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,070
You're so kind.

799
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:19,800
You're divorced

800
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,710
and you still take care
of your ex-wife so well.

801
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:21,680
Thank you for your efforts.

802
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:21,950
Okay.

803
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:22,400
You go first.

804
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,040
I gotta go.

805
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,560
Okay, okay.

806
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:23,920
See you later.

807
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:24,470
See you later.

808
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:27,710
Do you remember?

811
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,760
I thought

812
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,350
there was something wrong
with Impact before,

813
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:47,070
but I never thought
they would be so bold

814
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,640
as to run away with the money.

815
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,400
The "Court of Law" has been put on hold.

816

Although

817
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,160
legally,

818
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,590
Cool Visitor isn't jointly
and severally liable,

819
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:56,070
the bunch of people in the crew

820
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:57,430
just simply don't understand.

821
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:58,470
That's why

822
00:32:58,470 --> 00:32:59,830
they sent people to make trouble.

These photos seem a bit familiar.

825
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,950
I remember that

826

Fawei App

827
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,710
has also received

This is a big deal now.

831
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,520
They're both the perpetrators

832
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,520
and victims.

834

Don't worry.

835
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,000
The amendment

836
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
is very well done this time.

837
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,040
Legally speaking,

838
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:45,920
Cool Visitor doesn't have the obligation

839
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,190
to pay more.

840
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,680
Next,

841
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,000
we will help the crew

842
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,310
to collect the money

843
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,350
from Impact.

844
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,280
Please give us some time.

845
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,280
But look,

846
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,160
these crew members

847
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,040
are blocking the entrance

848

851

it'll cause damage to our image.

If they

853
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,470
were not that emotional,

for our future projects.

859
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:16,520

00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,870
(in the underground garage
of Cool Visitor?)

865
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,150
Forget it.

866
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,870
I'll go talk to them.

867
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:35,470
I'll go.

868
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:36,390
I'll go.

869
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:38,470
It's dangerous for you to go.

870
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:39,910
What if

871
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:40,630
they attack you?

872
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,710
They are ordinary workers,

873
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:43,950
not the gang.

874
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:44,870
Besides,

875
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:46,470
I've been to the set with Zixin before.

876
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:47,630
I've met with them a few times,

877
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,760
so I know them well.

878
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,280
I'm sure I'll get the work done.

879
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:52,800
All right.

880
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,190
Here.

881
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:53,950
Put this on.

882
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,470
What is it?

883
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:58,560
It's a lucky pendant.

884
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,320
By wearing this,
God will bless you to be safe.

885
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,120
Put it on.

886
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,150
I don't believe in that kind of thing.

887
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,470
Put it on.

888
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,120
Put it on.

889
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:08,910
Look.

890
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:10,360
You take care of the indictment,

891
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,560
and I'll see you when we're done.

892
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:19,600
Thank you.

893
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,870
Let's drink some water first.

894
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:24,800
I'm Qian Wei,

895
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,390
the head of Fawei Online.

896
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:27,040
I've received

897
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,600
your request for help.

898
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:32,040
(Qian Wei, Intern Attorney)
Just an Intern Attorney.

899
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,150
We have posted a lot of requests

900
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,230
for help online.

901
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,670
What a coincidence

902
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:38,560
that Miss Mo's lawyer

903
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,630
is on our radar!

904
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:41,360
What?

905
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:41,910
Miss Mo?

906
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,430
Zhanying did accept

907
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:45,230
the consultant job offer
from Cool Visitor.

908
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:46,600
But this won't affect

909
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,230
the impartiality of Fawei.

910
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,840
The target of your wage claim

911
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,870
is Impact Pictures.

912
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:51,760
Cool Visitor

913
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,000
is only one of the producers.

914
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,760
The company is also the victim.

915
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:57,000
I want

916
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:57,800
to help you guys,

917
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,910
to help both sides to mediate.

918
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,670
Nice try.

919
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:03,120
Why should we believe you?

920
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:03,560
Yes.

921
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,080
Why?

922
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:04,630
We want money.

923
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:05,520
We just want money.

924
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,710
We want money.

925
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:07,950
You're the team leader,

926
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:08,670
Mr. Wang,

927
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:09,360
right?

928
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,670
Wang, the extra.

929
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,560
Lighting, Ma.

930
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,800
Stage property, Zhang.

931
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,390
This should be the grip, Liu.

932
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:17,000
Am I right?

933
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:18,800
I have read all of your profiles

934
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,630
carefully.

935
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:22,630
And I'm clear about your requests.

936
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:23,670
Besides,

937
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,080
the service we provide

938
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:25,950
is charitable.

939
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,520
It's free.

940
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:28,760
So why not give it a shot?

941
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:31,760
We could try it.

942
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,630
Yeah, it's free anyway.

943
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:33,150
Yeah.

944
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,000
Yeah, let's try it.

945
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,280
We want our money back.

946
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:35,840
Yeah.

947
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:36,630
Okay then.

948
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,320
Let's try it.

949
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:37,710
Let's try it.

950
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:38,230
Yeah. Let's try it.

951
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,470
Okay.

952
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:40,390
We'll give it a shot.

953
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,800
You'd better

954
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,080
come up with a solution.

955
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,190
If you can't help us,

956
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:49,520
we'll keep on fighting with them.

957
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,190
Yeah.

958
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,430
Yeah, we will.

959
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:04,150
I know you've been

960
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:05,630
forced to do so.

961
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,390
Yes.

962
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,760
But Mr. Wang,

963
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,000
I believe you're also a nice person.

964
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:10,670
No matter what,

965
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:11,910
we can't do

966
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,230
illegal

967
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,320
and excessive behavior.

968
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:15,080
You can rest assured

969
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,190
that I will find

970
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:17,120
a legal

971
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,190
and reasonable solution for you.

972
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,220
(Li Chongwen)

973
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,280
I don't wanna meet you.

974
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,080
Fine.

975
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:46,710
Give me the address.

976
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,340
(LOVE ING)

977
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:56,700
(Couple Map, near me)

978
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:00,520
Mr. Wu,

979
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,800
are you going to inspect

980
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,430
a wetland development project

981
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:03,600
on the outskirts of town this afternoon?

982
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:09,710
(There are too many loopholes
in the contract.)

983
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,600
(It only stipulates the base salary.)

984
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,520
(About the overtime pay,)

985
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,430
(it's all verbal agreements)

986
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:15,190
(and has never been clarified
in the contract,)

987
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:17,230
(which makes it hard to get it back.)

988
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,080
(Besides,)

989
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:19,150
(Impact is not the employer)

990
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:20,280
(in the contract.)

991
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:21,950
(They used a labor agency)

992
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:22,950
(signing the contract
with the employees.)

993
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:24,910
(It's tough
to demand the unpaid salary.)

994
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:27,040
(It takes time to sue Impact.)

995
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,630
(And I'm not sure that we can win.)

996
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:31,430
(What should I do?)

997
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:41,540
(Your love is moving.)

998
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:45,360
What's going on?

999
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,120
Where is he going

1000
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,190
instead of working at the company?

1001
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,710
AES's acquisition offer of Fawei

1002
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:15,910
has already been rejected

1003
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:17,280
by Director Tao.

1004
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,190
Why do you wanna meet me again?

1005
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,800
I just wanna

1006
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,670
have a fight with you.

1007
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:33,390
Great.

1008
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:35,190
That's exactly what I have in my mind.

1009
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:44,190
Come on.

1010
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:53,150
Did you know

1011
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,430
that I liked Qian Wei,

1012
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,910
so you confessed to her

1013
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:58,040
right before me?

1014
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:03,120
Yes.

1015
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:05,950
But I didn't care who came first.

1016
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:08,120
I knew she still loved me

1017
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,280
and I wanted her to be happy.

1018
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:15,910
Happy?

1019
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,760
You're saying
that you wanted her to be happy?

1020
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,360
She's been waiting for you
for four years.

1021
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,600
You used

1022
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,520
and trampled on the career

1023
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,360
which she thought was priceless.

1024
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,280
And now you're telling me
that you want her to be happy,

1025
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:30,280
Li Chongwen!

1026
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,230
Right.

1027
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:43,910
It was my fault.

1028
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:46,040
I didn't get her.

1029
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,430
But now, I do.

1030
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,760
I wanna get her back.

1031
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,190
Until you showed up.

1032
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:00,630
Beat me!

1033
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:02,910
Why did you stop?

1034
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:12,000
Is this what Qian Wei gave to you?

1035
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:15,000
I won't wanna

1036
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,120
hurt her feelings.

1037
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:19,910
Actually, I came here today

1038
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,040
to teach you a lesson,

1039
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,670
but she seems happy

1040
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:26,320
with you.

1041
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,190
I thought I'd let it go.

1042
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,470
I don't wanna say congratulations.

1043
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:32,870
All I ask is

1044
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:34,670
that treat her well.

1045
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,230
Don't be like me.

1046
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:40,630
Sure thing.

1047
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,320
I will treat her well.

1048
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:53,840
You're here today for AES,

1049
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:56,800
so just tell me what you have to say.

1050
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:00,390
I think AES

1051
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:01,560
has already come to you.

1052
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:04,320
So I'll cut the crap.

1053
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,520
I just want

1054
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,120
to persuade you, as a friend,

1055
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:09,230
to accept the acquisition.

1056
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:13,910
Don't you know

1057
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,150
Qian Wei?

1058
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,360
This is the dream
she has worked so hard

1059
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,470
to accomplish.

1060
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:21,280
Do you think she will give it away?

1061
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,910
Not to mention selling it to AES.

1062
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:25,560
AES has been oppressive

1063
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,600
for its competing parties,

1064
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:29,230
and it has better supporting facilities

1065
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:30,630
than Zhanying.

1066
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,670
If the acquisition is done,

1067
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:33,190
even if

1068
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:34,390
the management right belongs to AES,

1069
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:35,630
you won't lose out.

1070
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:37,360
Instead, you'll get more cases.

1071
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,670
It will bring you

1072
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:39,190
more resources

1073
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:40,120
and much better influence

1074
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,190
than work with Guanghua,
isn't that good?

1075
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,430
(It's Qingyun Project again.)

1076
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:49,190
Qingyun Project

1077
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:50,910
is a public service program

1078
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:51,870
that AES launched

1079
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:52,800
to build

1080
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,230
a better brand image.

1081
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:56,120
It doesn't have any competition

1082
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,120
with Fawei.

1083
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,520
You came here in person today.

1084
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,190
It shouldn't be that simple.

1085
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:02,390
Just tell me.

1086
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,000
I know Qian Wei well.

1087
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,230
I know Lan He as well, too.

1088
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,040
If you care about Qian Wei's safety,

1089
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:19,670
and Fawei Online's development,

1090
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,390
please take the acquisition offer.

1091
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:30,470
I don't care about Lan He.

1092
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:32,710
I just wanna achieve the dream

1093
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:34,000
of Qian Wei and me.

1094
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:35,950
Besides,

1095
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,600
I appreciate

1096
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:40,710
that you came here
under such great pressure

1097
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:41,630
to tell me about this.

1098
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,600
I'll tell you what,

1099
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:47,710
stay well at AES

1100
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:48,670
and be safe.

1101
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:53,390
As for Qian Wei and Fawei,

1102
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,390
I'll watch over them.
