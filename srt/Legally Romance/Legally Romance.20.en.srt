Yes.

No nonsense.

Uh.

20
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,150
If you don't take it,

It's OK.

You'll take the exam anyway.

Shall I put it off for a year

34
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:26,480
and take it with you together?

35
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,480
Not all because of him.

36
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,440
It's mainly because

37
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,630
I want to be No.1.

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,680
change your plan for my sake.

it rains

What are you murmuring?

85
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,790
Did you go inside to get an umbrella?

86
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,230
What did you think?

87
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,920

you wanted to go to the bathroom,

you'll review the lessons with me.

Turns out that's not

92
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,550
what's on your mind at the moment.

In the case of a wedding anniversary,

105

it's not good
to give a pair of silver pigs as a gift.

106
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,040
I'll have this one.

107
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,270
OK.

108
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,760
You don't know better.

109
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,000
Such kind of real gold and silver

110
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,640
hold its value well

111
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,070
and its value will only increase later.

112
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,350
What's more, I tell you what,

113
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,880
it's not a golden wedding anniversary,

114
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,110
or

115
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,040
I'll just give this one as a gift.

116
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,790
Too expensive, too expensive.

117
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,510
It's really hard

118
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,720
to read women's minds.

119
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:41,480

In this case,

124
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,110
I'll have a pair of gold pigs

125
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,440
from the same collection.

126
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,320
It can hold its value well.

127
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,320
It's better to see its value increase,

128
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,110
like what she said just now.

129
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:54,640

But I can order a pair for you.

135
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:01,480
Why don't you

136
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,880
leave your contact number

137
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,320
and I'll call you to pick it up
when it's available?

138
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:04,880
OK.

139
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:08,550
Miss,

140
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,230
are you paying by card or in cash?

141
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:10,790

The match hasn't started yet

154
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,040
and you begin to think of losing?

155
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,950
My sense of water is just right today.

156
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,920
I'm trying to break a record.

157
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,320
OK. With Team No.2's fate,

158
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,880
you act as a member of Team No.1.

159
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,270
Show us what you got today.

160
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,720
Remember to warm up.

161

and ear-training exam today.)

163

(Do you also)

164
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,550
(have a match today?)

165
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,040

being the winner today.)

You are drinking in the daytime.

174
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:44,230
I failed
the audition and ear-training exam.

175
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:45,960
The teacher said

176
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,150
I might not be able to graduate

177
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,320
with such a level of intonation.

178
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,640
It's OK.

179
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,080
You can also take a make-up exam
for your second major.

180
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,200
Do you think I really

181
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,550
don't have a musical talent?

182
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,760
Of course not. You…

183
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,440
Take the call.

184
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,880
Maybe there's some good news

185
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,080
which can make me happy too.

186
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:12,640
Hello, who is it please?

187
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,110
Qian Chuan was drowning with a cramp

188
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,200
during the friendly match,

189
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,080
and he's nowhere to be found

190
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,960
after being sent to the infirmary.

191
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,880
He used to have cramps often.

192
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,000
But during a few months of not swimming,

193
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,320
he also has cramps in his legs.

194
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,960
He always wanted to join the team,

195
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,880
so he kept it a secret all the time.

196
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,350
But this time he injured

197
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,150
his inguinal ligaments

198
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:34,910
and was diagnosed with acute bursitis,

199
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,350
so he must be on acupuncture treatment

200
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,280
for over half a year.

201
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,440
Acupuncture treatment?

202
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,550
But isn't he training intensively

203
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,550
for the championship?

204
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,710
But he must

205
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,080
receive thorough treatment this time.

206
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,350
But ever since

207
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,710
Qian Chuan became an athlete,

208
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,280
he hasn't spent a day without swimming,

209
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,320
come rain or shine

210
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,200
or even when he's ill.

211
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:52,110
Yes.

212
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,520
For a swimmer,

213
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,000
his sense of water is what matters most.

214
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,880
Staying out of water for half a year

215
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,960
is nothing less than retirement.

216
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,030
Team No.2 is ready to give

217
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,000
a notice of withdrawal.

218
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,150
Well, sir,

219
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,760
can he still train

220
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,840
while receiving treatment?

221
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,640
It's not necessary to make him quit.

222
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,030
Team No.2 has issued

223
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,400
a public notice
on his condition of illness.

224
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,670
You can go and have a look.

225
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,880
Not that we want to give up on him.

226
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,230
Just that if he goes on like this

227
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,110
with torn ligaments

228
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,200
and deformed joints,

229
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,440
he'll even have problems with walking

230
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,200
later on.

231
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,000
Qian Chuan!

232
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:25,350
Qian Chuan!

233
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:29,710
Qian Chuan.

234
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:31,790
Qian Chuan.

235
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,030
What are you doing?

236
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,030
You've mistaken me for someone else.

237
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,320
Qian Chuan!

238
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,880
Make more sappers.

239
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,030
What are you doing?

240
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:50,590
Where is Qian Chuan?

241
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,910
Did you see him?

242
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:53,670
Don't know.

243
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,350
Could it be that

244
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,440
the things and fates I forcibly changed,

245
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,590
even if they developed as I wished
for a short time,

246
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:04,790
after that

247
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,590
they'd be back to square one again?

248
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,640
Could that be the case
for Dad's illness too?

249
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,030
Then what's the point

250
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,110
of everything I did?

251
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,400
Find out more about fitness
and swimming.

252
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,670
Are you OK?

253
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:57,840
What happened?

254
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,150
Miss,

255
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,470
are you interested in
weight loss or body-shaping?

256
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,320
We are offering huge discounts

257
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,110
these days.

258
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:04,590
Sorry,

259
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,280
we don't need this.

260
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:05,710
Thanks.

261
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:15,840
Are you all right?

262
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:19,230
You haven't eaten all day.

263
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:20,230
It's only normal for you to feel dizzy.

264
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,350
Qian Chuan is an adult.

265
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,470
I'm sure he'll be fine.

266
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,230
Don't worry.

267
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,080
Do you think

268
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,440
it's because I've been too insistent

269
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,960
that Qian Chuan…

270
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,550
…got injured?

271
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,440
If I wasn't being insistent

272
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,880
and let him rest instead,

273
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,320
he wouldn't get injured

274
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,000
and he'd at least

275
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,470
be able to swim happily
for another year.

276
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,030
It'd be better than

277
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,280
getting and losing it as things are now.

278
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,320
What do you mean by being insistent?

279
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,760
Actually,

280
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,760
actually I'm…

281
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,030
Nothing.

282
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:46,350
Sorry.

283
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,840
There's no celebration dinner.

284
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,150
With my leg like this,

285
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,710
I can't ride on the Big Pendulum
with you again.

286
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,880
Instead of a celebration dinner,

287
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,710
do you like some frustration beer?

288
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,030
I was the last in the exam today.

289
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,910
We are kind of unlucky companions.

290
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,000
I haven't drunk for a long time

291
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:29,880
in order to keep a good state.

292
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,350
Now things are different.

293
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:35,230
From now on,

294
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:37,790
I can drink as much as I like.

295
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,350
Don't say that.

296
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,230
I really envy you.

297
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,550
Although you failed for the time being,

298
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,150
you still have chances
in the days ahead.

299
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,080
Things are different for me.

300
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,230
After practicing for so many years

301
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,910
and suffering so many hardships,

302
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:02,080
I finally realized my champion dream

303
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,110
and got into the national team.

304
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,960
I was just about to show my potential…

305
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,520
Everything suddenly comes to an end.

306
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,960
Over the years,

307
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,440
I seem to have been living
for one thing -

308
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:26,880
swimming.

309
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,590
Now I can't swim.

310
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,080
I don't know

311
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,080
what I'm living for.

312
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:38,910
Have you finished
your disheartening words?

313
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,110
Don't you have compassion,

314
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:41,590
Shiyun?

315
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,640
I'm falling apart.

316
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,400
It's just because I have compassion

317
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,080
that I hit you.

318
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,230
If you go on talking,

319
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,320
it'd be the end of the world

320
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,280
and you'd find a place to hang yourself.

321
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:50,400
This,

322
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,080
you can have it back.

323
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:55,910
You think it brings bad luck?

324
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,550
To you,

325
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,470
this may be a symbol of honor.

326
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,400
But to me,

327
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,960
it's a charger to replenish courage.

328
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,110
Actually, I've always known

329
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,080
I don't have a lot of

330
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,910
talents for music.

331
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,150
You said you envy me.

332
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,400
I actually envy you more.

333
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,520
You are more talented

334
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:21,590
and more courageous than me.

335
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,080
You have achieved the best result.

336
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:25,910
This shining point

337
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,230
is something many people can't achieve

338
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,080
in their lifetime.

339
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,710
Now I'm fully charged.

340
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,320
There's nothing to fear.

341
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,280
It's time for me to give it back to you.

342
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,760
Life is long.

343
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,110
As long as you don't give up,

344
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,230
your dream will always come back to you

345
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:52,880
in one way or another.

346
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,000
(Chuan,)

347
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,760
(cry to your heart's content)

348
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,840
(Dad)
(if you want to.)

349
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:03,760
Dad,

350
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,040
I'm sorry.

351
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,310
I said I'd be an athlete

352
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,590
and make you proud.

353
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:12,040
(Son,)

354
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:15,110
(I'm still proud of you now.)

355
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,190
Did you forget?

356
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:18,070
When you were
learning swimming as a child,

357
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,350
I didn't agree

358
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:20,800
and didn't let you go.

359
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,680
Then you convinced me.

360
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,760
Not because you said

361
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,560
you'd be No.1,

362
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,000
but because you really liked it.

363
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,350
What's more,

364
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,160
you took up swimming
because you like it,

365
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,950
not because you wanted to

366
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:33,920
become a champion.

367
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:37,560
It's only normal to get injured.

368
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,830
Even if you can't swim later on,

369
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:40,640
you can still

370
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,760
be a coach

371
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,680
to train those kids

372
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,430
who want to learn swimming as you did.

373
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:48,830
Nine times out of ten life is
a frustration.

374
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,350
Being able to get over the frustrations

375
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,400
is a true skill.

376
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,280
(Dad)
(That's also what you live for.)

377
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:01,710
I'm sorry.

378
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,680
It's not your fault, Wei.

379
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,400
Thank you.

380
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,160
Thank you for what you said.

381
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,590
Because of those words,

382
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,760
at least

383
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,640
I once burned bright.

384
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,470
I'd rather lose what I got

385
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,560
than having never got it at all.

386
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,040
Well,

387
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,280
can I ask

388
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,560
what it is that you said?

389
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,560
Heaven's secrets must not be divulged.

390
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,350
Hello, Dad.

391
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,110
Have you

392
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,350
felt unwell these days

393
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:50,110
or is there anything wrong with you?

394
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,400
You've looked through

395
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,680
my checkup report again and again.

396
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,280
Don't focus your attention

397
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,920
on the past all the time.

398
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,190
Do you know?

399
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,310
Cherish the person right beside you,

400
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,760
like

401
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,590
Lu Xun.

402
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,070
I tell you what,

403
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:06,950
you guys stay out of

404
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,430
my wedding anniversary.

405
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,470
Your mom and I
have our own way of celebrating it.

406
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,760
By the way, I come to think of it.

407
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,350
Is it almost time

408
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,830
for your bar exam?

409
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,110
How are you getting on
with the preparation?

410
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,310
Well, after all is said and done,

411
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,310
why are you talking about me again?

412
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,640
I'm talking about
a serious matter with you.

413
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,560
You

414
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,560
always show such an attitude.

415
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,400
You always don't take it seriously.

416
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,160
You must stay in good form physically

417
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,350
and mentally.

418
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,400
Do you hear me?

419
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:29,800
I tell you what,

420
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,400
if you don't listen,

421
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,310
I'm gonna tell Mom

422
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,230
where you are hiding your pocket money.

423
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,640
OK, OK, OK.

424
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,000
I'm not gonna offend you.

425
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:35,800
I'm not gonna offend you,

426
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:36,560
OK?

427
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,230
Make sure you take care of yourself.

428
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,470
Don't get angry often.

429
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:01,070
What are you doing?

430
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,680
What are you doing?

431
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,160
Since you've come,

432
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,920
you can't just leave.

433
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,230
Cheer me up, by the way.

434
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,350
Well, to cheer you up,

435
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,590
you guys can do just that.

436
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,230
Why are you dragging me in?

437
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,280
You must go up there.

438
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,520
As I see something

439
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,430
has gone to your head lately.

440
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:16,430
You have a lot on your mind.

441
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,760
You need to chill out.

442
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,000
Go.

443
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,830
I have nothing on my mind.

444
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:19,680
- Don't dilly-dally.
- I don't want it.

445
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,400
- I really don't want a ride.
- Go up to the sky and fear nothing.

446
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,470
Let's go.

447
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:55,590
I've done mine.

448
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,190
What are these?

449
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,110
So obvious. Can't you see?

450
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,040
Pigs.

451
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,920
Why are there five of them?

452
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,470
Are you a pig?

453
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,160
Qian Wei…

454
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,000
Well, why do we

455
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,640
have to be pigs with you?

456
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,470
You've bought two pigs yourself.

457
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:15,000
I…

458
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,590
Qian Chuan!

459
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,470
Well,

460
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:20,880
I bought 100 balloons

461
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,880
and you've punctured

462
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,590
20 or 30 of them.

463
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:24,070
I wanted to make them 99,

464
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:24,830
but now I can't even

465
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:25,560
make them 66.

466
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,400
Qian Wei,

467
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,070
can you have a limit to being a miser?

468
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,230
Since you've bought so many balloons,

469
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,310
can't you buy an inflator as well?

470
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,590
Your sister has been a miser for so long

471
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,590
and you've only got to know now?

472
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,640
Is it me who's a miser?

473
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,640
It is the seller.

474
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,070
Well, you still dare to hit me.

475
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:37,950
The seller is a miser.

476
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,560
Don't…don't touch me!

477
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:39,640
You scared the wits out of me.

478
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,160
You even…

479
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,710
- How could you hit your sister?
- He's hitting me!

480
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:44,040
I'm hitting you too.

481
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,590
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

482
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,560
They are coming.

483
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:49,710
Be quick, be quick.

484
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,110
Mom, Dad,
happy silver wedding anniversary!

485
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:05,640
This is amazing! Amazing.

486
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,350
Thanks, thanks.

487
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:07,470
My darlings,

488
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:08,310
thanks, thanks.

489
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,640
Don't call them Mom and Dad.

490
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,280
They are my Mom and Dad.

491
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,070
Call them uncle and auntie

492
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:11,680
in a proper way.

493
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:13,760
You don't know better.

494
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,160
This is called uniformity.

495
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:15,950
We are acting in unison.

496
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:16,350
Do you get it?

497
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,070
Yes.

498
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:19,190
Wei, Mom and Dad have answered.

499
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,190
You can't say no.

500
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,160
Exactly.

501
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,680
Whose side are you on?

502
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,110
He hit me.

503
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:26,920
Why do you hit your sister?

504
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,520
He hit me.

505
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,070
Mom, Dad,

506
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,310
of all the dishes on the table,

507
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,560
Qian Wei only stewed

508
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,400
the turtle soup

509
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,110
and brother-in-law and I

510
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,040
cooked everything else.

511
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:06,950
I'm relieved then.

512
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,190
The food is certainly not poisoned.

513
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:09,640
I knew you'd do this.

514
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,190
A small-minded man claims the credit.

515
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,760
Fortunately,
I've prepared something beforehand.

516
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,040
Here you are.

517
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,560
I see you guys have wanted this

518
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,680
for a long time.

519
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,830
The weather happens to be nice recently.

520
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,520
(Haizhou International Cruise Co., Ltd.)
Just take this opportunity

521
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,800
(Haizhou International Cruise Co., Ltd.)
to go on a tour.

522
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,230
Once in a blue moon.

523
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,310
In my lifetime,

524
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,430
I can even see a miser like you

525
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:27,640
cough up money.

526
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:29,590
This… this… this…

527
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,680
This is just too…

528
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,950
Deluxe Double Room with Seaside View.

529
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,950
This… this… costs over 10,000 yuan.

530
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:36,640
Did you make a fortune, daughter?

531
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,160
Right. Where did you get so much money?

532
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,400
Haven't I told you guys?

533
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,400
I have supernatural hunches.

534
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,470
You guys just don't believe me.

535
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,110
During my first year at college,

536
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:45,310
I thought highly of Steve Jobs,

537
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,830
so I bought a lot of Apple's shares.

538
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:47,920
Then I made profits.

539
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,190
I had a hard time rustling up the money.

540
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,710
Awesome, awesome, awesome.

541
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,280
Good.

542
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:55,920
Wait a moment.

543
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,310
I knew

544
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,640
you'd give us a surprise today.

545
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,070
So

546
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:01,560
I'm gonna give Wei

547
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,470
a surprise today.

548
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,590
I've been…

549
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,950
…been waiting for fully three years.

550
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,640
I intended to give it to you guys

551
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,520
at your wedding reception.

552
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,230
But I think today

553
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:15,070
is also quite a good day.

554
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:15,920
Wait for me.

555
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:18,040
Uncle, is there also something for me?

556
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:18,830
Wait to see it.

557
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,680
You see, how nice uncle is to me!

558
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,350
Right?

559
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:24,800
Qian Wei,

560
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,430
have you also bought a full package of

561
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:28,560
wedding photo services

562
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,590
for yourself and Lu Xun?

563
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:31,520
Then…I'd be really thrilled.

564
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,400
Wouldn't someone beat me to it

565
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,070
if there was such a chance?

566
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:44,280
I've told you umpteen times

567
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,400
to put the stuff away.

568
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,520
It's broken quite a few times.

569
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,430
Qian!

570
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:11,280
Qian! Qian!

571
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:12,400
Dad!

572
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,280
Internal bleeding.

573
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,070
Let him lie flat.

574
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,280
Lu Xun, call an ambulance.

575
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,110
OK.

576
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,310
It's internal bleeding

577
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,190
caused by a relapse of leukemia.

578
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,830
Fortunately, he was sent here in time.

579
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,880
Now he's in a stable condition.

580
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,470
A few days' observation is needed.

581
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,160
We'll make a new treatment protocol

582
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:48,560
if his condition remains stable.

583
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:50,470
If…

584
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:52,800
Internal bleeding
puts him in a very dangerous state.

585
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:54,710
We are already injecting coagulant

586
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:55,830
and giving him a blood transfusion,

587
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:57,920
but still you'd better

588
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,710
brace yourselves.

589
00:25:59,190 --> 00:25:59,880
Brace ourselves?

590
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,230
For what?

591
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:02,950
Today is my parents'

592
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:03,710
silver wedding anniversary.

593
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:04,920
How do you want us to brace ourselves?

594
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,190
Sorry, sorry.

595
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,190
Doctor, we got it.

596
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:10,110
OK.

597
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,640
Now we need to get
the hospitalization procedures.

598
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,430
We'll then get some daily necessities

599
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:20,560
for uncle.

600
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,230
We'll go out later

601
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,680
and you go with me to get them.

602
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,160
Lu Xun, thank you.

603
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:28,760
I'll stay here with my mom

604
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,070
to talk to him.

605
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,230
I'm OK. I'm OK.

606
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,000
It's such a good anniversary.

607
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,950
But I ruined it.

608
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,280
Did you get cut by the shards of glass?

609
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,470
Give me my clothes.

610
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:44,590
There's something in my pocket.

611
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,070
This one?

612
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:52,190
This is it.

613
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,560
Daughter,

614
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,590
nine times out of ten life is
a frustration.

615
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:04,800
Your mom and I

616
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,070
also came into this world

617
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,880
for the first time.

618
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:11,590
There are a lot of things

619
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,280
to which we can't give you

620
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,590
the right answers.

621
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:21,230
If you run into difficulties,

622
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,160
just twirl it around.

623
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:28,640
When you are twirling it,

624
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,830
that's me helping you
come through difficulty.

625
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:38,950
Take it.

626
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,520
I have no difficulties

627
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:46,800
as long as I have you with me.

628
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:56,230
Are you hungry?

629
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,310
Are you hungry?

630
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:08,310
Why am I so hungry?

631
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,070
There is a shop

632
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,470
selling jujube congee downstairs.

633
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:16,880
Get me a bowl of it.

634
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:17,920
OK. OK.

635
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:18,710
OK.

636
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:23,560
And a razor,

637
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,040
I didn't bring one.

638
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:26,590
Bring one for me.

639
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,590
A razor.

640
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:29,190
I'm not hungry.

641
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:30,560
I'll stay here with you.

642
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,070
I'll be right here watching you.

643
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,470
I want a shave.

644
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:36,230
Chuan and Lu Xun are here.

645
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,230
Let your dad have a rest.

646
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,070
Go.

647
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:40,680
Go.

648
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,110
Let's go.

649
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:29,640
Although your father didn't say it,

650
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,800
you are actually the one

651
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,950
he's most concerned about deep down.

652
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,640
We all worry about

653
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:41,880
his illness.

654
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:43,950
Actually

655
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,680
that's not what he worries about at all.

656
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,800
What worries him is

657
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,040
what we are gonna do

658
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,000
in the days ahead.

659
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,470
He wants to see you pass the bar exam

660
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,830
and get a bachelor's degree.

661
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:02,950
I see.

662
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,040
I'm willing to exchange all I have

663
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,400
for his health and safety.

664
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:09,040
But this is something…

665
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,470
we don't want to see as parents.

666
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:55,400
The patient's vital signs

667
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,710
are declining rapidly.

668
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:58,350
I'm afraid we can't save him.

669
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,950
This is a notice of critical condition.

670
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:01,110
Let his family member sign it.

671
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,520
Dad,

672
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,070
please don't go.

673
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:08,590
If you go,

674
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:09,920
who can make Mom happy every day

675
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,560
and take her on a tour?

676
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,560
My sister and I haven't got to

677
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,230
do our filial duties yet.

678
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:14,000
Dad,

679
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:15,430
I'm not gonna turn things around.

680
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:16,280
Let's give up turning things around.

681
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,350
I can give up anything.

682
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:18,160
Can you…

683
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:18,880
Can you come around?

684
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,920
I give up everything.

685
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,310
Come around, OK?

686
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:22,830
I really…

687
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:24,350
Didn't you say it works if I twirl it?

688
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,040
Look,

689
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,000
look, I twirled it.

690
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,800
I twirled it.

691
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,160
I love you, too.

692
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,350
We all love you.

693
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:26,100
(Warning of Excessively Low RR)

694
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:40,700
(Emergency Center)

695
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:56,660
(I want 1,000 eyes of the eternal night
to set my eyes on you only)

696
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,520
Turns out the light of the Ferris wheel
would go out too.

697
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,830
It will light up again.

698
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:10,950
No.

699
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,710
Not anymore to me.

700
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,840
All this is a sham in the first place.

701
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,560
No matter how hard I try,

702
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,710
things won't change.

703
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:25,800
The same with you.

704
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,360
I'll lose you sooner or later.

705
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,430
No, Qian Wei.

706
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,870
I'll wait with you till dawn

707
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,040
for the Ferris wheel to light up again.

708
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:47,040
Even if it's pitch dark,

709
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,190
I'll hang stars over the sky for you.

710
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:51,760
Believe me.

711
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:20,470
Qian,

712
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,150
you love cleanliness

713
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:25,230
and you love to look attractive.

714
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,080
As we agreed,

715
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:33,630
in our afterlife

716
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,950
in the darkroom,

717
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:41,000
you are still gonna hold my hands.

718
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,280
Do remember.

719
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:01,150
(Dad,)

720
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,080
(No.20 Xin'an Road)

721
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,430
(turns out I'm still a child.)

722
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:05,430
(There are too many things)

723
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,000
(I can't wrap my head around.)

724
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:08,630
(Why do you think)

725
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,040
(we only come to realize)

726
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,360
(how to cherish and love)

727
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,120
(after having to say goodbye)

728
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,120
(and only get to know)

729
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:18,000
(we once owned a priceless treasure)

730
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,520
(after losing it?)

731
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,040
Are you really not coming with us?

732
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,840
Dad always wanted to

733
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,190
travel with Mom alone.

734
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,670
It's enough
to have you as a third wheel.

735
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:37,080
I've also got to
take care of household affairs.

736
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,230
Watch out for your safety.

737
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,150
OK.

738
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:52,360
Wei!

739
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:54,870
I love you.

740
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,120
Did you know?

741
00:36:58,670 --> 00:36:59,870
Now I know.

742
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:01,190
Go.

743
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:15,600
(Fighting against overwhelming grief)

744
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,470
(and regret,)

745
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,520
(we clean up our rooms,)

746
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,390
(adorn them with flowers,)

747
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,870
(roll out new carpets,)

748
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,150
(play new music,)

749
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,800
(watch new shows)

750
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:26,430
(and have new pastimes.)

751
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,360
(It seems we've slowly filled)

752
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,710
(those depressing moments.)

753
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,340
(Mom and Dad
Happy Silver Wedding Anniversary)

754
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,320
(It isn't until a certain moment)

755
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,150
(that demands our wholehearted devotion)

756
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:38,800
(that I come to realize)

757
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,360
(the empty holes)

758
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,600
(under the carpet)

759
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,280
(can never be filled up in a lifetime.)

760
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:46,630
(No matter how fast I run,)

761
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,670
(there's always
a black hole in the universe,)

762
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:51,320
(standing still)

763
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,600
(to sweep me)

764
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,630
(into its vortex.)

765
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:59,820
(September 3, 2011 Wei)

766
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:01,600
(I knew)

767
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,950
(you'd give us a surprise today.)

768
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,430
(So)

769
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,120
(I'm gonna give Wei)

770
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,040
(a surprise today.)

771
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:07,840
(September 3, 2011 Wei)

772
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,670
(I've been…)

773
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:10,320
(…been waiting for fully three years.)

774
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:11,870
(I intended to)

775
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:12,870
(give it to you guys)

776
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:13,600
(at your wedding reception,)

777
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,390
(but I think today)

778
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:16,230
(is also quite a good day.)

779
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:49,630
(Don't worry, auntie.)

780
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:51,430
(I'll keep Qian Wei company.)

781
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:06,900
(Gift for Mom and Dad's
Silver Wedding Anniversary)

782
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,430
Stop drinking, Qian Wei.

783
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,630
What brings you here?

784
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:56,080
Is it because my mom and Qian Chuan

785
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,150
are worried about me?

786
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,000
Don't worry.

787
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,080
I've promised Dad

788
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,470
to take good care of myself.

789
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:03,430
I said stop drinking.

790
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:04,080
What are you doing?

791
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,840
Dad left this to me.

792
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,320
Your father left you more than these.

793
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,390
Do you think he'd be happy

794
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:10,430
if he saw what you are doing now?

795
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:11,760
He wouldn't want to see you doing this.

796
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,470
Don't you get it?

797
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:13,870
Qian Wei,

798
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,230
can you be sober?

799
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:21,800
It doesn't matter.

800
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:25,190
He can't see it anyway.

801
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:27,840
Isn't it that you don't care?

802
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,150
Let go of it, let go of it.

803
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:33,470
I said stop drinking.

804
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:35,150
Leave me alone!

805
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:42,870
What are you doing?

806
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:44,840
What are you doing?

807
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:48,150
You know good and well

808
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,000
what your father expected

809
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,150
and what he wanted to see.

810
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:51,000
But now,

811
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,360
everything you are doing

812
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,870
is against his wishes,

813
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:54,470
Qian Wei.

814
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:56,870
You don't go to college.

815
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:58,230
You are absent from exams.

816
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,560
You care about nothing,

817
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,150
even Fawei Online.

818
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:02,950
You don't take the bar exam.

819
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:03,870
You just hold the alcohol every day,

820
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:05,600
drinking like a fish by the toilet.

821
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,150
Do you think this makes sense?

822
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:09,470
Yes.

823
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:11,040
I'm a good-for-nothing,

824
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,120
OK?

825
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:12,910
The hard-working me

826
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:14,120
you saw before

827
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,040
is all fake.

828
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,080
I'm indeed a good-for-nothing.

829
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,040
I'm indeed beyond redemption.

830
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:20,630
My father is dead anyway.

831
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:21,470
Whether I'm doing well or not,

832
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:22,190
living a happy life or not,

833
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:22,710
working hard or not,

834
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:23,600
what's the point of that?

835
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,630
Uncle knew

836
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:39,760
you would not take the bar exam

837
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,870
because of him.

838
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:42,470
This is a letter

839
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:43,390
he wrote you beforehand.

840
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:45,150
But if you decide

841
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:46,000
this is the way

842
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,360
to process your emotions,

843
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,000
I suggest

844
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
you'd better not read this letter.

845
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,430
But if you really care about him,

846
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,470
concern about him,

847
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:56,840
wipe your face dry.

848
00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:00,280
I beg you to keep a cool head.

849
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:03,040
I'll be waiting for you
