1
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:04,800
Now, I'm convinced

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:06,510
that your dream is accurate.

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:09,390
I wish you weren't

4
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:10,190
and none of that

5
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:11,350
happened.

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,310
Well...

7
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:16,840
Are you still mad at me

8
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:17,870
for doubting you at first?

9
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:20,470
I promise

10
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:21,520
that from now on,

11
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,310
whatever you say

12
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,230
or do,

13
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:25,390
you'll have my complete trust
and support.

14
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:26,070
OK?

15
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,040
I'm not mad at you.

16
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:29,200
I'm mad at myself

17
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:33,110
for being unable to do anything.

18
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:34,880
I mean,

19
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,430
whatever I do,

20
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:39,840
it won't make any difference,

21
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,150
right?

22
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,040
You're wrong.

23
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:44,880
Look,

24
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,400
you said

25
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,590
I'd be stabbed in the abdomen,

26
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,720
but actually,

27
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,150
someone else

28
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,430
cut my hand.

29
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,840
You changed it,

30
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,680
didn't you?

31
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:55,750
That didn't count.

32
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:57,310
Of course it did.

33
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:58,790
Let me ask you something.

34
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:00,880
If one day

35
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,200
you saw that we'd break up,

36
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,120
would you

37
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:04,830
still be with me?

38
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:06,360
Yes.

39
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,550
I rest my case.

40
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,360
Your dream

41
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:13,230
isn't reality.

42
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,360
It only reflects

43
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,510
your subconsciousness.

44
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,360
Even if it's true,

45
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:17,360
it only says

46
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,310
about a period,

47
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:19,480
but the end

48
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,590
is...

49
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,440
is still

50
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,270
in our hands.

51
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:25,760
I'll show you something

52
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,510
to prove it.

53
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,760
Thanks to the police,

54
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,190
(Mo Zixin)
the crew found out

55
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:37,720
(Mo Zixin)
it was Mr. Wang

56
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,590
and they've apologized to me and Fawei.

57
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:42,360
Really?

58
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,440
As tough as all that was,

59
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,270
it was a happy ending,

60
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,190
wasn't it?

61
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,230
Your dream didn't say that, did it?

62
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,590
You know

63
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,870
what your dream is like?

64
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,190
It's like sonar

65
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,510
finding objects underwater at night.

66
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,160
It can show you roughly

67
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,870
what's lying ahead,

68
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,360
but can it

69
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,510
tell you

70
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,360
about every rock

71
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,040
or island?

72
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,510
No!

73
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,480
Are you gonna

74
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,310
give up

75
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,400
your trip

76
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,590
or dream

77
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,390
for fear of not knowing it?

78
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:09,030
No way,

79
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:09,880
right?

80
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,600
Alright, no more tears.

81
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,470
Look,

82
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,080
whether or not

83
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,720
you can see everything in the dark,

84
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,270
you've got me, right?

85
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,550
I'll be your scout.

86
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,910
I'll go first.

87
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:22,520
Once I say it's clear,

88
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,360
you can come over,

89
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,360
OK?

90
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,520
No matter good or bad things

91
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,720
will happen to us,

92
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:28,360
you know,

93
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,630
as long as we're together,

94
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,910
we'll always be the happiest couple.

95
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:32,440
I'll let you in

96
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,240
on another secret,

97
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,110
a huge one

98
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,270
that I've been

99
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,080
keeping from you.

100
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,830
The Lu Xun in front of you right now

101

is from 2030.

102
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,360
Your guy is waiting for me to go back,

103
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,160
but I don't want to.

104
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,270
He... Last time, he said he'd buy me...

105
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,320
Knock it off!

106
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,520
So us together

107
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,440
can ward off bad luck,

108
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,830
right?

109
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,110
You bet!

110
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:05,390
If one little move of yours

111
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,470
could change everything,

112
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,670
with us combined,

everything is possible.

Keep this ring for me, will you?

115
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,240
I no longer believe

116
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,600
those dreams can predict the future.

117
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,750

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,000
stall our case.

180

00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,230
to Qingyun

183
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,950
have all been closed.

184
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,110
And

185
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,110
they've made Yu Tian their CFO

186
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,390
to replace Yuan Qiao.

187
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,390
I guess

188
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,070
the accounts of Qingyun Project

189
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,200
look fine now.

190
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,000
The new report

191
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,230
of the accounting firm

192
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,950
has deleted the original reservations

193
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,320
and the audit report.

194
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,270
But

195
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,880
we still have a card left,

196
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,200
information about Wang Ruogu's divorce.

197
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:43,550
We didn't think

198
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,110
it'd help with the case

199
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,000
against AES,

200
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,440
so Qian Wei

201
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,040
left it in the safe.

202
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,830
Look at this.

203
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,720
Wang Ruogu's offshore account

204
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:58,790
has received money of various amount

205
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:59,950
on different days

206
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,440
all from

207
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,200
domestic accounts.

208
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,390
They purchase

209
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,320
foreign currencies individually

210
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,200
within the maximum amount

211
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:07,950
and send it

212
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,110
to the same account.

213
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:09,790
You know what?

214
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,070
As long as

215
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:11,760
their money is sent

216
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,720
on different days,

217
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,320
the bank

218
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,760
might never

219
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,600
suspect anything.

220
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,790
See this?

221
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:17,950
Here.

222
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:20,040
Wang Ruogu even took the money

223
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,230
for the poor.

224
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,920
What an animal!

225
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,790
A greedy monster!

226
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:28,920
How could he do this?

(List of Students Funded by
Qingyun Project over the Years)

228
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,920
Qian Wei has got the list

229
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,440
of students funded by Qingyun Project

230
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,950
over the years.

231
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,440
We'll find more

232
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,110
other than Wang Ruogu's corruption

233
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,160
and embezzlement of student grants.

234
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,040
Once we file the case,

235
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,070
all the accounts

236
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,390
of Qingyun Project

237
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,640
will be reaudited

238
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,000
and AES's money laundering

239
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,790
will definitely be exposed.

240

(Wang Ruogu Stole Money from Qingyun
Students of Guanghua Wrote a Joint Letter)

I've only taken over

242
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:01,790
the finances of Qingyun recently.

243
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,480
Why do you insist on

meeting me?

245
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:05,670
What do you want?

246
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,550
Whether it's like you said

247
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,720
or you've surfaced from

248
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,390
under the water,

249
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,600
we both know the truth.

250
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,510
I asked

251
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,390
to see you

252
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,320
as we were

253
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,670
in the same debate club.

254
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:20,390
I should give you a heads-up

255
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,670
for old times' sake.

256
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,480
Let's get straight to the point.

257
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,230
I can't give you what you want.

258
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,950
If you think

259
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:33,030
I don't have enough evidence,

260
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,150
why did you come here

261
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,200
instead of

262
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,590
continuing ignoring me like before?

263
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,550
Look,

264
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,470
you were a law student, too.

265
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:42,960
Although you don't practice it now,

266
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,710
you should know

267
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,080
the sentence

268
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,760
for money laundering.

269
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:50,350
If you

270
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,230
turn yourself in now,

271
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:52,550
you'll be looking at

272
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,470
five years maximum.

273
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,550
According to my knowledge,

274
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,030
other than the Bursary Agreement,

275
00:08:59,030 --> 00:08:59,710
those students

276
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:00,880
also signed another one.

277
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:02,760
Whether this joint letter

278
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,760
will be admitted

279
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,350
as evidence or not

280
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,320
is still unknown.

281
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,320
So,

282
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,000
don't bluff.

283
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:12,960
You think

284
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,150
this is all I've got?

285
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:15,960
If I didn't have

286
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,840
enough evidence,

287
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,280
would you think

288
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,470
I'd be here

289
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,080
and have this conversation

290
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,280
with you?

291
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,550
You know,

292
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,030
the connection

293
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,640
between Qingyun and AES

294
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:26,960
is no longer a secret.

295
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,150

for others.

306

It's not worth it.

307
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:48,000
That'll be all.

308
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,280
Just think it over.

309
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,280
Give me some time.

Don't get too excited,

Wang Ruogu

318

trusts no one.

If he finds out

320
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,280
about your rendezvous with Yu Tian,

321
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,590
he'll surely suspect her.

322
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,790
I'm telling you the truth.

323
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,350
I was there to fish for information

324
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:30,840
and see

325
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,710
how much they've known.

326
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,470
Why didn't you tell me

327
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,470
about the meeting?

328
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,470
The meeting

329
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,440
shows

330
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,350
Yu Tian

331
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,350
means to protect herself

Besides,

I've shown her

337
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,350
the joint letter.

338
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:46,520
I've seen their joint letter.

339
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,640
It's a much bigger mess

340
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,670
than you said.

341
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,760
I hate to sell Qingyun out

342
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,440
as much as I hate

343
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,230
to take any risks

344
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,470
or be your scapegoat.

345
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,710
But I don't think

346
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,550
she'll

347
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:55,110
turn her back upon them

348
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,030
right away.

After all,

350
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,440
they're in the same boat,

351

which is, I'm afraid,

352

sinking.

But, hey,

373
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,400

That was a lot of work.

381

much more than a cup of coffee.

00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,040
I'm going back to work.

530
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,830
How many times have I said

531
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,230
to show your forehead as a girl

532
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,470
to look good?

533
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:08,190
You must be busy

534
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,830
with work lately.

535
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,590
It was my fault

536
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:15,110
that I had high hopes for you.

537
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,520
If you can't do business,

538
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,830
then go get married.

539
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,040
Maybe

540
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,920
you're better at that.

541
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,560
Dad,

542
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,640
I chose the wrong person,

543
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,640
but I'll take care of

544
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,520
all that money from Guanghua.

545
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:39,710
It won't delay

546
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:40,680
our IPO.

547
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,830
Your mistake

548
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:45,880
is our family's mistake.

549
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:49,160
Those geezers on the board

550
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,310
are giving me an earful of you.

551
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,560
It gives me a headache.

552
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:03,640
Dad,

553
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:07,070
give me one more chance.

554
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,830
Two weeks are all I'm asking for.

555
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,190
I'll

556
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,350
get rid of

557
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,280
those two stupid lawyers

558
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:15,280
and shut the board members up.

559
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:17,680
You have

560
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,800
my word.

561
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:23,880
President,

562
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,190
Ms. Lan has had the best accounting firm

563
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:27,800
handle the accounts.

564
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:29,560
And

565
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:31,160
I've convinced the board

566
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,190
that everything is under control.

567
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,280
No matter what happens,

568
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,520
Ms. Lan

569
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,800
should be the CEO.

570
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,520
It's OK

571
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,830
to have a lawn to decorate the yard

572
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:52,400
as long as

573
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,280
it doesn't take too much of your time

574
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,950
to trim it.

575
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,680
Otherwise,

576
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,310
you'll regret it.

577
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,980
(Evolution)

578
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,470
Two weeks it is.

579
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,430
Then

580
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:18,830
your brother will be back.

581
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,040
Let me show you something.

582
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,350
I found

583
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,070
this injured bird

584
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,160
at ten.

585
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,280
When I asked Dad to save it,

586
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
he said

587
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:02,640
cuckoos like it

588
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,070
would throw their kids out

589
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,110
in order to

590
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,710
survive,

591
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,310
and the little ones

592
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,230
would also

593
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:13,070
elbow their weakest sibling out.

594
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,190
Then I turned that bird

595
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,110
into this specimen

596
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,280
to always remind myself

597
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,710
of never being

598
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,710
the weakest bird

599
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:29,160
that got elbowed out.

600
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,920
I need to get the IPO done

601
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,760
before my brother comes back.

602
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,430
Otherwise,

603
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:41,680
all that I've done

604
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,000
will be worthless.

605
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:45,590
He'll reap what I've sown

606
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:46,760
and I'll be

607
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,950
his steppingstone.

608
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:52,680
Well,

609
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,800
none of that has anything to do
with you.

610
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,830
If you

611
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,560
decide to leave,

612
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,760
I'll destroy all the evidence

613
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:03,760
and try my best to get you out of it.

614
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:06,710
That said,

615
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,950
no one can stop me

616
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,230
from going public.

617
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,560
If we could go back

618
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,160
to the day we first met,

619
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,430
would you get off the bus?

620
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,230
There are no ifs.

621
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:06,760
Now,

622
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,590
it's too late to get off.

623
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,760
Wei.

624
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,230
What?

625
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,070
What's this?

626
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:30,800
Is it like the Poisoned Apple?

627
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,070
No!

628
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:33,190
Put it there.

629
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,640
Do you need a favor?

630
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:43,070
Wei,

631
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,110
Liu Shiyun's parents want to see me

632
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:51,350
and meet you and Mom.

633
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:53,000
Hey, you!

634
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,400
Good job!

635
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:55,310
OK. Let's do it.

636
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,760
When Mom gets back

637
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,880
from her trip,

638
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,400
we can meet each other.

639
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,000
Are you nervous?

640
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,920
You're a lawyer,

641
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,640
a lawyer-to-be,

642
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:09,920
and people respect lawyers,

643
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,680
you know.

644
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,350
While I

645
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,470
own a gym,

646
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,000
and I don't want Liu Shiyun's dad

647
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,680
to think

648
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,160
that I've only got muscles,

649
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:18,920
not the brain

650
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:20,310
or I'm not good enough for her.

651
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:22,950
Come on, you fool!

652
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,590
If they thought

653
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:25,520
their daughter deserved better,

654
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,560
they wouldn't have asked to see you.

655
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,160
They would've just ignored you.

656
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,920
Now, they simply need to make sure

657
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,040
they can entrust their baby girl

658
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:31,830
to you.

659
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:32,950
Here's my advice.

660
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:34,070
When they arrive,

661
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:34,800
just

662
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,800
pick up your trophy

663
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,710
with both hands and say,

664
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:38,190
"Darling,

665
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:38,950
from now on,

666
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,160
you're my trophy."

667
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,430
That's it.

668
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,400
But I've only

669
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,560
won amateurs

670
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,430
and

671
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,590
come second

672
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:48,280
among professionals.

673
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,070
That's my personal best.

674
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,560
What's wrong with being second?

675
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,830
You're the best

676
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:52,880
in her eyes, right?

677
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:54,350
Come on!

678
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,470
Man up!

679
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,280
Relax.

680
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:56,640
You've got me.

681
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,400
I'll help you.

682
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:57,880
Everything will be fine.

683
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,310
Stop worrying.

684
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:07,660
(Case of Li Shuangren
Holding Back Payment)

685
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,350
Wei,

686
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:13,280
are you

687
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,710
still in touch with Li Chongwen?

688
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,520
No.

689
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:20,110
Why?

690
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,830
I think

691
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,350
he isn't

692
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,040
too bad.

693
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,640
Even if

694
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,430
you two have broken up,

695
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,110
you can still be friends.

696
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
You've got a big heart.

697
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:37,880
OK.

698
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,470
I'll

699
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:39,430
call your girl

700
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:40,110
and tell her

701
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,000
to keep in touch

702
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,800
with her ex.

703
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,560
They can still be friends,

704
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,350
can't they?

705
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:44,070
No...

706
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,590
Please don't!

707
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:46,760
You're hiding something from me,

708
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,590
aren't you?

709
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,800
No.

710
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,520
No?

711
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,230
Fine.

712
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:54,430
You know what?

713
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:55,560
I've got a lot

714
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,950
on my plate right now

715
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:58,040
and I can't go with you

716
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,110
to meet her parents.

717
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:00,000
I think

718
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,920
you'll be fine on your own

719
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,350
despite the fact that her dad is

720
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:04,070
Chairman of the Boxing Association.

721
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:05,070
It's OK.

722
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,070
Just try not

723
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:06,680
to get killed.

724
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,950
No, I...

725
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,760
What is it?

726
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,470
Nothing? OK.

727
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:13,310
I'll...

728
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,470
Fine, I'll say it!

729
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,560
You know,

730
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,040
we wouldn't have gotten there in time

731
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,350
when Zhanying was in trouble

732
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,040
if Li Chongwen

733
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:26,880
hadn't called me.

734
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,140
(Qian Wei)

735
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:43,620
(Lu Xun)

736
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,640
Pick up! Pick up!

737
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,860
(Qian Chuan)

738
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,070
Qian Chuan, it's me.

739
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,000
Your sister and Lu Xun need help.

740
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,920
Call the police! They're at Zhanying.

741
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:02,190
He specifically asked me

742
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,520
not to tell you about it,

743
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,880
but I think

744
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:06,950
you should know

745
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:07,710
what he did

746
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,520
for you.

747
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:15,400
Wang Ruogu

748
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,880
taking money from those students

749
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,590
has something to do

750
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:19,800
with Li Chongwen.

751
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,710
He drafted the supplementary agreement

752
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:24,520
that Yu Tian said.

753
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,140
(Qingyun Project
Supplementary Bursary Agreement)

754
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,190
I've checked

755
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,680
Wang Ruogu's bank statements
these years.

756
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,280
He invested 300,000

757
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,310
(Debit Card Account Statement)
in Chongwei Law Firm

758
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,920
and Qingyun Project

759
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:36,520
and Li Chongwen gave him 100,000

760
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,430
as a kickback.

761
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,640
If we're gonna

762
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,560
push this case forward,

763
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,640
Li Chongwen will be dragged into it.

764
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,590
What do you suggest?

765
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:49,280
As AES's legal director,

766
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,520
he must've known

767
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,590
about their money laundering

768
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,880
but he's helped us more than once.

769
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,560
He called Qian Chuan

770
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:57,560
when they were smashing Zhanying.

771
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:58,920
We should

772
00:31:59,430 --> 00:31:59,920
give him another chance

773
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,760
for what it's worth.

774
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:06,700
(Law School of Guanghua University)
(Constitution Day)

775
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,760
Remember that?

776
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:16,950
That was

777
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:18,040
where we first met.

778
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,800
It's all fixed.

779
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,640
We can no longer go over it.

780
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:34,500
(Constitution Day)

781
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,640
You and Lu Xun

782
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:36,590
invited me to the celebration

783
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:37,560
of the Constitution Day at school

784
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,680
not just

785
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,880
to thank me

786
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:41,680
for calling Qian Chuan,

787
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,950
right?

788
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,760
I think

789
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:48,760
I owe you

790
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:49,760
an apology

791
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,310
for what I did in the past.

792
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,350
When you were drafting

793
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,680
The Wolf Pact,

794
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,920
I was too busy

795
00:32:58,190 --> 00:32:58,760
with the graduation and everything

796
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,920
to notice your pain and struggles.

797
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,470
Every time we fought,

798
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,160
I'd blame you

799
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,230
without considering your feelings.

800
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:05,830
I'm sorry.

801
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,350
Still, never did I imagine

802
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,310
that the one who put you through college

803
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,800
and helped you practice law

804
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,430
would also push you off the cliff.

805
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,070
How did you know

806
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:21,400
that pact was my idea?

807
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,760
When I was in a coma,

808
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,560
I had a dream

809
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,110
where I went back to 2011

810
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,430
and lived

811
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:30,640
as a college student again.

812
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,710
I saw new sides of people

813
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:34,230
that I hadn't realized

814
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:34,760
before.

815
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:36,430
Yours included.

816
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,590
In that dream,

817
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:40,160
you didn't ask Qin Fen

818
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,230
to sign The Wolf Pact

819
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,190
or take that job

820
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:43,640
at AES.

821
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,950
You stuck to who you were

822
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:45,920
and your dream.

823
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:51,800
Have you and Lu Xun found out

824
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,800
what I did

825
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,800
for Professor Wang?

826
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,190
I know what you're doing

827
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:00,040
but this dream

828
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,400
is nothing

829
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,070
but ridiculous.

830
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,280
Unlike Lu Xun

831
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:09,150
who was born with a silver spoon,

832
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:10,520
I only

833
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,870
had 3,000 yuan

834
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,800
when I came to Haizhou

835
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,800
years back.

836
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,710
My mom said

837
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,390
that was

838
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:21,710
all we had.

839
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,600
You think

840
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,230
I enjoy bending to money?

841
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:26,950
I don't.

842
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:28,150
But what else could I do?

843
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,040
Justice is

844
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:33,190
easier said than done.

845
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:35,120
You know

846
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:35,800
how much it takes

847
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,560
to uphold it?

848
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:40,670
Listen,

849
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:43,470
Lu Xun and I are gonna

850
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:44,080
report AES's money laundering

851
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,950
to the police

852
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:47,760
and China Banking and Insurance
Regulatory Commission.

853
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,430
I'm here

854
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,870
because we'd like to

855
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:52,670
give you one last chance

856
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:53,800
to turn yourself in.

857
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:55,840
You know

858
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,360
how that will affect the sentencing.

859
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:00,320
You shouldn't

860
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,520
sacrifice all your effort

861
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,040
and talent

862
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,560
for

863
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,760
a dirty company.

864
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:12,710
Thanks,

865
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:14,870
but

866
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:15,950
it's already too late.

867
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:18,760
My only card

868
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,760
is me

869
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:21,120
and I've played it

870
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:21,870
a long time ago.

871
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,120
I can't quit now.

872
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:29,800
Now that

873
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,120
the two of us

874
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,040
are on different sides,

875
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:35,040
we'd better

876
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,040
not see each other again.

877
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,710
But

878
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:40,670
if anything happens to you,

879
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:41,760
what about your mom?

880

I've never told anyone about this.

How did you know?

883
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:31,390
You told me

884
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:32,710
in my dream

885
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,320
about you and your father.

I don't believe it!

In that dream,

you met a boy

890
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,320
who was Qin Fen's son.

want that innocent boy

to go through

became another you,

so

901
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:00,840
you stopped his father

902
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,040
from signing The Wolf Pact.

903
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,560

915
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,360
I still remember

916
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:53,670
how passionate and devoted you were

917
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,190
