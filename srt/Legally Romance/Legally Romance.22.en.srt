1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:02,750
We can

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:04,280
draft an internal agreement

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,000
with equity dividends,

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,280
increases in year-end bonus

5
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,390
and quicker promotions

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,920
to tempt their employees

7
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,190
to give up their annual leaves,

8
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:12,960
overtime pay

9
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,840
and their previous year-end bonuses.

10
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,200
It'll be issued to and signed with
the middle and senior management.

11
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,790
Finally, we give

12
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:19,680
this agreement

13
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,040
a high-sounding name,

14
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:23,710
- which is Wolf Pact.
- Wolf Pact.

15
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,310
Wolf Pact.

16
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:35,240
It seems you and I

17
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,630
are really telepathic.

18
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:38,750
It's not that Li Chongwen and I

19
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,360
are telepathic,

20
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:40,910
but that

21
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:42,040
this Wolf Pact would become

22
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,630
notorious in the legal circle later on.

23
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,470
The Wolf Pact

24
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:47,680
goes against
the original intention of the labor law

25
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,400
by exploiting

26
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,270
employees' anxieties

27
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,400
and forcing them to give up

28
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,040
a series of benefits

29
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:52,680
they are entitled to

30
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,750
under the labor law.

31
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:55,720
Later on,

32
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,200
any lawyer

33
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,150
would think

34
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,150
this is a cunning and clever idea,

35
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:01,360
but

36
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,950
any lawyer with a conscience

37
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:04,830
would hate

38
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,270
its ruthless and exploitative nature.

39
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,120
Just that

40
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,760
I didn't know

41
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:13,800
this was

42
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,190
Li Chongwen's idea.

43
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,630
Actually, there's no need to

44
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:19,510
force the employees to sign it.

45
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,160
As long as one person signs it,

46
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,590
all others will follow suit.

47
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,230
Because in the workplace,

48
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:25,000
people have

49
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,270
a sick mentality,

50
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,440
which is fearing that

51
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,950
if I don't do it,

52
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:31,440
someone else surely will.

53
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:35,480
We can keep

54
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,270
a Plan B.

55
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,720
If Qin Fen

56
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,040
insists on making a big deal out of it,

57
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,270
we'll let HR

58
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:41,270
talk about compensation with him.

59
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,310
We'll have the money transferred

60
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,480
from a personal account to him,

61
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,120
so that we can just sue him

62
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,230
for fraud and extortion

63
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:48,000
without further worries.

to draft

67
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,680
a plan and an agreement.

68
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,310
Sorry, Mr. Zhang.

69
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:58,950
I'm probably

70
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,230
not competent for this case.

71
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,480
The bottom line of my morals

72
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,310
doesn't allow me

73
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,680
to serve such a case.

74
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,630
You guys are ruining his whole life.

75
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,590
He shouldn't be treated this way.

76
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,270
Do you think

77
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,160
lawyers are saviors?

78
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:12,110
Lawyers are Party B.

79
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:12,800
Party B is obligated to

80
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,030
serve Party A.

81
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,270

someone else surely will.

Even if I don't

85
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,110
make this proposal,

86
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,360
someone else will.

00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:28,750
from your inner heart?

89

Did you also

90

enter law school

91
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,080
with such a mentality?

as brave as you.

in normal times.

I didn't expect

he'd propose such a plan today.

he'd be different this time.

00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,640
but

178
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,160
if I just

179
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,600
let it slide,

180
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,550
I'll ruin

181
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:51,640
two people's lives.

182
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,760
Are you talking about your hunch again?

183
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:57,760
What

184
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,440
tiger and wolf pact is that?

185
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,670
Sounds so severe.

186
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,480
I've signed a confidentiality agreement,

187
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,950
so I can't tell you.

188
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,760
But I think

189
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,230
you can trust me 100%.

190
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,440
Besides, you see,

191
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,760
as fellow schoolmates,

192
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,550
we can't watch him

193
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:10,640
using his cleverness

194
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,510
for exploiting the loopholes in the law

195
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,720
for the rest of his life.

196
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,600
Do you have the heart to

197
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,600
watch me use my cleverness

198
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,670
for being jealous?

199
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:19,600
You won't.

200
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Say yes to me.

201
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,350
Please.

202
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,320
Please, please, please.

203
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,260
(Mom Calling)

204
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:40,510
Hi,

205
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:40,950
Mom.

206
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,950
(Wei,)

207
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,000
(your father's ashes have been buried)

208
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,070
(and placed properly.)

209
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,880
(During the burial today,)

210
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,480
(it was snowing heavily.)

211
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,320
(Pure white snow
blanketed the sky and the earth.)

212
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,480
(It was so beautiful.)

213
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:02,550
I've been so busy with my schoolwork,

214
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,600
otherwise, I'd

215
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,760
go back with you together.

216
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,550
We also want to go back to our hometown

217
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:10,550
to watch the snow fall.

218
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,380
(Integrated Service Division)

219
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,920
You are here.

220
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,320
(Tonghe Hospital)

221
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,520
What happened?

222
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,320
Are you ill?

223
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,200
Does that man look familiar?

224
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:44,790
The man

225
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,400
who's been on a drip

226
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,840
is Qin Fen whom you are

227
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,320
doing everything you can to fire.

228
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,230
You can't let the medicine drip so fast.

229
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,590
You are a long-time patient.

230
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,000
Why don't you listen?

231
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,520
I have an appointment with a client

232
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,230
at 3:00 PM.

233
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,320
I can't be late.

234
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,400
You have to go on
with the drip tomorrow.

235
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,150
Did you ask me to come just for him?

236
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,470
Take care when you work

237
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:04,760
- I've checked his background.
- in case you touch it.

238
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,280
- He's a conscientious,
- OK, thanks.

239
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,280
good employee.

240
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:08,840
But I am

241
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:10,550
Party A's lawyer.

242
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,470
I must do my best

243
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,550
to serve Party A.

244
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,520
Other's fate is not

245
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,280
something I can be responsible for.

246
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,200
I see.

247
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,400
I asked you to come today

248
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,080
not only to help him,

249
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:24,880
but to help you.

250
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,230
(KFC)
Poppet,

251
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,230
stop reading the comics.

252
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:41,960
Eat your meal quickly.

253
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,550
Hurry up.

254
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,840
Daddy's got work to do.

255
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,320
Be quick, be quick.

256
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,440
Stop reading the comics.

257
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,670
Eat quickly.

258
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,080
Come on.

259
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,440
Daddy,

260
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,200
I don't want you to work.

261
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,030
I want you to play with me.

262
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:55,840
Daddy

263
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,520
will bring you along

264
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,440
to see the client a while later.

265
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,520
If I manage to get this client,

266
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,640
I'll have a year-end bonus.

267
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,000
When the time comes,

268
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,880
I can take you

269
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,350
out of our hometown

270
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,400
and let you go to school here.

271
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,320
Qin Fen is a single dad.

272
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,030
If he doesn't work,

273
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,440
he can't raise his child;

274
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,320
if he does work,

275
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,760
he can't spend time with his child.

276
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,280
So the Wolf Pact

277
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:18,880
presents

278
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,110
no choices for him

279
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,110
and he has to sign it.

280
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,000
The adult world

281
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,910
is ruled by the law of the jungle.

282
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:26,790
I'm not in a position

283
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:27,840
to choose my own life,

284
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,080
nor am I in a position

285
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,320
to change the rules of society.

286
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,840
You are right.

287
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:33,910
But before,

288
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:34,960
Qin Fen was just a name

289
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,910
on a file.

290
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:36,550
But now he's

291
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,150
right in front of you
in flesh and blood.

292
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:38,760
I don't believe

293
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,960
you can still remain indifferent.

294
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:43,710
If I don't do this case,

295
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,440
plenty of other people will.

296
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:46,640
Besides, this agreement

297
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,320
does not go against

298
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,230
the rules of the labor law.

299
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,320
But it does go against

300
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,590
the original intention of the labor law.

301
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,150
The moment you turned down
Professor Wang

302
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,030
for the sake of Ms. Yuan,

303
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:56,840
I knew

304
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,710
you still have principles deep down

305
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,350
and you still have a conscience.

306
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,110
Qian Wei,

307
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,640
I'm not as noble-minded as you.

308
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,440
As you said,

309
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,590
I've lost

310
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:07,280
a chance once.

311
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,280
I can't

312
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:08,960
lose it again.

313
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,030
I must

314
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,440
get this job.

315
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,440
And in my heart,

316
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,320
you are the only one

317
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,150
I want to protect.

318
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,520
Just that

319
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,470
you don't accept it.

320
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,110
I'm off for now.

321
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,030
Had I heard

322
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,760
what you said in 2022,

323
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,910
I'd certainly be angry.

324
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,960
But maybe because

325
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,710
I'm reliving the past,

326
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,960
I've found another side of you.

327
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,000
You obviously care,

328
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:44,550
you obviously pay attention,

329
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,710
but why do you pretend
to be indifferent?

330
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:49,760
I always thought

331
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,760
Qin Fen and I

332
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,280
were the ones who sacrificed,

333
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,910
but now it dawned on me

334
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,440
you were actually the one
who sacrificed.

335
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,590
Do you mean

336
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,880
this is what made us break up?

337
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:16,840
For someone like me

338
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,030
who has nothing to my name,

339
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,030
what's the point of
talking about sacrifice?

340
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,640
The Wolf Pact

341
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,230
was the starting point
of your pursuit of fame and wealth.

342
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,760
After walking out of the meeting room,

343
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,670
you took

344
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,200
the first cigarette of your life.

345
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,400
If my guess is right,

346
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,910
you're having a pack in your bag now.

347
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:47,710
Fame and wealth

348
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:48,470
are like cigarettes

349
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,470
which can make you addicted.

350
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,880
If the pact is signed,

351
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,710
you'll become a wolf too.

352
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,320
Now we are

353
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:00,840
not choosing

354
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,200
whether to be a good person or not.

355
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,110
Rather,

356
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,400
either I lose my job

357
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,790
or he loses his.

358
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,670
It's the same for the two of us.

359
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:09,840
I don't have a choice or a fallback.

360
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,640
Do you get me?

361
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,910
Besides, you don't know

362
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,960
how hard my family

363
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,840
and my relatives in the town tried

364
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,110
ever since I was a child

365
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:23,840
to send me here

366
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,110
to attend four years' college

367
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,760
so that I can stand in front of you

368
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,470
to compete for this internship.

369
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,030
So I must

370
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:33,200
get this job.

371
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,760
Only when I've obtained fame and wealth

372
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,550
can I be in a position
to talk about ideals

373
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,470
and morals.

374
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:46,760
Do you think

375
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,350
you'll get closer to

376
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:50,320
your ideals

377
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,320
once you take this case?

378
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,000
The Wolf Pact

379
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,590
is notorious in the legal circle.

380
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,110
I didn't know

381
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:57,910
it was your idea.

382
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:58,790
It was not until later

383
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,230
when I saw the file on Qin Fen

384
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,470
that I began to understand

385
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,200
why you didn't become

386
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,350
a civil attorney later

387
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:08,790
and instead became

388
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,320
a legal counsel

389
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,080
who maximizes capital gains.

390
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:12,910
A legal counsel?

391
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,110
I…

392
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,520
How could I become a legal counsel?

393
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,030
Back then,

394
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,030
we opened a law firm together

395
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,590
which had poor earnings.

396
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,520
In the end, you compromised

397
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,470
to accept a high pay

398
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,350
and became AES's

399
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:27,350
legal director.

400
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,320
Actually, you are right.

401
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,760
There's no absolute right or wrong

402
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,760
on this path.

403
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,400
But you should follow

404
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,590
your inner voice.

405
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,000
Chongwen,

406
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,350
if you are not feeling the pain,

407
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:47,880
what do you

408
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,150
need that pack of stuff for?

409
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,790
This time, I just don't want you to

410
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,760
get further and further away
from your dream

411
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,590
after doing everything you can.

412
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,000
Older sister,

413
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,400
can I trade my coke

414
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,910
for your toy?

415
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,350
The older brother

416
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,000
bought this toy.

417
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,640
You have to ask him if he agrees.

418
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,000
Older brother,

419
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,150
do you also like

420
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,030
Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf?

421
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:51,470
This is for you.

422
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,150
Thanks.

423
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,840
I give my favorite toy

424
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,440
to you.

425
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,520
When your dad is back,

426
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,790
give him this Pleasant Goat

427
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:00,840
and ask him not to sign

428
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,030
the Big Big Wolf Pact.

429
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:08,590
The Pleasant Goat

430
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:10,230
can always beat the Big Big Wolf.

431
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:10,960
Justice is bound to

432
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,000
prevail over evil.

433
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:14,670
Go.

434
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,230
Do you know?

435
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,080
I was just like him

436
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,110
when I was a child.

437
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,880
Toys in kids' meals

438
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,760
had always been what I craved most.

439
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,350
My father

440
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,960
was a construction worker.

441
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,400
When I was young,

442
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,880
he was already disabled
by a work-related injury.

443
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,280
My parents were not well-educated.

444
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,550
My family had little money.

445
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,030
I always thought lawsuits

446
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,520
are a game played by the rich.

447
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,080
As it turned out,

448
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,710
I was just about to attend school

449
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:01,880
and we were in need of money.

450
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:05,000
Intimidated by

451
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,880
the employer's lawyer,

452
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,560
my father agreed to a settlement.

453
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,400
Just 10,000 yuan.

454
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:18,880
The day he got the compensation,

455
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,190
my father took me

456
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,190
to the only KFC in town.

457
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,310
I'm still keeping

458
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,920
the toy I got at that time till now.

459
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,760
It took some years of growing up
for me to understand

460
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:55,070
what iniquities

461
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,880
lied behind the hearty meal.

462
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,590
So from then on,

463
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,640
I began to strive hard

464
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,680
and I was determined to study law

465
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,800
and become a lawyer.

466
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,190
I don't want other families

467
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:11,230
to go through what I've been through.

468
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,310
Why did you

469
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,350
never tell me

470
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,350
about this before?

471
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,280
I thought I could fulfill my ideal

472
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,000
by becoming a lawyer,

473
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,070
but the closer I got to my goal,

474
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,560
the more I found the power of capital

475
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,950
was so strong

476
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,190
and I was so small.

477
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:38,590
So

478
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,590
I have to be a wolf

479
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:43,590
to avoid

480
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,070
being swallowed by other wolves.

481
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,350
I can understand

482
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,350
what you said.

483
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,920
But you should be hopeful that

484
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,680
the laws will certainly

485
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,920
be improved more and more in the future

486
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,560
and there'll be
fewer and fewer loopholes

487
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,000
for those opportunist lawyers
to exploit.

488
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:02,000
Qian Wei,

489
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:04,400
thank you.

490
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:06,710
Thank you for saving me.

491
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,800
I was almost to become

492
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,920
the person I hate most.

493
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,430
Both our fathers
are no longer in this world.

494
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,760
But I believe

495
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,160
they must be looking down at us

496
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:25,560
from the heaven,

497
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:28,110
so we can't

498
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:28,950
let them down.

499
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,310
The coke is so sweet today.

500
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,040
No matter how many times
I relive the past,

501
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,430
I still end up losing my job.

502
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:01,470
Qian Wei,

503
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:06,070
no matter what I'm like

504
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,040
in another world,

505
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,710
I apologize to you all the same.

506
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,400
Because I

507
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,350
know myself well.

508
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,070
Even if he hurts you,

509
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:16,680
he must be doing it to protect you.

510
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:19,590
It's OK.

511
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:21,710
I stopped hating him long ago.

512
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:24,800
Do you think

513
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,160
a repentant Super Mario

514
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,280
can win the princess's heart

515
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,280
after reaching a certain game level?

516
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,160
I have no idea.

517
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,470
I'm not a princess.

518
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,110
I'm just like you,

519
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,590
a Super Mario office worker.

520
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,230
In fact, life is different from

521
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:42,920
playing a video game.

522
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,430
There are no game levels to reach
and no monsters to kill.

523
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,280
People don't embark on the journey

524
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,350
to get something.

525
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:50,470
They just do it

526
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:51,800
for the sake of heroism in their heart.

527
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,520
Only by doing so

528
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,350
can you be Super Mario.

529
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:56,470
OK.

530
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:57,950
The right of interpretation

531
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:59,230
belongs to Super Mario.

532
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:02,680
All right.

533
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,880
Since you have
a special identity anyway,

534
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,110
I will not ask you about it again.

549
00:21:58,710 --> 00:21:59,830
cloying internet songs.

550
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,590

Your image on the stage

so has our co-worker relationship.

They've all left me a word of memento.

644

Don't cry, don't cry.

671
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:01,590
It'll be OK.

672

I really…

694
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,430
Let me do this.

695
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:56,190
I'll go and throw up first.

696
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:57,430
I'll drink with you after that.

697
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:58,070
Wait for me for a minute.

698
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:00,280
Please go

699
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,160
and take care of Qian Wei.

700
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,400
I'll go get
some anti-alcoholic drug for her.

701
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,280
OK.

702
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:18,060
(Make Your Life Sweet)

703
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:23,400
I saw Qian Wei drinking too much,

704
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,640
so I just wanted to buy something sweet

705
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,520
to relieve her hangover.

706
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,040
You see,

707
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:28,880
she has little capacity for alcohol,

708
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,040
but has the audacity to drink.

709
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:31,160
Did she throw up?

710
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,560
Yes.

711
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,560
She wouldn't throw up like that

712
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,430
had I come earlier.

713
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:36,950
But don't worry.

714
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:38,760
I'll be dutiful

715
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,920
and bother you less.

716
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,950
All right then.

717
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,310
Now that you've come,

718
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,040
go and give it to her.

719
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,000
It's impossible for me
to be her boyfriend.

720
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,160
Actually

721
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:58,830
I've never

722
00:28:58,830 --> 00:28:59,640
been a threat to you this time.

723
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:03,280
What this time that time?

724
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,560
Well, are you drunk too?

725
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:05,760
No.

726
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:08,830
She really loves you a lot.

727
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,950
I don't have a chance.

728
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:13,680
Hope you can

729
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,560
cherish your luck.

730
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,780
(Super Mario Qian)

731
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,230
I saw everybody signed

732
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,110
their word of wishes for you.

733
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:42,520
Shall I

734
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,350
sign one for you as well?

735
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,280
Forget it.

736
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,470
I didn't bring a marker pen.

737
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:50,070
You see, it's so full.

738
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:50,800
There's no space left.

739
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,070
I saw a marker pen over there.

740
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:54,110
That's why I made

741
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:54,710
this suggestion.

742
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:55,920
Otherwise, who wants to sign for you?

743
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:12,060
(All will be well.)

744
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:20,830
In fact,

745
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:23,160
when I was in college,

746
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:25,230
I took you as

747
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,160
my best rival,

748
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,190
also my most admired

749
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:30,640
senior fellow student.

750
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:35,710
Thanks.

751
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,190
All will be well.

752
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,350
You…

753
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:44,310
Should I say it or not,

754
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:44,920
Chongwen,

755
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:46,430
you are going a bit too far.

756
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:47,590
Let me

757
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:48,520
give you a lecture next time.

758
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:55,580
(Make Your Life Sweet)

759
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,860
(Rocky)

760
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,310
Shiyun?

761
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:23,470
Shiyun,

762
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,230
I miss you.

763
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,520
The dress you are wearing today

764
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,760
looks so nice,

765
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,590
just like what you were wearing

766
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:30,760
on our first date.

767
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:33,000
Do you miss me too?

768
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,560
You are mistaken.

769
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:35,710
I don't usually wear this.

770
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,000
This is a requirement of my job.

771
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:39,280
Don't keep denying it.

772
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:40,800
Shiyun,

773
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,280
why don't we…?

774
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:45,430
Start again?

775
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:47,760
Let go of her!

776
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:50,190
Qian Chuan?

777
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,280
Why are you here again?

778
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,110
Why are you always around Shiyun?

779
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:55,400
Do you have

780
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,400
ill intentions towards her?

781
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:57,760
It's none of your business.

782
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,110
You guys have broken up.

783
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:00,830
She still likes me,

784
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:01,880
and we'll make up again.

785
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:03,560
Shiyun…

786
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:05,040
Stay away from her!

787
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:05,830
You are drunk.

788
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,160
Sober up and go back quickly.

789
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,640
Shiyun!

790
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:12,110
I regret it.

791
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,760
You can avoid me for a while.

792
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:15,400
Can you avoid me your whole life?

793
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,070
I'll be right here
waiting for you to come out.

794
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,710
Why did you suddenly come back?

795
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,830
How's auntie doing?

796
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,160
And… How are you doing?

797
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:40,190
My mom and I are doing much better.

798
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,520
This time, we

799
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,880
literally travelled across the country.

800
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,830
We specially went to the hometown of

801
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:49,230
our favorite river snails rice noodles -

802
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:50,070
Liuzhou.

803
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:50,710
Really?

804
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:53,400
Here you are.

805
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,350
What's this?

806
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,230
In every place I went,

807
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,070
I bought

808
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:00,520
a local specialty as a souvenir.

809
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:02,000
These are for you.

810
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:03,400
So many?

811
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:05,400
Let me have a look.

812
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:07,710
This is…

813
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,640
This is a coffin.

814
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:15,800
This is a specialty of Liuzhou,

815
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,160
symbolizing wealth and promotion.

816
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,160
Aren't your parents businesspeople?

817
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:20,190
Just give it to them.

818
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:21,680
If you dare give this

819
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,590
to my parents,

820
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:23,920
my father would beat you to death.

821
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,000
Beat me to death.

822
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:32,760
From the way you are dressed,

823
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,000
are you not doing well?

824
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,640
It's hard to pursue my dream.

825
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:41,230
I can neither advance

826
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,830
nor retreat.

827
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:47,400
What are you doing here?

828
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,640
Are you dating?

829
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,590
With no regular singer out there,

830
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:50,760
the customers are leaving.

831
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,950
Do you want the job or not?

832
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:52,920
I'll give you two minutes.

833
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,640
Come out quickly.

834
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,190
Pretending to be someone else

835
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,640
singing songs you don't like.

836
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,920
How can this be the way
to pursue your dream?

837
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,360
Liu,

838
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:11,910
didn't you make it clear to Tang Lyu

839
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:13,080
when you broke up with him?

840
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,520
Why are you confused now?

841
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,910
Liu is so cool!

842
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,120
Today

843
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,520
both my ex-boyfriend and ex-boss

844
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,430
are seated among the audience.

845
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:38,560
I have a song

846
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,230
to dedicate to them.

847
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,520
I made no progress in singing

848
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,120
and lost my part-time job.

849
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,120
Maybe Tang Lyu

850
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,520
is gonna curse me everywhere.

851
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:40,320
Turns out my father wins.

852
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,670
He's right in his guesses.

853
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:44,080
Why do you think

854
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:47,040
they all dislike

855
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,120
the way I am?

856
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,390
Am I that pathetic?

857
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,840
Who says so?

858
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,430
You…

859
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:54,710
You are good in every way. You…

860
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:57,560
You have a good capacity for alcohol.

861
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,950
If you ply people with alcohol,

862
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,470
to put it in an allegorical saying,

863
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:02,000
a weasel
gives new year's greetings to a hen…

864
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,760
You're not good at comforting people.

865
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,910
Just don't talk nonsense.

866
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:07,040
You…

867
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:08,760
You have good physical strength.

868
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:09,910
When you go out,

869
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:11,360
you can only bully others.

870
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,950
Even three big and strong guys

871
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:13,710
can't hurt you.

872
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:18,150
You see,

873
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,320
you are well versed in both law

874
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,950
and music.

875
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:23,840
You are adept with
both the pen and the sword,

876
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,950
and refined
both internally and externally.

877
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,670
Although you speak

878
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:28,430
with a slight northeastern accent,

879
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:30,150
I think it's so cute.

880
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:32,600
There's one more thing

881
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,430
that if my sister gets to know,

882
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,000
she'll certainly beat me up.

883
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:42,000
After being away for so long,

884
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,000
I found

885
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,430
the one I missed the most

886
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:52,910
is you.

887
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:23,470
It's past 0:00 AM.

888
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:24,760
Christmas is gone.

889
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:29,360
All the surprises I prepared are wasted.

890
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:33,080
I'm doing things in vain every time.

891
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,390
You are not mine.

892
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:35,630
At the end of the day,

893
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,630
fate will still take you away.

894
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:39,230
You are drunk.

895
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:39,630
What nonsense

896
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:41,150
are you talking about again?

897
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,430
Are you sober?

898
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:18,320
It's my first time to see
people sober up like this.

899
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:20,950
Well, you prepared

900
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:21,630
so many surprises.

901
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:23,040
Why didn't you tell me?

902
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,360
I'd be back earlier.

903
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,040
I tell you in advance?

904
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,190
Surprise, surprise.

905
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,000
What is a surprise?

906
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,670
Would it be a surprise if I told you?

907
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,000
Let me go have a look.

908
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,950
I tell you what,

909
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:36,430
everything on there,

910
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:37,430
I hung it up

911
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,230
one by one.

912
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:39,520
I even strung the bulbs

913
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,430
one by one.

914
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:41,230
Really?

915
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,000
Of course.

916
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,600
I think you must

917
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,600
give me a reward.

918
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:46,800
Wait.

919
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,800
Save them till later.

920
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,390
Wait? All right.

921
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:51,710
What's this?

922
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:52,600
A projector?

923
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:55,150
Yes.

924
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,520
Didn't you tell your mother

925
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,670
over the phone that

926
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,520
you wanted to watch the snow fall?

927
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:07,910
It's a pity there's no snow in Haizhou.

928
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:09,470
But it doesn't matter.

929
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,760
Lu Xun

930
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,320
can make the snow fall for a lifetime

931
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:13,800
for Qian Wei.

932
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:17,800
What weird stuff is that?

933
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,600
Let me show you.

934
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,840
Are you ready?

935
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,910

00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:06,870
if you hold an umbrella

951
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:07,840
in a room,

952
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,190
you wouldn't grow taller later on.

953
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,760

957
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,470
(no matter how many regrets I have,)

958
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,120
(with the big fool)

959
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,040
(Lu Xun by my side,)

960
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,320
(I still feel so happy.)

961
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:29,840
Shall I turn it off?

962
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,430
Turn it off quickly.

963
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,080
How are we gonna clean it up later?

964
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,120
Don't worry.

965
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:41,840
With me being here,

966
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:43,520
you don't have to clean the house.

967
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,040
I... I'll open it?

968
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:47,760
Have a look.

969
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,000
This is the first lucky bag

970
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,000
I prepared for you.

971
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,780
(Qian Wei Head of Fawei Online)

972
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,150
Business card for Fawei Online?

973
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:00,280
Tomorrow Fawei Online will have

974
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,560
its first consultation.

975
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:03,840
I'm sure this will come in handy.

976
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,150
I've finally bobbed up like a cork
to become a boss.

977
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:09,840
Don't keep saying

978
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,760
bobbing up like a cork.

979
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,760
As if someone rides on you

980
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,760
and lords it over you every day.

981
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:14,040
I'll be the first

982
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:14,950
to drag him down

983
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:16,150
and fling him to the ground.

984
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:17,910
OK.

985
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:18,950
I'll avenge you.

986
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,120
What's this?

987
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,000
Lu Xun, a cure to all illnesses

988
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,840
and an elixir to all symptoms.

989
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:28,840
Actually, I know

990
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:30,560
you look like

991
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,840
a hard shell on the surface,

992
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,760
but I know deep down

993
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,040
you must have

994
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,360
a lot of untold secrets.

995
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:37,800
I have no idea

996
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,840
what that feels like.

997
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,000
Maybe it's grievance,

998
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,910
or sadness or upset.

999
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:42,800
But it doesn't matter.

1000
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:43,430
With me by your side,

1001
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:44,280
I am your

1002
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:45,520
best medicine.

1003
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,630
Any illness you have,

1004
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:49,150
anything unpleasant you have,

1005
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,760
I can cure it all for you.

1006
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:53,800
What's the expiration date
of the medicine?

1007
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,630
For such an expensive

1008
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:57,470
and hard-to-find medicine like me,

1009
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,150
at least it's effective for a lifetime?

1010
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:02,190
But

1011
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:04,280
you must cherish it

1012
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,470
and go easy on it.

1013
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:06,360
Well, where did you

1014
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,710
learn all this experience

1015
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:09,150
in your toolkit?

1016
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,670
We are about to graduate soon.

1017
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,670
I just want to know

1018
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:14,120
our plans for the future.

1019
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,150
I want to go abroad with you

1020
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:18,320
for postgraduate study.

1021
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:19,870
Let's go to

1022
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,120
Oxford University together.

1023
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,080
Oxford Law School?

1024
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,430
How did you know I want to apply for

1025
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:27,560
Oxford Law School?

1026
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,190
That goes without saying.

1027
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,120
You…

1028
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,560
There's another surprise here

1029
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,280
which is the biggest.

1030
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:33,870
Do you want to see it?

1031
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:35,040
What?

1032
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:35,840
The third lucky bag.

1033
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,950
So weird.

1034
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:40,150
Where did you learn this?

1035
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,190
Open it to have a look.

1036
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:45,360
So heavy?

1037
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,430
