1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:02,920
You're not

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,320
secretly putting

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:05,710
a big diamond ring inside for me,
are you?

4
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:06,400
I'm telling you.

5
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,400
I will…

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,200
Last time,
I saw you buy a pair of silver pigs

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,310
for your parents.

8
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:21,230
I feel that

9
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,470
you shouldn't like

10
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:23,790
that kind of flashy thing.

11
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:24,440
So,

12
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:25,470
like you did,

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,230
I bought a pair of gold pigs,

14
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:28,230
which are value-preserving.

15
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,070
See?
I remembered what you said.

16
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,790
So this pair of gold pigs means

17
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,040
that in the future we will

18
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,150
be able to hold hands
towards a golden wedding.

19
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,150
How does that look?

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,680
Don't be too impressed.

21
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,790
Or I'll feel embarrassed for that.

22
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:50,680
(You were the one)

23
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,750
(who was not supposed to show)

24
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:52,680
(in my reversal of life.)

25
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,080
(I'm not sure)

26
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,400
(whether the future Lu Xun)

27
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,080
(will love me or not.)

28
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,150
(I'm not sure)

29
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:59,430
(if I can always have you)

30
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,200
(in this world.)

31
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,470
(Whatever.)

32
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,480
(This moment is all that matters.)

33
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,190
Help me with this.

34
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,080
Help me tie up the spinning wheel.

35
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:14,310
Tie it up?

36
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,830
I promise,

37
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,870
even if God wants to separate us,

38
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,080
even if I have to bet everything,

39
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,190
I will definitely

40
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,080
stay with you.

41
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:32,800
What're you talking about?

42
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:34,590
Do you think you have a chance

43
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:35,800
to leave me?

44
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:36,950
This ring

45
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:37,830
was tied up tightly.

46
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,000
You'll never

47
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,870
keep away from me.

48
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:40,440
You.

49
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:40,830
Qian Wei,

50
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:41,630
you're my girlfriend.

51
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,480
Remember?

52
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:45,310
But…

53
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:45,550
I…

54
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,040
I'm telling you.

55
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,950
It's not official.

56
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,310
Next time when you propose,

57
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,510
please make it

58
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,950
a bit more serious.

59
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,310
No way.

60
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:53,760
Qian Wei.

61
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,270
It was you who proposed to me.

62
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,040
And it was me

63
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,510
who accepted your proposal
reluctantly.

64
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,480
You feel me?

65
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,040
Well…

66
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,120
I didn't mean it like that.

67
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:00,360
I…

68
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:00,910
Then, what do you mean?

69
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:01,720
I don't mean that.

70
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,270
That's what you meant.

71
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:02,950
I just asked you

72
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,440
to tie the wheel to me.

73
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,630
I didn't mean that.

74
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,230
You can't be a scoundrel like that.

75
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:14,670
Well.

76
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,000
It's

77
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,270
not snowing on Christmas,

78
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,630
but raining.

79
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:21,750
What does this mean?

80
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:24,720
Look.

81
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,110
Look at the rain outside.

82
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,630
The rain…

83
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,160
What do you mean by "next time"?

84
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,360
It means

85
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,630
when it rains

86
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,360
next time,

87
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,800
we…

88
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,630
We will do this.

89
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:42,390
No,

90
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,800
I didn't mean that.

91
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,270
You didn't mean…

92
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,320
What?

93
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:50,320
I…

94
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,390
What if

95
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,600
that's what I mean?

115
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,440
Hello.

116
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,640
I'm the head of Fawei Online.

117
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:55,390
We are

118
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,760
a legal aid platform.

119
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,600
You can rest assured

120
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,350
that we're selected

121
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,950
through a screening process.

122
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,200
And we take it seriously.

123
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,720
So, for the first meeting,

124
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,040
we can focus on the consultation.

125
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,550
Is that okay for you?

126
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,670
You can tell us

127
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:06,600
about your requests.

128
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,790
And we'll try to

129
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:08,390
give you some legal advice.

130
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,550
It turns out
that no matter what age you are,

131
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,270
you'll be nervous

132
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,160
when doing

133
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,000
what you wanna do.

134
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,510
Oops, I got the wrong bag.

135
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,200
Hi,

136
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,200
you are Miss Sheng, right?

137
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,640
I am the head of Fawei Online,

138
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,270
Qian Wei.

139
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,550
Hi.

140
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,510
I've been thinking

141
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:50,670
about today's consultation,

142
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,110
but I don't think I wanna talk.

143
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,880
I'm sorry.

144
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:55,790
Miss Sheng.

145
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,830
We don't charge for consultations.

146
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,920
Now that you're here,

147
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,480
why not have a seat
and talk to me?

148
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,230
Anyway, we'll just

149
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,230
give you some advice

150
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,550
from the legal point of view.

151
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,760
How to handle it,

152
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,070
or whether to handle it

153
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,550
is totally up to you.

154
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,600
Your claim

155
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,830
in legal terms,

156
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,600
is actually called
copyright segmentation.

157
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,510
The copyright
of the game character's artwork

158
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,920
belongs to you.

159
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,920
So it is not difficult

160
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,920
to get it back.

161
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,550
I drew

162
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:51,600
all those figures.

163
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:52,720
My paintings

164
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,790
are like my children.

165
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:54,440
I don't want to hand it over

166
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,670
to a stranger.

167
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,790
But he's already sold the game.

168
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,510
He...

169
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,760
It seems that this person

170
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,760
is very close to you.

171
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,920
That's why you hesitated.

172
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,070
We used to trust

173
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,440
each other a lot.

174
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,000
But we might be enemies
in the future.

175
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,920
If I take away a part of the rights
of the artwork,

176
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,270
will the game

177
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,070
not be sold?

178
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,110
He has signed the contract.

179
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,160
Will the other party

180
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:29,950
sue him

181
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:30,600
for this matter?

182
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,270
The game belongs

183
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,510
to both of you.

184
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,480
It was him who sold the rights first
without telling you.

185
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,920
It's definitely his fault.

186
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,600
You told me a lot.

187
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,070
But most of the time,

188
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,510
you were concerned
about the other party.

189
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,040
Is he

190
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,110
your boyfriend?

191
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,640
Yes.

192
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,950
I'm a straight shooter.

193
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,350
But no offense.

194
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:57,640
Actually, I

195
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,510
feel like that

196
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,760
the biggest problem here

197
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,270
is your attitude.

198
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,350
Which one is more important for you,
the artwork,

199
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,000
or the guy?

200
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,550
Even if we've broken up,

201
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,480
I don't wanna make it worse.

202
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,790
So I won't sue him.

203
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,070
Thank you

204
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,230
for your time.

205
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,350
In fact,

206
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,200
it's the best situation for us

207
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,760
to settle our client's claim

208
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,040
without filing a lawsuit
or going to court.

209
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,150
You're a lady with love and loyalty.

210
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,150
If this decision

211
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,080
gives you peace of mind,

212
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,320
then it is the best decision.

213
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,520
Keep these files.

214
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,520
Feel free to contact me

215
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,400
if there's any change

216
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,320
in the future.

217
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,640
Thank you.

218
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,710
You are Sheng Kai?

219
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,470
Your boyfriend's name is Ma Lun.

220
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:04,520
His company is called Morris,

221
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,200
right?

222
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,590
Looks like
you've played this game.

223
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,110
If he knew,

224
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,840
he wouldn't be in such a hurry

225
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,640
to sell it.

226
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,400
Have you really
made your decision?

227
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,670
I've seen the game

228
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,760
and the visual is amazing.

229
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:20,590
If you give up

230
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,550
the rights now,

231
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,520
you will have nothing to do

232
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,590
with all the copyright revenue
in the future.

233
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,230
I have nothing to do with him now.

234
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,280
What do I need money for?

235
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,760
But thank you anyway.

236
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,880
(Sheng Kai is the artist.)

237
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,110
(She and Ma Lun)

238
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,640
(not only started a business together,)

239
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,200
(but they were also a couple.)

240
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,640
(No wonder Ma Lun keeps saying)

241
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,000
(that he can't find another artist.)

242
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,470
(This is why he can't.)

243
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,230
(This might be)

244
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,760
(the breakthrough in the Morris case.)

245
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,030
(Probably, Sheng Kai)

246
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,400
(still keeps)

247
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,840
(the drafts of the game characters.)

248
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,590
(I'm ready)

249
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:02,470
(to stay in this world)

250
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:04,030
(forever.)

251
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,080
(But)

252
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,000
(in 2022,)

253
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:07,350
(there is still a mess)

254
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,710
(I left behind,)

255
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,030
(like the appeal case being heard,)

256
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,280
(Lu Xun who got tricked by me,)

257
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:14,760
(loss of Dad,)

258
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,320
(and Mom, who lost me…)

259
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,200
(Is it right)

260
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,710
(or not)

261
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,440
(to stay in this world?)

262
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,000
(Am I being too selfish?)

263
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,150
Main Quest.

264
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,390
(Turn the tide against the wind.
Deprive Lu Xun's life experience.)

265
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,320
Turn the tide against the wind.

266
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,840
Deprive Lu Xun's life experience.

267
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,400
Screenwriter, Qian Wei.

268
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,140
(Optimize the instance of Dad.)
(Stop Dad from dying of leukemia...)

269
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,420
(Help Qian Chuan, the forever No.2.)

270
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:08,400
(Prevent Chuan from getting injured
and make him join the national team.)

271
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:09,420
(Stop Chuan and Zixin
from falling in love.)

272
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:10,340
(Help Chuan overcome psychological
barriers and win the championship.)

273
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,200
(Side task, match Lu Xun and Zixin.)

274
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:16,620
(Let Chuan be a playboy,
and I lead the way.)

275
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,930
(Escape from Li Chongwen's cave.
Never get to know Li Chongwen.)

276
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,120
(No eye and physical contact
with Li Chongwen.)

277
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:22,140
(Turn down Li Chongwen.)

278
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,300
(Never get back to 2022.)

279
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:33,140
(Bye, Dad. Come visit me in my dreams.
I miss you, like always.)

280
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,640
Professor Wang.

281
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,820
(Professor Wang Ruogu calls)

282
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:48,220
(Hello?)

283
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:49,200
Professor Wang.

284
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:50,440
(Chongwen,)

285
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,110
(I heard)

286
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,710
(you just left Jinyuan Law Firm,)

287
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:54,150
(right?)

288
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:55,470
Yes.

289
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,760
I'm sorry, Professor Wang.

290
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,350
I think I won't

291
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,960
take Qingyun's grant offer.

292
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,000
(You get me wrong.)

293
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,350
(It's not about Qingyun.)

294
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,880
(The daughter of the owner
of AES Group)

295
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:09,640
(also,)

296
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,960
(the manager
of Group Administration Department.)

297
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,200
(She)

298
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:13,960
(asked me to make an appointment
with you.)

299
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,460
(Gate 3, East Campus,
Guanghua University)

300
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,000
Hello.

301
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,320
Get in the car.

302
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:38,790
No, I'm good.

303
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:40,960
Ms. Lan.

304
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,280
Why did you come here yourself?

305
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,200
I came to thank you.

306
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:44,670
My project

307
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,790
has officially started.

308
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:48,080
But I still need

309
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,440
a trustworthy helper now.

310
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:50,880
Preferably someone who,
just like me,

311
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,640
will have nothing if he loses.

312
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:53,910
Will you be

313
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:54,840
the one?

314
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,470
What're you doing here?

315
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,470
No, no, no.

316
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,080
You'd better go elsewhere.

317
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,030
We don't need

318
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:09,840
music like yours.

319
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,350
Come on. Go.

320
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,150
Don't wait here.

321
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,000
Just go away.

322
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,840
I can't imagine that one day,

323
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,590
me, Manchurian Tiger,

324
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,280
would have no money to eat.

325
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,200
Come on, Liu.

326
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:54,110
You must

327
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,000
make a difference

328
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,280
and make your parents satisfied.

329
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,840
Practice! Practice!

330
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:00,790
Practice!

331
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,440
Where are the music scores?

332
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,200
Aren't…?

333
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,000
Aren't these the boxing gloves

334
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,440
I used to practice boxing
when I was a kid?

335
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,670
Why are they here?

336
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,000
(I told you.)

337
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,910
(Bankcard)
(Since you've made this decision,)

338
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,840
(you can't ask for money
from us anymore.)

339
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,520
(You can't ask for it.)

340
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,670
(But I can give it to you.)

341
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,520
(Use the money)

342
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,790
(for music lessons.)

343
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,910
(Put some effort into it.)

344
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,230
(Prove to me)

345
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,320
(that I was wrong.)

346
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,350
(Shiyun,)

347
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,150
(if you really like it that much,)

348
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,470
(just take it seriously.)

349
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:51,550
(Stick to it.)

350
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,230
(Just like you did)

351
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,590
(when you used to learn boxing.)

352
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:57,520
(Never give up
until you beat your opponent.)

353
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,140
(Bankcard)

354
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,000
(You brat,)

355
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,840
(you know you have a family
out there, huh?)

356
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,080
Dad.

357
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,540
(Liu's Boxing Gym)

358
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,880
This place is so big!

359
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,790
My father had rented this place

360
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,200
to open a new boxing gym.

361
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,470
But he found a better place later.

362
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,230
So he dropped it.

363
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,000
I had to work hard

364
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,230
to convince him to keep this.

365
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:50,440
You've made up with your father?

366
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:51,640
My family

367
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,520
has always been fine.

368
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,030
Nothing is wrong.

369
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,760
Let's get down to business.

370
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,880
Don't you wanna start a business?

371
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:00,400
From now on,

372
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,080
you can borrow this gym,

373
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:03,080
I'll be your landlord and shareholder.

374
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,320
Such a good gym,

375
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,670
if I can't run the business well,

376
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,550
your family

377
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:11,520
will definitely not let me go.

378
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,030
No, I won't take it.

379
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:13,840
Rent it to someone else.

380
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,640
I believe that you will not fail.

381
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,080
You are the champion.

382
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,470
I lend it to you with conditions.

383
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,080
When you have profits,

384
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,110
you can give me back

385
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,030
the rent then.

386
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,000
If you run it well,

387
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,030
beyond the rent,
I'll also get dividends,

388
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:24,790
right?

389
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:26,150
You tell me.

390
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,880
If I rent this place to a stranger,

391
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,640
what I can get is only rent.

392
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:30,910
Such kind of business

393
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,030
is not what I'm gonna do.

394
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:35,590
Your sister has already

395
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:37,000
prepared a rental contract for me.

396
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,150
Just give me a word. Yes or no?

397
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,440
Yes.

398
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:46,440
You can count on me.

399
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,320
For your sake,

400
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,760
I will definitely

401
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,000
make this boxing gym

402
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,080
a success.

403
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,520
Then,

404
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:52,790
all the expense

405
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,520
for your concert is on me.

406
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,440
Good.

407
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:58,200
Cheers.

408
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,640
After being away for so long,

409
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,680
I found that,

410
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,950
in fact, the person I miss the most

411
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:12,680
is you.

412
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,430
The key to business

413
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,760
is to be calm and peaceful,

414
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,920
and not to lose your temper

415
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,000
no matter what kind of client
you've met.

416
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,920
You're grumpy.

417
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,190
Will you lose control?

418
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,430
You can rest assured

419
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,800
and just wait for the dividends.

420
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,470
Then, as the shareholder,

421
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,310
I gotta give you a test.

422
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:37,520
Hey.

423
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:38,640
Hey.

424
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,760
What're you doing?

425
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,280
Get up there.

426
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,310
Get up there.

427
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,680
Then what?

428
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,710
Let me see
your level of self-control.

429
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:52,830
Let's see,

430
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:53,920
under my knife-like gaze,

431
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,830
how long you can hold out.

432
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,430
No problem.

433
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:58,190
Let's do it.

434
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,590
The one who admits defeat first
will have to buy river snails rice noodles.

435
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:02,520
Deal.

436

Self-control? Not good enough.

♪Even stars can't be as shiny as you♪

00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,110
You…

445
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,560
You cheated.

446
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,680

(You kissed each other
and confirmed the relationship?)

457
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,190
Good for you, Liu.

458
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,070
You become the benefactor

459
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:46,760
of our family.

460
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,430
Thus, Qian Chuan

461
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,350
won't have to be single

462
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,560
until 2022.

463
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,560
Can you not undermine
your biological brother like that?

464
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,590
I'm an attractive man, okay?

465
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,040
No matter how big the forest is,

466
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,280
I still only like Manchurian Tiger.

467
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,190
This is called

468
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:05,680
"Charity begins at home".

469
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,160
I have always been very accurate

470
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,190
in this premonition.

471
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,920
Qian Chuan's gym will certainly

472
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,280
operate exceptionally well.

473
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:11,920
When the time comes,

474
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,350
he'll use his profits

475
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,110
to support your music dream.

476
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,680
That's a deal.

477
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:17,400
So,

478
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,950
are you going to have dinner
with us tonight?

479
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,110
No.

480
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:21,920
I've got

481
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:23,400
something to do lately.

482
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,640
What's going on with you lately?

483
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,590
I haven't seen you for a while.

484
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,430
What're you doing?

485
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,230
Lu Xun!

486
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:29,800
Come here.

487
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,110
(Lu Xun is here.)

488
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:34,880
(Are you gonna come…?)

489
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:35,830
No, no, no.

490
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,400
Well,

491
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,070
tell him

492
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,110
that I'm busy.

493
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:39,000
I gotta go.

494
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,310
Congratulations.

495
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,190
Thank you.

496
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,400
Tonight,

497
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,310
Qian Wei got plans

498
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,800
so she can't be with us
to have dinner.

499
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,640
What do you wanna eat?

500
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,400
I'll make a reservation.

501
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:55,830
No, thanks.

502
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:56,590
I don't want to disturb

503
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,350
the two

504
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,070
of you.

505
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,640
I came here just

506
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,800
to talk to Qian Chuan.

507
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,760
Then you guys talk first.

508
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,680
I'll go clean up.

509
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,280
Okay.

510
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:12,950
Have a seat.

511
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,190
Seriously, I don't know

512
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:22,920
what Qian Wei is working on.

513
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,640
No worries.

514
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,350
Last time,

515
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,000
your sister got drunk,

516
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:30,880
and she told me

517
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,110
that she came

518
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:32,880
from the year 2022.

519
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:35,560
I didn't believe her.

520
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,880
And then she said,

521
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,000
you and Liu Shiyun

522
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,190
will kiss and confirm the relationship

523
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:42,190
right in this gym.

524
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,110
So I came in to check.

525
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,640
Turns out it is true.

526
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,520
Do you remember

527
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,560
there was one time

528
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,040
you were very nervous
before the competition

529
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:55,160
but later,
you were a different person

530
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,950
and won the championship.

531
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,000
Was it because

532
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,880
Qian Wei told you

533
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,560
that she was from the future

534
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,710
and she told you
that you would win,

535
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:05,110
right?

536
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,160
Seriously? Lu Xun.

537
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,680
You are buying this?

538
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,400
All these nonsenses she made up

539
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,160
were just to try to get me

540
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,400
to get over the psychological barrier.

541
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,430
I knew it at the time,

542
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:22,590
but I didn't take it to heart.

543
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,400
If my sister said something
that made you upset,

544
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,310
don't take it personally.

545
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,590
She's probably just doing it

546
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:30,520
for our own good.

547
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,000
Don't worry.

548
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:35,640
Your sister

549
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,680
didn't say anything to me.

550
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,310
Good muscles.

551
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,760
Keep it up.

552
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,160
Okay.

553
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,160
Then I'll leave now.

554
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:45,830
Bye-bye.

the criminal law you cited

566
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:29,680
in the last subjective question
has been amended recently.

567
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,800
According to
the Criminal Law Amendment VIII,

568
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,470
it was from May 1, 2011

569
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,680
that the law officially
came into force.

570
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,230
In other words,

571
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,040
you answered this question
incorrectly

572
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,230
and got two points deducted.

573
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:38,400

574
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,350
don't call me Mate,

575
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,160
call me Lady.

576
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,110
So where is

577
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:42,920
the real underwear thief?

578
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,000
I know.

580
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:49,680
Good taste.

581
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,520
I'll tell you what.

582
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,000

00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,800
the Nobel Prize in Literature.

This Maugham you like

586
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:56,160
hasn't won a single Nobel Prize.

587
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,710
He's not even close.

588
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:58,000
(Shared Campus Bicycles)
So how did you come up

589
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,920
with bicycle sharing

590
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,040
and self-serviced charging?

591
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,520
Because I'm beautiful
and extremely smart,

592
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,070
okay?

593
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,680
You don't have to do this.

594
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,470
You can just

595
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,350
create an APP.

596
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:09,160
That's easy to understand,

597
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,110
easy to learn,

598
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,230
and much more convenient
than this.

599
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,160
It's not sleeping time.

600
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,680
You are already dreaming.

601
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,830
Smartphones are not yet popular.

602
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:18,800
How can I create an application?

603
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:20,920
When I was a freshman,

604
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,110
I was impressed by Steve Jobs

605
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,760
and bought a lot of shares of Apple.

606
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,760
And now I get dividends.

607
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,230
(Haizhou International Cruise Co., Ltd)
It's hard to get this money together.

608
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,800
Now you tell me it doesn't count?

609
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,040
Then why do we need the law?

610
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:29,920
I've studied law

611
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,920
for eleven years more than you.

612
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:33,470
Those words you just said

614
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:35,920
will definitely come true.

619
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:43,070
your behavior can be qualified
as defamation.

686
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:08,880
And

687
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,830
we're still working
on Fawei Online together,

688
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:10,880
aren't we?

689
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,110
Then,

690
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,560
besides school and career,

691
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:19,710
there's nothing else

692
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:20,680
you wanna do with me?

693
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,070
What's wrong with you?

694
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:24,680
Are you

695
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,830
out of your mind?

696
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,040
Come here.

697
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:27,830
I want a kiss.

698
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:29,470
Hey.

699
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:30,800
What's going on?

700
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:33,830
Are you having trouble

701
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:34,710
with the study abroad application?

702
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:35,400
Or is there something else
going on?

703
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,430
Tell me now.

704
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:46,230
Don't.

705
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:47,470
Don't read these things.

706
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:47,880
This…

707
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:48,880
Qian Wei.

708
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,760
I know

709
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:53,350
what you look like

710
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:54,110
when you lie.

711
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,470
The words
you wrote to your father,

712
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,400
I read them all.

713
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,310
Can you stop using

714
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:04,280
that premonition thing

715
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,350
to lie to me?

716
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,680
The reason why

717
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,350
you can foresee all this

718
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,710
is that

719
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:16,520
you came from the year of 2022,

720
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,400
the future,

721
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:17,950
right?

722
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,000
So why did you come here?

723
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,830
Why?

724
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,880
To change your disappointing life,

725
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:34,350
or to make up

726
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,400
for your regrets?

727
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,830
So for the person I care about,

728
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,640
no matter in her original life,

729
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,280
or her new life,

730
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,230
I'm just

731
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,520
a backdrop.

732
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,000
Qian Wei.

733
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Deep down in your heart,

734
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,830
what am I to you?

735
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:51,560
Can you tell me?

736
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:51,880
Hey.

737
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,830
Don't be angry.

738
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:54,950
I didn't mention you,

739
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:56,470
not because I don't care about you,

740
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,350
but because you were

741
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,950
a surprise in my life.

742
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,230
So

743
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:04,830
if I hadn't confessed my love to you,

744
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:07,950
you would still have chosen
Li Chongwen.

745
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:12,230
Last time,

746
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,800
you were with him.

747
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,040
You were in love with him.

748
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,160
That was history.

749
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,310
The one I love now is you.

750
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:24,000
Isn't that enough?

751
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:28,160
Li Chongwen,

752
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,110
also knew

753
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:31,470
that you came from the future, right?

754
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,280
That's why
you were able to convince him

755
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,280
to help Qin Fen.

756
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,640
And me?

757
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,590
I'm the last one
who gets to know it!

758
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:40,280
Why?

759
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,000
Why would you like
to be my girlfriend?

760
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,070
Is it out of love?

761
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,590
Or to avoid Li Chongwen?

762
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:46,430
Or because it's more convenient

763
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:48,000
to help reverse your life?

764
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:50,310
If the top student isn't Lu Xun,

765
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,110
isn't me,

766
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:53,160
but Zhang Xun, Li Xun,

767
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,280
Wang Xun,

768
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,190
will you choose

769
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:56,680
to be with one of them?

770
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,710
So in your eyes,
I'm that eager for quick success

771
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:59,400
and instant benefit, right?

772
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,430
Would you be my boyfriend

773
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:02,190
if I'm not

774
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:02,920
smart, capable,

775
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:03,880
brilliant,

776
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,590
and can't fight with you side by side?

777
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,040
If I were a dud,

778
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:07,950
if I were stupid,

779
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:09,110
you would not have chosen me as well.

780
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:10,070
Just like what you did

781
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,560
last time.

782
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:15,760
Qian Wei. Listen.

783
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,920
I don't care
if that Lu Xun in the future

784
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:22,110
likes you or not,

785
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,830
but I know that

786
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,040
whether you're eighteen,

787
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,280
twenty-eight,

788
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,590
or eighty-eight,

789
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:32,800
you're you,

790
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:34,430
the same person.

791
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:35,430
You're Qian Wei.

792
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,160
I love you.

793
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:41,800
It's not because how good you are,

794
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,520
and it's not because

795
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,430
you have impressive abilities,

796
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:46,470
but

797
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,640
you, the simple and pure you.

798
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,560
Don't you understand that?

799
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,640
But now, I think all this

800
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,920
is not important.

801
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:12,560
In my life,

802
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:16,830
every wish I make

803
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,190
is all about you.

804
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,110
But there's no space for me
on your wish list

805
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,230
as always.

806
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,620
(Exporting.)

807
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:04,140
(Rendering complete.)

808
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,110
(I'm not involved in your past.)

809
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,880
(I don't know anything
about your deep feelings.)

810
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:28,110
(But Lu Xun,)

811
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,160
(in your future,)

812
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,560
(I'll always be there.)

813
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:39,420
(You walk with me through your dreams
and tell me when the light will return.)

814
00:32:56,020 --> 00:33:02,260
(I hope Qian Wei will always be
simple and pure, Lu Xun)

815
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:14,110
(Lu Xun.)

816
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,000
(You idiot.)

817
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,160
(You're the only accident)

818
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,160
(of all my plans,)

819
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:19,640
(but also the one)

820
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,920
(I love the most.)

821
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:15,500
(Elevator No. 2)

822
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,840
Lu Xun.

823
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,120
You're here.

824
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,000
Lu,

825
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,870
are you leaving now?

826
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:29,870
Why not sit for a while?

827
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:31,080
Well…

828
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,630
Qian Wei is awake.

829
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:34,190
Li Chongwen is inside with her.

830
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,320
I'll leave them alone.

831
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,470
You can go in and take a look.

832
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,320
You?

833
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:57,190
Where's Lu Xun?

834
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:01,870
Wei.

835
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,710
Wei.

836
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:04,470
Mom.

837
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:05,360
Finally, you're awake.

838
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,870
Are you feeling well or not?

839
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:10,360
It's all my fault.

840
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,360
From now on,

841
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,670
I'll never go out

842
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:13,360
for so long to travel again.

843
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,470
I gotta spend more time with you.

844
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,320
What happened?

845
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,800
I remembered
that I was trapped in the elevator.

846
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,000
Then I felt like it was falling down

847
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,600
or something like that.

848
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,910
And then I fainted.

849
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,000
What happened?

850
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,670
Have I been in a coma for a long time?

851
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,910
Last time at the Law School party,

852
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:31,430
you got drank,

853
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:32,390
and then accidentally fell into the well

854
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:33,600
behind Jinhua Temple.

855
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,120
That's why

856
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:36,910
you've been in a coma for a month.

857
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,950
You've been undergoing brain therapy.

858
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,670
The doctors told me

859
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,760
that they're not sure
when you'll wake up.

860
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,000
I was so worried.

861
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,040
One month.

862
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,600
How is that possible?

863
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,710
You

864
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:02,520
used to complain

865
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,950
about how your boss mistreated you.

866
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:06,280
But I think he's nice.

867
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:07,600
Look.

868
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:08,800
Before you fell into a coma,

869
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,950
you broke

870
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:10,950
your father's ring.

871
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:12,080
He even found someone

872
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,470
to help fix it.

873
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,950
I just ran into him at the door.

874
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,190
Where is he now?

875
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,710
He saw you are awake

876
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:30,320
and left.

877
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:32,430
Left?

878
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:35,670
Wei, take it easy.

00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:36,800
