1
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:12,600
Did you really go to the suburbs?

2
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,720
Was the air good there?

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,680
Be honest with me.

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,230
Did you go to see AES' people

5
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:19,390
or Mr. Wang?

6
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:20,440
Did you get injured?

7
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,520
I didn't.

8
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,070
There was

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,550
a fight.

10
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,360
But I was certainly the winner.

11
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,470
Don't be facetious.

12
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:31,310
I lost touch with you the whole day.

13
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:32,560
What exactly were you doing there?

14
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:37,910
As a professional lawyer,

15
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:40,000
confidentiality is my duty.

16
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,000
All right.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,880
You won't tell me, right?

18
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:43,400
Starting from today,

19
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,430
I'm gonna stay in your study

20
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:45,470
for some time.

21
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:47,080
I'll see what other secrets you have.

22
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,000
I tell you what,

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,630
having no sense of security

24
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:49,880
is a common problem of girls in love,

25
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,880
so you can't say no.

26
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:52,950
I tell you what,

27
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,040
I'll give you enough sense of security.

28
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:58,910
By the way,

29
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,950
the one I saw was a man,

30
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:01,470
not a woman.

31
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:02,840
Don't overthink.

32
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,720
You can see a woman,

33
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,830
but not a man.

34
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,760
It's absolutely a no-no to see a man,

35
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,000
especially a bunch of men.

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,440
I'll see the men if need be.

37
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,910
I'll take care of things related to men.

38
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:13,440
Do you get it?

39
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:14,680
Why?

40
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,310
OK.

41
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:18,950
You can stay

42
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:20,270
and I can have no secrets,

43
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:21,160
but can you tell me

44
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,080
why you've been

45
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:22,950
so neurotic these days?

46
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,000
What makes you so uptight?

47
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,550
What happened?

48
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,420
=Legally Romance=

49
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:35,140
=Episode 30 The First Stab Suffered
for Probing the AES Case=

50
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,320
You are saying you have prophetic dreams

51
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,320
every time you've done

52
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,750
a brain rehabilitation session.

53
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,440
And this time in your dream,

54
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,910
I was stabbed by a staff
of a filming crew?

55
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:46,750
Well,

56
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,910
don't take it lightly.

57
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:48,750
It was real.

58
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,550
And the stabber

59
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,360
had a scar on his hand.

60
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,910
Although I also had

61
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,000
two prophetic dreams before,

62
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,880
although some details vary,

63
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,520
they've basically

64
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,030
come to pass without much deviation.

65
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,110
I'm sorry.

66
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,190
It's my fault indeed.

67
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,270
I didn't give you
enough sense of security.

68
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,880
No, I'm serious.

69
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:13,110
Here you are.

70
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,360
It has all my bank cards in it.

71
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,080
Each card's PIN number

72
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,750
is your student number

73
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,800
at college.

74
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,830
I'll let you

75
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,080
keep all my money.

76
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,270
Wherever I go,

77
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:25,910
whomever I see,

78
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,080
I'll report it to you.

79
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,630
I'll never make you worried again.

80
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,520
I'll give you
plenty of sense of security.

81
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,080
Do you get it?

82
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,750
(Xun, open the door!)

83
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,880
Your parents?

84
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,390
They were taking a walk nearby

85
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,110
and I suggested they come to visit.

86
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,270
No, no.

87
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:44,960
I can't see them

88
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,030
in such a look today.

89
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,390
(What took you so long
to open the door?)

90
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,630
(What are you fussing about?)

91
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,960
(The dog was too noisy.)

92
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,190
(I was taking care of it.)

93
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:00,630
(You've reached marriageable age.)

94
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,110
(Don't think about
playing with a dog all day.)

95
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:02,960
When are you gonna bring me

96
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,190
a daughter-in-law?

97
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,080
These are your winter clothes.

98
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,190
Clear out your summer clothes.

99
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,190
I'll do it myself.

100
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,670
How can I leave such a thing to my mom?

101
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,550
You haven't taken a sip of water

102
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,190
since you and dad came.

103
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,110
Go out to have some water first.

104
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,360
Then order some food and have a rest.

105
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,270
Leave such a trifle to me.

106
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:15,910
Go quickly to have a rest.

107
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,070
You are getting honey-mouthed.

108
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:17,760
Of course.

109
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,000
Never lose sight of whose son I am,

110
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,720
right?

111
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,230
Where's that white bag?

112
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,000
Didn't you put it on the floor?

113
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,350
I'm old.

114
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:24,880
I forgot.

115
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,320
(I have to take care of you every day.)

116
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,480
Lu Xun.

117
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,720
Who does this girls' stuff belong to?

118
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,070
The pink one. This toothbrush.

119
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:01,950
The girl's…

120
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,000
That's for the housekeeper.

121
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,200
When she came

122
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,200
to clean the house last time,

123
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,320
I bought a set for her.

124
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,070
Housekeeper?

125
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:07,830
You bought the house…

126
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:16,640
Mom, Dad,

127
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,160
well then,

128
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,510
you've seen us with your own eyes.

129
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,790
What shall I do?

130
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,040
I can do nothing about it.

131
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,880
I have to tell you the truth.

132
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,000
To be honest,

133
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,600
actually

134
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,230
this is my girlfriend,

135
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,670
Qian Wei.

136
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,790
Let me formally introduce her to you.

137
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,270
Hello, Uncle, Auntie.

138
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:37,510
This is unexpected.

139
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,480
Hello, hello.

140
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:44,320
Daughter-in-law,

141
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,070
we'll certainly come less often

142
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,270
unless necessary.

143
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,510
But I still have a wish.

144
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,790
When you have kids later,

145
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,040
let them study medicine.

146
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,880
You always talk about your own wish.

147
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,230
Both Qian and Lu Xun

148
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,440
studied law.

149
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,830
Their kids will certainly study law.

150
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:03,510
Exactly.

151
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,350
Isn't it good to study medicine?

152
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,070
What's good about studying medicine?

153
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,830
Well, can you two

154
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,270
stop bickering over such things?

155
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,270
Argue at home.

156
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,110
Go home.

157
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:10,600
Go. Go.

158
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,720
- Talk it over at home.
- Bye, Wei.

159
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,510
Goodbye, Uncle.

160
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,320
- Goodbye, Auntie.
- Bye.

161
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,110
Talk it over

162
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,350
as to whether to study medicine or law.

163
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,350
Don't even know when I'll have kids.

164
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,440
There's something off about it.

165
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,760
Your parents
didn't come earlier or later.

166
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,670
They came

167
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:25,790
hard on my heels.

168
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,880
Did you set a trap for me?

169
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,320
Right.

170
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,760
How could it be such a coincidence?

171
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,880
The timing of my parents' visit.

172
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,670
I tell you what,

173
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,510
I must give you
enough sense of security.

174

You haven't come to my home

181

and visited my family yet.

182
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:53,760

I tell you what,

184
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,200
I'll do the same to you.

185
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,160

186

Right?

192

You are still

193

an eyesore to my brother now.

194

195
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:10,390
And what?

196
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:10,830
Go ahead.

197

Don't you have a boyfriend already?

but we haven't even kissed.

You haven't kissed
after dating for half a year?

222
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,920
I think we are just
not being affectionate enough.

223
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,320
Why are you still together then?

224

don't get me wrong.

226

I'm asking for him.

230
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:02,200
Well I…

231
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,640
When he confessed his love to me,

232
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,670
I just said yes.

233
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:05,600
I thought we could be friends again

234

if it didn't work out.

235
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,640
But I lose the feelings day by day,

236

We are on the verge of breaking up.

240

It's different for everybody.

242
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,790
She's just very fickle in love.

243

♪I'll fight the world for you♪

346
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:09,970
Yeah!

347
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,640
You mean…

348
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,710
You let me take over production

349
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,110
and finish shooting?

350
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:25,960
Back then, you guys said

351
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,030
you'd help me avoid the risk.

352
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,550
Now the risk has come.

353
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,000
It serves us better to reduce the loss

354
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
and dissociate ourselves.

355
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,670
I don't intend to

356
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,910
be partial to either side.

357
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:35,030
We'll

358
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:37,080
continue to help Cool Visitor

and the crew staffs
to ask for their wages.

360
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:40,400
You just need to know that

361
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,280
it takes time

362
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,640
to get the money back.

363
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,790
In this case,

364
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,000
the project of the Court of Law

365
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,350
is bound to be aborted.

366
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,280
I'm sure this is not something

00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,760
you and the filming crew

368
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,790
want to see,

369
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,000
otherwise

370
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,150
you wouldn't hesitate when you were

371
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,110
asked to put in more investments.

372
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,350
So far, I've stopped

373
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,200
those employees

374
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,320
from asking for wages at the doorstep,

375
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,470
but actually

376
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,760
their final goal

377
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,280
is to finish the work

378
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,910
and get back the money they deserve.

379
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,520
If they can't achieve it,

380
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,150
they'll certainly go on making a scene.

381
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,760
If the matter escalates,

382
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,200
both sides will end up as losers.

383
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,520
Besides, I've also heard

384

Cool Visitor and the platform

385
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:17,000
have signed
a strategic partnership agreement

386
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,550
to produce
three online dramas every year.

387
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,150
If work

388

389
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,150
you won't be able to

390
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,280
reach this year's standard.

391

392
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,440
onto the remake project

393
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,150
and pay 30%

394
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,030
of the outstanding renumeration

395
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,470
to show sincerity.

396
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,760
The rest of the amount

397
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,840
embezzled by the production company

398
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,590
is to be split between the two parties.

399
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,400
But this 30%

400
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,350
is not a small amount.

401
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,670
But as long as we guarantee

402
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:50,840
it's finished

403
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,790
and sold without a hitch,

404
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,840
we'll be able to turn loss into profit.

405
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,790
In this way, we can get back

406
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,590
the filming crew's wages

407
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:01,880
and protect the company's reputation.

00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:57,080
I think

422
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,400
you'd better hurry back to the company

423
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,350
in case they'll do something

424

even more over-the-top.

fish for information from Mr. Wang.

The misunderstandings

sowing discord

440
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,000
with the aim of

441

ruining Fawei's reputation

442
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,640

in charge of Qingyun?

450

What does he have to do with us?

Fawei is focused on civil cases.

452
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,150
There's no relevance at all.

453

please approve the acquisition.

456
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,200
It shows that in the case of Qingyun,

457
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,350
the entry of Fawei

458
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:02,150
will bring huge risks.

459
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,150
Once we set up a partnership

460
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,350
with the university,

461
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,350
it means

462
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:06,800
we can have access to

463
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,070
all their accounts.

464
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,560
Through Qingyun, AES

465
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,830
has donated to the university

466
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,110
a host of international-level,

467
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:15,110
expensive and cutting-edge equipment.

468
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,430
Now they are also ready

469
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,760
to set up
a professional training college.

470
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,470
So you mean

471
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,800
those accounts are shady?

472
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,230
I also went to their lab.

473
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,800
One of the workers there told me

474
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,280
they claim to the outside that

475
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,160
all the donated equipment

476
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,400
is imported from Germany.

477
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,190
But actually

478
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,190
the equipment

479
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,760
is mixed with quite a lot
produced in Southeast Asia.

480
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,040
Imported from Germany versus
produced in Southeast Asia,

481
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:43,400
the price difference is poles apart

482
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,880
with as much as a six-digit difference.

483
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,640
The expert
who checked and accepted the equipment

484
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,110
is Wang Ruogu.

485
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:51,350
So

486
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,280
they are not evading tax,

487
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,190
but…

488
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,070
Laundering money.

489
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,310
They want to balance the book

490
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,760
before getting listed.

491
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,350
Exactly.

492
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:04,880
But once this matter

493
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,190
is exposed,

494
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,520
to us,

495
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,400
to the uninformed Guanghua

496
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,350
and to AES,

497
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,350
this will definitely be

498
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,190
an earth-shattering change.

499
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:15,920
How do you see it?

500
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,760
Get to the bottom of it.

501
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,160
Actually

502
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:26,880
I've found out

503
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,830
who their account is.

504
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,350
Maybe it'll be

505
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,310
a bit awkward for you.

How can you make it up to me?

517
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,040
We found Wang Ruogu

518
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,560
has been doing

519
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,350
Qingyun Group's outsourcing accounts

520
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,280
in your name.

521
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,880
I ask you to go.

522
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,160
Don't you hear me?

523
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,920
I've looked through the record.

524
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,310
Wang Ruogu

525
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,160
takes your child

526
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,040
to see you every month.

527
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:00,760
Is it because

528
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,520
you want to see your child so much

529
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,830
that you agreed to

530
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,160
be his chief financial officer?

531
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,640
Ms. Yuan,

532
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,110
your child is old enough

533
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,280
and has a sense of right and wrong.

534
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,760
If he gets to know his parents

535
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,880
are both economic criminals,

536
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,350
how would he feel?

537
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,310
He's been doing it in your name

538
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:18,040
just because he wants you to

539
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,520
be held accountable
in his place one day.

540
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,280
Don't bring up my son!

541
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,830
It is you

542
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,000
who took Qi away from me.

543
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,310
How are you different from him?

544
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,230
How are you different from him?

545
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Ms. Yuan,

546
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,590
it was me to blame for the case
back then.

547
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:33,070
You are right to blame me.

548
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,800
But I hope you can move on.

549
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,950
You can't be
under his control all the time.

550
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,560
That must be Qi's hope as well.

551
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,520
Qi…

552
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:46,160
Qi won't forgive me.

553
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,350
He won't.

554
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,680
It's Yu Tian.

555
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,230
She's doing the actual accounts.

556
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,470
Go catch her if you want.

557
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,350
Don't come to me again.

558
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:11,590
Yu Tian?

559
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,160
Yu Tian,

560
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,110
how about

561
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,760
we talk face to face?

562
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:17,680
No need.

563
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,040
I know nothing.

564
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,430
Don't worry.

565
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,430
The previous accounts were neatly done.

566
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,470
As long as the company can get listed,

567
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,110
nobody will make trouble
for you anymore.

568
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:49,430
The only thing you have to do is

569
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,710
to change your number.

570
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,280
(The subscriber you dialed)

571
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,000
(cannot be connected
for the time being.)

572
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,430
Sit down first.

573
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,400
Hold your horses, hold your horses.

574
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,430
Give her some more time to think.

575
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:15,950
Don't you have

576
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:17,230
something you want to do?

577
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,000
I've been keeping

578
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,350
the file on Ms. Yuan

579
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,640
and Wang Ruogu's case till now.

580
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,520
These are the socks knitted by Ms. Yuan.

581
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,070
I think these socks

582
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,430
mean something different

583
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,000
to her.

584
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,560
I've asked her doctor.

585
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,190
She has actually

586
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,680
got a lot better through therapy and

587
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,710
it's OK for her to leave the hospital.

588
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:45,880
But she still stays in the hospital,

589
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,560
and I think she must

590
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,590
have a knot in her heart.

591
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:50,800
Back then when they were

592
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,470
vying for the custody of their son,

593
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,520
this was the photo

594
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,590
Wang Ruogu provided.

595
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,310
He said Ms. Yuan had bipolar disorder

596
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,520
and often could not control
her emotions.

597
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:00,950
On one occasion,

598
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,640
she carelessly broke a glass

599
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,110
which stabbed her son in the feet.

600
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,590
This was also the key

601
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,430
to his success in winning custody.

602
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,190
Any mother

603
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,190
who saw her own child

604
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,350
get injured because of her

605
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,640
would find it hard to get over it.

606
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:16,830
Maybe

607
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:17,110
that's why

608
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,680
she doesn't want to leave the hospital.

609
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,430
As it happens,

610
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,640
through this opportunity

611
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,830
I want to untie the knot
in Ms. Yuan's heart.

612
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,000
I owe her that.

613
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:30,280
I'm going to the hospital again.

614
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:32,640
Let me go with you.

615
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:33,760
No.

616
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,920
Whoever tied the knot
is responsible for untying it.

617
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:37,520
Besides, we are both women.

618
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,590
We understand each other better.

619
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:39,830
Don't worry.

620
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,000
I'm sure I can handle it well.

621
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,680
Over these years,

622
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,040
my mother has been reluctant
to leave the hospital.

623
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,800
Every time I come to see her,

624
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,110
she stays far away from me

625
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,310
and doesn't come close.

626
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:55,760
I thought

627
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,190
she didn't care about me at all.

628
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:00,470
But little did I think…

629
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:01,590
Over these years,

630
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,430
your mother has been blaming herself

631
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,040
and thinking you got injured

632
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,110
because she didn't

633
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,710
give you good socks to wear.

634
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,590
No.

635
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:11,000
Back then, my dad was beating my mom.

636
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,760
She couldn't take it anymore

637
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,400
and threw a glass

638
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,470
at my dad.

639
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,040
It was not her fault that I got injured.

640
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,280
Mom.

641
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:28,640
Mom.

642
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,400
You knitted so many socks for me.

643
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,800
Why did you never give them to me?

644
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,350
You've grown up.

645
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,310
You no longer need these.

646
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,640
You have to go quickly.

647
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,400
If your dad knows

648
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,400
you've come to see me secretly,

649
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,430
he'll be unhappy again.

650
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,560
Go quickly, go quickly.

651
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,560
Mom, I'm not going!

652
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,400
Go quickly.

653
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,190
I'm not going.

654
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,800
When I was a child, I always thought

655
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,000
you were moody

656
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,160
and cranky.

657
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:10,680
I didn't know until I've grown up

658
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,430
that you were ill.

659
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:15,190
I was supposed to stay by your side

660
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,560
and take care of you,

661
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,160
but I left you behind.

662
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:21,920
I'm sorry.

663
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:27,400
I don't deserve to be your mom.

664
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,470
I made you get injured

665
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:32,310
and have

666
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,760
such an unhappy childhood.

667
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:35,520
Mom,

668
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,190
that was not the case.

669
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:38,800
My feet got stabbed

670
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:41,110
because I wanted to run over there.

671
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,110
I wanted to run to you

672
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,310
to stop Dad from beating you.

673
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,040
Qi,

674
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,590
everything was Mom's fault.

675
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,640
It was Mom to blame.

676
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,040
Mom

677
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,710
shouldn't have let you see these,

678
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:02,350
and shouldn't have let you

679
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:04,520
grow up in such a family.

680
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,110
I'm sorry.

681
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:08,000
Mom, you did nothing wrong.

682
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:09,470
It was my dad's fault.

683
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,230
Don't believe in

684
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:12,400
his lies anymore.

685
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,110
Ms. Yuan,

686
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,310
all these years,

687
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:22,760
Wang Ruogu has been

688
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,880
taking advantage of your self-blame

689
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,280
to make you doubt yourself

690
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,070
and to control you.

691
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:28,680
You've already

692
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,920
missed Qi's childhood.

693
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,880
Do you want to miss his future too?

694
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:35,680
Mom,

695
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,920
I'm coming of age soon.

696
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,800
When you leave the hospital,

697
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,280
I'm gonna move in with you.

698
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,430
Let me protect you.

699
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,230
You've been reluctant
to leave the hospital

700
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,800
because of the knot in your heart

701
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,230
tied by what happened to Qi.

702
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,830
Now the knot is untied.

703
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:56,760
Everything shall pass.

704
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,710
I've found

705
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:01,830
some jobs that suit you

706
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,230
and wrote a resume for you.

707
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:05,680
Make a fresh start,

708
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,400
Ms. Yuan.

709
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,310
All these years,

710
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,160
I've been living on

711
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,520
the alimonies Wang Ruogu pays me.

712
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:31,430
I've been
out of touch with society for so long.

713
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,830
It's never too late

714
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:36,760
as long as you want to.

715
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,190
Mom,

716
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,000
Miss Qian is right.

717
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:42,350
Leave the hospital.

718
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:44,950
I miss you.

719
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,430
Bouquets have been
bought for you for so many years.

720
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,950
You can start to put them at home.

721
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,880
I'll leave you guys alone.

722
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:11,950
Wait a moment.

723
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,310
Though I'm the accountant in name only,

724
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:20,280
as long as you go to the bank

725
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,190
with my ID card,

726
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:22,710
you'll be able to
check Qingyun's accounts.

727
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:25,000
As to other materials you need,

728
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,800
as long as it's within my capacity,

729
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,800
I'm sure I'll help.

730
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:35,590
Actually, both Lu Xun and Qian Wei

731
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,190
have a strong desire to win.

732
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,000
That's why they

733
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,920
keep a close watch on the accounts.

734
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,190
If we

735
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,560
use the strong-arm tactics,

736
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,400
things would get very difficult.

737
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:50,400
I want harmony between us as well.

738
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:53,640
But they don't want to
take the money and stop.

739
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,160
As their senior fellow schoolmate,

740
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,710
you've shown enough forbearance.

741
00:28:58,950 --> 00:28:59,640
But

742
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,000
as the man I trust most,

743
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,310
have you done your best?

744
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:08,400
If you leave this to me,

745
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,190
I'm sure I can do it well.

746
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,520
I trust you.

747
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,110
Go and prepare

748
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,230
the materials for tomorrow's meeting.

749
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,190
Shall I go and talk to them again?

750
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:29,800
OK?

751
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,590
Tomorrow's meeting
is also very important.

752
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:32,430
Please

753
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:32,680
just let me…

754
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,160
Go.

755
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:38,590
OK.

756
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:39,880
I'm going.

757
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:00,060
(CEO)

758
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:01,000
Go ahead.

759
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,880
Actually, Ms. Lan,

760
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,110
you don't need to worry.

761
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:07,800
Yuan Qiao

762
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,680
had severe bipolar disorder,

763
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,470
so her testimony

764
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:13,470
will not be accepted by the court.

765
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:14,920
Even so,

766
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,830
Lu Xun and his team

767
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:17,640
have Yuan Qiao as a living witness.

768
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,400
What kind of evidence can't they get?

769
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,640
If they follow the clues,

770
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,230
sooner or later they'll be able to

771
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:24,590
track down AES's cash flow.

772
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:26,710
I've got the filming crew

773
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,640
all covered.

774
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,110
I'll have them

775
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,680
smash whatever can be smashed

776
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,160
and destroy whatever can be destroyed.

777
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:38,280
Not a single thing will be spared.

778
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,110
Anyway, whatever happens,

779
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,880
AES must launch its IPO next month.

780
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,560
OK.

781
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:48,760
Wish us a successful IPO then.

782
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,160
(Fawei Online)
Certificate of deposit,

783
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,230
labor contract

784
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:09,560
and business license.

785
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,470
Now we only need to get

786
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,310
Qingyun's day-to-day account

787
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,160
to see

788
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,710
AES's true form.

789
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,800
I really didn't expect

790
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,950
such an

791
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:22,400
unlicensed trainee lawyer like me

792
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,110
can even shake

793
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,640
a listed company.

794
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,430
The mere thought of it
makes my blood surging.

795
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,880
You are quite something.

796
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,040
A Prairie Fire Started by a Single Spark

797
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:29,520
tells a story about

798
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,800
self-heating packs like you.

799
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:34,070
I've also asked Zixin

800
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,470
to come and have a look

801
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:36,710
before signing the contract

802
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:37,070
so that we can

803
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,640
have good things coming in pairs.

804
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,040
No problem.

805
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:47,280
Speak of the devil.

806
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,190
Have a read of

807
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,590
this proposal and this contract.

808
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:50,520
See if they are OK.

809
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,640
We'll sign them tomorrow if they are.

810
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:53,350
No need to read.

811
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:54,280
Thank you, guys.

812
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,680
I've talked to the investors.

813
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,110
They have no problem with

814
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,230
the percentage of payment of back pay.

815
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:00,160
But now we must

816
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,160
go through the contract

817
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,400
with the filming crew

818
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,470
and issue a statement of clarification.

819
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,920
OK.

820
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,280
Good things come in pairs indeed.

821
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:08,680
By the way,

822
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,430
let's just not

823
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,280
make members of the filming crew

824
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,430
wait downstairs.

825
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,710
Let them talk with us together.

826
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,880
Has Mr. Wang come?

827
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:15,880
He's not supposed to.

828
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,520
He was told
the contract would be signed tomorrow.

829
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,070
Aren't they Mr. Wang's people?

830
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:21,470
Let's go down to have a look.

831
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:24,710
Here they are!

832
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:25,280
Let's smash!

833
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:26,710
What are you doing?

834
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,000
Don't do it, don't do it.

835
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,710
You can't. There's evidence in it.

836
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:30,710
Qingyun's evidence is in there.

837
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:31,070
Watch out.

838
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:31,880
At such a time,

839
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,760
why are you caring about the evidence?

840
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,590
Isn't life more important than evidence?

841
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,800
They must be AES's people.

842
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,310
Let's go first.

843
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,190
OK.

844
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:49,230
Ms. Lan says

845
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,470
she doesn't want Director Li

846
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:51,520
to have a hand in these things again,

847
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,000
but neither does she want to
put Director Li on the spot.

848
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,230
Director Li,

849
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:57,310
work overtime in the office tonight

850
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,470
and make do for the night.

851
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,000
When the company gets listed,

852
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,280
Ms. Lan will give you

853
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,160
a long leave.

854
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,430
What do you mean?

855
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:26,760
Get in the car.

856
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,640
Wait.

857
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,000
Could here be…?

858
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:44,400
Zixin, get out of here quickly!

859
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,880
Everybody stays where you are!

860
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:47,070
Go!

861
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,760
Qian Wei, take it.

862
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:52,680
I'm not leaving.

863
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:53,590
I'm gonna stay with you.

864
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:21,840
Zixin…

865
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:22,670
Are you all right?

866
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,080
I'm OK.

867
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,000
Watch out.

868
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:54,190
Watch out!

869
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:34,710
Stop.

870
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,150
We've called the police.

871
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:37,230
You dare touch my friends.

872
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:38,360
I'm gonna cut you to pieces!

873
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,840
Go!

874
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,660
(Outpatient Building)

875
00:35:55,660 --> 00:36:00,980
(Emergency Pharmacy)

876
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:10,020
(Emergency Pharmacy)

877
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,520
When we were at college,

878
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,320
the first time I saw you

879
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,190
injured

880
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,190
and it was for catching the bra thief.

881
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,520
When I see you again
so many years later,

882
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,000
I'm bruised again.

883
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:31,870
But it's for Liu.

884
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:35,150
I said back in that year that

885
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:37,280
you'd meet the one better suited to you

886
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,950
earlier than me.

887
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,360
Yes.

888
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:44,760
Now it has come to pass.

889
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,320
And that's good.

890
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:47,670
Back then

891
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:48,630
I just didn't have a thing for him

892
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:49,280
at all.

893
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:50,760
Who would have thought…?

894
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,630
The person you like now

895
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,630
might not be on your radar
when you were young.

896
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,560
But meeting the right person

897
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,120
at the right time

898
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:02,430
is both a luck

899
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:03,360
and happiness.

900
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:04,760
You see,

901
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,230
that's the case for Lu Xun and Qian Wei.

902
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:07,470
And for you two as well.

903
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,560
But what's more,

904
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:11,430
don't call her Liu anymore.

905
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:12,910
You must call her Little Liu.

906
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:15,190
You must

907
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,040
take greater care of

908
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,280
our little Manchurian tiger.

909
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:17,840
Do you hear me?

910
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,520
Uh.

911
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:20,710
Zixin.

912
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:22,950
The police

913
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:24,320
have detained

914
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,230
the leader of the violent mob.

915
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,040
But the dude

916
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:30,230
insisted that he took revenge

917
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,670
in a fit of rage

918
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:34,120
and there was no backer behind him.

919
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:35,360
It seems

920
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,230
AES has paid him a lot.

921
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,320
How are you doing?

922
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,040
Let me have a look.

923
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,080
With an impending IPO,

924
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,040
the pressure
to hit a market value of 10 billion

925
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,360
is no joke for AES.

926
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:55,470
You've also seen

927
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:57,230
their bully-boy tactics.

928
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,190
If you go on looking into the case,

929
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,390
nobody can tell

930
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,390
whether they are gonna

931
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:02,710
do something even more over-the-top
just to protect themselves.

932
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,120
What's your plan

933
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,280
for the next step?

934
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:11,910
Neither I nor Qian Wei is

935
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:13,280
the type of person who gives up halfway.

936
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:15,600
All right.

937
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,670
I know

938
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:19,670
your and Qian Wei's characters,

939
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,670
so I will not give you advice this time.

940
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,190
But you must promise me

941
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:25,670
to ensure your safety.

942
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:26,390
Remember

943
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:27,950
Zhanying will

944
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:29,520
always be your

945
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:31,670
backer.

946
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:42,430
This time you came forward

947
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:43,320
to save a damsel in distress.

948
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,150
Didn't the damsel you saved

949
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:47,040
plight her troth?

950
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,520
She's beating up herself about it now.

951
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:52,560
Comfort her for me.

952
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:53,800
OK.

953
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:59,360
That's very uncool of you.

954
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,080
I'm not blaming you,

955
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:03,600
but can you report to me first

956
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,230
if anything big

957
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:06,040
comes up later?

958
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:06,600
For such a thing,

959
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,470
just tell me,

960
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,230
and I…

961
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:09,630
What are you gonna do?

962
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:10,630
To give him a beating?

963
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,910
Of... Of course.

964
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:18,840
It hurts again.

965
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,840
Thank you for

966
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,910
taking so many beatings for me today

967
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:27,760
and showing me

968
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,600
how you put gals before pals.

969
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:32,800
That's what I should do.

970
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,710
You are my girlfriend.

971
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,280
Don't you

972
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,470
have anything to say to me?

973
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:58,870
I do.

974
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:07,870
This bottle of fizzy water is for you.

975
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:12,470
And…

976
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:14,950
And

977
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,000
you bought this ice cream

978
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:19,190
to give me an ice compress.

979
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,190
I'm not going until it's done.

980
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,320
Does it hurt?

981
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:38,040
It's OK.

982
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:38,760
I'll go easy.

983
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,760
Why is your face getting redder
with the compress?

984
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:57,190
Are you having a fever?

985
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:01,040
What are you doing?

986
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,230
I…

987
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,600
Feel a bit hot.

988
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:09,000
I want to have the ice cream.

989
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,220
(Liu's Boxing Gym)

990
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,280
Come on, come on. Be quick.

991
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:04,800
Daughter!

992
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,150
Daughter!

993
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,950
We came back early.

994
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,120
Isn't this a surprise?

995
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,390
Come, come.

996
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:12,000
Look at the gifts Dad brought you.

997
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,910
This careless girl

998
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:20,080
must have forgotten
to turn off the lights when going out.

999
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:22,080
Go, go.

1000
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:22,870
Let's go upstairs.

1001
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:23,470
Go upstairs.

1002
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,600
Go.

1003
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,630
What are you looking at?

1004
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:27,520
Go, go.

1005
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,150
If my dad saw us

1006
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:29,870
kissing here,

1007
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,600
he'd certainly break your legs.

1008
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:33,190
But we…

1009
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,150
Liu Shiyun,

1010
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:10,670
I like you.

1011
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:12,630
Very much.

1012
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,470
Let's not just try.

1013
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:16,840
Let's

1014
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:18,190
be earnest,

1015
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,230
be serious,

1016
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:22,000
and be together

1017
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:23,800
for the purpose of marriage.

1018
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:25,800
OK?

1019
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,760
Aren't you afraid of
having your legs broken by my dad?

1020
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:36,040
He wouldn't bear to do it for the sake

1021
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:37,470
of his daughter's happiness.

1022
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:55,620
(The Most Handsome Man in the World)

1023
00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:56,320
(The Most Handsome Man in the World)
Who is it?

1024
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,380
(The Most Handsome Man in the World)

1025
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,120
My dad.

1026
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:02,280
Well,

1027
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:04,870
we are in a serious relationship.

1028
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:06,000
Why do we have to be sneaky?

1029
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:08,520
There's no better day than today.

1030
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:09,800
Shall I

1031
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:10,630
go to see

1032
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:11,390
your parents now?

1033
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:12,150
No.

1034
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,600
If my dad sees I took a man home

1035
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,560
at such a late hour,

1036
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,360
be it a good man

1037
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,150
or a bad man,

1038
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:17,390
he can't get out in a standing position.

1039
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,150
Saving your life matters more.

1040
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,150
Let me lay the groundwork first

1041
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:25,120
and fix you up with him later.

1042
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:27,840
Don't worry.

1043
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:30,080
I'll also work out more

1044
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,710
to make myself endure beatings better.

1045
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:42,040
It hurts.

1046
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:43,560
It hurts?

1047
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:49,150
It hurts. It hurts, it hurts…
