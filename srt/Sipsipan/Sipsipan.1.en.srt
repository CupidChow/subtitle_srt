1
00:00:46,299 --> 00:00:48,635
Don’t tell Liza about this, okay?

2
00:00:49,504 --> 00:00:51,654
She won’t find out. Don’t worry.

3
00:01:01,909 --> 00:01:02,910
Oh, shit!

4
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:07,917
Shit!

5
00:01:08,366 --> 00:01:10,660
Keep going! Keep going!

6
00:01:12,579 --> 00:01:13,622
Shit!

7
00:01:17,547 --> 00:01:18,897
Ah, shit!

8
00:01:25,788 --> 00:01:27,205
Keep going. Shit!

9
00:01:36,995 --> 00:01:39,105
Shit... More!

10
00:01:40,388 --> 00:01:41,388
Shit!

11
00:01:42,013 --> 00:01:43,689
Yes! Harder!

12
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:53,024
Shit.

13
00:01:54,227 --> 00:01:55,236
Keep going!

14
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:57,334
Shit! Harder!

15
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:20,773
Shit!

16
00:02:23,092 --> 00:02:24,092
Shit!

17
00:02:27,662 --> 00:02:29,224
Shit, keep going!

18
00:02:33,185 --> 00:02:34,185
Shit!

19
00:02:37,263 --> 00:02:38,617
Ah, shit!

20
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:40,389
Shit...

21
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,486
Shit, keep going! More!

22
00:02:43,651 --> 00:02:44,740
Feels good!

23
00:02:47,996 --> 00:02:49,048
Shit!

24
00:02:51,386 --> 00:02:52,387
Ah, shit!

25
00:02:54,347 --> 00:02:56,725
Ah, shit! Shit!

26
00:02:57,072 --> 00:03:00,646
Shit, keep going! Harder!

27
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:04,251
Shit!

28
00:03:13,184 --> 00:03:14,184
Shit!

29
00:03:31,057 --> 00:03:33,017
Where’ve you been?
Took you long enough.

30
00:03:36,898 --> 00:03:38,483
Lara, we’ll go ahead, alright?

31
00:03:38,859 --> 00:03:41,530
Take care, okay? Call me.

32
00:03:41,945 --> 00:03:43,310
We’re going for round two.

33
00:03:43,405 --> 00:03:45,257
Just don’t say anything to Liza, alright?

34
00:03:45,282 --> 00:03:46,822
Of course. She won’t find out.

35
00:03:49,619 --> 00:03:50,619
Take care!

36
00:03:54,365 --> 00:03:55,867
Man, you’re something else.

37
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:58,170
She’s different from last time, right?

38
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,630
Well, that’s how it is.
I’m just too good-looking.

39
00:04:00,783 --> 00:04:02,493
That’s why you should look up to me.

40
00:04:02,518 --> 00:04:03,525
No way.

41
00:04:03,616 --> 00:04:06,501
Forget it, man. Let’s just go.

42
00:04:06,553 --> 00:04:08,409
- Let’s go.
- I’m on it.

43
00:05:09,324 --> 00:05:11,157
Come on, man, we’re gonna be late.

44
00:05:12,411 --> 00:05:13,454
Yeah.

45
00:05:15,372 --> 00:05:16,706
I’m getting sleepy.

46
00:05:17,712 --> 00:05:20,256
Why don’t you take a nap?

47
00:05:21,893 --> 00:05:22,894
No need.

48
00:05:23,603 --> 00:05:25,230
We’re almost at the
truck stop anyway.

49
00:05:26,591 --> 00:05:27,842
Thanks!

50
00:05:28,614 --> 00:05:29,630
Thank you!

51
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,260
We’re still far from the truck stop,

52
00:05:53,285 --> 00:05:54,488
I though we’re almost there.

53
00:05:55,476 --> 00:05:57,865
When you see a red light,
we’re already there.

54
00:06:15,164 --> 00:06:17,416
There’s the red light.

55
00:06:17,845 --> 00:06:19,430
We’ve arrived.

56
00:06:37,975 --> 00:06:40,180
- Your bag, man.
- Thanks.

57
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,290
Okay.

58
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,977
Your tumbler, man.

59
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,400
[groans]

60
00:06:52,273 --> 00:06:54,560
Liza’s business is really booming.

61
00:06:54,763 --> 00:06:57,140
Yeah, it’s already late. Let’s go!

62
00:06:58,475 --> 00:07:00,310
- Andoy!
- Hey, Liza.

63
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,067
Good thing you dropped by.

64
00:07:02,437 --> 00:07:04,400
What's getting sucked tonight?

65
00:07:05,273 --> 00:07:07,169
Gasoline, or your dick?

66
00:07:09,108 --> 00:07:11,199
You're too much, babe.
Straight to the point, huh?

67
00:07:11,321 --> 00:07:14,676
That’s how deals go faster.

68
00:07:15,116 --> 00:07:16,576
By the way,

69
00:07:16,951 --> 00:07:18,843
your favorite’s got customer.

70
00:07:19,128 --> 00:07:22,264
But I’ve got new ones too,
take your pick.

71
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:27,020
You know you’re the
only one I like, right?

72
00:07:27,337 --> 00:07:28,338
Only you.

73
00:07:28,363 --> 00:07:31,337
Hey man, Liza,
I’m gonna sleep,

74
00:07:31,674 --> 00:07:33,531
while the gasoline's getting pumped out.

75
00:07:34,544 --> 00:07:35,629
Noli!

76
00:07:36,388 --> 00:07:38,640
- Yes, ma’am?
- Suck up their gasoline.

77
00:07:38,665 --> 00:07:40,625
Three gallons. Get it set up.

78
00:07:40,735 --> 00:07:41,777
Alright, ma'am.

79
00:07:43,937 --> 00:07:47,474
Andoy, go rest in the spare room.

80
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,607
I’ll take care of your friend.

81
00:07:50,852 --> 00:07:52,728
- Okay.
- Alright, man.

82
00:07:55,615 --> 00:07:56,658
You do you.

83
00:07:59,327 --> 00:08:01,157
Come on. I’ve been waiting!

84
00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:20,432
Shit--

85
00:08:25,048 --> 00:08:26,048
Shit.

86
00:08:30,904 --> 00:08:31,904
Shit.

87
00:08:34,863 --> 00:08:35,966
Oh, shit!

88
00:08:49,536 --> 00:08:50,536
Shit.

89
00:09:06,653 --> 00:09:08,000
Shit.

90
00:09:25,684 --> 00:09:26,816
You feel so good.

91
00:11:02,302 --> 00:11:03,386
Oh, yeah!

92
00:11:16,774 --> 00:11:17,984
Oh yeah!

93
00:12:05,929 --> 00:12:07,088
Oh shit!

94
00:12:17,198 --> 00:12:18,332
Oh shit!

95
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:26,569
Keep moving!

96
00:12:26,982 --> 00:12:28,720
Oh yeah! There!

97
00:13:16,811 --> 00:13:19,397
Harder! Keep going!

98
00:13:19,819 --> 00:13:21,904
Shit! Go!

99
00:13:34,036 --> 00:13:35,621
You horny--

100
00:13:36,581 --> 00:13:37,665
The best!

101
00:13:41,717 --> 00:13:43,358
You thought I didn’t know?

102
00:13:43,588 --> 00:13:45,405
You took Lara out the other day.

103
00:13:46,591 --> 00:13:48,003
Don’t be jealous.

104
00:13:48,103 --> 00:13:50,094
You know you’re my favorite.

105
00:13:52,013 --> 00:13:53,848
That’s why I always come back to you.

106
00:14:33,179 --> 00:14:34,430
I missed this.

107
00:17:16,717 --> 00:17:19,845
Here you go, Andoy.
Thanks for the business.

108
00:17:20,471 --> 00:17:23,724
I already deducted
what Jugs’ got last night.

109
00:17:25,601 --> 00:17:27,979
Thanks, Liza. See you next time.

110
00:17:28,187 --> 00:17:30,398
Of course. Drop by anytime.

111
00:17:32,149 --> 00:17:33,512
We’ll be back for sure.

112
00:17:33,609 --> 00:17:36,098
Andoy still needs to try
your other service.

113
00:17:36,487 --> 00:17:38,823
You’re crazy. We’ll go ahead.

114
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:41,781
- Bye, babe!
- Thanks, Liza!

115
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:47,384
Say bye, man. Go give her a kiss.

116
00:17:47,707 --> 00:17:49,333
Go give her a kiss.

117
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:10,391
Hey, babe. You’re back.

118
00:18:10,533 --> 00:18:11,743
We just got here.

119
00:18:16,527 --> 00:18:17,570
What’s the occasion?

120
00:18:18,404 --> 00:18:20,698
You cooked a lot today.

121
00:18:21,991 --> 00:18:25,244
It’s our anniversary,
so it should be special.

122
00:18:25,995 --> 00:18:27,160
Right. Sorry, I forgot.

123
00:18:27,246 --> 00:18:31,042
Lots of variety—chicken, shrimp,

124
00:18:31,417 --> 00:18:34,060
sisig, and fish.

125
00:18:34,128 --> 00:18:37,339
And of course, wine later tonight.

126
00:18:37,423 --> 00:18:40,832
- Wow.
- Of course. You were gone so long.

127
00:18:40,926 --> 00:18:44,263
So it better be a feast.

128
00:18:45,097 --> 00:18:46,807
What do you want to eat?

129
00:18:49,226 --> 00:18:50,269
Do you even have to ask?

130
00:18:52,489 --> 00:18:53,532
You, of course.

131
00:22:19,561 --> 00:22:22,231
One more, one more.

132
00:22:24,191 --> 00:22:25,192
Thanks.

133
00:22:28,529 --> 00:22:30,656
- Dig in, man.
- Thanks.

134
00:22:32,491 --> 00:22:35,703
Good thing traffic was light today.
Trip went fast.

135
00:22:37,277 --> 00:22:38,987
We’ll be back at Liza’s in no time.

136
00:22:41,292 --> 00:22:43,794
Looks like you’re too excited, man.

137
00:22:44,878 --> 00:22:47,423
Of course. She’s probably
waiting for me.

138
00:22:50,801 --> 00:22:52,970
What about you, man?
Why don’t you try it out too?

139
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:56,765
Liza’s got some hot chicks—
young and sexy.

140
00:22:57,349 --> 00:22:58,600
Give it a shot sometime.

141
00:22:59,184 --> 00:23:00,728
You know why I don’t.

142
00:23:01,812 --> 00:23:03,939
And besides,

143
00:23:04,481 --> 00:23:05,858
that’s just extra expense.

144
00:23:10,195 --> 00:23:11,737
Let’s split this.

145
00:23:17,453 --> 00:23:18,537
Eat some more.

146
00:23:18,912 --> 00:23:20,728
I already ate a lot.

147
00:23:48,984 --> 00:23:50,069
We’re here.

148
00:23:51,153 --> 00:23:52,154
Let’s go?

149
00:23:55,449 --> 00:23:57,076
Don’t turn it off yet.

150
00:23:59,165 --> 00:24:00,959
Andoy! Three again?

151
00:24:03,582 --> 00:24:06,085
- The usual.
- Come on, babe. Let’s go.

152
00:24:06,491 --> 00:24:07,784
Hold on,

153
00:24:09,046 --> 00:24:10,923
just buying your truck’s load.

154
00:24:22,976 --> 00:24:24,895
Ligaya, come here.

155
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:45,947
A truck’s here for a refill—three gallons.

156
00:24:47,167 --> 00:24:50,246
Andoy, Jugs, this is Ligaya.

157
00:24:50,587 --> 00:24:52,631
My best friend from Pampanga.

158
00:24:53,465 --> 00:24:55,300
Nice to meet you, Ms. Beautiful.

159
00:24:55,757 --> 00:24:59,131
Hey, Jugs! Ligaya’s off-limits, alright?

160
00:24:59,221 --> 00:25:02,467
She handles fuel,
not... other things.

161
00:25:03,216 --> 00:25:05,302
Jeez, you’re jealous already.

162
00:25:05,686 --> 00:25:07,938
I was just being friendly.

163
00:25:08,105 --> 00:25:11,311
I’m just being clear.
Ligaya’s a proper lady.

164
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:13,944
Andoy.

165
00:25:16,613 --> 00:25:18,323
We’ll go start.

166
00:25:24,866 --> 00:25:28,089
Noli, three gallons for that truck.

167
00:25:50,939 --> 00:25:53,790
- Need help?
- Oh, hey, Andoy.

168
00:25:54,651 --> 00:25:58,062
It’s fine. I’m used
to this kind of work.

169
00:25:59,531 --> 00:26:02,159
How about keeping me company
for coffee instead?

170
00:26:02,618 --> 00:26:04,828
- Oh, no—it’s alright.
- Come on, don’t say no.

171
00:26:05,106 --> 00:26:06,246
It’s my treat. Come on.

172
00:26:08,207 --> 00:26:09,208
Okay, fine.

173
00:26:15,547 --> 00:26:17,633
Um, Ligaya,

174
00:26:18,467 --> 00:26:20,890
how’d you end up working here?

175
00:26:22,429 --> 00:26:24,306
I’m on my own now.

176
00:26:25,182 --> 00:26:27,434
My parents are gone,

177
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:31,605
and I don’t have any
relatives to turn to, so yeah.

178
00:26:32,397 --> 00:26:34,274
I ended up here with Liza.

179
00:26:37,903 --> 00:26:41,365
So... How do you know Liza?

180
00:26:42,381 --> 00:26:44,342
We were classmates in grade school.

181
00:26:45,035 --> 00:26:47,538
When she heard about what happened,

182
00:26:47,913 --> 00:26:53,210
she called and offered me a job here.

183
00:27:00,133 --> 00:27:02,302
Good thing she brought you here.

184
00:27:03,554 --> 00:27:05,764
Huh? Why?

185
00:27:07,474 --> 00:27:08,767
Because if it weren’t for her,

186
00:27:09,226 --> 00:27:12,771
I wouldn’t have met the most
beautiful woman on Earth.

187
00:27:12,926 --> 00:27:14,969
Ugh, flatterer.

188
00:27:32,207 --> 00:27:33,667
Thanks for the coffee.

189
00:27:34,501 --> 00:27:37,337
I’ll head back inside,
I still have stuff to do.

190
00:27:37,629 --> 00:27:39,548
I’ll go take a nap then.

191
00:28:09,161 --> 00:28:11,496
Huh? Ligaya?

192
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,354
Hey man, wake up!

193
00:29:59,521 --> 00:30:00,605
Hey--

194
00:30:00,814 --> 00:30:02,399
Why are you sleeping there? It’s hot.

195
00:30:03,191 --> 00:30:04,401
Come inside.

196
00:30:35,849 --> 00:30:38,810
Babe, how are you feeling?

197
00:30:40,479 --> 00:30:43,565
I’m fine, babe. Why?

198
00:30:48,361 --> 00:30:49,613
Did you have your check up?

199
00:30:51,865 --> 00:30:52,866
Babe...

200
00:30:54,409 --> 00:30:55,911
Still nothing...

201
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,335
I really thought

202
00:31:04,252 --> 00:31:05,629
this time would be it.

203
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:13,345
I know you want to have a baby.

204
00:31:14,012 --> 00:31:16,973
But don’t worry, we won’t give up.

205
00:31:25,106 --> 00:31:28,401
Maybe you should take
a break from teaching?

206
00:31:28,693 --> 00:31:30,362
Avoid the stress?

207
00:31:31,655 --> 00:31:36,335
I can’t just leave teaching like that.

208
00:31:36,493 --> 00:31:40,038
The kids need me.

209
00:31:42,499 --> 00:31:47,045
You take care of so many kids,
but we can’t have one of our own.

210
00:32:11,302 --> 00:32:12,595
- Cheers!
- Shot!

211
00:32:13,905 --> 00:32:15,590
Let’s look for some girls.

212
00:32:15,615 --> 00:32:17,171
Hey man, there’s one.

213
00:32:17,196 --> 00:32:18,309
Let me, let me.

214
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:19,953
Hi, miss!

215
00:32:20,579 --> 00:32:21,793
How about a
little entertainment?

216
00:32:21,817 --> 00:32:24,778
Oh, I’m just an attendant here.

217
00:32:25,083 --> 00:32:26,977
Don’t be shy. We’ll pay.

218
00:32:27,002 --> 00:32:28,178
Yeah, come on.

219
00:32:28,203 --> 00:32:30,165
- Sir!
- Come on. Just for a bit.

220
00:32:30,291 --> 00:32:31,566
- Come on, this is our table.
- Sir.

221
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:33,549
Sir, I think you’ve
had enough to drink.

222
00:32:33,608 --> 00:32:35,485
- Don’t be picky.
- Sir--

223
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:37,262
- I said no.
- Come on!

224
00:32:37,596 --> 00:32:39,281
We’ll pay you.

225
00:32:39,306 --> 00:32:41,171
- I said, I'm not...
- Hey, hey!

226
00:32:41,558 --> 00:32:42,642
Who are you guys?

227
00:32:43,518 --> 00:32:44,936
Bastards.

228
00:32:45,116 --> 00:32:46,156
Come on, bro.

229
00:32:46,813 --> 00:32:48,064
You bastards--

230
00:32:52,413 --> 00:32:55,039
- Come on.
- Show some respect to women.

231
00:32:55,238 --> 00:32:56,639
- Sorry, sorry--
- Who’s this guy?

232
00:32:56,865 --> 00:32:58,074
Don’t be an asshole.

233
00:32:59,784 --> 00:33:01,620
- Sorry, boss.
- She’s yours.

234
00:33:06,791 --> 00:33:07,834
You okay?

235
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,757
Thanks, Andoy. I’m glad you came.

236
00:33:14,424 --> 00:33:15,467
Don’t mention it.

237
00:33:16,441 --> 00:33:21,080
Ligaya, I brought you something.

238
00:33:22,098 --> 00:33:24,309
You didn’t have to. Thanks.

239
00:33:29,816 --> 00:33:30,816
Come on.

240
00:39:56,492 --> 00:40:00,163
So, does this mean…
you’re saying yes?

241
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,571
Of course.

242
00:40:03,232 --> 00:40:07,020
We wouldn’t be doing this
if we didn’t love each other.

243
00:40:07,045 --> 00:40:08,087
Yes!

244
00:40:08,921 --> 00:40:13,968
Finally! I got the most beautiful
woman in the world to say yes.

245
00:40:14,139 --> 00:40:17,638
Stop it. Quit your sweet talk.

246
00:40:18,264 --> 00:40:20,892
No, I mean it.

247
00:40:21,309 --> 00:40:24,687
You really are the most
beautiful woman to me.

248
00:40:25,063 --> 00:40:28,566
And I swear, I’ll never hurt you.

249
00:40:30,234 --> 00:40:32,779
- Promise?
- Promise.

250
00:40:34,113 --> 00:40:35,948
I love you, Andoy.

251
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,451
I love you too, Ligaya.

252
00:44:32,435 --> 00:44:36,689
Babe, like I said,
you don’t have to work.

253
00:44:37,148 --> 00:44:39,233
Just stay home so you
don’t tire yourself out.

254
00:44:40,276 --> 00:44:42,862
So you can relax.

255
00:44:47,533 --> 00:44:50,661
Come on, I’ll get bored
if I just stay here.

256
00:44:50,911 --> 00:44:53,539
And you’re always out driving, so…

257
00:44:53,831 --> 00:44:57,168
I’d rather keep myself busy.

258
00:44:58,377 --> 00:45:00,046
You’re so stubborn.

259
00:45:00,463 --> 00:45:04,258
Fine, just promise me
you’ll take care of yourself.

260
00:45:04,608 --> 00:45:05,608
Hmm?

261
00:45:06,969 --> 00:45:08,304
Of course, babe.

262
00:45:08,596 --> 00:45:11,349
You too, okay? Drive safely.

263
00:45:11,557 --> 00:45:13,060
When’s your next trip again?

264
00:45:20,733 --> 00:45:22,902
<i>I miss you, babe.</i>

265
00:45:23,653 --> 00:45:25,279
When’s your next trip again?

266
00:45:28,574 --> 00:45:29,575
Babe!

267
00:45:30,242 --> 00:45:32,244
Yeah? What’s up?

268
00:45:32,453 --> 00:45:34,372
You seem super busy all of a sudden.

269
00:45:34,893 --> 00:45:35,893
Oh...

270
00:45:36,332 --> 00:45:38,376
Sorry, babe. It’s Jugs.

271
00:45:38,751 --> 00:45:41,504
He’s been pestering me—
wants to hit the road again.

272
00:45:42,129 --> 00:45:44,674
You know, he needs the money.

273
00:45:45,508 --> 00:45:46,681
I see.

274
00:45:48,594 --> 00:45:51,222
What were you asking again?

275
00:45:51,597 --> 00:45:55,332
I was asking when are you
leaving again?

276
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:57,629
Looks like you’re heading out
earlier than planned.

277
00:45:59,105 --> 00:46:00,398
Sorry again, babe.

278
00:47:25,483 --> 00:47:28,444
Hey man, what’s taking you
so long? Let’s go!

279
00:47:28,736 --> 00:47:30,400
Yeah, yeah, just a second!

280
00:47:32,615 --> 00:47:33,699
Hurry up!

281
00:47:40,456 --> 00:47:42,208
Looks like you’re extra pumped today.

282
00:47:43,125 --> 00:47:45,252
Can’t wait to get back to Liza’s, huh?

283
00:47:46,378 --> 00:47:48,339
Well, we just refilled with a fresh load—

284
00:47:48,364 --> 00:47:51,325
we’ve got a lot of
gas to pump out.

285
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:54,678
I thought you were excited
to get a taste of Ligaya.

286
00:47:54,929 --> 00:47:56,013
Idiot!

287
00:47:56,555 --> 00:47:58,891
Well, that too. Come on!

288
00:48:01,477 --> 00:48:02,478
Let’s go! Hurry!

289
00:48:38,764 --> 00:48:42,059
Here to pump out gas again?

290
00:48:42,476 --> 00:48:43,503
Yep, Liza.

291
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:44,796
Um...

292
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:46,089
Babe.

293
00:48:47,773 --> 00:48:51,235
I’ll take care of this, Liza.
I’ll just wait for Ligaya.

294
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:54,947
Jugs is too eager for you.

295
00:48:55,239 --> 00:48:58,492
- Go on, I got this.
- Okay. Thanks, Andoy.

296
00:48:59,285 --> 00:49:01,036
- Go on, man.
- Okay. Let’s go, babe.

297
00:49:07,501 --> 00:49:09,128
Hey, Noli, you good?

298
00:49:09,628 --> 00:49:12,814
Let that engine cool
before you pump.

299
00:49:12,882 --> 00:49:14,008
Andoy!

300
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:15,843
Ligaya!

301
00:49:18,436 --> 00:49:19,436
Wow!

302
00:49:20,222 --> 00:49:22,433
It’s good that you’re back early.

303
00:49:22,933 --> 00:49:25,144
I thought your trip
wasn’t till next week.

304
00:49:25,853 --> 00:49:28,188
Well, you know...

305
00:49:28,772 --> 00:49:31,734
how much I missed your kisses.

306
00:49:31,759 --> 00:49:33,312
I just couldn’t wait any longer.

307
00:49:33,945 --> 00:49:35,426
- Oh, come on.
- I missed you so much.

308
00:49:35,738 --> 00:49:39,325
Don’t worry. I’ll make all
your exhaustion go away.

309
00:49:40,284 --> 00:49:43,787
You won’t feel anything
but pleasure tonight.

310
00:49:44,038 --> 00:49:46,290
Really? Let’s go.

311
00:49:46,832 --> 00:49:49,209
- Come here.
- Where?

312
00:49:49,501 --> 00:49:50,753
Just for a while.

313
00:49:54,214 --> 00:49:56,425
Andoy, what’s this?
Why’d you bring me here?

314
00:49:56,450 --> 00:49:58,936
Just for a second.
I'll take care of you.

315
00:53:27,678 --> 00:53:34,518
I took the pregnancy test earlier.
We’re having a baby!

316
00:54:16,823 --> 00:54:17,823
Yay!

317
00:54:19,188 --> 00:54:20,314
Thank you, babe!

318
00:54:20,814 --> 00:54:23,483
You know how long I’ve
dreamed of having a child.

319
00:54:24,067 --> 00:54:27,709
Thanks to you, it’s finally coming true.
A happy family.

320
00:54:29,494 --> 00:54:33,322
Just keep all your promises.

321
00:54:33,952 --> 00:54:37,414
Of course. I swear to anyone—

322
00:54:37,956 --> 00:54:40,167
I’ll take care of you and our baby.

323
00:54:40,834 --> 00:54:42,377
I love you so much, Ligaya.

324
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:44,963
I love you too, Andoy.

325
00:54:57,100 --> 00:55:00,771
Take care, Andoy!
Jugs, drive safe!

326
00:55:33,595 --> 00:55:34,721
Are you Ligaya?

327
00:55:35,222 --> 00:55:36,807
Yes. Why?

328
00:55:37,557 --> 00:55:40,519
I’m Mercy. Andoy’s wife.

329
00:55:43,981 --> 00:55:47,442
Don’t be scared.
I’m not here to fight.

330
00:55:48,068 --> 00:55:49,573
I’m not here to cause trouble.

331
00:55:49,987 --> 00:55:52,489
I just wanted to meet you.

332
00:56:00,747 --> 00:56:01,999
How many months along are you?

333
00:56:06,091 --> 00:56:07,426
Almost three.

334
00:56:09,006 --> 00:56:12,551
You know, Andoy really
wanted to have a child.

335
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,221
But no matter what I did,

336
00:56:17,055 --> 00:56:18,348
I couldn’t give him one.

337
00:56:18,974 --> 00:56:21,101
Because the problem’s with me.

338
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:26,231
I didn’t tell him,

339
00:56:27,065 --> 00:56:28,734
because I didn’t want to lose him.

340
00:56:29,443 --> 00:56:31,903
I had no idea. I’m sorry.

341
00:56:32,362 --> 00:56:36,298
Don’t say sorry. I know
my husband’s a womanizer.

342
00:56:36,491 --> 00:56:39,119
I’ve caught and forgiven
him so many times.

343
00:56:39,828 --> 00:56:44,288
But this time feels different.

344
00:56:48,795 --> 00:56:50,088
Because now,

345
00:56:51,381 --> 00:56:55,886
you can give him what I never could.

346
00:56:57,220 --> 00:56:58,347
Sorry...

347
00:56:59,556 --> 00:57:03,333
It’s not your fault.
Stop apologizing.

348
00:57:05,228 --> 00:57:07,230
All I ask, Ligaya,

349
00:57:08,106 --> 00:57:09,858
please take care of Andoy.

350
00:57:11,318 --> 00:57:12,694
He’s a good man.

351
00:57:13,445 --> 00:57:15,822
Yes, he made mistakes,

352
00:57:17,574 --> 00:57:20,535
but maybe he just
followed his heart.

353
00:57:21,661 --> 00:57:23,997
He’ll be a good father to your baby.

354
00:57:25,457 --> 00:57:30,023
I hope you two get to
build the happy family

355
00:57:30,295 --> 00:57:32,506
I couldn’t give him.

356
00:59:41,499 --> 00:59:43,918
Hey, babe.
Where are you going?

357
00:59:48,428 --> 00:59:50,221
What happened? Something wrong?

358
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:54,049
I know about you and Ligaya.

359
00:59:55,273 --> 00:59:57,299
I also know… you’re having a baby.

360
00:59:57,582 --> 00:59:58,582
What?

361
01:00:02,614 --> 01:00:03,698
Babe, I’m sorry.

362
01:00:04,824 --> 01:00:05,909
Sorry.

363
01:00:07,536 --> 01:00:10,497
Babe, please, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

364
01:00:11,998 --> 01:00:15,210
Please don’t leave me. Please.

365
01:00:16,336 --> 01:00:17,420
Please, stay.

366
01:00:24,135 --> 01:00:27,172
It’s okay, Andoy. It’s okay.

367
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:33,061
I know how long you’ve wanted a child.

368
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:39,610
That one thing
I just couldn’t give you.

369
01:00:41,528 --> 01:00:43,613
Now, you’ll have it.

370
01:00:46,074 --> 01:00:47,576
You’ll be a dad.

371
01:00:50,996 --> 01:00:52,581
You’ll finally build

372
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:55,542
that family you’ve been dreaming of.

373
01:00:58,211 --> 01:00:59,629
But how about you?

374
01:01:01,673 --> 01:01:05,635
Don’t worry about me.
I’ll go back to my parents.

375
01:01:06,553 --> 01:01:08,805
They’ll understand my decision.

376
01:01:25,530 --> 01:01:27,324
I’m letting you go.

377
01:02:06,613 --> 01:02:08,573
Looks like you’ve really made up
your mind, huh?

378
01:02:09,741 --> 01:02:12,911
Yeah, man. I’m all in.

379
01:02:13,745 --> 01:02:16,247
I’m bringing Ligaya home—
so we can finally live together.

380
01:02:16,748 --> 01:02:18,750
And so I can be there for her
during the pregnancy.

381
01:02:19,709 --> 01:02:21,586
You’re really excited
to be a dad, huh?

382
01:02:22,712 --> 01:02:23,963
Of course, man.

383
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:27,217
You know I’ve wanted this for so long.

384
01:02:28,206 --> 01:02:29,488
What about Mercy?

385
01:02:34,391 --> 01:02:35,892
She already knows everything.

386
01:02:37,310 --> 01:02:39,396
She found out about Ligaya.

387
01:02:40,188 --> 01:02:41,481
We’ve split up.

388
01:02:42,607 --> 01:02:44,275
She went back to her family.

389
01:02:45,318 --> 01:02:47,737
You know, it’s not like you
did anything wrong.

390
01:02:48,947 --> 01:02:50,532
You just happened
to love two people.

391
01:03:30,905 --> 01:03:32,115
Ligaya!

392
01:03:33,450 --> 01:03:35,285
Ligaya, I’m here!

393
01:03:37,343 --> 01:03:41,013
What the hell, Andoy?
Why are you yelling?

394
01:03:42,250 --> 01:03:43,334
When is she coming back?

395
01:03:43,626 --> 01:03:45,003
She’s gone.

396
01:03:46,296 --> 01:03:47,756
What are you talking about, Liza?

397
01:03:48,465 --> 01:03:50,175
She’s not coming back.

398
01:03:50,759 --> 01:03:52,510
Don’t mess with me, Liza.

399
01:03:55,305 --> 01:03:58,641
- Ligaya! Ligaya!
- Andoy!

400
01:03:59,893 --> 01:04:00,977
Andoy!

401
01:04:04,814 --> 01:04:08,193
Ligaya! Ligaya! Li--

402
01:04:15,636 --> 01:04:16,929
What are you doing, Andoy?

403
01:04:19,204 --> 01:04:21,080
You can turn this whole place
upside down,

404
01:04:21,105 --> 01:04:22,607
but Ligaya’s not coming back.

405
01:04:23,333 --> 01:04:25,627
You know how this business works.

406
01:04:27,587 --> 01:04:29,971
I don’t even know why you let
yourself get fooled.

407
01:04:31,357 --> 01:04:33,443
We’re the ones fooling people here—

408
01:04:33,468 --> 01:04:35,460
tricking them just to suck out their gas.

409
01:04:40,350 --> 01:04:41,559
That’s enough, man.

410
01:04:44,729 --> 01:04:47,273
This place is only for gasoline.

411
01:04:49,108 --> 01:04:51,028
You never should’ve brought
your heart into this.

412
01:04:54,739 --> 01:04:56,449
That was never part
of the business.

413
01:05:11,297 --> 01:05:13,550
She wouldn’t leave me.

414
01:05:18,888 --> 01:05:20,348
Let it go, man.

415
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:26,070
Let Ligaya go.

416
01:06:22,035 --> 01:06:24,704
We’re here at the truck stop,
are we going to drop by?

417
01:06:25,246 --> 01:06:26,246
No.

418
01:06:26,748 --> 01:06:28,458
I was lost once,

419
01:06:29,042 --> 01:06:30,418
and I can’t let that happen again.
