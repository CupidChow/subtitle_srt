1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,040
What?

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:03,410
Really?

3
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:04,639
I'm telling you.

4
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:06,179
I noticed him as soon as I went in.

5
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:07,209
It was Lee Jeong Hoon.

6
00:00:07,209 --> 00:00:08,279
My gosh!

7
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:11,550
Then did he come here alone to watch
his girlfriend's movie at this hour?

8
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,820
My gosh.
He must really love Yeo Ha Jin.

9
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,849
Hey, let's go.
I want to see him too.

10
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:16,989
Wait, no.

11
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,059
Let's stay here for now.

12
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,989
- You want to stay here?
- Yes.

13
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:22,390
Why?

14
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,039
(Episode 8)

15
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:40,179
Hey, get him.

16
00:00:40,179 --> 00:00:41,609
- I'll take this side first.
- Take the picture.

17
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:42,609
My gosh!

18
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:43,979
- This is huge!
- Please stop.

19
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:45,119
- His face is tiny!
- Please don't take pictures.

20
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:46,649
Smile, girls. Let's go.

21
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:48,049
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye!

22
00:00:49,189 --> 00:00:50,719
I take back
that I called you cheesy!

23
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,490
I hope you and Ha Jin
stay in love for a long time!

24
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:53,990
This is huge.
He has such a tiny face.

25
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:55,289
- Yes!
- My gosh!

26
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:57,829
That was like a terrorist attack.

27
00:01:22,989 --> 00:01:24,689
What am I doing?

28
00:01:37,769 --> 00:01:38,840
What is this?

29
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,569
(I ran into Lee Jeong Hoon
at the movies today.)

30
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:47,209
Ha Kyung!

31
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,849
Ha Kyung! Wake up!

32
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,280
Come on.

33
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:53,790
There's no time to sleep.

34
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,549
Wake up. Hurry. Wake up.

35
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:57,560
- Okay?
- What? What is it?

36
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,989
No! We're late for the interview!

37
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:02,859
No, we aren't late.
It's not the evening.

38
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:04,329
It's 5:30 a.m.

39
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:05,730
In the morning?

40
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,370
Why aren't you asleep?

41
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,830
I woke up to go to the restroom,

42
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,599
then checked
my social media for a second...

43
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:13,569
and found out Jeong Hoon
went to watch my movie yesterday,

44
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:15,439
and he went all by himself
for the late-night show.

45
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:17,009
- What?
- Look.

46
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,250
Someone who watched the movie...

47
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,849
in the same movie theater
uploaded that.

48
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,750
She said...

49
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,349
he cried a lot
while he watched the movie.

50
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:28,689
He must've gotten
overly emotional...

51
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:31,259
because he didn't leave
for a long time even after it ended.

52
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:34,259
Is he really insane?

53
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:35,960
It looks like...

54
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,229
I should probably contact him first.

55
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,930
Why are you taking things that way?

56
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,599
Think about it.

57
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:46,270
Why do you think he suddenly went
to watch my movie that late?

58
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:48,710
He probably couldn't sleep.

59
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:50,740
Of course, it's because of me.

60
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,680
He missed me.

61
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,110
That was an easy question.

62
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,379
It's so obvious.

63
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:56,979
I think you're right.

64
00:02:56,979 --> 00:02:58,449
You'll never date anyone.

65
00:02:58,449 --> 00:02:59,650
You're right.

66
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,590
Do you think so too?

67
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,159
Yes.

68
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,259
I'll contact him first.

69
00:03:06,259 --> 00:03:07,930
Do whatever you want.

70
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,560
Okay. Go back to sleep.

71
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,750
I'm going to work
without having breakfast.

72
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,479
Will you please buy some food?

73
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,680
What's wrong with your house?

74
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,669
(New message, Jo Il Kwon)

75
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:53,000
Congratulations.

76
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,110
You've become
the number-one romantic in Korea.

77
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,009
That was quick.

78
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,480
What is this?

79
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:15,889
Why is it so messy around here?

80
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,160
My gosh.

81
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,730
Ha Jin!

82
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,439
She wants me to clean this up?

83
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,060
Yeo Ha Jin!

84
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:12,579
It's been a while.

85
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:15,149
What are you doing here
so early in the morning?

86
00:06:15,149 --> 00:06:16,610
We need to talk.

87
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,819
The weather seems
to be getting even colder.

88
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,120
This is bearable.
Let's go to that cafe.

89
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,720
Let's go to that one instead.

90
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,560
No, let's go there.
We always went there.

91
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,560
You're right.

92
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:33,029
- Goodness.
- I have a coupon as well.

93
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:34,029
Get in.

94
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:35,629
Let's go here.

95
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:43,709
What's wrong?

96
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:44,879
Drive.

97
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:46,040
To where?

98
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,850
Anywhere. Just step on it.

99
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,990
You always had that drink?

100
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,620
It's because we always
go there together.

101
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,889
What's going on?

102
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,629
There was someone
I didn't want to run into.

103
00:07:06,829 --> 00:07:09,170
By the way, why do we need to talk?

104
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,170
I was taken aback.

105
00:07:14,209 --> 00:07:17,180
I didn't know you'd go watch
my movie alone.

106
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,209
So I thought long and hard...

107
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,319
about what to do...

108
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:27,389
regarding your love for me.

109
00:07:27,649 --> 00:07:30,189
What? What do you mean?

110
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:33,319
Stop right there. Let me talk first.

111
00:07:34,459 --> 00:07:36,230
Listen to me first.

112
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:39,329
I know you regret saying
what you did...

113
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:41,199
last time we were here.

114
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,639
So I'm going to give you
another chance.

115
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,500
What do you...

116
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:49,439
Not yet. I'm not done talking.

117
00:07:51,579 --> 00:07:54,779
Is it because you feel pressured
about dating a celebrity?

118
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:57,620
No. It's not like that at all.

119
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,579
I watched your movie...

120
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:01,250
because I had to interview
Director Ji Hyun Geun later.

121
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,189
Please don't misunderstand me.

122
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,089
I was wrong.

123
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,490
You have an interview
with Director Ji.

124
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,069
Then let me ask you one question.

125
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,310
Did you ever think about me
during the past several days?

126
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,839
Or did you forget about me?

127
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,410
Well...

128
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:34,019
I'm not the type who forgets easily.

129
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:38,720
Does that mean you thought about me?

130
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,460
I guess you didn't forget about me.

131
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,700
I'm glad.

132
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,899
I'm going to keep
misunderstanding you.

133
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:49,429
I'm going to think that
you watched that movie...

134
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:50,500
because you missed me.

135
00:08:50,669 --> 00:08:51,740
Why...

136
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,340
I'm quite popular these days.

137
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,610
I shot advertisements, photoshoots,
and interviews.

138
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:58,909
Many directors want me
in their dramas.

139
00:08:58,909 --> 00:09:00,850
I'm getting fewer hate comments now.

140
00:09:01,309 --> 00:09:03,009
People are starting to like me more.

141
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:08,019
But I'm not that elated.

142
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,860
The past me
would've been exhilarated.

143
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:17,600
I think it's because of you.

144
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,559
You said...

145
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:24,669
we were just going back
to our places.

146
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,639
You said it was simple.

147
00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:30,269
But that's not the case for me.

148
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:33,080
I need more time.

149
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:35,750
Everyone has their own pace.

150
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,789
I'm a bit surprised by your answer.

151
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:44,090
I guess I really wanted this
to work out.

152
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,460
So let me misunderstand you
for the time being.

153
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:51,200
Who knows? Perhaps, it's not
a misunderstanding.

154
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,299
Maybe you need more time...

155
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,669
to become honest with me.

156
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:02,610
Do as you please.

157
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:05,279
You can ignore my calls and block...

158
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:08,850
No. Don't block me.

159
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,919
If you ignore me for too long,
I might barge into your house.

160
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,889
Don't forget that I know
where you live.

161
00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:17,789
Is that a threat?

162
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,559
Not really.

163
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:27,000
Right, how was the movie?
Was it interesting?

164
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,940
Was it that bad?

165
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,039
It was interesting.

166
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:39,779
Really? How was my acting?

167
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,210
It was good.

168
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,950
Your role suited you.

169
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,450
I can understand why people like it.

170
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:51,759
Oh, right. I wasn't going
to take much of your time.

171
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:54,429
Thank you for sparing your time.

172
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:55,990
I'm done talking...

173
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,960
although this wasn't
what I had anticipated.

174
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,370
I'm sorry, but can you call a cab?

175
00:11:03,669 --> 00:11:06,769
I feel awkward about driving
you home after this talk.

176
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:08,870
Sure.

177
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,470
Then I'll be leaving now.

178
00:11:27,889 --> 00:11:29,059
Gosh.

179
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:33,360
I couldn't find you.
I thought you ran away.

180
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,929
Maybe I should have.

181
00:11:35,169 --> 00:11:37,200
Don't get smart with me.

182
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,100
You're all dressed up.

183
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,269
Do I really need to go?

184
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:42,370
Of course.

185
00:11:42,509 --> 00:11:44,279
We're receiving
the Program of the Year.

186
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:45,710
If you don't go, then who will?

187
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:49,179
You were here.

188
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:54,320
I guess you're getting ready
to go to the awards ceremony.

189
00:11:54,649 --> 00:11:56,289
He can go.

190
00:11:56,289 --> 00:11:57,289
Me?

191
00:11:57,289 --> 00:11:59,389
The award isn't given
specifically to me, anyway.

192
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:00,889
Should I?

193
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:03,629
I can change in a jiffy.

194
00:12:03,629 --> 00:12:05,429
Don't be ridiculous.

195
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:08,470
The program is called
"Lee Jeong Hoon's News Live",

196
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:10,330
not "Kim Chul Woong's News Live".

197
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,799
And it's better for you to go...

198
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,539
since they'll recognize you.

199
00:12:14,539 --> 00:12:16,110
Who would like...

200
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,610
an unknown news team manager
to receive it?

201
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,210
Right.

202
00:12:20,409 --> 00:12:23,080
I'm just a nobody.

203
00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:26,580
Have fun at the awards ceremony
with the famous Anchor Lee.

204
00:12:27,889 --> 00:12:31,720
My gosh, he's sulking.
Let's leave in 10.

205
00:12:32,289 --> 00:12:33,460
Darn it.

206
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,429
She's awful and cheap.

207
00:12:38,429 --> 00:12:40,259
I've been on TV before too,
you know?

208
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,269
My profile is registered online
as well.

209
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:43,570
What's wrong?

210
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,399
You're sulking because
of the awards ceremony, right?

211
00:12:46,669 --> 00:12:48,169
I'm not sulking.

212
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,809
Why isn't this working?
Give me your lighter.

213
00:12:52,809 --> 00:12:54,080
Don't.

214
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:57,250
You said she'd kill you.
You never smoked near work.

215
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:00,889
She won't kill me.
I can do as I please.

216
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:01,919
Give it to me.

217
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,919
I have nothing to do with this.

218
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,330
Mr. Kim Chul Woong.

219
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:14,870
I have a call.

220
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:18,070
Hello? It's been ages.

221
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:21,169
Why have you been so busy? Yes.

222
00:13:21,169 --> 00:13:23,440
You weren't in your office.
I was wondering where you went.

223
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,649
You were out here
for some fresh air.

224
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,950
Why would you be curious about me?

225
00:13:31,149 --> 00:13:33,549
I thought you and Jeong Hoon
went to the awards ceremony.

226
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:37,049
What did you say
when you promised to quit smoking?

227
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:38,389
Didn't you say...

228
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:40,929
you'd hand over your bankbook
if you smoked again?

229
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:43,259
I wasn't smoking.

230
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:45,629
I sighed
because of my horrible wife.

231
00:13:45,629 --> 00:13:47,769
You were just seeing my breath.
It's cold today.

232
00:13:48,169 --> 00:13:49,370
I'm so cold.

233
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,639
All right. Is that so?

234
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:53,200
If you're cold,

235
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,240
you should drink that.

236
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,240
This?

237
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,210
It's a cold drink.

238
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,250
Drink it now. Drink it.

239
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,779
- Drink it.
- Come on.

240
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,950
I need to work on a story today.
I forgot about that.

241
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:09,220
I'll talk to you soon,
Director Choi.

242
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:15,960
(Korea Broadcasting
Production Award)

243
00:14:16,129 --> 00:14:17,600
(Program of the Year Award)

244
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,500
What's taking the general manager
so long?

245
00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:21,129
Thank you.

246
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:22,970
It's Ha Jin.

247
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:27,769
It's Ha Jin.

248
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,679
- My gosh, Ha Jin.
- Director Choi.

249
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,950
What a surprise
running into you here.

250
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,679
It's been a while.
Have you been well?

251
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:37,980
Of course.

252
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:40,850
I didn't know
I'd be seeing you here.

253
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,190
Same here.

254
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:44,659
Are you here as a recipient?

255
00:14:44,659 --> 00:14:46,690
I was invited here
as a presenter of an award.

256
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:48,559
You are the most
sought-after actress.

257
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:50,860
Everyone is trying to get you
for their shows.

258
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:52,500
Hold on.

259
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,830
All right. Hey,
the general manager is here.

260
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,200
Excuse me for a moment.

261
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,169
If I knew I'd meet you here,

262
00:15:01,169 --> 00:15:03,409
I wouldn't have taken up
your time earlier.

263
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,950
Did you win
the Program of the Year Award?

264
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,480
Well, I didn't win it, per se.

265
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,990
The director dragged me here
because the program won the award.

266
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,620
It's "Lee Jeong Hoon's News Live".

267
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,889
I think it's safe to say
that you won the award.

268
00:15:19,659 --> 00:15:21,990
It would've been nice
if I presented the award.

269
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,090
How sad.

270
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:26,600
Don't get the wrong idea.

271
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:29,700
I had no idea
that you would be here.

272
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,200
Okay.

273
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:38,240
All right. We will now begin
Korea Broadcasting Production Award.

274
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:41,480
- Please take your seats.
- Congratulations.

275
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,720
My seat is over there.

276
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,320
Okay.

277
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,299
I will now announce...

278
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:02,570
the Program of the Year Award
which was selected by the viewers.

279
00:16:03,169 --> 00:16:04,769
(Korea Broadcasting
Production Award)

280
00:16:04,769 --> 00:16:06,139
The Program of the Year Award.

281
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,309
It goes to
"Lee Jeong Hoon's News Live".

282
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,039
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,879
(Program of the Year Award)

284
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,720
(Program of the Year Award)

285
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,629
Congratulations.

286
00:16:28,929 --> 00:16:31,559
(Program of the Year Award)

287
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,000
It is called
"Lee Jeong Hoon's News Live",

288
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:40,169
but I didn't produce this show
on my own.

289
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,639
I will share this glory...

290
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,679
with Director Choi Hee Sang and
every staff member of the program.

291
00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:48,080
Thank you.

292
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:51,879
Anchor Lee, if there's
a message you want...

293
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:55,190
to deliver to anyone in this room,
you can.

294
00:17:02,629 --> 00:17:05,130
I'm dying to find out
what he will say...

295
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:07,000
as more time passes by.

296
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:20,109
I hope your days in the future...

297
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:24,819
will bring more happiness
than your past.

298
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,059
I will root for you.

299
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:37,089
Thank you.

300

(Program of the Year Award)

301
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:44,769
We will continue
the presentation of the next award.

302
00:17:45,369 --> 00:17:47,940
Next up is the Producer
of the Year Award.

303
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,109
You have to get back
to the station, right?

304
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:58,579
For the news, right?

305
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,450
Yes. I should get back.

306
00:18:00,819 --> 00:18:02,950
But where's your manager?

307
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:05,490
I told her to get some sleep
in the car.

308
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,720
I called her just now.
She'll be here soon.

309
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,289
Get home safe.

310
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,500
I will.

311
00:18:15,869 --> 00:18:16,869
Well,

312
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,940
thank you for that earlier.

313
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:26,509
I know that you don't like
to be in the limelight.

314
00:18:26,509 --> 00:18:28,410
I just thought
you wouldn't say anything.

315
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:30,910
It was a bit touching.

316
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:42,359
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

317
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:44,259
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations.

318
00:18:44,259 --> 00:18:46,160
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

319
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,259
Great job!

320
00:18:48,069 --> 00:18:49,799
I hope your days in the future...

321
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:54,609
will bring more happiness
than your past.

322
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,279
I will root for you.

323
00:19:00,109 --> 00:19:02,680
I really can't figure him out.

324
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:04,750
He can be the sweetest guy.

325
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,420
But he's also the coldest guy.

326
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,849
You might memorize the lines
at this rate.

327
00:19:07,849 --> 00:19:09,250
Stop watching that.

328
00:19:09,819 --> 00:19:12,359
What if he turns out
to be a total player?

329
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,859
He's playing hard-to-get.

330
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,190
He said he'd root for me.

331
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:18,400
It's because the whole country
thinks you guys are dating.

332
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,200
He said it
because he had no other choice.

333
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,329
In my opinion,
he's the most patient guy.

334
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,500
No.

335
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:31,440
I will root for you.

336
00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:35,109
Jeong Hoon, congratulations.

337
00:19:37,849 --> 00:19:39,980
You seemed really annoyed
that you had to go earlier.

338
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,789
Stop getting cheeky.

339
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,019
I saw many new sides of you today.

340
00:19:45,819 --> 00:19:47,589
You're such a romantic!

341
00:19:47,589 --> 00:19:49,559
Do you read
my articles all day long?

342
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:51,799
I'm just showing interest
as your junior.

343
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,099
(New message, Yeo Ha Jin)

344
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:01,269
I really like this photo,

345
00:20:01,269 --> 00:20:04,039
so I thought about posting it online
and bragging about it,

346
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,940
but I remembered your angry eyes,
so I stopped myself.

347
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,910
But I'm sending it,
so at least you can save it.

348
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,319
Good luck with today's news!

349
00:20:13,549 --> 00:20:14,789
Go work.

350
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,250
Okay.

351
00:20:29,569 --> 00:20:30,769
I'll be back.

352
00:20:31,099 --> 00:20:32,640
Send me a text message.

353
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,200
It's the era of 5G. Do you think...

354
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,910
you're not getting a text
because of the network connection?

355
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:38,809
Because he pulled me earlier,
is he pushing me away now?

356
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,509
Or does he not like the photo?

357
00:20:40,509 --> 00:20:43,150
I told you countless times.
This is why men get sick of you.

358
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,349
I told you that can't be true!

359
00:20:44,349 --> 00:20:45,349
Gosh, I'm so sick of her.

360
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,349
Are you sure you can be alone?

361
00:20:48,349 --> 00:20:49,819
I'll just stay home.

362
00:20:50,089 --> 00:20:52,420
You said you were getting an itch
to work out. It's been a while.

363
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,490
Go have fun.
I'll go to sleep after I wash up.

364
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:56,529
Okay. Call me if there's a problem.

365
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,170
Is he busy preparing for the news?

366
00:21:11,809 --> 00:21:13,380
Should I go and watch a movie too?

367
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,349
(Ha Jin, Jeong Hoon)

368
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:59,619
He's in the sweetest phase
in his relationship.

369
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:04,259
All right. What's next?

370
00:22:04,259 --> 00:22:06,660
What do we have here?

371
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,200
What's this?

372
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:22,049
Darn it. He already started.

373
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:32,019
Jeong Hoon.

374
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:34,559
I think you need to see this.

375
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,059
- What is it?
- It was delivered to you.

376
00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:39,029
I found photos instead of a letter.

377
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:40,700
But those photos look a bit...

378
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,319
Darn it. You're such a sloth.

379
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:42,529
Make it quick. Come on!

380
00:23:42,529 --> 00:23:44,059
It's 1 dollar and 80 cents.

381
00:23:44,059 --> 00:23:46,900
- Let me put it in a bag.
- Forget it.

382
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:16,990
Here.

383
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,029
Right.

384
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,339
He must be awfully busy.

385
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:32,579
But still.
He shouldn't throw money like that.

386
00:24:33,809 --> 00:24:35,210
That was awful.

387
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,250
Yes.

388
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,490
Isn't that frightening?

389
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,789
I'd rather have
a threatening letter.

390
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:26,630
These pictures are way too ominous.

391
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:29,430
It was sent to our mail,
and the sender's address was empty.

392

Jeong Hoon!

393
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,880
I don't think I'll be able
to watch your news tonight.

394
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,980
I'm on my way
to watch a movie by myself.

395
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:50,819
I wanted to watch my movie
at a movie theater.

396
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,559
It's starting in five minutes.

397
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,519
I'll leave you a message
after the movie ends.

398
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:05,240
Hello?

399
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:07,869
Ha Jin?

400
00:26:08,069 --> 00:26:09,940
She's probably asleep at home.

401
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,910
Didn't she tell you that
she's going out to watch a movie?

402
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,339
A movie?

403
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,809
No, she said
she's going to sleep early.

404
00:26:15,849 --> 00:26:16,880
With whom?

405
00:26:17,049 --> 00:26:18,450
She said she's going alone.

406
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,180
Do you know
which theater she went to?

407
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,720
There must be one
that she often goes to.

408
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:24,549
There's no particular place
she often goes to,

409
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:25,589
but there are a few theaters...

410
00:26:25,589 --> 00:26:27,660
10 minutes away from
our house by car.

411

Yes.

414
00:26:32,529 --> 00:26:35,130
Someone who's often seen
wherever she goes to,

415
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:37,029
or someone who often waits
in front of your house.

416
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:39,500
Has she recently received...

417
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,970
any weird photos
or threatening letters?

418
