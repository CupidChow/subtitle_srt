1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:02,839
(Episode 27)

2
00:00:13,419 --> 00:00:14,419
Ha Jin.

3
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,429
Where have you been?

4
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,000
I've been worried sick.

5
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:30,000
At the least,
you should have told Ha Kyung.

6
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:34,840
Anchor Lee,

7
00:00:36,109 --> 00:00:37,509
don't you hate me?

8
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:46,920
Ha Jin.

9
00:00:48,789 --> 00:00:51,460
I'm the one who broke up with you,

10
00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:02,469
but I missed you to death.

11
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,370
I couldn't even breathe...

12
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:10,480
to think I'll never see you again.

13
00:01:16,349 --> 00:01:19,379
May I just stay by your side?

14
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,260
(Find Me in Your Memory)

15
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,050
You should get changed into these.

16
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:30,620
How long were you
sitting out in the rain?

17
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,560
What if you really catch a cold?

18
00:02:33,259 --> 00:02:34,259
Here.

19
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,129
I'm sorry.

20
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,870
I must've been out of my mind.

21
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:45,939
I didn't mean what I just said.

22
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:47,770
Please pretend like
you didn't hear it.

23
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:49,009
Please excuse me.

24
00:02:50,409 --> 00:02:52,280
You said you wanted to
stay by my side.

25
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,020
Are you sure you didn't mean that?

26
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,599
No. I didn't mean it.

27
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:15,770
All right.

28
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:18,169
I understand.

29
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,840
But do get changed...

30
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,409
and grab a cup of hot tea
before you go.

31
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:28,610
Then I'll pretend like
I didn't hear you.

32
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:34,849
You broke all of our promises...

33
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,719
and had me worried all day long.

34
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,930
So you can do this much for me.

35
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,340
Ha Jin.

36
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,270
Come out
if you're done getting changed.

37
00:04:12,189 --> 00:04:13,930
I changed my mind too.

38
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,699
I can't let you go
after a cup of tea,

39
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,930
so eat this before you go.

40
00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:27,310
Take a seat. Come on.

41
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:46,720
I'm not sure if it's any good
because I had to make it in a hurry.

42
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:53,629
Here.

43
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,970
Drink that
and take your time to eat.

44
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:58,699
You should get changed.

45
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:01,610
You might end up
catching a cold too.

46
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:03,509
I'm fine.

47
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:06,439
You're making me feel uncomfortable.
You should go get changed.

48
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,779
No, I don't want to get changed.

49
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,420
Why not?

50
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:14,550
I'm afraid you might leave
while I get changed.

51
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,290
You told me to finish this
before I go.

52
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:18,759
Go get changed.

53
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,329
You must be upset about your drama.

54
00:05:27,329 --> 00:05:28,800
You prepared so much for it.

55
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:31,370
Yes.

56
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,910
I'm sure you'll find
another great work soon. Cheer up.

57
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,139
Thank you.

58
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:44,079
Take your time and eat.
I'll take you home when you're done.

59
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:48,019
I'm fine. I can call Ha Kyung...

60
00:05:48,019 --> 00:05:49,490
or take a taxi.

61
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:52,490
I already called her
and told her I'm with you.

62
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,490
I thought she'd be worried.

63
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,930
It's late and raining.

64
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,730
If I let you go alone
after telling her that I'm with you,

65
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,569
Ha Kyung will think
I'm completely irresponsible.

66
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,939
That's why I have to take you home.

67
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,220
Go home safely.

68
00:06:24,019 --> 00:06:26,319
I'll return your clothes
through Ha Kyung.

69
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,389
I'm the one who's bad, not you.

70
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,370
I knew everything,

71
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:38,899
but I didn't want to lose you
and got selfish.

72
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:43,879
I couldn't go on without you.

73
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:50,680
So you don't have to try hard.

74
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,519
I'll be the bad person.

75
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,360
Ha Jin!
Do you know how much I was worried?

76
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,160
I'm sorry.

77
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:07,000
Goodbye, Anchor Lee.

78
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,600
Let's go inside.

79
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,730
I found this out front,
so I brought it in.

80
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,500
I think you threw these out
by mistake.

81
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:42,800
I threw away the scripts.

82
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:46,199
But you can throw these away again
if you want to.

83
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,069
(Anchor Lee)

84
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:34,019
What is it?

85
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,350
I came for my long sleeves.

86
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:38,559
Your long sleeves?

87
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,690
Yes. The one you wore last night.

88
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:44,029
I have to wear it today.

89
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:49,730
If today's not the best time,
I can come by tomorrow.

90
00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:55,039
No, that's okay. Hold on.

91
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:05,779
Is it delivery?

92
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:07,350
No, it's Anchor Lee.

93
00:09:08,419 --> 00:09:11,090
He's here? Why?

94
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:13,059
He wants the clothes
I wore yesterday.

95
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:16,529
What?

96
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:20,259
Here you go.

97
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:25,600
Thanks. I forgot
I had to wear it today.

98
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,210
Did you sleep well?

99
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:32,509
Yes.

100
00:09:32,909 --> 00:09:33,909
Did you have breakfast?

101
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:35,809
Not yet.

102
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:38,850
Don't skip your meals.

103
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,480
Goodbye.

104
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:55,370
Have some macarons.

105
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:59,100
What's gotten into you?
You've never offered me sweets.

106
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,870
It's still early in the morning.
You can have two.

107
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:05,179
You feel sorry for me
since the drama fell through, right?

108
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:07,309
Don't be ridiculous.

109
00:10:07,309 --> 00:10:08,850
You're going to work
on something even better.

110
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,549
I heard there's a pile of scripts
this high at the office.

111
00:10:18,259 --> 00:10:19,460
Are you going...

112
00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:22,059
to break up with him?

113
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,299
I already did.

114
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,700
I know that's not what you want.
I know you like him a lot.

115
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,840
Didn't you dive into work
because you were in pain?

116
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:34,509
I'm going to endure it.

117
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:37,210
I have to.

118
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,850
I can't be with him.

119
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:42,850
I don't deserve him.

120
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:50,789
Did you receive any tip-offs
on Moon Seong Ho?

121
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:54,360
Yes, a few.

122
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,389
But they turned out to be false.

123
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:57,830
They mistook others for him.

124
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,460
I thought this would be easy,

125
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,700
but he's more tenacious
than I thought.

126
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,669
Let me know every time
you receive new calls.

127
00:11:04,169 --> 00:11:05,440
Okay. I'll do that.

128
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,269
What is this shopping bag?

129
00:11:09,309 --> 00:11:11,080
It's just an excuse to see her face.

130
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,340
What?

131
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:24,559
Ha Kyung.

132
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,019
Hello.

133
00:11:26,659 --> 00:11:28,860
I'm sorry for calling
out of the blue.

134
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,460
It's fine. What is it?

135
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,299
There's no one
more important to me...

136
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,730
than my sister.

137
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,139
But she's in a lot of pain
right now.

138
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,480
She didn't break up with you
because she wanted to.

139
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,279
It's all because of Seo Yeon.

140
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,379
She feels guilty.

141
00:11:49,649 --> 00:11:50,679
I know.

142
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,590
You're not going
to let her go, right?

143
00:11:55,789 --> 00:11:57,419
I can't.

144
00:11:58,889 --> 00:12:00,860
She's the most important person
to me as well.

145
00:12:03,629 --> 00:12:06,200
Seeing how you came
all the way here to tell me this,

146
00:12:06,429 --> 00:12:08,700
I guess it's safe to say
that you're on my side.

147
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,470
I'm glad to have an ally.

148
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,350
Chul.

149
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,919
Hello.

150
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,649
Did you have lunch?

151
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:30,649
Yes, I did.

152
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:32,659
Let's go.

153
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,029
Here you go.

154
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:40,659
Why are there so many?

155
00:12:40,929 --> 00:12:43,370
These are only a few
that I picked out last night.

156
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:45,370
Everyone has been sending in
their scripts...

157
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:47,340
ever since they found out
that our drama flopped.

158
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:49,840
All these people want you.

159
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:53,940
So don't you worry about a thing,
and let's pick a new one.

160
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:57,149
- Okay.
- First, read these.

161
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,919
This is from Director Song Min Seok.
It's a movie script.

162
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:02,590
The female lead is a reporter.

163
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,360
And this one is
from Writer Kim Soo Ji.

164
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,960
This will be aired
during the first half of next year.

165
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,830
It was quite amusing.

166
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:12,129
The rest of them are
also quite nice.

167
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,700
Thank you.

168
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,029
We're in no rush.
Take your time to read them all.

169
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:17,169
Okay.

170
00:13:17,169 --> 00:13:20,470
She's right.
Your opinion matters the most.

171
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,740
We should hit the jackpot once more.

172
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,870
I'd love that.

175
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:35,850
Ha Jin, I don't think
the shooting will take too long.

176
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:37,919
You just need to say something.

177
00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:40,960
I didn't know there would be others.

178
00:13:41,259 --> 00:13:43,059
Who else has done this?

179
00:13:44,029 --> 00:13:46,960
I'm not sure. But since it's a PSA,

180
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,169
I'm sure many have.

181
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,600
Excuse me.

182
00:13:51,169 --> 00:13:53,000
We have a bit of free time.

183
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,710
If you'd like, you can meet
the puppies right now.

184
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:58,440
It'd make the shooting easier
if you guys become close.

185
00:13:59,009 --> 00:14:00,980
Sure. Let's go.

186
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:01,980
Okay.

187
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,049
What? Is Jeong Hoon not here yet?

188
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,620
How dare he slack off?

189
00:14:13,059 --> 00:14:15,759
Let him be.
He'll be running late today.

190
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:17,899
Why? Did something happen again?

191
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:20,100
Not really.

192
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,500
I'm serious. He has something else
to take care of.

193
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,039
What else does he have to do
other than the news?

194
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,970
He couldn't be receiving
another award without my knowing.

195
00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:30,240
Why are you keeping me in the dark?

196
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,080
Don't shout at me. We're not home.

197
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,809
Hey. Don't call him.

198
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:39,149
Gosh, I'm so irritated.

199
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:42,120
I'm going to call him. Darn it.

200
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,700
Hey.

201
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,600
Why are you here?

202
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:00,899
To film. I'm filming
the same advertisement as you are.

203
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,740
You're shooting an advertisement?

204
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,409
Yes. I liked what
they're trying to achieve.

205
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,250
And I really love puppies.

206
00:15:11,049 --> 00:15:12,049
Aren't they so pretty?

207
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:17,120
I'll be filming with them,
so we should become close.

208
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:22,129
This one's Bori. This one's Choco.

209
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,399
And this white one is Coco.

210
00:15:27,929 --> 00:15:30,299
I don't know why people abandon
such beautiful animals.

211
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,840
Did you have lunch?

212
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:44,279
If not, do you want to join me?
I bought some sandwiches.

213
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:48,649
No, that's fine.

214
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:51,690
I don't want to eat alone.

215
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,529
I feel awkward here,
and there's no one I know.

216
00:15:56,259 --> 00:15:57,460
Please?

217
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:05,240
Have some.

218
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:08,539
It's bacon and egg sandwich
and honey black tea.

219
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,980
What is it? Do you not like them?

220
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:20,779
Ha Kyung told me
that you like this sandwich.

221
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,090
Why are you doing this?

222
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,759
Why do you keep doing things
that are unlike you?

223
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:34,059
Because I like you, miss you,
and want to spend time with you.

224
00:16:37,169 --> 00:16:39,840
I told you that I was going to be
the bad one.

225
00:16:42,809 --> 00:16:45,440
So just stay where you are.

226
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,950
I'll come to you.

227
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,889
Ha Jin, they'll begin now.

228
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,220
Okay.

229
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:01,490
I should go.

230
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:02,730
Okay.

231
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,109
Every year, 100,000 dogs...

232
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:18,710
roam the streets on empty stomachs
while trembling in fear...

233
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,140
or become euthanized.

234
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:23,279
Please give these precious animals
your love.

235
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,579
The most heartwarming way
of creating a family is...

236
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:28,089
by adopting an abandoned dog.

237
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:32,859
Cut. Okay. That was great.
Thank you.

238
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:35,890
- Let's move onto the next scene.
- Yes, sir.

239
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:36,930
Okay.

240
00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:39,930
You looked so pretty.

241
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:47,269
I'm sorry for this sudden request.
But how about we film...

242
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:50,670
you two together?

243
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:53,380
Sure, that's fine with me.

244
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:57,410
That's fine.

245
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:01,490
That's great. I was feeling awkward
about doing it alone.

246
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:03,089
Okay, let's do that.

247
00:18:03,089 --> 00:18:05,819
It's quite simple,
so let me explain.

248
00:18:05,859 --> 00:18:07,190
Then,
we'll start filming right away.

249
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,759
Okay? Good.

250
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,460
All right. Next.

251
00:18:23,009 --> 00:18:25,309
I'm so nervous. What were the lines?

252
00:18:29,849 --> 00:18:32,119
"Give them a hug. Love them."

253
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,250
"Welcome these precious dogs
into your family."

254
00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:37,289
Right.

255
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,559
"Give them a hug. Love them."

256
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:45,829
If I knew that I would have lines,

257
00:18:45,829 --> 00:18:48,029
I should have thought a bit more
before accepting it.

258
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,869
Someone once scolded me...

259
00:18:50,569 --> 00:18:52,740
for doing an awful job
with reading lines.

260
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,539
I'm scared to deliver my lines.

261
00:19:01,509 --> 00:19:02,509
Okay.

262
00:19:02,849 --> 00:19:04,380
- Hello.
- Hey.

263
00:19:07,549 --> 00:19:10,150
Goodness, you two
make such a nice couple.

264
00:19:10,289 --> 00:19:11,960
You guys look like a real family.

265
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:14,930
Looking good!

266
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,559
We'll start now.

267
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:17,859
Ready.

268
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,660
Action.

269
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:21,630
Give them a hug.

270
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,069
Love them.

271
00:19:23,069 --> 00:19:26,269
Welcome these precious dogs
into your family.

272
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,140
Okay. Cut!

273
00:19:56,269 --> 00:19:58,670
Ha Kyung. I'm sick.

274
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,710
I'm coming down with a cold.
And I have a fever.

275
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,880
I'm here.

276
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,190
Is it serious?

277
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,259
Yes.

278
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:23,490
Let me see.

279
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:26,059
You don't have a fever.

280
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:28,769
No. I have a fever.

281
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:31,200
You won't know if you just
put your hand on my forehead.

282
00:20:31,869 --> 00:20:33,140
You have to put
your forehead on mine.

283
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,140
My forehead?

284
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,880
See? I'm burning up.

285
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,150
You're not sick, right?

286
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,950
No.

287
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:49,289
I've been sick today.

288
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:51,759
But when you said you were coming,

289
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:53,490
strangely, I started to recover.

290
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,589
I knew it. You're not sick.

291
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:57,630
No, I'm sick.

292
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,599
I'm serious. I've been sick.

293
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:01,130
Are you sure you're okay now?

294
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:02,670
Any other symptoms?

295
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:04,900
- Right here.
- Gosh.

296
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:06,869
I bought some medicine and porridge.

297
00:21:06,869 --> 00:21:08,240
Take them if you still feel sick.

298
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,039
Are you leaving already?

299
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,410
Can you stay for two more hours?

300
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:14,539
No, just an hour.

301
00:21:14,779 --> 00:21:16,950
Please? Just an hour. Please.

302
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,990
My goodness. It's so scary.

303
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,319
You have to go forward.

304
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,589
- Go, go.
- No!

305
00:21:28,589 --> 00:21:29,660
Don't touch me.

306
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:32,299
Don't touch me. I'm serious.
Don't do that.

307
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,400
Darn it.

308
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,240
Do you think it's funny?

309
00:21:43,539 --> 00:21:45,710
- I'm hungry.
- All of a sudden?

310
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:47,680
I bought some new stuff
from the convenience store.

311
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,680
Do you want to try it?

312
00:21:49,579 --> 00:21:51,779
All right. Let's eat.

313
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,990
- Let's play a game.
- What game?

314
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:56,190
We'll ask each other a question.

315
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,319
The one who can't answer them
in five seconds...

316
00:21:57,319 --> 00:21:58,990
will have to eat as much as
the other person gives.

317
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:00,460
Are you sure you can handle it?

318
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:01,890
I heard it's really spicy.

319
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:03,559
I can just answer
your questions then.

320
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:06,430
Sounds good. I can answer
anything you ask me.

321
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:07,900
I'll go first.

322
00:22:10,369 --> 00:22:11,700
Since when...

323
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,769
did you start
having feelings for me?

324
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:16,269
When I learned jujitsu from you
for the first time.

325
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,309
You were so cool.

326
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:26,319
Is that so?

327
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,880
What about you?

328
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,599
When you tied my hair
at the hospital...

329
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:43,670
Wait. Then, you liked me first.

330
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:45,599
That's not it. It was after that.

331
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:46,740
I don't think so.

332
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,309
It was after that.
After we worked out together.

333
00:22:48,309 --> 00:22:49,339
You liked me before that,
didn't you?

334
00:22:49,339 --> 00:22:51,170
I said no.

335
00:22:51,339 --> 00:22:52,440
It was after that.

336
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,079
Okay, fine.

337
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:55,779
I'll play along.

338
00:22:56,109 --> 00:22:57,450
It's your turn to ask a question.

339
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,420
How many guys did you date so far?

340
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,450
So far?

341
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:01,549
I'm counting now.

342
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:04,720
5, 4, 3,

343
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,259
2, 1. Time's up.

344
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:08,430
What about you?

345
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,630
Me? I had...

346
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,059
5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Time's up.

347
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:15,099
Come on. What was that?
You counted too fast.

348
00:23:15,099 --> 00:23:16,170
Then, answer me.

349
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:19,769
No. I'll just eat it.

350
00:23:19,769 --> 00:23:22,140
Fine. Let's just eat it.
We should eat this together.

351
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,609
We'll help ourselves.

352
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:27,009
Hey, this got soggy.

353
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,319
It's better than I thought.

354
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:36,049
It's not spicy.

355
00:23:41,859 --> 00:23:42,859
Water!

356
00:24:04,779 --> 00:24:06,079
(New message, Anchor Lee)

357
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,119
I was taking photos of Coco,

358
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:10,819
but you look good in the photos too.
So I'm sending some to you.

359
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:23,670
Because I like you, miss you,

360
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,500
and want to spend time with you.

361
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:36,279
(Inbox)

362
00:24:37,049 --> 00:24:40,150
He just checked in.
He sort of matches the descriptions.

363
00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:42,750
Please don't disclose
my personal information.

364
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,190
(A tip on Moon Seong Ho, Forward)

365
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:51,430
Yes, Detective. Please check
the email I just sent you.

366
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,130
Okay.

367
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,200
- Jo Il Kwon.
- Yes?

368
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,900
Get ready for coverage
and come with me.

369
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:00,470
Now?

370
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:08,250
Hello. What about Moon Seong Ho?

371
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,779
When another guest tried to call it
in after recognizing him,

372
00:25:09,779 --> 00:25:11,349
he attacked the guest and ran away.

373
00:25:11,349 --> 00:25:12,849
We're searching the area now.

374
00:25:12,849 --> 00:25:14,720
What about the victim?
Is the victim okay?

375
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,690
Yes. It's not a severe injury.

376
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:17,750
That's a relief.

377
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,660
We were a step late.

378
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:23,059
Can we report from the scene?

379
00:25:23,059 --> 00:25:24,789
Yes. I'll set it up for you.

380
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:25,859
Thank you.

381
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,869
A while ago, an inmate named
Moon Seong Ho...

382
00:25:29,869 --> 00:25:31,400
who was incarcerated
at the National Forensic Hospital...

383
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,069
ran away from the hospital
when he was being treated.

384
00:25:33,069 --> 00:25:35,869
And we have received a report
that he was sighted at a motel.

385
00:25:36,309 --> 00:25:38,440
Did you find any leads?

386
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:40,079
When he was running away,

387
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:41,650
he dropped this journal.
This is what it said on it.

388
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,450
He just wrote down
some nonsense on it.

389
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:47,180
I don't think this will
give us any leads.

390
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:49,549
I see.

391
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,920
How will the investigation
move forward now?

392
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,460
He attacked a civilian on the run.

393
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,059
We must dial it up a notch.

394
00:25:55,059 --> 00:25:57,460
We'll inspect at the checkpoints
more aggressively.

395
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,660
And we'll launch
an extensive search.

396
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:02,400
We should keep asking
for any tip-offs.

397
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,869
These tip-offs are
definitely getting to him.

398
00:26:04,869 --> 00:26:06,940
Yes. I ask for your cooperation.

399
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,940
Sure.

400
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,779
My father will be back soon.

401
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,079
I'll wait inside.

402
00:26:14,309 --> 00:26:16,079
Do you want any beverages?

403
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:17,079
It's okay.

404
00:26:17,849 --> 00:26:18,849
Right.

405
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:22,720
You must be busy
with my father's work these days.

406
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,619
When he focuses on something,
he goes all the way.

407
00:26:25,619 --> 00:26:28,390
I see. Are you talking about
the book he's about to publish?

408
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:29,829
It's fine.

409
00:26:29,829 --> 00:26:32,430
I only research
to gather information.

410
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,759
I see. Is that so?

411
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,670
Right. Don't mind me.
You can go back to your work.

412
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,029
All right, then.

413
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:02,130
("The Man Who Cannot Forget")

414
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:07,299
("The Man Who Cannot Forget")

415
00:27:20,509 --> 00:27:22,680
When did I give you permission...

416
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:26,049
to go through my stuff in my office?

417
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:28,450
I don't need to talk to you. Leave.

418
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:29,450
No.

419
00:27:30,089 --> 00:27:32,920
You must explain to me what that is.

420
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,890
I said I don't need to talk to you.

421
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:36,329
Is this it?

422
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:39,700
Is this why you've been spying
on Jeong Hoon?

423
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,029
And you even went to a murderer
to ask about him.

424
00:27:42,029 --> 00:27:44,000
Did you do all that
because of a book?

425
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,299
Have I been too lenient with you?

426
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:49,670
How dare you scold me about my book?

427
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:52,079
This is my life, my achievement,

428
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:54,039
and my entire research.

429
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,009
This is Jeong Hoon's life.

430
00:27:57,309 --> 00:27:59,519
Even if you were his doctor,

431
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:00,880
you don't have any right...

432
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,589
to disclose everything about him
to the world!

433
00:28:02,589 --> 00:28:04,119
If it weren't for my help,

434
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:05,920
he wouldn't have been able
to live a normal life.

435
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,619
No, he probably couldn't bear
the weight of his memories...

436
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:09,160
and could have died already.

437
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,559
You already know
he can enjoy his life now...

438
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:14,200
thanks to the result of my research!

439
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,970
I know him the best.

440
00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:22,910
If he continues to do this,
he'll make everyone's life painful.

441
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:26,609
Yeo Ha Jin knows everything now,
so she'll stay away from him too.

442
00:28:27,579 --> 00:28:29,710
What do you mean?

443
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,779
What do you mean, she knows?

444
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:34,150
I told her more
about Jeong Hoon's condition.

445
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:37,950
I asked if it's okay for him
to never forget about Seo Yeon.

446
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,720
There's no use in holding out
for the sake of love or whatever.

447
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:43,859
Nothing will change.

448
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:47,099
That's what
Jeong Hoon's disease does.

449
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,069
He'll never get over Seo Yeon,
who's dead now.

450
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:52,369
He'll live forever...

451
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:55,940
in that pain. That's his fate.

452
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,710
What are you doing? How dare you?

453
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:06,849
What's with those eyes?

454
00:29:07,549 --> 00:29:11,420
I'm devastated that my father is
someone who's this low.

455
00:29:11,859 --> 00:29:12,859
What?

456
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,690
Once this book gets published,

457
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:17,529
everyone will look at you
like how I'm looking at you now,

458
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:19,200
as an immoral scholar...

459
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,869
who treated his patients like
a lab animal for your research.

460
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,500
So you need to stop here!

461
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:27,900
How dare you do this?
Have you really gone insane?

462
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:32,210
If you won't stop,
I'll make you stop.

463
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,880
Wait and see.

464
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:35,410
That little...
