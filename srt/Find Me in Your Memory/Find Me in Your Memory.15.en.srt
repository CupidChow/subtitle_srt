00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:04,480
(Episode 15)

2
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,990
Man, Jeong Hoon.

3
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,789
I thought you
already left by yourself.

4
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:25,429
You'll probably figure it out soon,

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,530
so I'll spill the truth first.

6
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:29,329
What is it?

7
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:31,570
I installed...

8
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:34,770
a location tracking app
on your phone.

9
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,039
It was just in case
anything happens to you.

10
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:42,850
Thankfully, the passcode
for your phone was the same.

11
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:45,079
I'll delete it now.

12
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:48,350
But please don't disappear
all of a sudden.

13
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,789
Are you
still that concerned about me?

14
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,960
Once I die, you'll only have...

15
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,130
memories of how you were
worried and concerned about me.

16
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,899
Did you just figure that out?

17
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,500
I guess your conscience says
that you're actually sorry for me.

18
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,939
Ever since Seo Yeon passed away,

19
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,609
I only had this thought on my mind.

20
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,150
"I will never make
another painful memory..."

21
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,750
"with another person."

22
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:25,989
That was the only goal I had.

23
00:01:27,489 --> 00:01:28,989
Don't I sound like a fool?

24
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:32,900
Why didn't I want to make
more good memories?

25
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:36,430
My mother lived her life...

26
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,840
trying to give me
only good memories.

27
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:46,540
I don't want to live my life
making everyone worried like a kid.

28
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,980
I never thought of it
as you making me worried.

29
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,549
Don't say that.

30
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:54,219
Then will you just sit around
if I break down like you did?

31
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,260
That's what friends do.

32
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,420
Exactly.

33
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:02,260
I take back asking you
to fix my disease.

34
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,159
You can just be a friend
from now on.

35
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,770
You don't have to be
my doctor or guardian.

36
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,319
Goodness, what is this?

37
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:28,990
Ha Jin, Ha Kyung.

38
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,259
Girls!

39
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:33,120
Hey, are you two okay?
Was everything all right?

40
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,629
What about Ha Jin? Where is she?

41
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:36,229
What's wrong? Is something going on?

42
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:39,129
Someone spray-painted
the security cameras black.

43
00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:40,900
Are you sure everything is okay?

44
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,379
Why is the door locked?

45
00:02:53,949 --> 00:02:55,580
Ha Jin! Ha Jin!

46
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,780
Ha Jin!

47
00:02:57,849 --> 00:02:59,319
Open the door!

48
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,419
Are you in there?

49
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:02,349
Ha Jin! Answer me!

50
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,090
- Ha Jin!
- Are you in there?

51
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,159
- Answer us!
- Ha Jin!

52
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,159
- Ha Jin!
- Darn it, why won't this open?

53
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:10,530
- Ha Jin!
- Are you in there?

54
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,360
- Ha Jin! Are you there?
- Ha Jin!

55
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,900
- Ha Jin!
- My gosh.

56
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,270
- Why are they making a fuss?
- Ha Jin!

57
00:03:17,169 --> 00:03:19,069
Ha Jin! Ha Jin!

58
00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:20,270
Ha Jin!

59
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:22,539
Ha Jin, open the door!

60
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,879
Ha Jin! Ha Jin!

61
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,080
Ha Jin!

62
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,580
Open the door!

63
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,680
Are you in there? Ha Jin!

64
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:33,250
(Ha Jin, you're mine.)

65
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,430
What is all this?

66
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,030
Ha Jin, open up!

67
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,729
- You're in there, right?
- Darn it!

68
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:51,039
Break it open!

69
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:53,500
Ha Jin, are you okay?

70
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:01,080
My goodness, what is that?

71
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,650
Darn it.

72
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:36,579
It's not just tough for you.
It's tough for everyone.

73
00:04:37,579 --> 00:04:41,689
Everyone gets sad
when they lose someone they love...

74
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:42,750
because of their memories...

75
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:46,189
Not you.

76
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:49,490
You forgot everything.

77
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:52,930
You forgot everything, and you live
as if nothing had happened.

78
00:04:54,029 --> 00:04:56,000
So stop talking
as if you know everything.

79
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,800
(Director Choi)

80
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,870
(This is your last chance. Call me
as soon as you see this message.)

81
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:44,850
Hello, ma'am.

82
00:05:45,819 --> 00:05:47,089
What's wrong with you?

83
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,149
What were you thinking?

84
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:52,660
I'm sorry for not calling.

85
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,089
Are you okay?

86
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,860
You seem better.

87
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,899
Sit down.

88
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,339
You know your leave
is until tomorrow, right?

89
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:17,120
Will you be able to work
starting in two days?

90
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,449
I want...

91
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,920
to work again.

92
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:31,060
But I can't promise you
that I'm fully recovered.

93
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:34,069
Come back to work.
The news is all that you have.

94
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:36,199
What else can you do?

95
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:39,199
Remember how I said...

96
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:41,569
I can't gamble with this?

97
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:45,509
But I realized that I already was.

98
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:48,149
Appointing you as the anchor
of "Lee Jeong Hoon's News Live"...

99
00:06:48,149 --> 00:06:49,610
was a gamble for me.

100
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:52,480
The others said no, but I insisted.

101
00:06:53,019 --> 00:06:55,449
So if I were to let you go
in order to save face,

102
00:06:56,089 --> 00:06:57,519
what would that make me?

103
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,959
Let me be cool for once.

104
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,029
You can do it.

105
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,529
So come back.

106
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:11,540
The envelope and the photos?

107
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,069
Yes, I want to check
everything that was sent.

108
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,639
I believe Jeong Hoon has it.

109
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:18,379
I'll look for it.

110
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:21,149
But why all of a sudden?
Is something wrong?

111
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,550
Yes, something's wrong.

112
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,699
What? Jeong Hoon!

113
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,170
What's your deal?
You're alive and well,

114
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:50,139
yet you refused to pick up my calls
or text back.

115
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,439
Are you that upset
that I'm doing fine?

116
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:56,079
You know that's not what I meant.
I was worried sick.

117
00:07:56,379 --> 00:07:57,579
Have you been well?

118
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,920
Of course.

119
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:03,389
By the way, did you hear
about Ha Jin?

120
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:05,620
Hear what?

121
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,189
(I'm always watching you.)

122
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:24,139
Hello, Anchor Lee.

123
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:26,279
Where are you? Are you home?

124
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,810
Yes, I am.

125
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:32,149
Where are you?

126
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:35,450
I'm on my way to your house.
I'll be there soon.

127
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,960
You're coming here?

128
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:55,370
Hey.

129
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:59,039
Hey.

130
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,009
Are you okay?

131
00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:03,179
Yes.

132
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,720
I'm sorry
for leaving first yesterday.

133
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,049
I know I promised to stay with you.

134
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:11,490
Don't be sorry.

135
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,889
You should be worried
about yourself instead.

136
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:21,470
(Don't get the wrong idea.
Ha Jin loves me.)

137
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:24,570
(Get ready. We'll meet soon.)

138
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:32,940
Did you report to the police?

139
00:09:33,809 --> 00:09:35,350
No, not yet.

140
00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:38,879
We don't want the media
to be talking about this right now.

141
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:41,190
Ms. Park is speaking with a lawyer.

142
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:48,429
May I look around your room?

143
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:53,399
The stalker could've installed
cameras or listening devices.

144
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:57,169
Sure. It's upstairs.

145
00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:23,090
I didn't know it was this serious.

146
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:25,659
Why would someone do this?

147
00:10:27,129 --> 00:10:28,529
Don't worry too much.

148
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,370
You'll be fine.
I'll make sure of that.

149
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:36,509
Okay. Thanks.

150
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:57,230
(Medication)

151
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:06,570
I don't see anything in particular.

152
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:10,840
But I think it's best
to hire someone to take a look.

153
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:12,679
Okay.

154
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:15,009
By the way, are you sick?

155
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,480
I saw your medication.

156
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:23,350
I had come down with a flu.
I'm all better now.

157
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:25,990
I'm sorry...

158
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,429
about that day
and yesterday as well.

159
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:33,299
Please don't take to heart
what I said to you at my house.

160
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:37,269
I just vented my anger on you.

161
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:38,539
I didn't mean any of it.

162
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:43,740
Okay. I'll just think that
you were drunk and rambling.

163
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:47,409
If you're truly sorry,
don't ever drink again.

164
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:51,879
You have a terrible drinking habit.

165
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:00,389
Let's go. Where's Ha Jin?

166
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:02,330
She's upstairs. Anchor Lee is here.

167
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,759
He is?

168
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:06,529
Oh, my. Hello, sir.

169
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:08,370
- Hello.
- Hello.

170
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:11,440
Ha Jin, have you packed everything?

171
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,840
I'm still packing.

172
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,370
Just pack the things you need.

173
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,039
- Okay.
- Are you going somewhere?

174
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:20,139
We're going to a hotel.
We don't want to stay here anymore.

175
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:23,179
Don't you think it'd be dangerous
since there are many strangers?

176
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:24,919
Is there anywhere else you could go?

177
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:29,990
My parents live too far away,
and I don't want to worry them.

178
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:34,960
We're looking for a place
she can move into right away.

179
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,500
I won't be staying there for long,
so you don't have to worry.

180
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,899
I'll look into it.
Give me some time.

181
00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:45,440
Where?

182
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:50,769
Father, I got this herbal tea
as a gift recently.

183
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:52,740
Try it. It's really fragrant.

184
00:12:53,179 --> 00:12:54,179
Okay.

185
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,919
So what brings you here?

186
00:12:57,919 --> 00:12:59,620
I don't think you're here to see me.

187
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:02,850
How's Jeong Hoon?

188
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,289
Good. He's hanging in there.

189
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:08,389
Professor Kim called me.

190
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,500
I heard Jeong Hoon
received therapy recently.

191
00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:17,330
What? Oh, about that...

192
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,399
What in the world is going on?

193
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,740
I heard
you asked Prof. Kim yourself.

194
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:29,279
Did you volunteer
to be his doctor...

195
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,580
so that you can keep everything
from me?

196
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,549
Is this your way of telling me
to back off?

197
00:13:34,419 --> 00:13:35,649
It's not like that.

198
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:37,960
Then why didn't you tell me
about this?

199
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,159
After that incident,
Jeong Hoon has not once gone there.

200
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:44,200
If he went,
he must have had a reason for it.

201
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,529
You don't need to worry about that.

202
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:48,899
Does this...

203
00:13:50,169 --> 00:13:52,440
have to do with that woman,
Yeo Ha Jin?

204
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,570
Is their relationship serious?

205
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:59,779
Is it truly possible for him
to love another woman...

206
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:02,909
with all the memories
he has about Seo Yeon?

207
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,480
Why aren't you answering me?
You must know.

208
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,320
I don't know
about his feelings that deeply.

209
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,629
Yeo Ha Jin.
Her name sounded familiar,

210
00:14:15,629 --> 00:14:17,529
so I tried to remember
where I heard her name from.

211
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:19,759
She was your patient in the past.

212
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:23,029
The one who caused a problem because
you overprescribed sleeping pills.

213
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,029
Isn't she the patient?

214
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,600
If you can't find out
through Jeong Hoon,

215
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,309
try to keep an eye on him
through her.

216
00:14:29,309 --> 00:14:30,940
You still have a good relationship
with her, right?

217
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,409
From what I know, she still came
for therapy after that incident.

218
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,379
Dad,

219
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,250
you're not interested
in my feelings...

220
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,519
or my emotions, right?

221
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,350
What on earth are you talking about?

222
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,190
You're well aware how hard
that incident had been on me.

223
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:50,629
How could you bring that up
so casually as if it's nothing?

224
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,830
Until when will you whine
like a baby?

225
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:59,500
This is why I don't acknowledge you
as a fellow doctor.

226
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,840
Instead of overcoming
such incidents, you keep whining.

227
00:15:03,309 --> 00:15:06,440
You can't even control
your feelings. You're not a doctor.

228
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,059
Which unit are you going to?

229
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:20,090
We're going to Unit 701.

230
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:23,330
I was informed you were coming.

231
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:24,799
- This way, please.
- Okay.

232
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,570
Getting access to this budding
as visitors is difficult.

233
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,379
So you don't have to worry
while you stay here.

234
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:41,649
My gosh, this place looks great.

235
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,909
Are you sure we can stay here?

236
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:45,450
What about the person living here?

237
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:48,190
This place has been vacant
because of work.

238
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:50,450
This was supposed to be vacant
for some time anyway.

239
00:15:51,289 --> 00:15:53,059
Feel free to stay here.

240
00:15:53,059 --> 00:15:55,230
By the way,
how do you know the person?

241
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,460
Well...

242
00:15:57,529 --> 00:16:00,629
We are close like family.

243
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:07,240
Thank you for going out
of your way to help.

244
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,710
You should go back in.

245
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,240
Call me if there's a problem.

246
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:11,710
Okay.

247
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:15,409
Then, you won't suddenly disappear
into thin air again, right?

248
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:20,820
You can go anywhere
or someplace far.

249
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:23,190
But if you are going anywhere,
just tell me.

250
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,360
Then, I'll know where you are
and wait for you.

251
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,429
I can't go even if I want to now.

252
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:30,690
Why not?

253
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:32,559
Because of me?

254
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,429
I have to be back
on the news program.

255
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:37,940
Are you going back?
When are you starting?

256
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,070
In two days.

257
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,840
My leave of absence ends tomorrow.

258
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,269
That's great!

259
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:44,240
I wanted to see you lead the news.

260
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,549
I'll call you once I get home.

261
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,509
Get home safe.

262
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,320
Go back in.

263
00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:15,839
Ha Jin.

264
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,710
I'm certain that the owner
of this place is a man.

265
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,309
There's a razor in the bathroom.

266
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:21,309
Really?

267
00:17:21,549 --> 00:17:25,150
The place is really clean.
And the interior design is chic.

268
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:27,619
I wonder who owns this house.

269
00:17:28,849 --> 00:17:30,089
Is it Anchor Lee?

270
00:17:30,089 --> 00:17:31,690
Does he have two houses?

271
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,460
Come on. No way.

272
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:36,059
Then, how could he get a house
like this on such short notice?

273
00:17:38,829 --> 00:17:39,829
Ha Jin.

274
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:42,970
It's about Anchor Lee.

275
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,069
I think he has feelings for you.

276
00:17:46,069 --> 00:17:47,269
Do you think so?

277
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:50,569
He was worried about you, so he got
a house like this right away.

278
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,809
To call it a fake relationship,
he's way too affectionate, isn't he?

279
00:17:54,609 --> 00:17:56,180
You think so too, right?

280
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,019
Goodness. Look at you smiling.

281
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:04,019
Should we continue this romantic
feeling with some music?

282
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:05,619
I saw some records earlier.

283
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:07,119
Okay. Put on a good one.

284
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:10,329
Okay. I'll put on something great.

285
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:15,670
Ha Jin. I found
the photo of the owner!

286
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:16,670
Who?

287
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,769
Who is it? Who's the owner?

288
00:18:19,539 --> 00:18:20,900
I guess this was when he was young.

289
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:24,240
That can't be Anchor Lee, right?

290
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:29,309
Seeing how he has such a common
face, I don't think it's him.

291
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:31,980
He looks familiar. Who is this?

292
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:36,420
Who am I to you?

293
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:39,690
I'm your only junior reporter,
Jo Il Kwon.

294
00:18:39,789 --> 00:18:41,859
Of course, I ought to help you out.

295
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:43,230
I'm the best, right?

296
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,730
Yes. Thank you.

297
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:48,230
You don't look grateful at all.

298
00:18:50,099 --> 00:18:52,200
Thank you so much.

299
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,910
Happy?
Can you feel my gratitude now?

300
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,240
If you're really grateful,

301
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,380
write me some coupons.

302
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,579
What coupons?

303
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,450
10 coupons to get a pass?

304
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,279
Okay. I'll give you 20 coupons.

305
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:09,819
Really? Then, I get 20 free passes
when you want to scold me.

306
00:19:09,819 --> 00:19:11,220
You can't say anything later.

307
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,190
Okay, I got it.

308
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,890
And as for the house,
I said it was a close...

309
00:19:18,529 --> 00:19:21,970
I just said it was a friend
of mine's house. Just so you know.

310
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:25,240
Okay. After hearing
what happened, I was worried.

311
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,240
I'm glad.

312
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:28,869
Then, I'm going to get some sleep.

313
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,309
Where's my room?

314
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:31,710
Why would you sleep here?

315
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:32,940
Then, where do I sleep?

316
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,910
There are a lot of places.

317
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:37,410
So many rooms are available
at nearby hotels.

318
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:40,079
I thought I was staying
with you for the time being.

319
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:41,150
With me?

320
00:19:42,089 --> 00:19:43,119
Why?

321
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,390
Just stay at a comfortable place.

322
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:49,390
I'm sure staying with me
must be uncomfortable for you.

323
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,660
Here.

324
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,960
Well, you didn't have to.

325
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,500
You can't scold me
for how much I spend...

326
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:57,500
on the hotels. Okay?

327
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,140
Okay. Fine.

328
00:19:59,539 --> 00:20:00,769
Go and get some rest.

329
00:20:02,339 --> 00:20:05,339
Okay. All right. Good night.

330
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:24,259
My goodness. Hold on.
Where did I put my glasses?

331
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,430
Hold on. Where are they?

332
00:20:31,569 --> 00:20:33,269
Did I put them here?

333
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:41,279
What's this?

334
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:09,269
(Dad)

335
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:22,390
Hey, where are you now?

336
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,190
I'm in the office.

337
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,430
Hey, you're here.

338
00:21:30,259 --> 00:21:32,700
My gosh. I thought you...

339
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,599
What? Are you already regretting it?

340
00:21:36,869 --> 00:21:39,869
No, I'm not. I was just checking
if you came to work.

341
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:42,410
How are you feeling?

342
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:45,180
Fine. I'm okay.

343
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:47,839
I'm glad to hear that.

344
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:52,750
My gosh. I can feel your affection
toward him in your voice.

345
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,920
Are you that happy
to see him at work?

346
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,319
Why do you keep talking nonsense?

347
00:21:58,019 --> 00:22:00,420
What's up with your outfit?

348
00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:03,559
What? What's wrong with my outfit?

349
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:04,930
Clothes are good
as long as they are clean.

350
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:06,000
Forget it.

351
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:07,799
Just focus on preparing the news.

352
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:10,200
It's been a while
since you worked together.

353
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,769
Stay focused to the end.

354
00:22:11,769 --> 00:22:12,769
Okay?

355
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,410
- Do a good job.
- Okay.

356
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:23,779
People might think he was gone
for a year or something.

357
00:22:23,779 --> 00:22:25,349
Why is she making a fuss?

358
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,579
You're feeling okay, right?

359
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:30,950
My gosh. Yes. I'm perfectly fine.
I'm okay.

360
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,019
Okay. You look fine.

361
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:34,730
Well,

362
00:22:35,529 --> 00:22:37,490
what do you think about my voice?

363
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:40,059
Why are you asking me that
all of a sudden?

364
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:42,700
You know,
I do the countdown for you.

365
00:22:43,569 --> 00:22:45,299
I thought if it was distracting.

366
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,400
That never crossed my mind.

367
00:22:48,269 --> 00:22:49,269
Really?

368
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,170
Okay.

369
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:02,250
You should have just called him.

370
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:04,119
Did you have to come
all the way here?

371
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:06,619
I wanted to give him moral support
for coming back to work.

372
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:09,160
Since I'm here, I can research
about live news. It's great.

373
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,700
Research, my foot.
I can see right through you.

374
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,400
You're worried about him.

375
00:23:14,329 --> 00:23:15,799
Should I get him some coffee?

376
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,069
No. It's better to visit him
as if it's any other day, right?

377
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,039
- What is it?
- I don't think...

378
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:25,740
you should be worried
about other people now.

379
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,349
Despite what happened,
you're still worried about him,

380
00:23:28,349 --> 00:23:30,009
so I guess you like him a lot.

381
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,220
You know,

382
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,119
I just thought he needs me now.

383
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,319
I'll call you after I'm done.

384
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:41,460
Okay.

385
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:45,059
Wait, my phone. I must have left it.

386
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,700
Is this really you, my sister?

387
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,170
Can you go up alone?

388
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:51,170
Of course. Hurry up and go.
I'm going up.

389
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,170
- I'll call you.
- Okay.

390
00:23:55,069 --> 00:23:56,210
Which floor was it?

391
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,480
- The fourth floor!
- The fourth floor.

392
00:23:58,609 --> 00:24:00,079
The doors are closing.

394
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:52,700
Where is he?

395
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,700
Is he already at the studio?

396
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,230
Hello.

397
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:59,769
By any chance,
do you know where Anchor Lee is?

398
00:25:00,069 --> 00:25:02,210
Well, he was there just now.

399
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:05,039
I'll call him. Thank you.

400
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:19,359
He even left his phone here.
Where did he go?

401
00:25:38,109 --> 00:25:41,279
My son, congratulations
on becoming a reporter.

402
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:48,549
This is your most treasured pen.

403
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:50,450
You're right. Very much.

404
00:25:51,789 --> 00:25:56,190
When I hold this in my hand,

405
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:58,359
I get a lot of great ideas.

406
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,900
I hope you write a lot
of great articles with this pen.

407
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,549
Ta-da.
Congratulations on your return.

408
00:27:27,019 --> 00:27:29,789
Please make great news
that refreshes our hearts.

409
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:33,359
What brings you here at this hour?

410
00:27:34,259 --> 00:27:35,559
What's with that face?

411
00:27:36,289 --> 00:27:39,299
You seem like you're happy
to see me, but you kind of don't.

412
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,299
Thank you for the water.

413
00:27:43,299 --> 00:27:46,470
Anyway, are you here alone?
Where's Ha Kyung?

414
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:49,809
We came together,
but she left her phone at home.

415
00:27:50,339 --> 00:27:51,440
I see.

416
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,910
Right, how are you doing?
Are you doing okay?

417
00:27:56,609 --> 00:27:59,420
I'm doing fine thanks to you.

418
00:27:59,849 --> 00:28:00,880
I'm glad.

419
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:05,960
If it's okay with you,
will you wait until I'm done?

420
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:07,789
I'll take you home.

421
00:28:10,029 --> 00:28:11,529
Okay. Sounds great.

422
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,509
Jeong Hoon,
why do you look so serious?

423
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,369
Are you nervous
because it has been too long?

424
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:00,380
Me? No way.

425
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:02,549
I think you're the one
who's nervous.

426
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:04,680
If you can throw jokes,
I shouldn't have to worry.

427
00:29:05,349 --> 00:29:08,220
We have a lot of stories,
so keep up the pace.

428
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,390
Okay, 10 seconds
to the opening jingle.
