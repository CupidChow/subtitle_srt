1
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:03,680
(Episode 14)

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,750
(Anchor Lee)

3
00:00:25,629 --> 00:00:28,170
Ha Kyung, you got a call.

4
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:31,539
It's Chul.

5
00:00:33,969 --> 00:00:35,710
- Hey.
- Ha Kyung.

6
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:37,710
Why am I in charge of Se Min
all of a sudden?

7
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:38,979
I'm in charge of Ha Jin.

8
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,880
Did I do something wrong?

9
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:42,509
What do you mean?

10
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:44,750
Hey.

11
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,320
No, you didn't do anything wrong.

12
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,390
The newbie seemed
very inexperienced,

13
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:50,689
so we thought you could help him.

14
00:00:50,689 --> 00:00:52,289
Did Ms. Park not tell you?

15
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,159
Yes, that's why.

16
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:56,759
All right.

17
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:58,630
Let's talk again later. Bye.

18
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:01,770
What's going on?
Why haven't I heard about this?

19
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,270
Well...

20
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:06,099
I really wasn't trying to hide it
from you this time.

21
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:07,939
I just didn't have the time
to tell you...

22
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:10,140
because of what happened
to Anchor Lee. Don't misunderstand.

23
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,780
Okay, I won't.

24
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,310
So what's going on?

25
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:15,849
Well...

26
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,150
Anchor Lee received more photos
from your stalker.

27
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:21,290
- What?
- So Anchor Lee was looking...

28
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:24,290
into any suspicious people
around you.

29
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,319
And who were they?

30
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,730
Reporter Park Soo Chang,
Director Ji Hyun Geun,

31
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,329
and Chul.

32
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,159
"Chul"?

33
00:01:43,209 --> 00:01:44,879
- Hello.
- Oh, my.

34
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,849
What a pleasant surprise
so early in the morning.

35
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:50,319
I wanted to discuss something
with you.

36
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:52,620
Sure. Sit down.

37
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,620
Okay.

38
00:01:58,489 --> 00:02:01,090
Did you hear about my movie?

39
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:04,129
Yes. It's a shame that
she'll be busy during that time.

40
00:02:04,129 --> 00:02:06,870
Ha Jin was always eager
to work with you.

41
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,500
I'm so disappointed.

42
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,240
Do you still feel the same way?

43
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,300
Of course. No doubt about it.

44
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:15,310
Then it's settled.

45
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:17,939
- I'll adjust the schedule.
- Sorry?

46
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:20,509
I've been wanting
to take a break lately.

47
00:02:20,509 --> 00:02:24,449
And the film company is generous
enough to let me have my way,

48
00:02:24,449 --> 00:02:25,879
so I'm in no rush.

49
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,689
We'll start
after Ha Jin finishes her work.

50
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:30,319
Well...

51
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,389
Don't worry. We'll adjust
the conditions as you wish.

52
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:35,560
Are we done here?

53
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,599
You see, it's not solely up to me.

54
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,900
To be honest,

55
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,500
I was disappointed in you.

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,909
I told everyone,
including the reporters,

57
00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:50,039
that Ha Jin and I would be working
on the next movie together.

58
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:52,909
But you decided to let her work
on that other drama...

59
00:02:52,909 --> 00:02:55,150
without discussing it with me.

60
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:00,319
Don't you think I'd feel humiliated?

61
00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:17,370
Hello.

62
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,469
Since when has he been following us?

63
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:21,439
I was curious about something.

64
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:23,639
- What's Anchor Lee up to nowadays?
- Please leave.

65
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:25,909
You two don't seem
to be meeting these days.

66
00:03:25,909 --> 00:03:26,979
Did you break up?

67
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:28,080
Let's go.

68
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,680
Gosh. Come on.

69
00:03:31,219 --> 00:03:33,219
Is it that hard...

70
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:36,120
to answer yes or no?

71
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:42,229
Ha Jin.

72
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,330
I talked with Ms. Park,
so don't worry about it.

73
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:51,599
Let's grab something to eat soon.

74
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:57,479
Let's go.

75
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:03,780
Ha Jin.

76
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:07,419
Hey, Chul.
Are you here to see Ms. Park?

77
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:09,819
Yes, but she's still having
a meeting.

78
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,389
We need to talk.

79
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:12,960
Later.

80
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,360
She's feeling under the weather.

81
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,060
- It won't take long.
- No, you can talk later.

82
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,629
Why are you doing this
all of a sudden?

83
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:20,129
Just tell me!

84
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:21,870
I'll call you later
and explain everything.

85
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:22,870
I'm sorry.

86
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:32,410
Ha Jin.

87
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,980
Are you listening to me?

88
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:50,829
Hey, are you okay?

89
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:52,459
Yes.

90
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,930
Why were all of them here?

91
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,600
You're here.

92
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,740
Ms. Park.

93
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:02,439
I came down
since you weren't coming.

94
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,810
Why do you look so down?

95
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,879
What did Director Ji say?
Why was he here?

96
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,379
Well...

97
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:12,850
It seems like you'll have to work
on his movie.

98
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,920
What? Why?

99
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,250
She can't.

100
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,389
I wanted to say no too but...

101
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:21,930
First, come inside.

102
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,420
Jeong Hoon.

103
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:52,319
Jeong Hoon, open up.

104
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:56,529
Jeong Hoon.

105
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,800
Jeong Hoon. Open up.

106
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,430
I know you're in there.

107
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:03,939
Jeong Hoon.

108
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,410
Since her role is an anchor,
I've prepared some formal outfits.

109
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:17,750
How about this?

110
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,550
Isn't it too old-fashioned?

111
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,149
Does she need to wear something
so formal...

112
00:06:21,149 --> 00:06:22,389
just because she's an anchor?

113
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:24,920
What do you think?
Doesn't it look too bland?

114
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:31,259
Hey.

115
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,399
Yes?

116
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:35,129
Why have you been acting like this
since yesterday?

117
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:37,000
Is it because of Director Ji?

118
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:39,040
He's such a pain.

119
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,040
There are so many actresses
who want to work with him,

120
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,139
so why is he doing this?

121
00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:44,009
How dare he threaten Ms. Park?

122
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:46,839
- You're right.
- Don't worry.

123
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:49,250
I'm going to make sure
you don't work with him.

124
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,449
Never.

125
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,819
What is this?

126
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:57,990
What is it?

127
00:06:59,089 --> 00:07:00,889
Can you reach Jeong Hoon?

128
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:02,829
I haven't been able to for days.

129
00:07:02,829 --> 00:07:04,129
I'm getting worried.

130
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:21,949
Anchor Lee, it's me.

131
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:23,879
Please open up.

132
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:26,220
Why don't you call him again?

133
00:07:27,149 --> 00:07:28,149
Anchor Lee.

134
00:07:28,149 --> 00:07:29,519
What's wrong?

135
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,220
Hello, sir.

136
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,759
It's our friend's house.

137
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,360
We're worried since we haven't
been able to reach him.

138
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,699
I know that
this is Anchor Lee's house.

139
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:41,600
Wait. Aren't you Yeo Ha Jin?

140
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,699
Have you seen him recently?

141
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:46,769
No. I haven't seen him
for several days...

142
00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:48,810
and thought it was odd.

143
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:51,579
Is there a way to open this door?

144
00:07:51,579 --> 00:07:52,779
Without his permission?

145
00:07:52,779 --> 00:07:54,310
I'd get in trouble for doing that.

146
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,810
It may be urgent.

147
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:59,050
I think it's better for you
to call 911.

148
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,519
Right, 911.

149
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,920
911.

150
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:06,589
Anchor Lee.

151
00:08:09,329 --> 00:08:11,560
Why didn't he answer
if he was in there all along?

152
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,870
Sir, it must be difficult
working here.

153
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,080
How much did you drink?

154
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,789
As you can see, I drank a lot.

155
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,519
I thought you didn't enjoy drinking.

156
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,960
You always refused to drink,
so what's gotten into you?

157
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,759
That's what I don't know.

158
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:46,200
What should I do?

159
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,500
You're strong.

160
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,210
You've endured so much
up until now, so I'm sure...

161
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:55,309
How much...

162
00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:01,509
do you think you know about me?

163
00:09:02,379 --> 00:09:04,919
You sound like a close friend.

164
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,950
One thing I know for sure...

165
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,019
is that this is unlike you.

166
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:18,500
My existence itself was a burden
and a shackle to my mom.

167
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:25,100
Not once in her life
did she live solely for herself.

168
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,269
Even until the end,
she was worried about me...

169
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:31,309
and didn't think
about her poor self.

170
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:35,480
It was all because I was her son.

171
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:45,090
Your mother did that
out of her love for you.

172
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,759
Don't bring up
the word love that easily.

173
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:50,330
I didn't bring it up easily.

174
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:54,129
It's not just tough for you.
It's tough for everyone.

175
00:09:54,269 --> 00:09:56,399
Everyone gets sad
when they lose someone they love...

176
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,799
because of their memories...

177
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:01,639
Not you.

178
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,009
You forgot everything.

179
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:08,250
You forgot everything, and you live
as if nothing had happened.

180
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:11,220
So stop talking
as if you know everything.

181
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:29,799
Ha Jin!

182
00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:35,409
What's wrong? Do you feel sick?

183
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,279
No, I'm fine.

184
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:42,679
Let's go.

185
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:05,940
The two of us

186
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:10,980
Will become each other's light

187
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:48,149
What is it? I was
really into the music just now.

188
00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:50,309
It's because
you only listen to this song.

189
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:51,450
Don't you get sick of it?

190
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,480
No, not at all.

191
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,850
I'm not sick of you, Ha Na,

192
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,720
but I'm getting
kind of sick of this song.

193
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,529
Stop saying weird stuff
and listen to the song.

194
00:12:01,529 --> 00:12:02,830
Focus on the lyrics.

195
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:03,860
Okay.

196
00:12:04,299 --> 00:12:06,700
But let's listen to something else
after we listen to this once.

You don't look good.
Did you not sleep well?

202
00:15:39,309 --> 00:15:40,340
No, I'm fine.

203
00:15:41,049 --> 00:15:42,450
You're skipping breakfast, right?

204
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:45,879
I'm going to the convenience store.
Do you need anything?

205
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:47,419
No, go ahead.

206
00:15:47,419 --> 00:15:49,519
I should get ready to go out.

- You jerk.

- Why? What's wrong?
- You idiot.

- Hey, wait. I'm sorry. Why?
- My goodness.

- Darn you.
- Gosh.

217

218
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,889
This is embarrassing.

219
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,960
Hello. Have you been well?

220
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,029
Yes, I can't believe we met here.

221
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:09,700
If I may ask, how much did you see?

222
00:17:10,769 --> 00:17:13,369
I saw you get slapped
and beaten with her bag.

223
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:15,569
You saw everything.

224
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:17,670
Are you okay?

225
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,880
What did you do
that she beat you up that badly?

226
00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:25,079
No idea.
She keeps saying that I changed.

227
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:29,890
Why did you hit me?

228
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:31,960
Use the ice to cool your face down.
It's red.

229
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:36,029
Thanks.

230
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:37,930
Have you eaten?

231
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:40,230
No, not yet.

232
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:41,829
Come in. It's my treat.

233
00:17:52,009 --> 00:17:54,279
I'm sorry to bother you
on your busy schedule.

234
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,279
It's all right.
Why did you suddenly want to see me?

235
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,880
Yesterday,

236
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:04,250
I was at Anchor Lee's house,
and he had a lot to drink.

237
00:18:04,859 --> 00:18:06,460
But he shouldn't drink.

238
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:08,089
He was drinking?

239
00:18:08,529 --> 00:18:10,730
I think he was blaming himself
for his mother.

240
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,329
I'm sure you take good care of him
without me having say this,

241
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:19,240
but I thought I should tell you.

242
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,440
I can't visit him right now.

243
00:18:24,579 --> 00:18:27,509
Why not? Did something happen
between you and him?

244
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:33,579
I think it's uncomfortable for him
to have me around at the moment.

245
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:38,190
He probably wants to be alone.
Don't worry about him.

246
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:40,289
Okay.

247
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:45,000
Anyway, are you feeling sick?
You don't look so well.

248
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:52,869
I had an odd dream.

249
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:57,009
I was in a ballet studio...

250
00:18:58,809 --> 00:19:00,440
with someone.

251
00:19:04,349 --> 00:19:06,420
It was so heartwarming and fun,

252
00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:10,150
but I couldn't remember her face
after I woke up.

253
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,829
Is that dream troubling you?

254
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,460
It didn't seem like a dream.
I think it really happened.

255
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,200
It was the same studio
that I used to practice at.

256
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,599
I guess so.

257
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:30,369
Or you could have experienced
a similar situation.

258
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:33,309
Or it could just be a dream.

259
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,880
What's important is...

260
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,920
that I hope
your dream doesn't trouble you.

261
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:46,490
I ended up getting
a free session from you.

262
00:19:47,259 --> 00:19:50,130
It's all right.
Call me whenever things get hard.

263
00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:53,630
Thank you.
I feel much better thanks to you.

264
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:03,470
It's breakfast,
so I'll keep it simple.

265
00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:05,410
Simple?

266
00:20:05,609 --> 00:20:06,609
Open wide.

267
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,880
What?

268
00:20:08,009 --> 00:20:09,880
- Open wide.
- I can eat it myself.

269
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,950
Open.

270
00:20:18,819 --> 00:20:19,819
It's hot.

271
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:23,460
What is this?

272
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,230
This is so good.

273
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,299
Can I eat this?

274
00:20:31,769 --> 00:20:32,799
It's hot.

275
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,289
What? I thought
you were in your room.

276
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:58,400
Where have you been?

277
00:20:58,529 --> 00:21:00,700
I met up with Doctor Yoo Tae Eun.

278
00:21:01,099 --> 00:21:02,269
Why?

279
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:03,670
Just because.

280
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,369
I always feel better
after talking to him.

281
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:08,970
When I needed help,
I used to go to his sessions.

282
00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:11,710
Is it that hard?
To need therapy from him?

283
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:14,410
I'm not saying
I want to get therapy.

284
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,849
Meeting him from time to time
would be good for me.

285
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:25,759
Hello.

286
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:28,859
This is the security guard
at Anchor Lee's apartment.

287
00:21:28,859 --> 00:21:31,430
You wanted me to call you
if something happened.

288
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:34,769
Yes. Did something happen?

289
00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:43,609
It's been about 10 minutes
since he left in a car.

290
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:46,309
I don't know where he went.

291
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,920
Doctor Yoo.

292
00:21:56,589 --> 00:21:57,650
The receiver cannot be reached.

293
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,589
Anchor Lee isn't back, right?

294
00:21:59,789 --> 00:22:02,160
Is there any place you can think of
that he might've gone?

295
00:22:02,829 --> 00:22:04,829
There's a way I can find out.

296
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,299
I'll go check.

297
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:07,400
Let me go with you.

298
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,329
You're not going anywhere.
You have a meeting later.

299
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,269
If something happens to Anchor Lee,

300
00:22:12,269 --> 00:22:14,299
I think I'll regret it a lot.

301
00:22:15,069 --> 00:22:16,440
I'm sorry, Ha Kyung.

302
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,210
Gosh, whatever.

303
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:22,009
I'll handle the meeting.

304
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:23,609
But keep me in the loop.

305
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:24,609
Thank you.

306
00:22:34,059 --> 00:22:35,329
What's that?

307
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,029
Jeong Hoon's location.

308
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:41,200
I downloaded a tracking app
on Jeong Hoon's phone.

309
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,500
I did it at the funeral
when he was distracted.

310
00:22:45,769 --> 00:22:49,269
I was worried
that something might happen to him.

311
00:22:51,309 --> 00:22:52,480
In the end,

312
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,279
I treated Jeong Hoon like a patient
and kept a watch on him.

313
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,509
Just like my father.

314
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,180
But you had no other choice.

315
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:02,990
You had to do something
for Anchor Lee.

316
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:08,130
Perhaps, I might have driven him
out of his own house.

317
00:23:09,859 --> 00:23:12,029
I shouldn't have gone to his house.

318
00:23:12,259 --> 00:23:14,000
I shouldn't have talked rashly.

319
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:20,539
Where on earth is he going?

320
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:29,109
Now, I know where he's headed.

323
00:23:49,069 --> 00:23:52,000
this place has a lot of trees
which you like.

324

There are so many things
I want to ask you.

325

this one question.

328

Mom!

329
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,970
I'm...

330
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:30,210
so happy
that you're with me, Jeong Hoon.

331
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,650
Were you really happy with me?

332
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:40,480
(The late Seo Mi Hyun)

333
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:11,650
His cell phone is in the car.

334
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:14,180
Let's go that way.

335
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:21,119
(The late Seo Mi Hyun)

336
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,460
Is this the place?

337
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:25,299
Yes.

338
00:25:28,329 --> 00:25:29,500
Snow.

339
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,940
Anchor Lee has a bad memory
about snow, right?

340
00:25:34,569 --> 00:25:36,140
I thought so.

341
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:39,710
When it snowed the other day,
something was off about him.

342
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,309
Shouldn't we try
to find him quickly then?

343
00:25:42,579 --> 00:25:45,380
His car is here. I don't think
he could've gone far from here.

344
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,480
Let's split and look for him.

345
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,480
Okay.

346
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:28,819
Anchor Lee!

347
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:33,390
Anchor Lee.

348
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,289
Anchor Lee!

349
00:27:41,299 --> 00:27:42,670
Are you all right?

350
00:27:47,869 --> 00:27:50,539
Anchor Lee, get yourself together.
Please.

351
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,289
Are you okay? Are you awake?

352
00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:41,519
Gosh, what perfect timing.

353
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:43,190
I was about to wake you.

354
00:29:44,019 --> 00:29:45,119
Where are we?

355
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:46,890
Where do you think we are?

356
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:50,289
Do you know how tough it was to find
lodging while dragging you around?

357
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:53,559
If you're up,
wake up and take a seat here.

358
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:54,799
Don't be a crybaby.

359
00:29:56,369 --> 00:29:59,470
What about Ha Jin?
I thought she was here.

360
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:02,240
She watched over you the whole time,
then left not long ago.

361
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:04,839
Ha Kyung picked her up.

362
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,079
Come and take a seat.
Ha Jin bought...

363
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:11,609
this porridge for you. Eat up.

364
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:24,890
I'm sorry I had to leave first.

365
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,930
Make sure you eat everything.

366
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:46,119
Are you sure
you don't have to go to a hospital?

367
00:30:46,779 --> 00:30:49,349
I already took medicine.
I just need to get some rest.

368
00:30:50,089 --> 00:30:52,759
Why did you stay there
until you got this sick?

369
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:54,660
Why are you so foolish?

370
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:01,059
I promised I'll stay by his side.

371
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:05,900
I was really heartbroken,

372
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,740
but there's nothing I could do.

373
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,410
Doctor Yoo is there with him.

374
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:18,349
You shouldn't be worried about him.
You're burning up.

375
00:31:19,019 --> 00:31:21,180
Wait here.
I have to get a wet towel.

376
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,839
(Find Me in Your Memory)

377
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:53,039
Are you suspicious of me?

378
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,650
It wasn't me. Okay? It's not me!

379
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:57,150
I don't think this is right.

380
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:59,650
If it's not too urgent,
can you tell me?

381
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:01,819
Who does she think she is
to boss me around?

382
00:33:01,819 --> 00:33:03,319
Aren't these
all pictures of Ms. Yeo?

383
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:04,849
Call that newspaper company...

384
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:06,920
and find out if Park Soo Chang is
at work, then call me back.

385
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:10,230
You broke into her house
and sent threatening letters.

386
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:12,829
It wasn't me.
I'm not Yeo Ha Jin's stalker.

387
00:33:12,829 --> 00:33:13,829
Where are you?

388
00:33:13,829 --> 00:33:16,670
Is it because of that woman,
Yeo Ha Jin?

389
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:18,029
It's nothing for you to worry about.

390
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:20,500
That jerk isn't just a normal guy.

391
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,569
Ha Jin!
