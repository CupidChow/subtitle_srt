1
00:00:02,839 --> 00:00:04,440
What do you mean...

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,480
we can't publish
Professor Yoo's book?

3
00:00:06,809 --> 00:00:09,109
I'm the current doctor
of that patient.

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,720
I found my medical records
cited in that book.

5
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:16,120
You do know that you'll be liable...

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,289
for illegal leakage or citation
of medical records, don't you?

7
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:20,530
Pardon?

8
00:00:20,859 --> 00:00:23,760
I never provided my medical records,

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,699
and I do not plan on doing so.

10
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,800
If you decide to push ahead
with the publication,

11
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,399
I will take the legal measure
right away.

12
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:30,399
Wait,

13
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:32,869
of all people,
this is your father's book.

14
00:00:32,869 --> 00:00:33,869
No.

15
00:00:34,369 --> 00:00:36,539
He may be my father,
but nothing will change.

16
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:40,679
I'll assume that you have understood
what I said.

17
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:41,909
Please excuse me.

18
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,020
Is that what Tae Eun said?

19
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:56,630
All right.

20
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:20,790
Goodnight. Sweet dreams.

21
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:26,319
You too.

22
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,140
Hey, it's me.

23
00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:45,340
You don't go to work today, right?

24
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,180
What's this chair?

25
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,680
Did you make it?

26
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,680
Yes.

27
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,819
It's a present.

28
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,349
Why did you
suddenly bring a present?

29
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,689
Thank you.

30
00:01:58,859 --> 00:01:59,859
Sure.

31
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,489
Have you had lunch?

32
00:02:01,489 --> 00:02:03,129
If you haven't,
you should stay for a meal.

33
00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:05,230
I'll have a glass of water.

34
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:06,459
Sure.

35
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,210
Here.

36
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:27,990
Is everything all right?

37
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,090
Jeong Hoon.

38
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,590
I remember how I locked you up
in that closet as a child.

39
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:34,629
I am sorry...

40
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,159
for what I did back then.

41
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:41,530
I know I hurt you deeply,
and that you'll never forget.

42
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:46,500
I'm truly sorry.

43
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,250
You should get back to work.

44
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:59,520
Father.

45
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:07,729
I love this chair.

46
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:09,990
Thank you.

47
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,629
From now on,

48
00:03:14,469 --> 00:03:16,530
this chair will be my memory of you.

49
00:03:19,969 --> 00:03:23,240
I'm going to try
to let go of my past from now on.

50
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,159
Moon Seong Ho?

51
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,129
You must've been
dying to hear from me.

52
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:48,699
Where are you?

53
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:50,599
That's not it.

54
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:52,199
You shouldn't ask for my location.

55
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:54,639
You need to ask me
what I'm about to do.

56
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:56,039
That's the essence.

57
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:59,080
What do you want?

58
00:03:59,379 --> 00:04:00,650
Yes, I like that question.

59
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:03,819
What do I want?

60
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:07,789
My eternal love with Seo Yeon.

61
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:10,460
I'll prove it to you.

62
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:23,600
The number you reached
cannot take any calls.

63
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:29,670
Yes, Detective.
This is Lee Jeong Hoon.

64
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:32,680
I just received a call
from Moon Seong Ho.

65
00:04:33,009 --> 00:04:35,310
It seemed like a payphone.
Can you find the location?

66
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:12,220
(The late Jung Seo Yeon)

67
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:22,060
I'm too late, aren't I?

68
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,829
I'm sorry for leaving you alone.

69
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,509
(The late Jung Seo Yeon)

70
00:06:06,769 --> 00:06:07,769
Yes, Detective.

71
00:06:07,769 --> 00:06:09,769
I found the location
of Moon's cell phone.

72
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:11,639
Where is it?

73
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,949
It's near Inho-dong in Paju.
Does that ring a bell?

74
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:47,910
Did you do this?

75
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,850
You came faster than I had expected.

76
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:56,319
You're really good
at catching onto my hints.

77
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,620
If I was a second too late,

78
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,959
I may have not been able
to bring Seo Yeon with me.

79
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,029
Don't you think so?

80
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:04,660
Why are you doing this?

81
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,800
Am I not the one
you want to get rid of?

82
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:11,370
Yes. You're right.

83
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,269
I'll come to you. Tell me where.

84
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,779
I can go right away.

85
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:20,480
Are you worried?

86
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,509
Do you think I might harm
Yeo Ha Jin?

87
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,850
Shut it and tell me where you are.

88
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:27,889
Mr. Lee.

89
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:32,560
Be quiet and wait.

90
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:34,629
I'll call you again.

91
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,769
Ha Kyung, are you with Ha Jin?

92
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,370
Yes, we're
at the broadcasting station.

93
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,009
She has a meeting regarding a drama.

94
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,480
You're at the broadcasting station?

95
00:07:56,379 --> 00:07:59,120
You had to go through security
to get to the office, right?

96
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,019
You're right.

97
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,259
Can you wait there
after the meeting ends?

98
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,819
I have something to say to her.

99
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,889
I thought you're not working today
since it's the weekend.

100
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:12,259
No, I'm just about to leave.

101
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,800
Don't go outside the building.
Make sure to stay inside.

102
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:17,540
I'll call you when I'm almost there.

103
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:19,300
Okay.

104
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,709
Thank you.

105
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,370
Wait a little bit more.

106
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:25,370
We're almost there.

107
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,889
This was the last location
of his phone.

108
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,490
I'll look for him as well.

109
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,000
It's dangerous.
You should wait here.

110
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,299
He even stole her ashes
in order to lure me.

111
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,840
If I don't show up,
he'll hide once again.

112
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:33,169
No, it's too dangerous.

113
00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:35,070
All right, let's look for him.

114
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,169
Let's go.

115
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,009
- Which channel are you on?
- Channel one, sir.

116
00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:39,379
One? Okay.

117
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,509
- Hurry up.
- Yes, sir.

118
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:43,350
- All right.
- Where could he be?

119
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:46,320
Check that side.

120
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,690
- I'll check this area and go up.
- Okay.

121
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:53,490
I told you to wait for my call,
but you came here first.

122
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,629
You even brought some guests.

123
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:12,809
Sir, he's on the rooftop.

124
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:23,190
Watch carefully.

125
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:27,289
It's almost over.

126
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,960
It's been a long time.

127
00:12:04,429 --> 00:12:06,759
What do you think about this place?
It seems familiar, right?

128
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,970
I couldn't think of a better place
than here to carry out my last task.

129
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:16,870
This is where Seo Yeon and I
will begin our love.

130
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,409
It was this place all along?

131
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:25,379
Is it locked?

132
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:26,779
Mr. Lee!

133
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,049
- Open up!
- Oh, no.

134
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:30,590
We should end this quickly.

135
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,990
- Mr. Lee!
- I want to see Seo Yeon...

136
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:34,690
as soon as possible.

137
00:12:35,429 --> 00:12:36,690
You're insane.

138
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,960
- Hey, hey!
- Don't forget.

139
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,230
The one who'll be by her side...

140
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:44,200
is me, not you!

141
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,009
Mr. Lee!

142
00:12:49,909 --> 00:12:51,879
Moon Seong Ho! Stop right there!

143
00:12:53,309 --> 00:12:54,950
- Stop!
- Stop it!

144
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,450
- Drop your knife!
- Put it down!

145
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:58,480
- Don't come near.
- Drop that knife.

146
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,519
Don't come near me.

147
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,289
Calm down. Seong Ho.

148
00:13:01,289 --> 00:13:02,320
Don't come near.

149
00:13:05,889 --> 00:13:07,659
- Come down.
- Hey.

150
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,129
- Seong Ho.
- Come down.

151
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:11,200
Lee Jeong Hoon.

152
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,029
Don't forget.

153
00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:21,409
I won. I did.

154
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,769
Seo Yeon.

155
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,679
I'm on my way.

156
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:07,889
He wanted me to wait
because he had something to say?

157
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:10,120
Yes.

158
00:14:11,289 --> 00:14:14,289
Maybe he's driving.
He's not replying back.

159
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:20,330
You guys aren't up to anything,
are you?

160
00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:23,730
Don't be ridiculous. Gosh.

161
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:30,169
You know what?
Let's be honest with each other.

162
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:31,980
I want you guys
to get back together.

163
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,350
When you're with him,

164
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,049
you seem at peace
like you did in the past.

165
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:38,279
I know you don't want to break up.

166
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:40,149
Aren't you happy with him?

167
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:42,090
How many times
do I need to tell you?

168
00:14:42,789 --> 00:14:44,919
I can't be selfish about this.

169
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:47,730
Do you really think this is
the best solution for you guys?

170
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:51,860
Focus on what's most important
to you right now.

171
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,200
I think that's
the right thing to do.

172
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,769
But then again, I know I am
the most important person to you.

173
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,840
Oh, it's Anchor Lee.

174
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:11,580
I'll pick it up.

175
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:17,659
Hello?

176
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:35,710
(Restricted Area, Operation Room)

177
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:37,779
I was the one who called.

178
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:39,809
What happened?

179
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,279
You know Moon Seong Ho, the inmate
who escaped the hospital, right?

180
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:44,450
Mr. Lee was trying to catch him.

181
00:15:45,419 --> 00:15:46,980
Is he in a critical situation?

182
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,850
They'll only know
once the surgery is over.

183
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:50,690
You should wait for now.

184
00:16:10,539 --> 00:16:12,840
How did it go? How is he?

185
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,309
It went well.

186
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:17,879
Thank you.

187
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:19,049
He was bleeding a lot.

188
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,950
But thankfully,
the wound wasn't deep,

189
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:23,549
and his organs weren't damaged.

190
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:25,120
He'll be okay.

191
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:27,360
Then is everything all right?

192
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,830
Yes. He'll wake up
once the anesthesia wears off.

193
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,600
Don't worry. Goodbye.

194
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,700
Thank you.

195
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,960
- Thank you.
- No problem.

196
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:36,570
That's a relief.

197
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,889
Are you awake? Can you see me?

198
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,730
Am I dreaming right now?

199
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:11,670
You're with me and holding my hand.

200
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:14,869
How can you make a joke now?
You gave me a scare.

201
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:19,079
I guess I'm not dreaming
since you look really angry.

202
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,380
I wasn't angry.

203
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:25,720
I raised my voice
because I was happy.

204
00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:28,650
I'm sorry for scaring you...

205
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:31,559
and making you wait.

206
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:34,359
You said you'd be the bad guy.

207
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:39,500
Bad guys don't apologize this often.

208
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:45,900
Wait. I'll get your doctor.

209
00:17:51,509 --> 00:17:53,910
I don't want you to go anywhere.

210
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,279
I won't leave you here.

211
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:01,119
I should let them know
that you're awake.

212
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:11,130
I need you the most right now.

213
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,509
Can you bring
some comfortable clothes for me?

214
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,650
Will you stay with him all night?

215
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,279
Yes. I think
I need to stay with him.

216
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:35,819
I can't just leave him alone
when he's sick.

217
00:18:39,019 --> 00:18:40,920
Come on. Just get me my clothes.

218
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,460
Okay.

219
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,170
(Intensive Care Unit)

220
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:00,539
When he fell,

221
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,480
his fifth cervical vertebra
was fractured...

222
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,210
and pressed on his central nerves.

223
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:07,950
Due to the nerve damage,
he's paralyzed from the neck down.

224
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,789
Due to the brain hemorrhage,

225
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,359
it's likely that he'll face
a speech impediment.

226
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,730
We were able to save his life,

227
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:18,529
but there's nothing
he can do by himself.

228
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,900
You can't even run away on your own.

229
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:25,400
Before you pay
for all of your crimes,

230
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,170
don't even think about dying.

231
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,230
You scared me when
you disappeared without telling me.

232
00:19:56,299 --> 00:19:58,170
It's cold.
What are you doing up here?

233
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,410
I was just getting some air.

234
00:20:02,109 --> 00:20:03,569
It was stuffy inside.

235
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:05,809
Even so, you must stay indoors.

236
00:20:05,809 --> 00:20:06,980
Let's go.

237
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:21,930
Why are you staring at me like that?

238
00:20:23,329 --> 00:20:25,059
Can you just accept it now?

239
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:29,369
You won't be able to bend my will.

240
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:32,170
Let's talk inside.

241
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,869
It's cold out here.
You can't catch a cold.

242
00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:37,170
I'll go once you answer me.

243
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,150
I don't think I can do it yet.

244
00:20:53,859 --> 00:20:57,359
But when I thought I might not
be able to see you again,

245
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,230
I was more scared of making...

246
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:05,269
the same mistake
and suffering from it...

247
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:07,799
for the rest of my life.

248
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,710
This must have been harder on you.

249
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:17,309
But you still mustered up
the courage for me.

250
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,759
You win.

251
00:22:20,779 --> 00:22:22,910
Stop walking around.
You should go to sleep now.

252
00:22:24,779 --> 00:22:26,549
Get home safely, Ha Jin.

253
00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:27,920
I'm not leaving.

254
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:30,319
If I leave,
you'll walk around again.

255
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:32,259
I'll be watching you
the whole night.

256
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,160
I'll stay in the room. Don't worry.

257
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,730
Go home now. It's late.

258
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,960
No. I can't because
it makes me anxious.

259
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:40,529
There's no place to stay.
It's uncomfortable for you.

260
00:22:40,529 --> 00:22:42,970
The doctor said you needed to rest
to recover. Lie down.

261
00:22:43,269 --> 00:22:44,269
Now.

262
00:22:57,049 --> 00:23:00,049
I don't think I can sleep when
you're staring at me like that.

263
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:07,289
I'll go to sleep
if you answer my question.

264
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,230
Okay. I'll answer it.

265
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:10,289
What is it?

266
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,259
Did you miss me?

267
00:23:18,069 --> 00:23:20,039
I missed you like crazy.

268
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,880
I'll pass. Next question.

269
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:32,680
The text messages I sent...

270
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:36,849
Did you read them
before ignoring them...

271
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:38,289
or did you not read them at all?

272
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,029
Well, that's...

273
00:23:45,099 --> 00:23:47,700
Just go to sleep. If you keep
talking, you won't get sleepy.

274
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:49,029
Close your eyes.

275
00:23:54,569 --> 00:23:56,809
Go to sleep now.
I'm serious. Sleep now.

276
00:23:56,809 --> 00:23:57,869
Okay.

277
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,410
I think I'm getting sleepy...

278
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,710
because you're covering my eyes.

279
00:24:05,619 --> 00:24:06,619
Right?

280
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:09,890
Goodnight.

281
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,269
The defendant was instigated
by Ji Hyun Geun,

282
00:24:27,269 --> 00:24:28,769
Yeo Ha Jin's stalker,

283
00:24:28,769 --> 00:24:30,970
to stalk the actress...

284
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,509
and to secretly take photos.

285
00:24:32,509 --> 00:24:33,880
He used his position
as a reporter...

286
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,109
and ended up blackmailing
the actress.

287
00:24:36,109 --> 00:24:37,579
But I will accept his argument...

288
00:24:37,579 --> 00:24:39,119
that he wasn't aware his photos
could be used...

289
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:40,619
in criminal activities,

290
00:24:40,619 --> 00:24:41,720
I sentence the defendant...

291
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,519
2 years in prison
or 3 years on probation.

292
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:47,220
Hey, it's me. Mr. Hwang.

293
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:51,759
I just wanted to thank you
for introducing me to a good lawyer.

294
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:54,359
I need to buy you a drink.

295
00:24:55,299 --> 00:24:56,400
When are you free?

296
00:24:58,670 --> 00:24:59,970
Here you go.

297
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,200
That looks good.

298
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:04,910
I was so shocked when
I heard Jeong Hoon got stabbed.

299
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,509
My heart is still beating
like crazy.

300
00:25:06,509 --> 00:25:08,710
I'm relieved that
it's not a severe injury.

301
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,279
And he's recovering quickly too.

302
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:12,819
Right. And Ha Jin is with him too.

303
00:25:13,619 --> 00:25:15,089
Things will work out
for them, right?

304
00:25:15,289 --> 00:25:16,349
Right?

305
00:25:17,289 --> 00:25:20,960
I want my sister to just think
about her own happiness.

306
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,190
You did well.

307
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:24,859
I didn't do much.

308
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,660
- Let's eat.
- Okay.

309
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,200
Here.

310
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,440
By the way, we played
a game a few days ago.

311
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,609
- Eating the spicy ramyeon.
- Yes. What about it?

312
00:25:36,609 --> 00:25:38,480
I want you to answer
the question you didn't answer.

313
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,710
Did you date a lot of men?
Or did you just date a few?

314
00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:44,049
Are you that curious about that?

315
00:25:44,049 --> 00:25:45,049
Yes.

316
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,720
I'll tell you
if you tell me your answer.

317
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,819
Fine. Let's say it at the same time.

318
00:25:49,819 --> 00:25:50,819
Sure.

319
00:25:51,619 --> 00:25:53,289
In 1, 2, 3.

320
00:25:53,289 --> 00:25:54,289
- A lot.
- Not a lot...

321
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:56,259
- You didn't date a lot?
- A lot of women?

322
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,529
How many women did you date?

323
00:25:58,529 --> 00:26:00,660
About 4 or 5?

324
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,400
What do you mean by that?

325
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,369
I bet it's over 5. Is it over 10?

326
00:26:04,369 --> 00:26:05,799
No. I'm serious.

327
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,670
How many men did you date then?

328
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,670
I didn't date a lot of men.

329
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:13,009
What is it? How many is it?

330
00:26:13,009 --> 00:26:14,440
I can't be your first.

331
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,849
It's okay. Just tell me.

332
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,880
Wait. Am I really
your first boyfriend?

333
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,190
No!

334
00:26:23,019 --> 00:26:24,289
As if!

335
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,859
Let's stop talking about this.

336
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:29,029
My gosh, you're so cute!

337
00:26:29,259 --> 00:26:32,160
Fine, yes. It's in the past.
Let's move on.

338
00:26:32,329 --> 00:26:34,130
What's important is
our present, isn't it?

339
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:36,869
Why? Are you sulking?

340
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:38,799
It's more than 10, isn't it?

341
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:43,410
No way. Come here.
Open your mouth. Here.

342
00:26:44,109 --> 00:26:45,839
Gosh, you're eating so well.

343
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:02,960
Are you sure you can do this?

344
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,490
Don't you trust me?

345
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:07,230
I'll do just as you told me earlier.

346
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:09,430
Yes, that's true,
but it's pretty tough...

347
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:10,599
Quiet.

348
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,640
- I'll do it.
- One second.

349
00:27:17,339 --> 00:27:18,940
Why? Mouth.

350
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:38,460
I think I have a knack for this.

351
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:48,609
Are you busy, Director Choi?
How does some Americano sound?

352
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,410
Sounds great.

353
00:27:52,309 --> 00:27:56,450
Why do they make you work so hard
that you can't even go for lunch?

354
00:27:57,549 --> 00:27:59,680
I'm almost finished.

355
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,420
I was just getting thirsty.

356
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:07,390
- Thanks.
- I knew you'd be thirsty.

357
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:08,829
My gosh.

358
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:13,700
Gosh, this is great.

359
00:28:14,829 --> 00:28:16,069
What's this?

360
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:17,569
This? It's a book.

361
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:20,200
It seemed
very uncanny and interesting.

362
00:28:20,539 --> 00:28:21,839
You read books?

363
00:28:22,309 --> 00:28:25,809
What are you talking about?
I was once called a bookworm.

364
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:28,809
I've known you for about 30 years,

365
00:28:28,809 --> 00:28:30,180
but this is unheard of.

366
00:28:30,579 --> 00:28:31,609
Goodness.

367
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,779
What's it about?

368
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:36,049
- Honey.
- What?

369
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:38,559
Do you know
what hyperthymesia is?

370
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:43,259
- What?
- It's someone who remembers...

371
00:28:43,259 --> 00:28:45,960
everything about their life,
all 365 days in a year.

372
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:48,400
There's someone
who has that condition in Korea.

373
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,069
Really?

374
00:28:50,069 --> 00:28:53,240
Yes. This book is about that person.

375
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,109
Don't you think it'll be uncanny
to meet them in real life?

376
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:58,109
What's so uncanny about that?

377
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,839
I'm sure it's someone
who just remembers well.

378
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:02,950
This person is apparently an anchor,

379
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,809
and he seems
very similar to Jeong Hoon.

380
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,579
He has a great memory too.

381
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:10,420
Does Jeong Hoon look like
someone with this disease?

382
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:13,819
Yes, well,
I know he's good at his job,

383
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:17,589
but he's way too normal and rude
to have a condition like this.

384
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:20,200
So who could it be?
Is it someone at our station?

385
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,269
I'm so curious. I'm dying to know.
It's driving me crazy.

386
00:29:23,269 --> 00:29:25,099
Why are you curious about that?

387
00:29:25,099 --> 00:29:28,240
Stop asking a useless question
and get ready for the news.

388
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,170
Our coffee date is finished.
The end.

389
00:29:31,509 --> 00:29:35,450
Get up. Come on, get up.
Get up and go. Go now.

390
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:37,779
Yes, of course.
I'll do as you say, Director Choi.

391
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:40,650
Hey, wait.

392
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,750
Can you leave that book here?
Let me read it.

393
00:29:44,019 --> 00:29:46,220
See? Don't you get curious too?

394
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,789
I haven't finished it yet,
so read it quickly and give it back.

395
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:51,660
Thanks.

396
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:53,160
Gosh.

397
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:54,259
Keep it up.

398
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:55,769
Okay.

399
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,140
"The Man Who Cannot Forget"?

400
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:05,380
Are you sure you're okay?

401
00:30:06,009 --> 00:30:07,109
I'm fine.

402
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:10,349
The doctor said
I can carry out my everyday life.

403
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:13,119
But don't work too hard.

404
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:15,220
If you have to carry something heavy
or do something tough,

405
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,490
make someone else do it.

406
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,690
I won't have to do
anything like that.

407
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:20,589
But still. You never know.

408
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:22,490
All right.

409
00:30:23,589 --> 00:30:24,589
This is great.

410
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,900
What is?

411
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:29,700
To have you worry about me.

412
00:30:31,829 --> 00:30:34,440
I'll do it so much from now on that
you'll get sick of it. Be ready.

413
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:35,970
I'll look forward to it.

414
00:30:36,869 --> 00:30:39,440
I'm almost at work.
I'll call you later.

415
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:42,279
Okay. Be careful.

416
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,279
You really have to be careful.

417
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,519
Okay.

418
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:55,190
- Is that him?
- I don't think that's him.

419
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:57,029
It's Anchor Lee Jeong Hoon!

420
00:30:57,329 --> 00:31:00,359
Anchor Lee, have you read the book
titled "The Man Who Cannot Forget"?

421
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:03,630
Are you the man of this book?

422
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:05,640
Is it true that
you suffer from hyperthymesia?

423
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,670
Tell us something.

424
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:08,170
- Say something.
- How are you feeling?

425
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:09,470
- Excuse me.
- Say something!

426
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:10,970
- Please say something.
- Anchor Lee!

427
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:14,079
Did you know that
your story will get published?

428
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:15,480
- Anchor Lee!
- Is this you?

429
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,849
- What's your take on this?
- Say something!

430
00:31:16,849 --> 00:31:18,920
- Anchor Lee!
- Tell us something!

431
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,180
- Say something!
- Anchor Lee!

432
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,450
Hey, Lee Jeong Hoon!

433
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:41,839
I picked up a huge scoop.

434
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,170
Don't you want to know what it is?

435
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,940
(Find Me in Your Memory)

436
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:18,369
Now that everyone knows,
I'm a bit scared of their reactions.

437
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:19,579
Did you miss me?

438
00:32:19,579 --> 00:32:20,940
Of course, I did.

439
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,180
Okay, you pass.

440
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,180
Did you read the book?

441
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:25,750
Is that why you prepared this
to cheer me up?

442
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,980
People forget
much faster than you think.

443
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,589
So I don't want you to be
in too much pain.

444
00:32:30,589 --> 00:32:32,160
I found a new story.

445
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,720
A woman he loved died,

446
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,789
then he fell in love with
her best friend all over again.

447
00:32:35,789 --> 00:32:38,130
Why do they have to make
such a big deal out of this?

448
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:39,900
I didn't think
it would blow up like this.

449
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,430
It could be tougher than
what we expected,

450
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:44,670
but let's live through this
like we did today.
