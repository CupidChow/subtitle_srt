1
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:15,890
Yes, Anchor Lee.

2
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,160
If it's okay with you,
may I check the footage?

3
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,489
The security footage?

4
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:22,390
I thought I'd better check.

5
00:00:23,629 --> 00:00:26,730
I'm sure it'll be fine.
Nothing special happened.

6
00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:29,699
But I'll tell Chul to send it over.

7
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:32,939
(Episode 12)

8
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,609
What? Since when
was that camera there?

9
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,750
Darn it.

10
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,540
Yes, Ha Kyung.

11
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,540
I was going to send it over,

12
00:01:08,739 --> 00:01:11,239
but the settings were all messed up.

13
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:12,980
Nothing was recorded.

14
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,849
Really? What happened?

15
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,120
Everything is fine now, right?

16
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,689
Yes, I fixed the setting.

17
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:22,450
Okay.

18
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:33,900
(Do you want to
delete this footage?)

19
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,900
(Footage deleted.)

20
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,939
Do you have the new big scoop?

21
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,739
Why have you been running around
with Il Kwon since the morning?

22
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,409
Oh, it's nothing.

23
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:53,620
It doesn't seem like
this is nothing.

24
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,120
It looks like something is going on.

25
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,159
- Hello.
- Yes, hello.

26
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,000
Goodness, look who this is.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,200
I can't believe I ran into you.

28
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,669
- Nice to meet you, Anchor Lee.
- Yes.

29
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,500
- Anyway, who are you?
- Who are you?

30
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,310
She's the director.
And she's my CEO.

31
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,139
I see. Nice to meet you.

32
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:19,939
Yes, you're like
Anchor Lee's mother.

33
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,449
Please do take good care
of my Ha Jin, Director.

34
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:25,819
Goodness, Director.

35
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:27,789
His mother? I'm just his boss.

36
00:02:27,789 --> 00:02:30,259
I'm not that much older than him.

37
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:31,759
- One second.
- I see.

38
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:33,289
Anyway, what brings you here?

39
00:02:33,289 --> 00:02:36,490
We have a meeting for a drama
with the writer and the director.

40
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,400
Oh, yes. I heard
you might play the news anchor.

41
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,270
Let me know if you need anything.

42
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:43,270
I was really relieved
when you said you'll help us...

43
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,939
by taking up that documentary,
so I should help too.

44
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:47,710
Then we should ask
if she can do research here.

45
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:50,009
You wanted to do that, didn't you?

46
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,039
Do you need to do research?

47
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,349
Oh, yes. I hardly know anything,
so I didn't know what to do.

48
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:57,479
It would be great if I can study
by seeing it in real life.

49
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:59,150
Go ahead, then.
That's nothing difficult.

50
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,889
Come over whenever you have time.

51
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,650
You have nothing tomorrow.

52
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,259
You can come tomorrow, then.

53
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:05,490
Is that all right?

54
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,330
Yes. Yes, of course.

55
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:11,400
Thank you.
Then I'll see you tomorrow.

56
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,199
- Sure.
- Please excuse us.

57
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:15,569
- Goodbye.
- Sure, goodbye.

58
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:16,729
Goodbye.

59
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:18,439
Goodness.

60
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:23,009
- Thank you.
- Here's your coffee.

61
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,310
- Thank you.
- I'll take that.

62
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,110
- Are we parked right outside?
- Yes, it's right outside.

63
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:29,479
Let's go.

64
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:38,520
Chul looked at it,
but the setting was wrong.

65
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,590
He fixed it now, so it should be
all right from now on.

66
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,860
I'll keep checking
from time to time.

67
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,710
Goodness, Ha Jin. Great work today.

68
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,169
Get a good rest at home.

69
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:56,210
Okay, Ms. Park. Goodbye.

70
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,039
- Goodbye.
- Okay.

71
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:59,639
- Great work. Drive safely.
- Yes, goodbye.

72
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,979
- Yes.
- Okay.

73
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,889
It's the director.

74
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:14,960
Which one?

75
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,930
Director Ji? Don't pick it up.

76
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:20,259
- Why not?
- Don't pick up.

77
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:21,899
Yes, Director Ji.

78
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,269
I told you not to pick it up.

79
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:24,970
Right now?

80
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,129
Do you like that picture?

81
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,000
Yes.

82
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:54,470
But it'd be better
if it was in my room.

83
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,899
It's your work,
so I'll buy it from you.

84
00:04:57,139 --> 00:04:59,569
I can always give it to you,

85
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,709
but that picture
looks the best when it's here.

86
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,110
But I'll give you another present.

87
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:06,079
A present?

88
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:07,779
Yes, come here.

89
00:05:15,019 --> 00:05:16,050
("Goodnight, Darling")

90
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,319
I kept you waiting, didn't I?

91
00:05:18,089 --> 00:05:20,589
Something about the ending
didn't seem right.

92
00:05:20,589 --> 00:05:23,129
I couldn't make up my mind, so
I finally finished it this morning.

93
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,860
That's why I wanted to see you.

94
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,399
I thought Ms. Yoo Mi So will be
starring in this one.

95
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,899
I saw the article.

96
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:30,939
Mi So had a misunderstanding.

97
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:32,470
I always told you...

98
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:34,740
that you'll also play the lead role
of my next movie, Ha Jin.

99
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:36,769
I see.

100
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:38,839
We'll start filming
at the end of the year.

101
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,949
The lead role is a pianist,

102
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:43,149
- so you need to learn to play...
- I'm sorry, Director Ji.

103
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:45,120
I don't think I can do this.

104
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:49,189
- What do you mean?
- I'm starring in a drama,

105
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:51,089
Writer Hwang's work.

106
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:55,160
I thought Ms. Yoo would be
playing the lead for this one.

107
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,899
You haven't signed
the contract yet, have you?

108
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,699
Read it first.
It'll help change your mind.

109
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,569
You know what? Read it right now.

110
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:06,500
I'm sorry, but I really want
to do this drama.

111
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:09,870
I'm truly sorry.

112
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,310
I said,

113
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,410
read it right now.

114
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,290
I'm sorry. I was a bit flustered.

115
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:27,860
You understand me, right?

116
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,300
You didn't have to buy this.

117
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:32,899
- Thanks.
- No problem.

118
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:40,910
Is he crazy or what?

119
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:43,240
He was always so loving
toward Mi So,

120
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,680
so why is he upset at you?

121
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,879
He's the one who changed his mind.

122
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:50,310
If it's too difficult for you
to say no, let me talk.

123
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,579
I'll tell him that our agency
decided to do so.

124
00:06:53,149 --> 00:06:54,350
I should.

125
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,490
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

126
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:04,660
("Goodnight, Darling")

127
00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:26,680
("Goodnight, Darling")

128
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,089
Jeong Hoon.

129
00:07:33,089 --> 00:07:35,589
Anchor Lee, I came to study.

130
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:36,589
I see.

131
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:38,829
I was just about to show her
the studio control room.

132
00:07:38,829 --> 00:07:39,930
Do you want to come with me?

133
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,629
No, go without me.

134
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,240
Why is he so cold?

135
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:51,439
Does he usually come to work
around this time?

136
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:54,079
No, he's a bit late today.

137
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,410
He usually comes around 10 p.m.

138
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:56,810
On Mondays, he comes at 9 p.m.

139
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,879
He comes to work early.

140
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,220
The news ends at 12 a.m.

141
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:03,290
You're right. The last news team
doesn't come to work that early.

142
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,519
He's just meticulous.

143
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:06,420
Thanks to him, I have to come
to work early as well.

144
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:08,360
Please keep this a secret from him.

145
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:09,829
Okay.

146
00:08:11,129 --> 00:08:14,199
He comes to work at 10 p.m.
and 9 p.m. on Mondays.

147
00:08:14,269 --> 00:08:15,930
Why would you write that down?

148
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,069
It's important.

149
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:19,439
- Shall we go?
- Sure.

150
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,230
What are you doing there?

151
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,399
I was curious
about what you were reading.

152
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,799
You should've just asked.

153
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:54,809
You seemed very focused.
I didn't want to disturb you.

154
00:08:54,809 --> 00:08:56,870
Staring at me like that is worse.

155
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,039
Really?

156
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:00,110
So what were you reading?

157
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,049
Can I read it too?

158
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:05,980
Come sit next to me.

159
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:07,450
Okay.

160
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,360
These are the articles
we'll cover during the news.

161
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,600
They're not finalized yet.

162
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,799
They'll be finalized
a bit after 6 p.m.

163
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,870
I see.

164
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:27,070
My news will be recapping
the articles...

165
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,769
from the 9 p.m. news.

166
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:30,840
So it's important to determine
which ones to omit...

167
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,080
and which ones to dig in deeper.

168
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,549
Can you hold on?

169
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:43,090
But I won't be repeating
the same thing.

170
00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:44,590
I might cover the same news,

171
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:47,389
but the anchors are different
and mine starts late at night.

172
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,259
Since your character
works for the 9 p.m. news,

173
00:09:50,259 --> 00:09:52,559
it'll help you more
if you watch the 9 p.m. news.

174
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,899
Ha Jin found out...

175
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,799
about your disease.

176
00:10:01,409 --> 00:10:04,509
Then when will you read
the 9 p.m. news?

177
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:06,409
I heard that's the main one.

178
00:10:07,409 --> 00:10:11,080
I'm not sure. That's not up to me.

179
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:13,049
I've never considered it either.

180
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,519
Not anyone can do the 9 p.m. news.

181
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,360
Since when were you there?

182
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,769
I had a food coma and was napping.

183
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:30,669
What? Was I not allowed to?

184
00:10:30,669 --> 00:10:32,200
I didn't see you at all.

185
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,409
You probably couldn't.

186
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,740
You were busy pulling each other...

187
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,440
closer.

188
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:41,379
You were too busy
being lovey-dovey...

189
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:42,980
to notice me.

190
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,820
We were neither pulling
each other closer...

191
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,549
nor being lovey-dovey.

192
00:10:46,549 --> 00:10:47,919
We were only talking about the news.

193
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:50,320
Right, I'm sure.

194
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:53,889
You must be professionals.

195
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:56,929
Out of all the great places to date,

196
00:10:56,929 --> 00:10:59,029
you picked this busy workplace...

197
00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:02,200
to act all lovey-dovey.

198
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,200
- Wait.
- Right.

199
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,070
Let me clear something.

200
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:11,480
I'm the one who's in charge
of the articles for his news.

201
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:14,750
I'm the one who decides
what to omit and what to dig deeper.

202
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,779
Got it?

203
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:18,950
After all, I'm his boss.

204
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:22,090
Make sure you write them all down.

205
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:26,820
Look at you acting all cool
in front of your girlfriend.

206
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:32,259
What's wrong with him?

207
00:11:32,429 --> 00:11:34,529
I have no idea either.

208
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:40,500
What are you writing so secretively?

209
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,110
Nothing.

210
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:47,549
I'd like two cups of Americano,
to go, please.

211
00:11:47,549 --> 00:11:48,549
That'll be nine dollars.

212
00:11:48,549 --> 00:11:50,080
How was it today?

213
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,279
Was he nice enough
to explain everything?

214
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:55,490
Yes, he was. But I'm going
to come again tomorrow.

215
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,889
Why would you? Wasn't today enough?

216
00:11:57,889 --> 00:12:00,320
What's wrong? I'm free tomorrow.

217
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,559
It's good to be thorough.

218
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:02,830
That's true.

219
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:06,330
By the way, how many cups
of coffee do we need?

220
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,169
- I want a chocolate drink.
- No.

221
00:12:08,169 --> 00:12:09,200
Hold on.

222
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:12,269
Hello? You may speak.

223
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:15,370
Hey, don't even talk
about Anchor Lee. He irritates me.

224
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:18,440
He thinks he owns
the broadcasting station.

225
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,850
This time, he even invited
his girlfriend over.

226
00:12:21,549 --> 00:12:23,750
It was ridiculous.

227
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,620
I can't take it.

228
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,519
Can you send me
the tentative proposal?

229
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:32,090
- I need to go to the toilet.
- Okay.

230
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:43,929
Oh, my.

231
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,840
When did you come?

232
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,740
Just now. You can finish writing.

233
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,070
That's fine. I'm all done.

234
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:53,240
I hope I'm not taking
too much of your time.

235
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,779
Don't worry.
I have all the time in the world.

236
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:05,720
Isn't that your team leader?

237
00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:22,769
What was that?

238
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:23,840
Oh, no.

239
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,340
I'm so sorry.
I thought you were my manager.

240
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:30,179
Even still, why would you slap
your manager's head like this?

241
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:32,820
Oh, no! Oh, no!

242
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,190
You two have similar-looking heads.

243
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:35,690
I'm sorry. That must've hurt.

244
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:36,720
It's fine.

245
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,960
I'm sorry.

246
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,960
It's okay.

247
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:46,960
Hello.

248
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,799
I'm Jeong Hoon's mom.
It's nice to meet you.

249
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:54,610
Hello, it's nice to meet you.

250
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:55,669
Me too.

251
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,240
Have you eaten already?

252
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,480
Do you want to join us for dinner?

253
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,350
We're going to have something nice.

254
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:04,519
Come with us.

255
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:12,419
Do you want some hand cream?

256
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:13,889
- Hand cream?
- Do this.

257
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:15,029
This?

258
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,259
Do it like this.

259
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,230
Doesn't it smell nice?

260
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:24,740
The food's already here.

261
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,539
You're right. That was quick.

262
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,740
Jeong Hoon, listen to this.

263
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:34,350
Ha Jin said she slapped
your team leader on purpose.

264
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:36,950
She said he was being so annoying.

265
00:14:37,649 --> 00:14:40,820
You told me about him before.

266
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,590
Is he really that bad?

267
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:46,059
You'll understand me
once you get to know him.

268
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:48,429
He's so pesky.

269
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:52,100
It must've felt great to slap him.

270
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,899
Extremely.
I was waiting for my chance.

271
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,899
I think you have a call.

272
00:14:57,899 --> 00:14:59,299
Oh, excuse me.

273
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,309
It's my sister. I'll be back.

274
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,950
She's so cheerful.

275
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:14,289
I bet she makes everyone
around her laugh a lot.

276
00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:17,320
I haven't seen you laugh this much
in a long time.

277
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:18,789
Really?

278
00:15:19,289 --> 00:15:23,789
Then don't you think it'd be nice
to meet up like this more often?

279
00:15:26,029 --> 00:15:27,429
Are you sure you're all right?

280
00:15:27,429 --> 00:15:29,970
I'm totally fine.

281
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,269
When you become my age,
every day becomes boring.

282
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:36,110
You know you can't lie to me.

283
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,909
What is it?

284
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,509
Later.

285
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:43,980
I'll tell you everything later.

286
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:48,590
I've always kept my word.

287
00:15:50,289 --> 00:15:51,360
I promise...

288
00:15:52,289 --> 00:15:53,720
to tell you later.

289
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:55,429
Really.

290
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,070
Okay. Let's eat.

291
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:08,110
Gosh, it's been a while
since I had steak.

292
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,409
Wait. I'll cut it for you.

293
00:16:11,909 --> 00:16:14,450
Yes. I'm having a meal
with Anchor Lee and his mother.

294
00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:17,720
No, it's not uncomfortable at all.

295
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,149
She's really nice.

296
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,519
Okay. I'll be back soon.

297
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:25,419
Okay. I got it.

298
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,720
Okay.

299
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,129
Here you go.

300
00:16:42,509 --> 00:16:44,639
I had such a nice meal
thanks to you.

301
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,840
Please let me treat you
to a meal next time.

302
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,250
Will you?

303
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:51,419
Then, I should have
a really expensive meal then.

304
00:16:51,419 --> 00:16:53,279
Please do. I have a lot of money.

305
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:57,690
I'm laughing a lot
thanks to you today.

306
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,519
Let me.

307
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,529
Okay.

308
00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:03,960
I have a way with scarves.

309
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:05,599
I know about ten different ways
of wearing them.

310
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,930
And I'll use the most beautiful
way of wearing a scarf.

311
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,470
I should learn them
from you sometime.

312
00:17:12,269 --> 00:17:13,640
There you go.

313
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:17,940
I see. I didn't know
you could wear it like this.

314
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,109
This looks beautiful.

315
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,910
Jeong Hoon, what do you think?
Doesn't this look nice?

316
00:17:23,779 --> 00:17:26,579
Is it any different?
They look all the same to me.

317
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,720
My goodness.

318
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,720
This is why having a son is no fun.

319
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:36,660
Ha Jin, do you want
to take a photo with me?

320
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,559
It would look really nice
if we take it over there.

321
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,200
Yes. Sounds great.

322
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,470
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

323
00:17:49,539 --> 00:17:51,309
You're the photographer.

324
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,279
I was the photographer?

325
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,079
- Of course.
- Of course.

326
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:04,720
All right.

327
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,720
In 1, 2, 3.

328
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:09,759
Ta-da.

329
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:12,460
If you want, I'd love to take
a photo for you guys.

330
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:15,529
Yes. That sounds great.
Please take a photo of us.

331
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:17,000
Jeong Hoon, come over here.

332
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:18,039
Hurry.

333
00:18:21,369 --> 00:18:22,869
I'll take it now.

334
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:25,410
In 1, 2, 3.

335
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:33,519
We have to mark the spot
for surgery tomorrow,

336
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:35,519
so you have an endoscopy.

337
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:38,720
You can't leave the hospital
without permission again like today.

338
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,819
You know that, right?

339
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:41,289
Okay.

340
00:18:41,589 --> 00:18:43,859
I don't need to leave
the hospital now.

341
00:18:43,859 --> 00:18:45,059
I'll believe you.

342
00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:47,559
I haven't seen many patients...

343
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:49,529
getting surgery after going through
stage four chemotherapy.

344
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:50,930
That's really impressive.

345
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:53,869
You just need this surgery
to go well.

346
00:18:53,869 --> 00:18:55,569
Hang in there a bit more.

347
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:58,039
Okay. Thank you.

348
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,230
You ate a lot today.

349
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,930
Shouldn't we go for a run
before going to sleep?

350
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,670
I'll do it if you let me eat
late-night snacks.

351
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,700
What?

352
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:26,900
Do I need to come tomorrow
at the same time as today?

353
00:19:27,269 --> 00:19:29,640
Well, I'll just drive her around.

354
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,440
- Take a day off tomorrow.
- Okay.

355
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,579
You'll be back
after the news, right?

356
00:19:32,579 --> 00:19:33,809
Yes, I should.

357
00:19:33,809 --> 00:19:35,150
Good job today. Go home now.

358
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:37,109
Okay. Call me if you have a problem.

359
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:38,250
Okay. Bye.

360
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,019
I want fried chicken.

361
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,450
Go get changed.

362
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:43,950
Where? To go for a run.

363
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,339
Be careful.

364
00:20:09,049 --> 00:20:11,680
I think I dropped it
somewhere over here.

365
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,180
(Anchor Lee's Day)

366
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:48,390
(Anchor Lee usually listens
during the meeting.)

367
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:49,650
(After the meeting, he checks
articles and writes lines.)

368
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:52,289
(He always uses the same pen
when he works.)

369
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:15,609
He always uses the same pen
when he works.

370
00:21:16,049 --> 00:21:19,619
Look at you acting all cool
in front of your girlfriend.

371
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:21,920
What's wrong with him?

372
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,049
I have no idea either.

373
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,460
What are you writing so secretively?

374
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,829
Nothing.

375
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:33,700
The person that annoys him the most
is Team Leader Kim Chul Woong.

376
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,230
I can tell that he's thinking
about punching the guy.

377
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:39,839
Then, what should I do?

378
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:41,539
Are you asking me
because you don't know?

379
00:21:41,539 --> 00:21:43,569
Or because you're testing me
to see if I can get it right?

380
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,880
Of course, I know what to do.

381
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,150
He hates it the most when people
ask him what they should do.

382
00:22:19,009 --> 00:22:21,650
After having lunch,
he always drinks an Americano.

383
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,559
When he's done with the news,

384
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:38,160
he stays in the green room
and is the last one to leave.

385
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,900
He looks so lonely when he's alone.

386
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:57,309
You're here.

387
00:22:58,049 --> 00:22:59,349
Let's talk.

388
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:13,759
Where did you find that?

389
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:16,299
I looked everywhere,
but I couldn't find it.

390
00:23:23,539 --> 00:23:26,039
Did you read this?

391
00:23:29,549 --> 00:23:31,079
I was just...

392
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,720
Don't get the wrong idea.
It didn't mean anything.

393
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:36,490
I hope you're not upset.

394
00:23:36,819 --> 00:23:38,049
I won't get the wrong idea.

395
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:39,589
And I'm not upset either.

396
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,529
I'm just uncomfortable
about this kind of situation.

397
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,400
I hate that you're walking
on eggshells around me...

398
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,000
because of my condition.

399
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,599
I've had this condition
for a long time.

400
00:23:52,339 --> 00:23:54,140
And I'm used to this.

401
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:57,039
So you don't need
to try hard for my sake.

402
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:00,039
I wasn't trying hard.

403
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:04,680
To be honest, when I found out
about your condition,

404
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,890
I just thought
that I got to know you a bit more.

405
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,920
That's not true. It got harder.

406
00:24:13,289 --> 00:24:15,230
I studied
and kept thinking about it,

407
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,390
but I still don't know...

408
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:22,130
how it must feel to live
with all the memories one has.

409
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,799
On one side, I'm jealous.

410
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:30,640
And on the other side, I feel bad.

411
00:24:34,109 --> 00:24:37,250
I'm sorry. I won't write notes
if this upsets you.

412
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,319
But please don't
misunderstand my intention.

413
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,619
I'm doing this for me, not for you.

414
00:24:45,019 --> 00:24:46,490
I can forget about other things,

415
00:24:47,859 --> 00:24:51,160
but I really want to remember
everything about you.

416
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,130
I don't want to forget anything
when it comes to you.

417
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:36,109
Why isn't he answering his phone?

418
00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:42,380
Why are you still here?

419
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,980
Chul was supposed to come,
but he's not coming.

420
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,380
And he's not answering either.

421
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,250
What about your sister?

422
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:51,119
She left earlier because
she had an important meeting.

423
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:53,359
That's why
Chul was supposed to come.

424
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,589
Chul must be here.

425
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:58,660
Hey, Chul.

426
00:26:00,329 --> 00:26:02,769
What? Why can't you come?
Where are you?

427
00:26:04,569 --> 00:26:06,539
Okay. I understand.

428
00:26:07,539 --> 00:26:08,970
No, I'll manage.

429
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:10,940
Okay.

430
00:26:13,779 --> 00:26:15,480
Hop in. I'll give you a ride.

431
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,210
It's okay. I'll take a taxi.

432
00:26:17,349 --> 00:26:20,049
My friend got hospitalized,
so I have to go to the hospital.

433
00:26:21,049 --> 00:26:22,049
Get in.

434
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:29,190
Thank you.

435
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:31,730
I'm sorry you had to do this
instead of going home.

436
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:32,900
It's okay.

437
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:36,599
Does he break his promise
very often? Your manager, I mean.

438
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:39,670
Oh, we told him before
to take today off,

439
00:26:39,769 --> 00:26:42,140
so I guess he was
hanging out somewhere far away.

440
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:44,109
He's usually not like that.
He's very diligent.

441
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,240
Really?

442
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,640
Right.

443
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,349
Ta-da. I bought this.
Your mother's poetry book.

444
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,250
That was published a while ago.
How did you find it?

445
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:57,819
I got curious and looked for it
right away as soon as I met her.

446
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:00,759
I don't know much about poetry,
but I loved it.

447
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:02,190
I instantly became her fan.

448
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:05,400
If I get to meet her again,
I'll ask her for an autograph.

449
00:27:06,829 --> 00:27:08,200
She'll be thrilled.

450
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:10,799
She looks a lot like you.

451
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,170
Especially the way you smile.

452
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,140
I'm sure you only have
good memories of her.

453
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,509
You're right.

454
00:27:20,609 --> 00:27:22,009
She always...

455
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,319
gave me nothing but good memories
since when I was a kid.

456
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:30,490
(Soojeong University Hospital)

457
00:27:32,089 --> 00:27:34,960
Thank you for the ride.
Go home safely.

458
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,089
Will you be all right by yourself?

459
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,759
There are a lot of people.

460
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,839
What's wrong?

461
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,809
(Father)

462
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,450
Anchor Lee.

463
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:05,420
(We thank Shin Dong Mi, Kim Nam Hui
for their guest appearance.)

464
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,029
(Find Me in Your Memory)

465
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:23,400
Can you fix my disease?

466
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:27,170
Anchor Lee, time can't help you.

467
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:29,039
Just keep your eyes on him.

468
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,069
Keep my eyes on him?

469
00:29:30,069 --> 00:29:32,039
I can't
let Jeong Hoon get destroyed.

470
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:34,440
What on earth happened to Mom?

471
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,250
She wanted this.

472
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,750
She felt too bad for you.

473
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:40,420
She did this out of love.

474
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:44,349
I'm so happy
that you're with me, Jeong Hoon.

475
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:46,420
Are you sure that you were happy?

476
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:49,289
It's okay, Jeong Hoon.
It'll be fine.
