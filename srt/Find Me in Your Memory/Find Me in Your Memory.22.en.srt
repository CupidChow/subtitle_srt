1
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:03,410
Thanks for making time for me.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,110
Don't mention it.

3
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:06,750
How's the result?

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,609
No one would find any difference...

5
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:10,619
even if we switched this
with the previous result.

6
00:00:11,449 --> 00:00:13,550
There are no new anomalies.

7
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:15,089
Everything looks clean.

8
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:18,620
Just think of this
as your regular checkup.

9
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,460
I mean, some people
put aside time to do this.

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,699
- All right.
- Do you have some time today?

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,730
Yes, I can spare some time.

12
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,899
Then let's have a chat for once.

13
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:41,049
When did we first meet?

14
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,420
October 17, 1995.

15
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:48,649
It was a rainy Tuesday.

16
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,789
When you were young,

17
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:53,289
you were the most scared of...

18
00:00:53,729 --> 00:00:56,159
getting locked up in your closet.

19
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:57,859
Are you still scared of that?

20
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:03,369
Dad, I'm sorry.

21
00:01:03,369 --> 00:01:07,269
Please open this. Dad.

22
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:08,840
Lee Jeong Hoon!

23
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:10,379
Why won't you listen to me?

24
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:13,609
Dad, I'm sorry.

25
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,709
Please let me out.

26
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:17,719
Be quiet!

27
00:01:19,819 --> 00:01:21,049
Dad!

28
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:24,920
Dad! Dad!

29
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,920
Yes.

30
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,359
I know it's embarrassing, but I am.

31
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:34,299
What about regarding Seo Yeon?

32
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:40,909
Are your memories and feelings
about her the same?

33
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:58,590
The images
are still very vivid to me.

34
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,730
I see.

35
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:02,730
To be honest,

36
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,599
I was meaning to ask you this
for some time now.

37
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,639
But I felt hesitant to ask
about your private life.

38
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,099
That's okay.

39
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:17,009
Is it true
that you and Yeo Ha Jin...

40
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:20,080
are in a serious relationship?

41
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,319
Yes, it's true.

42
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,020
But you'll never be able
to forget Seo Yeon.

43
00:02:29,689 --> 00:02:34,090
How could you start
a new relationship in that state?

44
00:02:34,289 --> 00:02:35,659
Is it actually possible?

45
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,129
I'm just surprised, that's all.

46
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,400
I'm going to try to work it out.

47
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,469
She's someone dear to me.

48
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:54,210
I don't want to live
the rest of my life in regret.

49
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,050
Is that so?

50
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,020
All right.

51
00:02:59,449 --> 00:03:02,990
You look happy, so I'm relieved.

52
00:03:04,789 --> 00:03:05,819
I'm glad.

53
00:03:06,789 --> 00:03:07,789
Thank you.

54
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:13,800
What do you think?

55
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:19,099
("The Man Who Cannot Forget")

56
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:20,770
I like this one the best.

57
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:24,379
Okay, we'll use this.

58
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:25,379
All right.

59
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:28,610
How long will it take
to finalize your manuscript?

60
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:31,719
Well, I think I'll need
a few more weeks.

61
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:32,819
Oh, right.

62
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:36,090
You wrote about a patient.

63
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,960
The renowned news anchor
who suffers from hyperthymesia.

64
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,460
I can understand
that you can't reveal his name,

65
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,500
but it would be nice
to offer more details about him.

66
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,530
I think
it's already detailed enough.

67
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:50,639
There are two factors that'll grab
your readers' attention.

68
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,699
One, the fact
that he's a real-life individual.

69
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,169
Two, the fact
that due to his illness,

70
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:59,539
he's still living in pain
from the memories of his first love.

71
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:01,650
And for eight years, at that.

72
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:04,379
When I had first read
your manuscript,

73
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:06,379
an individual came to my mind.

74
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,620
Anchor Lee Jeong Hoon.

75
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:11,719
But we all know
that he's dating Yeo Ha Jin.

76
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,790
In that case, I can't think
of anyone else.

77
00:04:17,629 --> 00:04:19,860
I'm afraid your readers
will find it odd as well.

78
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,810
You must be busy.
You should head back in.

79
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:31,610
Good work today.

80
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:32,839
- I'll call you.
- Sure.

81
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,120
You can't do that.

82
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,319
How could you date someone new?

83
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,959
That's not right.

84
00:04:49,129 --> 00:04:51,060
You aren't capable of doing that.

85
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:57,139
But you'll never be able
to forget Seo Yeon.

86
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,610
How could you start
a new relationship in that state?

87
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,040
Is it actually possible?

88
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:09,550
Hey, Tae Eun.

89
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,050
What do you think?

90
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:16,120
It suits you. Not only will you be
the nation's first love...

91
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,920
but also the nation's news anchor.

92
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:19,589
- Really?
- Yes.

93
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:21,160
Why don't we take a photo?

94
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,589
Sure, that'd be lovely.

95
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:25,500
Let's take a photo to commemorate
your first lead role.

96
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:28,170
Try this on. Let's create a theme.

97
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,970
Why would I wear your clothes?
Forget it.

98
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,069
Come on, I think
it'll look good on you. Go on.

99
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,370
Ms. Park, try this on.

100
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,540
Oh, please. It won't even fit.

101
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,639
Come on.

102
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,750
Should I give it a try?
I do like the color.

103
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,610
It looks good on you.

104
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,319
You look wonderful. Put yours on.

105
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:48,550
It's okay.
I'll take a photo of you two.

106
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,220
Let's take it together.

107
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,720
Hurry up and pose.

108
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:53,589
It's going to be one-take.

109
00:05:54,329 --> 00:05:55,389
Okay.

110
00:05:56,629 --> 00:05:57,829
That's good.

111
00:05:58,259 --> 00:05:59,899
You look great.

112
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:03,769
Done.

113
00:06:03,769 --> 00:06:05,100
- It came out nicely.
- Let me see.

114
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,100
Look.

115
00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:09,839
Look at how pretty we look.

116
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:11,110
You're right.

117
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,009
Ms. Park, you got a call.

118
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,110
Oh, dear. I completely forgot.

119
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:17,379
I have a meeting to attend.

120
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:18,649
Ma'am, the jacket.

121
00:06:18,649 --> 00:06:19,850
Right.

122
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,089
- Bye, then.
- Goodbye.

123
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:25,759
Try that one on.

124
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,889
- This yellow one?
- Yes.

125
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:29,730
Did you leave...

126
00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:35,500
Get out this instant!

127
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,139
Chul.

128
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,269
I'm truly sorry.

129
00:06:44,209 --> 00:06:45,480
I really am.

130
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,449
How dare you come here?
Do you have no shame?

131
00:06:48,649 --> 00:06:50,720
I know that I can't be forgiven.

132
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:55,019
But I couldn't deal with the guilt,
so I decided to come here.

133
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,420
I'm sorry.

134
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,990
This won't work.

135
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:01,529
I know you just want us
to lessen your punishment.

136
00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:03,160
That's not true.

137
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,300
I'm just here to sincerely apologize
for what I've done.

138
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,199
I'm truly sorry.

139
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:10,899
I couldn't handle the debt.

140
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:13,670
- The debt?
- My father suddenly passed away,

141
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,769
and his debt kept increasing
no matter how much I tried.

142
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,449
About Chul...

143
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:27,620
Don't you dare mention lessening
his punishment. That's absurd.

144
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,819
But I feel bad for him.

145
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:31,589
You know he's a goodhearted kid.

146
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,629
What kind of a goodhearted person
deceives and steals from others?

147
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,399
He seems to be repenting a lot.

148
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,730
How will his family manage
if he's put behind bars?

149
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:44,470
I'm not buying it.
Don't you ever mention him again.

150
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:56,050
I guess my father called you over.

151
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:57,949
Yes.

152
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:02,220
Next time he calls, say no.
You don't have to listen to him.

153
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,120
But I have to listen to you?

154
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,060
No, you don't have
to listen to me either.

155
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:10,829
When you were young, hypnotherapy,

156
00:08:10,829 --> 00:08:14,000
medication, and counseling may have
helped you, but not anymore.

157
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,370
Your determination
is what put you here.

158
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,310
You need neither my father
nor my help anymore.

159
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:24,209
So don't listen to us.

160
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:27,079
There's nothing difficult
about receiving a checkup.

161
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:30,720
And I'll be forever grateful to him.

162
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,620
That'll never change.

163
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,690
So was the checkup
all that you received?

164
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,120
Did he have any other questions?

165
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:43,090
He asked about Ha Jin.

166
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,799
He asked if we were serious.

167
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,000
He had asked me
several times before.

168
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:55,240
I think he's been watching the news.
You don't have to explain it to him.

169
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,379
We are in a serious relationship.

170
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:03,919
What do you mean?

171
00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:05,320
It's exactly what I said.

172
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,049
Don't you know her condition?

173
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:11,659
Her memories might come back...

174
00:09:11,659 --> 00:09:13,889
if you remain by her side.

175
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:16,429
I know. I know that.

176
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:20,059
But I don't want to shun her
because of that.

177
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,429
Even if her memories come back
and she struggles,

178
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:23,940
I'm going to be there for her.

179
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,110
I've given this a lot of thought.

180
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,049
Among all the decisions
you've made to this day,

181
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:39,879
I had never gone against any.

182
00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:43,590
Because you were
a cautious and wise individual.

183
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:47,360
But not this time.

184
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,960
You don't seem like
the Jeong Hoon I know.

185
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:53,299
That's because I did change.

186
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:57,639
I'm not going
to hide in fear anymore.

187
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:08,549
Doctor, Ms. Oh Mi Young
is waiting for you.

188
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,379
I'll let you go back to work.
I'll call you.

189
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:26,929
Oh, hi. How's the hangover?

190
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,769
It's fine,
but I don't remember much.

191
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:34,210
How did I go home?

192
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:37,039
I carried you home, of course.

193
00:10:37,409 --> 00:10:38,539
Seriously?

194
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:42,379
How could you have carried me
with that tiny body of yours?

195
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:47,320
Don't you ever boast
about drinking well, got it?

196
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,190
I'm sorry.

197
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,090
I didn't make any mistakes, did I?

198
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:55,360
No... No, you didn't.

199
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,429
Really? I'm glad.

200
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,299
Will you be working out today?

201
00:11:00,929 --> 00:11:02,570
Yes, I will.

202
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,970
Then I'll see you
around the same time as yesterday.

203
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:06,299
All right.

204
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:17,919
You're so tiny...

205
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,320
and cute.

206
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,570
Why do I keep thinking about her?

207
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,740
I must have had too many drinks.
Goodness.

208
00:11:44,909 --> 00:11:47,039
My entire body aches.

209
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:49,580
I should ask her
to go easy on me today.

210
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:52,419
I'm sorry for calling you
all of a sudden like this.

211
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:56,789
No, it's all right. Actually,
I wanted to get some fresh air.

212
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,659
But I hope everything is okay.

213
00:12:01,629 --> 00:12:03,889
I was just a bit worried.

214
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:07,159
You recently went through
something traumatic.

215
00:12:07,429 --> 00:12:10,230
I was worried if it took
a psychological toll on you.

216
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,639
And I was wondering
if you needed my help.

217
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,210
I'm okay now.

218
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:16,940
It's all in the past.

219
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:18,809
I'm glad to hear that.

220
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:22,250
Right. If you need help later,
feel free to call me.

221
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,450
Thank you, doctor.

222
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:32,789
The other day,
we talked about your dream.

223
00:12:32,789 --> 00:12:34,429
You said you had a weird dream.

224
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:36,960
Did you have a similar dream
like that ever since then?

225
00:12:39,429 --> 00:12:42,070
I did have similar dreams
after the first one.

226
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:45,940
But I'm really fine these days.

227
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:49,110
Thanks to Anchor Lee,
I'm really happy.

228
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,909
- I see.
- If you aren't too busy,

229
00:12:51,909 --> 00:12:52,980
we should meet up together.

230
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,080
We can get
something delicious and talk.

231
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:56,610
Sure.

232
00:13:09,659 --> 00:13:11,899
(First Date, 7:40 a.m.)

233
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:19,570
Who is it this early in the morning?

234
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,340
It's for me!

235
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,639
It's for me. Don't touch it!

236
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:29,950
My goodness. What on earth is it?

237
00:13:31,149 --> 00:13:32,620
What did you buy this time?

238
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,950
Some stuff.

239
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:37,019
I thought you were going
on a date with Anchor Lee today.

240
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,889
You said it was
your official first date.

241
00:13:39,659 --> 00:13:40,929
Yes, that's right.

242
00:13:40,929 --> 00:13:42,559
Can you help me move them?

243
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,299
I decided on my wish.

244
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:56,169
Today, you have to do
everything I ask you to do.

245
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:59,980
She's making me anxious.

246
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:05,279
I'm in front of your house.
Open the door for me.

247
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:14,460
What's going on?

248
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,830
We were supposed to meet
two hours later.

249
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:19,029
I need water.
Could you give me a cup of water?

250
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:20,799
Water? Okay.

251
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,240
Here.

252
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,879
What's all this?

253
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:35,110
Open them now.

254
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:43,049
Presents.

255
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,860
They are all yours.

256
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:49,029
What are...

257
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,610
Don't you think
you'd look great in these?

258
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:05,340
It's perfect on you. Right?

259
00:15:05,809 --> 00:15:07,139
I'm not sure.

260
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,110
I don't know.

261
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:11,120
That was made for you.

262
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,750
Put that one. And what else
will look good with that?

263
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,450
And try them with this.

264
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:19,990
Put them on now?

265
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:22,389
Yes, it's my wish.

266
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:25,860
Wait. Have you been hating
my outfits all this time?

267
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,230
You did talk about my tie
when you were on my show.

268
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:29,769
Are you giving me
a wardrobe makeover?

269
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:31,399
It's not that.

270
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,470
It's our first date.

271
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:35,509
There's this place
I really want to go,

272
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:37,679
but I don't want people
to recognize us.

273
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:40,009
If you go out dressed like that,
people will spot us in five minutes.

274
00:15:40,009 --> 00:15:41,610
It'll be so easy to recognize you.

275
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,549
Think of this as a type of disguise.

276
00:15:43,549 --> 00:15:45,720
I don't think that will work on me.

277
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,850
Trust me on this.

278
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:49,320
People won't recognize you at all.
I assure you.

279
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,519
Besides, you're supposed to do
whatever I ask of you today.

280
00:15:54,789 --> 00:15:56,129
Hurry and get changed.

281
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,429
I did have a bad feeling about it.

282
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:09,909
I really don't think
this is working.

283
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,110
Let's try the next outfit.

284
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,289
Is it supposed to look like this?

285
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,700
What do you say? Do you like it?

286
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:35,730
The last one.

287
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:38,470
- Another one?
- It's the last one.

288
00:16:53,549 --> 00:16:54,789
See?

289
00:16:54,789 --> 00:16:57,490
I bet you also think
this color stands out too much.

290
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:00,659
No, I'm looking at you
because it looks great on you.

291
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:03,059
From now on,
wear an outfit like this.

292
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:05,299
It lightens up your looks
and makes you look more dashing.

293
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:08,000
I really think you're teasing me.

294
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,799
No, I'm not.

295
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,900
By the way,

296
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:14,809
what is this place
you wanted to go on a date?

297
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:18,009
Oh, that.
You'll know once we get there.

298
00:17:18,509 --> 00:17:21,079
I daresay
you never thought of this place.

299
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,109
All of a sudden, you're scaring me.

300
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,019
Was going on dates supposed
to be full of thrill like this?

301
00:17:27,019 --> 00:17:28,750
I'm really excited.

302
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:43,470
Is this the place
you wanted to come on a date?

303
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:44,470
Yes.

304
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,369
I don't see anything special here.

305
00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:50,309
Isn't the cherry blossom path
just so gorgeous?

306
00:17:50,309 --> 00:17:51,609
Whenever I passed by here in a car,

307
00:17:51,609 --> 00:17:54,039
I saw couples holding hands here.

308
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:55,849
I was really jealous of them.

309
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,180
What is it?

310
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,019
Were you disappointed
because it's too plain?

311
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:04,619
No.

312
00:18:05,789 --> 00:18:07,359
I would not have thought
of this place.

313
00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:08,859
I like it.

314
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,029
Let's get off now.

315
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,730
Right. Hold on.

316
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:17,099
Just in case.

317
00:18:23,809 --> 00:18:25,180
There.

318
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:27,849
Let's go.

319
00:18:58,079 --> 00:18:59,640
The weather is great today.

320
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,640
Right?

321
00:19:02,109 --> 00:19:03,579
Hey, it's them.

322
00:19:03,579 --> 00:19:06,250
- My goodness.
- Gosh.

323
00:19:07,349 --> 00:19:09,650
Isn't that Yeo Ha Jin?
Isn't that Anchor Lee Jeong Hoon?

324
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,220
I don't believe this. No way!

325
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:13,119
My goodness!

326
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:15,960
- You guys look great together!
- You look great together!

327
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:17,589
Let's go.

328
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:20,099
That was quicker than I expected.

329
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:21,670
Right.

330
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:26,640
We should give up on this path.
Let's go back to the car.

331
00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:31,710
You said you really wanted
to walk this path.

332
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:35,210
But people can recognize us.

333
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:36,549
Let them, then.

334
00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:39,450
There's no reason why we must hide.

335
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,960
Let's go.

336
00:20:27,099 --> 00:20:28,900
This is beautiful.

337
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,769
This is how it feels
to see it up close.

338
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,500
What do you say?
Isn't this worth it?

339
00:20:35,339 --> 00:20:36,369
It's nice.

340
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:39,779
I only saw cherry blossoms
on the news every year.

341
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,480
Let's come back and see
the cherry blossoms every spring.

342
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:45,750
Yes.

343
00:20:54,259 --> 00:20:55,660
What are you thinking?

344
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,400
That it's unfair.

345
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,160
What's unfair?

346
00:21:01,099 --> 00:21:02,430
Come to think of it,

347
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:05,970
I granted you
more than just one wish today.

348
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:08,269
I had to try on
so many different outfits.

349
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:10,809
Do you really think
it's that unfair?

350
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:13,640
But sorry, it's too late.

351
00:21:13,809 --> 00:21:15,210
You can't take it back.

352
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:16,910
Instead,

353
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,420
grant me a wish too.

354
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,190
That's so cheap.

355
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,420
Fine, what is it?

356
00:21:27,289 --> 00:21:29,089
No matter what happens,

357
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,529
don't ever say goodbye.

358
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,430
That's my wish.

359
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:44,109
I'll probably do it anyway
even if you didn't wish for that.

360
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:48,849
Okay, then. I'll do that.

361
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:55,390
You promised.

362
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:58,759
Okay. I promise.

363
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,250
Go inside.

364
00:22:57,509 --> 00:22:59,950
Okay. Call me when you get home.

365
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:02,619
Okay. You should go in.

366
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,920
Anchor Lee, give me your phone.

367
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,930
My phone?

368
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:12,160
- Why do you want my phone?
- It'll take only a second.

369
00:23:25,009 --> 00:23:27,640
You can't change that
without my permission, okay?

370
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,809
Okay. Go in and get some rest.

371
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,619
Okay, I'm really going in.

372
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:21,900
This is bad.

373
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:25,200
I miss him already.

374
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,519
(Incoming video call: Ha Jin)

375
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,960
What is this?

376
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,690
(Incoming video call: Ha Jin)

377
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:53,900
(Incoming video call: Ha Jin)

378
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:57,470
Yes, Ha Jin.

379
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:00,900
What were you up to?
Thinking about me?

380
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:02,740
I was just...

381
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:04,940
looking up some news articles.

382
00:25:06,009 --> 00:25:09,809
Oh, I see. I was thinking about you.

383
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,819
You didn't text me
after you got home,

384
00:25:12,819 --> 00:25:14,250
so I called because I missed you.

385
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:18,220
I was about to text you.

386
00:25:19,859 --> 00:25:21,019
Why are you laughing?

387
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:24,660
I was wondering
how you could be so honest.

388
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:28,599
Now that I told you that honestly,
can you raise up your camera?

389
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:29,869
I can't really see you.

390
00:25:34,269 --> 00:25:35,369
Like this?

391
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:39,140
No, not like that.
About 45 degrees up.

392
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:40,710
About 45 degrees.

393
00:25:42,509 --> 00:25:43,549
Like this?

394
00:25:45,049 --> 00:25:46,849
Can we just talk on the phone?

395
00:25:46,849 --> 00:25:48,849
It's a bit awkward
to be on a video call.

396
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:52,359
No. Then stay still.
I'll just find a way to look at you.

397
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:58,089
Right, did you see how
I changed my name on your phone?

398
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:00,799
You can't change that
without my permission.

399
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:04,329
I'm the only one
who sees this phone anyway.

400
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,769
Is it that important?

401
00:26:05,769 --> 00:26:06,970
Of course, it is.

402
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:09,609
Of all people,
you'll be seeing my name like that.

403
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:11,539
"Yeo Ha Jin"? That's so cold.

404
00:26:11,539 --> 00:26:12,910
You might end up
losing the love you had.

405
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,009
How did you store my name?

406
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,380
"Anchor Lee".

407
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:20,049
It doesn't sound
that different from mine.

408
00:26:20,049 --> 00:26:21,420
It's completely different.

409
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,819
I put hearts surrounding your name,

410
00:26:23,819 --> 00:26:25,059
and two each.

411
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,220
I like calling you Anchor Lee.

412
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:32,630
In dramas, I've seen people called
as a general manager or a director,

413
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:34,630
but never an anchor.

414
00:26:35,269 --> 00:26:37,069
Okay, do whatever you want.

415
00:26:38,369 --> 00:26:39,440
Get some rest, then.

416
00:26:39,569 --> 00:26:40,740
Are you hanging up already?

417
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:43,440
Oh, it's not like that.

418
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,670
Do you not want to talk to me?

419
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:47,740
Yeo Ha Jin! Look at your room.

420
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,450
It's like a pigsty.
Is this a pigsty?

421
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:53,180
Ha Kyung, later. Do that later.

422
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,289
- It's nothing.
- Look at your outfit.

423
00:26:55,289 --> 00:26:57,289
- I'll call you again.
- Anchor Lee, look at this.

424
00:26:57,289 --> 00:26:58,490
Look at this.

425
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,490
Hey. I'll call you again. Sorry.

426
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:03,359
Hello, viewers.

427
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:05,299
This is "Yeo Ha Jin's Dirty Room".

428
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,400
Make sure you keep your promise.

429
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,329
Goodnight.

430
00:27:14,069 --> 00:27:15,269
- Hey.
- What?

431
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:16,839
You need to knock.
Show some manners.

432
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:19,380
"Manners"? I was going out
to eat something delicious,

433
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,339
so I thought I'd ask you to come,
but forget it.

434
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:23,549
Where are you going?
I'll go with you.

435
00:27:23,549 --> 00:27:25,450
If you come out in 10 minutes
after cleaning up your room.

436
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,750
I'll clean it up after we eat.

437
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:27,779
No.

438
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:30,220
You have 10 minutes!

439
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,200
(Tae Eun)

440
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,069
Can we meet for a second?
I have to talk to you.

441
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:44,630
It's about Ha Jin.

442
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:58,210
Wait.

443
00:28:08,529 --> 00:28:09,990
This is yours.

444
00:28:10,529 --> 00:28:13,259
These are mine. Don't touch mine.

445
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:16,900
Only if it wasn't past 10 p.m.,
I'd have a bite of each one.

446
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,170
That looks good.

447
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,200
This is good.

448
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,009
I'm so jealous.

449
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,910
I'm hungry.
I'm hungry. I'm so hungry.

450
00:28:29,049 --> 00:28:30,180
I'm hungry.

451
00:28:30,349 --> 00:28:32,119
- You can have a bite.
- Okay.

452
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:35,019
Hey, wait!
That's not a bite. Hands off.

453
00:28:35,019 --> 00:28:37,319
- You can't take it back.
- This is too big of a bite.

454
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:39,390
- My bite is that big.
- Hey. Hey.

455
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:41,930
Hey, wait.
I'm not doing this for myself.

456
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:44,130
Wait, think about this
one more time.

457
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:47,529
Wait. That's coffee. Wait.

458
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,299
Wait here. I'll bring the coffee.
Don't eat this.

459
00:28:50,569 --> 00:28:51,769
I have my eyes on you.

460
00:28:51,769 --> 00:28:54,099
- I'll keep watching you as I go.
- Trust me.

461
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:58,369
- Don't eat that.
- I won't.

462
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,720
- Ha Na. Over here.
- Yes?

463
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:15,130
Ha Na, you look so pretty.

464
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:17,630
- Don't say that.
- My gosh.

465
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:20,130
No way, you look much prettier now.

466
00:29:51,829 --> 00:29:54,630
Ha Jin. Ha Jin, what's wrong?
Are you feeling sick?

467
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,230
Do you have a headache?
How does it hurt?

468
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:00,900
This isn't good.
Let's go to the hospital.

469
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,509
What is it? Why did you
want to see me this late?

470
00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:07,940
You're here.

471
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:10,150
What is it?

472
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:12,849
There's something
I couldn't tell you.

473
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,019
Ha Kyung.

474
00:30:19,059 --> 00:30:20,519
Do you know who Yeong is?

475
00:30:24,829 --> 00:30:25,829
What?

476
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:28,329
You know that name, don't you?

477
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,170
Who's Yeong?

478
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:36,839
I'm sure you know.

479
00:30:37,809 --> 00:30:39,609
Tell me now. Please?

480
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:45,220
The reason why
Ha Jin was so tormented...

481
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,150
that she wanted to
take her own life.

482
00:30:51,589 --> 00:30:52,920
Yeong...

483
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:00,700
Yeong died because of me.

484
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:05,900
She died because of me.

485
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:44,710
(Find Me in Your Memory)

486
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,410
I want Ha Na to be happy again.

487
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:49,279
I want to tell Ha Jin that...

488
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,450
it was an accident.

489
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,650
She was murdered by her stalker.

490
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:54,250
Her name is Seo Yeon?

491
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:56,920
He's a guy who has
another person in his heart.

492
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,250
Can you really take him?

493
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:02,130
The time I spend with you is
very special.

494
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:03,829
I hope that's the case with you too.

495
00:32:03,829 --> 00:32:05,500
Is something going on
with Anchor Lee?

496
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,799
Do you want to
talk about Anchor Lee Jeong Hoon?

497
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:12,299
So you want to hear the truth?

498
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:15,369
I made Ha Na unhappy.
