00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,640
(Episode 21)

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,879
Welcome home, girls.

3
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:10,380
Gosh, Ms. Park.

4
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,080
This is why you told us
to come an hour later.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,849
Did you prepare all these yourself?

6
00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:15,890
I just blew up a few balloons,
that's all.

7
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,820
Goodness, how many balloons
did you blow up?

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,489
Ha Jin, do you like it?

9
00:00:19,489 --> 00:00:21,160
I love it.

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,629
Ms. Park, you must have taken
an interest in surprising people.

11
00:00:23,629 --> 00:00:24,730
Wait till you go upstairs.

12
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,329
I redecorated everything
just in case...

13
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:27,469
something brings back bad memories.

14
00:00:27,469 --> 00:00:29,870
Don't worry about that.
I already forgot everything.

15
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,460
What do you think?

16
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:54,729
It's so pretty.

17
00:00:54,729 --> 00:00:56,090
I like this much better than before.

18
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:57,500
I'm glad.

19
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,229
I put in a bit of an effort.

20
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,929
Get some rest. I need to take this.

21
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,709
Are you sure you're okay?

22
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:10,510
Of course. There's no reason
for me not to be okay.

23
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:12,939
You should unpack and get some rest.
I need to rest too.

24
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,150
Okay.

25
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:15,780
Get some rest.

26
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:52,719
Ha Jin.

27
00:01:53,849 --> 00:01:55,719
What's going on?
What's with that face?

28
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,359
- What is?
- You were making an odd face.

29
00:01:58,359 --> 00:01:59,760
You were touching your lips and all.

30
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,629
When? I didn't do that.

31
00:02:01,629 --> 00:02:02,730
You seem suspicious.

32
00:02:03,129 --> 00:02:04,500
Very suspicious.

33
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:07,700
No, it's nothing. What is it?

34
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,169
Right. We're getting
some sandwiches.

35
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:11,840
- Do you want one?
- Yes, I do.

36
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,240
Okay. Bacon and egg?

37
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,240
Yes.

38
00:02:56,979 --> 00:02:59,849
(Find Me in Your Memory)

39
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:28,110
What's the point of coming
to see me? It does nothing good.

40
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,349
You're only ruining my day.

41
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,580
What?

42
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,050
Did you want to see how frustrated
I was to be locked up here?

43
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:41,889
Too bad. I'm perfectly fine.

44
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,300
Ha Jin will come to me in the end...

45
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,439
once she finds out that you're
her best friend's boyfriend.

46
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:59,810
I'm here to tell you
there's nothing you can do in there.

47
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,180
Listen up.

48
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:07,719
First of all, you'll be in prison
a lot longer than you think.

49
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:09,349
I'll make that happen.

50
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,160
Who do you think you are?

51
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:22,029
No matter what you do,
I'll be released.

52
00:04:22,769 --> 00:04:24,500
The law works that way.

53
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,569
There's no way
you can keep me here forever.

54
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:30,509
Breaking and entering,
special violence,

55
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:31,939
confinement, kidnapping...

56
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:35,009
Those crimes may get you
three years in prison at most,

57
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:37,620
maybe even less.

58
00:04:38,649 --> 00:04:40,490
But do you really think that's all?

59
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,290
What are you trying to say?

60
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:45,259
What if you approached
Moon Seong Ho,

61
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:47,189
who was sentenced to life
for murder,

62
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,029
figured out his methods,

63
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,860
and tried to commit a copycat crime?

64
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,370
How will the law, the press,
and public opinion...

65
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:58,970
react to that?

66
00:05:01,269 --> 00:05:03,410
I'm different from that murderer.

67
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:06,040
All I wanted to do was
tell Ha Jin the truth...

68
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,350
and vow our love.

69
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,350
Do you think
people will believe that?

70
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,449
That's just one of
those delusions...

71
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:17,089
lunatics like Moon Seong Ho
and you have.

72
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,230
No, that's not true.

73
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,529
Never!

74
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:29,800
Fine. You don't have to
either admit it...

75
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,500
or apologize for it.

76
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:36,610
Just watch your life
get destroyed in there.

77
00:06:02,769 --> 00:06:04,000
Hello, Anchor Lee.

78
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,540
You were sleeping?

79
00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:11,779
This stuffed animal you gave me
is really effective.

80
00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:15,050
I hugged it for a second
and fell asleep right away.

81
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,319
I'm glad to hear that.

82
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:21,189
Did you get home safely?

83
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:22,420
Yes, I'm home now.

84
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:25,220
It's so nice to be back home.

85
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:27,759
Everything is finally over.

86
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:31,500
Are you on your way to work?

87
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:34,000
Yes, I am.

88
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,129
Go back to sleep then.

89
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,769
Hold on.

90
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:42,009
We can talk some more.
I've rested enough.

91
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,779
Can we meet today?

92
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:48,079
I really need your help
with my script.

93
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,550
The read-through is coming up.

94
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,319
All right.

95
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,620
But on weekdays,
I can only meet after the news.

96
00:06:55,819 --> 00:06:58,819
Is that okay with you?
It'll be pretty late.

97
00:06:59,089 --> 00:07:00,990
Don't worry, I'm a night owl.

98
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,129
Then shall we meet
after the news tonight?

99
00:07:04,129 --> 00:07:05,529
I'll come to you.

100
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,170
Okay, let's do that.

101
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:10,069
Drive safe. See you later.

102
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,740
I don't have time for this.

103
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,610
Sandwiches are here...

104
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:27,519
What are you doing?
You're going somewhere?

105
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,189
I'm meeting Anchor Lee
for some practice later.

106
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,589
- When?
- After his news.

107
00:07:32,589 --> 00:07:34,389
It's only 10 a.m.

108
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:37,060
You have 14 hours, and you're
already picking out an outfit?

109
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,930
I want to get a head start.

110
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,899
You're going to make a mess
for the next 14 hours, aren't you?

111
00:07:43,069 --> 00:07:44,139
The thing is...

112
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,500
Come here.

113
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,310
What? What is it now?

114
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:53,879
It's happening for real.

115
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:55,279
What do you mean?

116
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:57,620
Anchor Lee and I are dating
for real now.

117
00:07:58,949 --> 00:07:59,949
You are?

118
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,649
It's true.

119
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:04,620
Sure. Just don't go overboard
and get dumped later.

120
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,420
I'm sure of it. Believe me.

121
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,790
It's happening for real, I swear.

122
00:08:10,129 --> 00:08:11,699
What are you doing with your lips?

123
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,370
What? What happened between you two?

124
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:18,170
You guys kissed?

125
00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:27,180
That hurts!

126
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:32,179
That's what happened.

127
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,399
Are you in the lobby yet?

128
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
The cafe in the lobby has
amazing honey black tea.

129
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,769
I highly recommend it.
Get a cup on your way.

130
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,139
Have a nice day. See you later.

131
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,440
I almost forgot.
If you run into Mr. Kim,

132
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,110
please thank him for visiting me
in the hospital the other day.

133
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,820
(Please thank him for visiting me
in the hospital the other day.)

134
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:11,889
Gosh, this is unbelievable.

135
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,629
After all this wait,

136
00:09:14,789 --> 00:09:16,889
you finally won his heart.

137
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,460
It'd be more accurate to say...

138
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:22,070
that Anchor Lee finally realized
his feelings.

139
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,740
So? Are you happy?

140
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,070
Yes, I really am.

141
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,379
Right, weren't you and Mr. Jo
going to work out together?

142
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,179
When are you starting?
Your shoulder is fine now.

143
00:09:34,179 --> 00:09:35,850
We're starting today.

144
00:09:37,549 --> 00:09:38,850
Be honest.

145
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:41,090
Is something going on
between you two?

146
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,519
What are you talking about?

147
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:46,960
He got dumped because
he's too weak, so I'm helping him.

148
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:48,490
Really?

149
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:51,629
I think you two would make
a cute couple. Too bad.

150
00:09:51,629 --> 00:09:53,899
Don't be ridiculous.

151
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:57,600
Do you really think...

152
00:09:58,769 --> 00:09:59,799
we'd make a cute couple?

153
00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:01,809
He and I?

154
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:04,009
Yes, I do.

155
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,240
I see.

156
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:07,879
Well...

157
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,850
Why? What makes you think so?

158
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,620
You two have the ideal
height difference and all.

159
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:19,159
What? Why are you asking?

160
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:21,460
- I was just curious.
- Are you interested in him?

161
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,889
Don't be ridiculous.

162
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:24,659
- Why are you stuttering?
- It's not like that.

163
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:25,659
Your voice is shaking.

164
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:27,100
I said, no!

165
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,529
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

166
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,409
Good morning, Anchor Lee.

167
00:10:34,409 --> 00:10:35,570
Good morning.

168
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:40,440
You look like you're in a good mood.
I'm devastated.

169
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,220
What's wrong? Did something happen?

170
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:48,850
Because he switched you out
the other day,

171
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:51,389
he, you, and the director
will be disciplined.

172
00:10:51,789 --> 00:10:54,460
Not only me but you two as well?

173
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,590
Unfortunately, yes.

174
00:10:56,230 --> 00:11:00,029
The news still has to air,
so you and I will be fine.

175
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:02,899
But Director Choi will be suspended
until the disciplinary committee...

176
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:04,200
makes a decision.

177
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,970
She's been told to stay
out of his office from today.

178
00:11:07,909 --> 00:11:10,070
What if she ends up getting fired?

179
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,840
But why the director?

180
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:13,909
I'm the one who is responsible for
what happened.

181
00:11:13,909 --> 00:11:15,049
It doesn't make sense.

182
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,779
What do you mean,
it doesn't make sense?

183
00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:20,049
We switched the anchor out without
reporting it to the higher-ups.

184
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:23,350
Also, this isn't only about
what happened that day.

185
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,889
Think of all the things
you've revealed...

186
00:11:25,889 --> 00:11:29,889
on the news so far,
ignoring the higher-ups.

187
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:32,200
You've gotten on their wrong side.

188
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:35,100
This is just an excuse
to bring you down.

189
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,940
I'm sorry, Mr. Kim.

190
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:40,000
Where is Director Choi now?

191
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:48,980
Come in.

192
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:51,919
Director Choi.

193
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,419
Judging by your face,
I guess you heard the news.

194
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:04,100
It's no big deal.
Don't worry and go back to work.

195
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:06,129
I apologize.

196
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,429
For what?

197
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,970
For trying to save someone close
to you who got kidnapped?

198
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,269
Or is it because you left...

199
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:18,639
after only asking for my permission
instead of following protocol...

200
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,110
and asking everyone in management?

201
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,549
It was only a natural thing to do.
So why would you apologize?

202
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,860
I caused you and
the team manager trouble.

203
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:35,889
We switched the main anchor out
without any prior notice.

204
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:37,799
We should take responsibility
for that.

205
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:41,669
But that's it.
Don't read anything more into it.

206
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:46,039
I'll try to explain it
to the president in person.

207
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:48,840
Gosh, you talk too much.

208
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:51,340
Don't you trust me?

209
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:54,549
What are you talking about?
You know how much I look up to you.

210
00:12:54,549 --> 00:12:57,649
Then just let it go
when I tell you everything's cool.

211
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,549
Also, consider yourself lucky
to have an amazing boss like me,

212
00:13:01,549 --> 00:13:02,620
okay?

213
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,590
Besides, the disciplinary
committee's decision...

214
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,529
will come in 3 or 4 days
at the latest.

215
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:11,059
I think I'm going to take
this chance and take some time off.

216
00:13:11,059 --> 00:13:13,360
So leave me alone and get out.

217
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,769
I'm sorry, Director Choi.

218
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:23,809
All right.

219
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,809
I love you, Director Choi.

220
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,279
Thanks.

221
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:43,129
Gosh, I've never had a break before.

222
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:46,659
I mean,
I rarely get to take a break.

223
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,399
Why am I reading the newspaper? Why?

224
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:50,970
Come on. Seriously.

225
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,600
Goodness.

226
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,409
Ha Jin, are you ready to go?

227
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:06,379
Don't tell me
that's what you're wearing.

228
00:14:06,549 --> 00:14:07,649
Is it too much?

229
00:14:07,789 --> 00:14:10,789
Yes, it is way too much.
It's like you're going...

230
00:14:10,789 --> 00:14:12,120
to an awards ceremony.

231
00:14:12,789 --> 00:14:15,159
I wanted to dress up
since it's our first date.

232
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:17,090
Date? It's not a date.

233
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,730
Isn't he helping you
with your lines?

234
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:19,960
That's the same thing.

235
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:22,200
I'll be professional while spending
time with him like a mature lady.

236
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,629
I'll get the best of both worlds.

237
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:25,899
I doubt that Anchor Lee
will agree with you.

238
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:28,009
- I should change, right?
- Of course.

239
00:14:28,009 --> 00:14:29,470
You look like a mix of apples
and strawberries.

240
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:32,379
- I'll go change.
- Okay. Hurry.

241
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:33,909
Be careful.

242
00:14:33,909 --> 00:14:36,350
Don't hurt yourself
on your first date with him.

243
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,409
Okay!

244
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,980
I want to go work out.
Make it quick.

245
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,789
No, be careful first.

246
00:14:45,389 --> 00:14:46,559
Where is she?

247
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:49,629
Hey, Chul Woong.

248
00:14:50,029 --> 00:14:51,600
Hey, have you seen Hee Sang?

249
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,700
I saw her just now on the rooftop
when I went up to smoke.

250
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:59,970
Where on earth is she?

251
00:15:00,269 --> 00:15:01,669
She was right here.

252
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:03,169
There she is.

253
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,850
What? Is she crying?

254
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,779
Go and try to comfort her.

255
00:15:16,419 --> 00:15:17,519
Sweetheart.

256
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,519
Why are you crying out here?

257
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,889
My gosh.

258
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:27,870
Why do your shoulders look so small
from the back?

259
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,269
You've been so strong for me,
so I have been taking the back seat.

260
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,110
Now, I'll take the burdens...

261
00:15:38,009 --> 00:15:39,309
you've been shouldering.

262
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:44,750
Goodness,
it must have been tough on you.

263
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,620
Oh, poor you.

264
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,059
Darn it.

265
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,429
If the higher-ups give you a hard
time because of this incident,

266
00:15:54,429 --> 00:15:56,029
you should just resign.

267
00:15:56,029 --> 00:15:58,600
I'll be able to support you.

268
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,830
You've been working so hard for us,

269
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,840
so I'll take up your burdens now.

270
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,840
Don't let this ruin your mood.

271
00:16:13,779 --> 00:16:14,909
Stop crying.

272
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,309
Sweetheart.

273
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,320
My gosh.

274
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:22,250
When did you get here? You should've
told me if you were here.

275
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:25,490
I did. I've been talking to you
all this time.

276
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:26,720
Really?

277
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:29,629
I probably didn't hear you
because of the earbuds.

278
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:33,500
My goodness. This is so funny.

279
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,000
I've been laughing so hard. Look.

280
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,799
I'm literally crying.

281
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,509
Were you watching this?

282
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,340
While shaking your shoulders?

283
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,710
I haven't seen this for a while,
so this is hilarious.

284
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,980
- It's so funny.
- My gosh, Chul Woong.

285
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,250
Look at you.

286
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,419
By the way,
did you come up here to find me?

287
00:16:55,419 --> 00:16:57,049
Whatever!

288
00:16:57,289 --> 00:16:58,559
How could you be watching
a variety show now?

289
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,389
You startled me.

290
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:02,730
What else could I do?
I have nothing to do.

291
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,160
And time is moving so slowly.
I need to entertain myself.

292
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,329
Fine, go ahead.

293
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:08,000
You should catch up
with all the shows...

294
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,670
you missed so far
now that you're suspended.

295
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,569
Good for you. This all worked out.

296
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,309
Shut it.

297
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:20,940
My goodness, my husband
sure makes me feel safe.

298
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:25,579
Darn it.

299
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,589
Try again. This time,
pronounce them more clearly.

300
00:17:34,089 --> 00:17:35,460
Now, say your line.

301
00:17:35,859 --> 00:17:37,190
Korean conglomerates...

302
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,230
No, I told you before.

303
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:41,430
I want you to enunciate
one at a time.

304
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:42,900
Okay. Enunciate.

305
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:48,940
Korean conglomerates.

306
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:51,480
- Now, say them together.
- Korean conglomerates.

307
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:54,609
That's good.
Let's move onto the next line.

308
00:17:54,609 --> 00:17:56,710
The first half
of their recruiting program.

309
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,650
Pronounce the vowels 10 times again.

310
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,079
10 times?

311
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,250
Start.

312
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,190
Enunciate.

313
00:18:11,529 --> 00:18:12,930
Slowly.

314
00:18:19,069 --> 00:18:20,140
I did it. 10 times.

315
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,640
You're done?

316
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,410
Can we just use it
without permission?

317
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,049
I already got
the coach's permission.

318
00:18:30,049 --> 00:18:31,549
We just have to clean up afterward.

319
00:18:31,549 --> 00:18:33,319
Here. Go put this on.

320
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,150
Okay.

321
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:38,619
By the way, what are we doing here?

322
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:42,630
Jujitsu.

323
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,559
I've heard of it a lot.

324
00:18:45,259 --> 00:18:46,859
But this isn't right, you know.

325
00:18:47,099 --> 00:18:49,730
- What do you mean?
- I get that I'm a first-timer.

326
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,400
You know, there are
weight classes in fights.

327
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,240
Jujitsu isn't a form of fighting.
It's martial arts.

328
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,769
And this allows us to overcome
physical traits.

329
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:58,579
But still, this won't work.

330
00:18:58,579 --> 00:19:01,250
I can't do this when I know
you won't be my match at all.

331
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,849
Where are you? You know?
I can't see you.

332
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,319
I told you this sport allows us
to overcome our physical traits.

333
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,920
You ought to listen to people
to the end.

334
00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:14,420
Okay.

335
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,430
Okay?

336
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,529
Okay.

337
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:20,930
Okay. Since it's your first day,
we'll stick to the basic moves.

338
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,299
The basic moves?

339
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,670
My back. My gosh.

340
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:27,240
Hold on a second.

341
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,609
I didn't start yet.

342
00:19:28,609 --> 00:19:29,809
But it already hurts.

343
00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:31,210
Hold on! Wait!

344
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:32,910
Tap out. I'm tapping.

345
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,039
Tap out.

346
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,509
By cutting down...

347
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:37,150
on their recruiting programs,
which were held twice a year,

348
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,819
they increased the number of hires
by accepting resumes all year round.

349
00:19:38,819 --> 00:19:41,079
And this has led to confusion
for the job-seekers.

350
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:44,920
You did well,
but your voice keeps going up.

351
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:48,859
Try to lower your voice. It's lower
than the voice you have in mind.

352
00:19:48,859 --> 00:19:50,490
That way, your voice
will sound stable.

353
00:19:50,859 --> 00:19:51,859
Try again.

354
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,359
- Again?
- One more time.

355
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:58,099
You've been saying that
more than 50 times.

356
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:01,839
This is boring.

357
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,640
What are you doing?

358
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:04,910
I knew it.

359
00:20:05,509 --> 00:20:06,609
There's a saying that
we shouldn't learn...

360
00:20:06,609 --> 00:20:08,450
to drive or to be an anchor
from the significant others.

361
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,210
All the sayings were true.

362
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,220
I've never heard of such a saying.

363
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,049
Had I known how this would turn out,
I would've asked someone else.

364
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:19,559
You sound like a scary, strict
teacher, not my boyfriend.

365
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:22,230
Today, I'm not your boyfriend.
I'm your teacher.

366
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:26,660
If I knew I would be reading lines,
I shouldn't have dressed up.

367
00:20:26,829 --> 00:20:28,400
I got excited for nothing.

368
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,740
You give me no choice.
We need to dial it up a notch.

369
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:37,940
Where are you going?

370
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,680
Get your script and follow me.

371
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,480
My gosh.

372
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:47,450
We were already
practicing so hard here.

373
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:04,640
Why are we in the studio?

374
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,769
Sit down in the anchor's seat.

375
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,609
Me?

376
00:21:09,509 --> 00:21:11,140
Practice as if it's real.

377
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:12,710
Hurry.

378
00:21:28,529 --> 00:21:31,230
You look much better in that seat
than I expected.

379
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,500
Really?

380
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:37,329
All right.

381
00:21:37,769 --> 00:21:39,039
Square your shoulders.

382
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,140
Keep your back straight.

383
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,880
My outfit feels uncomfortable.
I can't get the right posture.

384
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,380
What's the correct posture?
Help me one more time.

385
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,150
Listen carefully.

386
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:58,359
Square your shoulders.

387
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,619
Keep your back straight.

388
00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:02,859
Okay?

389
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:04,289
Okay.

390
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:08,200
Think about what we practiced.

391
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,329
And give it a try.

392
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:11,700
Try to remember
your breathing points.

393
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,940
Now that I'm in a new environment,
I can focus better. It's nice.

394
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,140
Since I'm focused,
let me practice other scenes.

395
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,480
Help me.

396
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:20,940
Other scenes? Which one?

397
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,410
Scene 35.

398
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:24,410
You're not leading the news
in that scene.

399
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,920
This is a very important scene.

400
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,589
You need to help me.

401
00:22:28,589 --> 00:22:31,019
You just have to read lines for me.

402
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,589
Let's start from there. Hurry.

403
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,259
Okay.

404
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,029
"It was as if
I've been bewitched today."

405
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:46,140
"I have been following traces
of you all day today."

406
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:50,309
"It felt like some force was
stopping us from seeing each other."

407
00:22:50,309 --> 00:22:52,710
What was that? Are you a robot?

408
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,480
You didn't put
any emotions into that.

409
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:57,980
I thought you just needed me
to read the lines.

410
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,650
You need to read with your emotions
for me to get into my character.

411
00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:02,849
Try to sound more sorrowful.
Try it again.

412
00:23:06,859 --> 00:23:09,259
"It was as if..."

413
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:12,160
"It was as if
I've been bewitched today."

414
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,769
"I have been following traces
of you all day today."

415
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:18,099
Relax and try again.

416
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:27,710
"It was as if
I've been bewitched today."

417
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:30,650
"I have been following traces
of you all day today."

418
00:23:38,859 --> 00:23:40,890
All right. I'm sorry about that.

419
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,730
Let's call it a day.

420
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:45,630
I'm so glad
I didn't become an anchor,

421
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:47,430
and I'm also very glad
you didn't get into acting.

422
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,799
You're an awful actor.

423
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,529
Agreed.

424
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:55,039
What do you think will happen to
this drama? Will it be a big hit?

425
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:59,309
I'm not sure. I don't know
a lot about dramas,

426
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,940
but it's a little...

427
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,049
It's a little what?

428
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:05,019
It's a little far-fetched.

429
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:07,180
What's far-fetched?

430
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:08,619
There are a lot of things,

431
00:24:09,289 --> 00:24:11,619
but especially the scene
where the man and the woman reunite.

432
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:15,630
They run into each other three times
on the same day in the same place,

433
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:19,599
then they miss each other by a hair.

434
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:24,029
Then they get into
a ridiculous accident on a street.

435
00:24:24,269 --> 00:24:26,670
Don't you think there are
way too many coincidences?

436
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:28,369
That's why they're meant to be.

437
00:24:29,369 --> 00:24:31,609
They're destined to meet each other
and fall in love.

438
00:24:33,009 --> 00:24:36,180
And I'm sure more dramatic things
happen in our reality.

439
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:39,680
Think of us. We didn't know
we'd end up like this.

440
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,720
You're right.

441
00:24:46,059 --> 00:24:48,589
It's pretty late. Let's go.
You said you have work tomorrow.

442
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:51,160
That's true.

443
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:53,299
But this is pretty disappointing.

444
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:56,529
I didn't think we'd spend
our first date working.

445
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,140
I didn't think
this was our first date.

446
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:02,410
Then?

447
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:06,609
I can't count
meeting you this briefly as a date.

448
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:09,910
We need to have
a really good first date.

449
00:25:10,779 --> 00:25:12,720
Let's go on an official date
this weekend.

450
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,720
Sounds great.

451
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:20,789
Oh, right.
You have to grant me a wish.

452
00:25:21,089 --> 00:25:23,259
You said you're sorry
while we read the script.

453
00:25:24,329 --> 00:25:26,460
What? I don't remember that.

454
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:28,430
You can't pull that on me.

455
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:34,470
Fine. What's your wish?

456
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:38,410
You'll find out soon enough.

457
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:42,009
You're suddenly making me anxious.

458
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:57,630
Doesn't it hurt?

459
00:25:57,759 --> 00:25:58,960
What are you doing?

460
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:01,670
I'm doing as I'm told.

461
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,430
Goodness.

462
00:26:23,589 --> 00:26:26,390
This is how you pull off the move.
Got it?

463
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:34,500
Are you all right?

464
00:26:45,109 --> 00:26:46,339
Are you hurt?

465
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,980
I think I hurt my head.

466
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,509
Your head? When?

467
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,490
Hey, Ha Jin.

468
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:03,390
You're already leaving
on Anchor Lee's car?

469
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:05,529
Okay.

470
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,329
This is great.
I was craving a drink.

471
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,339
Excuse me! One gizzard
and a bottle of soju, please.

472
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:13,339
Sure.

473
00:27:14,339 --> 00:27:16,609
Do you want some soda?

474
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:19,579
What are you talking about?
I'm a good drinker.

475
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:23,750
Excuse me! Can we have
a soju glass and a regular glass?

476
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:24,779
Sure.

477
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:31,549
Have a drink.

478
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:43,269
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

479
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:54,009
That's sweet. A drink you have
after your workout is the sweetest.

480
00:27:54,009 --> 00:27:55,410
It's far from sweet.

481
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:57,779
You haven't worked out enough, then.

482
00:27:57,779 --> 00:27:59,549
I went easy on you today
since it was your first day.

483
00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:01,950
You can expect more from now on.
We'll work out for real.

484
00:28:02,549 --> 00:28:03,990
You went easy on me today?

485
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,460
Don't say that.

486
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,920
You have to do your best
to get your revenge on your ex.

487
00:28:11,329 --> 00:28:13,799
Why are you rushing? Take your time.

488
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:16,170
I can totally handle my drinks.

489
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,000
Don't worry about me.

490
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,470
Sure.

491
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,309
I don't think so.

492
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:33,619
Ha Kyung, don't you
want to become an athlete?

493
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:37,619
I was an athlete in high school.
I played judo.

494
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,059
I knew it!

495
00:28:40,589 --> 00:28:41,960
Why did you quit?

496
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,630
At first, it was
because of an injury,

497
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:47,160
but now, it's because of my sister.

498
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:49,470
I thought I should be by her side.

499
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:54,740
Then did you give up on your dream
because of Ha Jin?

500
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:57,809
You two are very loving sisters.

501
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,410
But you two do look that loving.

502
00:29:01,779 --> 00:29:04,579
It's also my dream
to live happily with my family.

503
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:08,490
We don't live with our parents,

504
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,119
but it's still fun to live
hand in hand with my sister.

505
00:29:12,589 --> 00:29:15,730
Sometimes she doesn't listen to me
and gets in trouble,

506
00:29:16,029 --> 00:29:19,599
then I'd get angry and upset,

507
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,569
but we still have a laugh
and make great memories.

508
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:26,299
Every day is...

509
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:32,079
What is this? Mr. Jo. Mr. Jo?

510
00:29:32,609 --> 00:29:35,180
I was just telling a serious story.

511
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,710
Hey, Jo Il Kwon! Hey!

512
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:39,680
Are you doing this to avoid paying?

513
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:45,019
Hey! Get up. Hey. Hey!

514
00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:48,529
This guy is really out.

515
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:57,099
"I can handle my drinks"?
My foot. You're such a weak drinker.

516
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:04,410
This is weird.
It doesn't feel like I'm walking.

517
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,839
Be quiet. It's already tough enough.

518
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:13,450
Something smells.

519
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:15,250
What's this smell?

520
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,619
Shut up, you idiot!

521
00:30:18,619 --> 00:30:19,789
I don't feel good.

522
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,059
I'm never drinking with you again.

523
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,700
Man, that was tough.

524
00:30:36,609 --> 00:30:37,740
That was tough.

525
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,309
You're so tiny and cute.
