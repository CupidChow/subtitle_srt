1
00:00:03,209 --> 00:00:04,839
Hurry up and climb up.

2
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:06,679
Why are you so slow?

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:09,250
I'm running out of breath
because of this mask.

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:10,919
Gosh, that's much better.

5
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:12,550
Hey, keep the mask on.

6
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:14,390
There are a few people here.

7
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,519
No, I'll look more suspicious
if I hide my face.

8
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,190
Let's start climbing for real.

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,760
Goodness.

10
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:23,899
Hurry up!

11
00:00:25,629 --> 00:00:26,899
Hey, wait!

12
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:30,940
(Episode 6)

13
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:33,439
This is great.

14
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:36,780
I got some exercise
out in the open...

15
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,210
and got to see the night view.

16
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:39,810
It has been forever.

17
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,750
Let's come out from time to time.

18
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,880
It must be suffocating
to only work out inside.

19
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:45,179
Okay.

20
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,189
This place hasn't changed.

21
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:50,560
Even the air seems the same.

22
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:54,729
Is it your first time here
after that?

23
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,130
I had no reason to be here.

24
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,100
I was busy too.

25
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:04,700
And I was kind of sick of it
because of someone.

26
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,370
I was always in my room
even after I got discharged,

27
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,510
so you always made me
come up here with you,

28
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,180
saying I have to exercise
to get better quickly.

29
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:17,349
You seemed like
the evilest drill instructor.

30
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,620
Thanks to that time,

31
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,819
you're able to live through
such a tough shooting schedule.

32
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:23,959
Of course, I know that.

33
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,689
When you first said
you wanted to be an actress,

34
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:28,459
I tried so hard to stop you.

35
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:31,400
You tried to stop me that badly,

36
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,700
but you're still by my side
because you were so worried.

37
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:37,670
So you know?

38
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:44,980
Is it not tough to be surrounded
by people?

39
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:49,180
It's not. But I do become greedy.

40
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:52,379
I want to do better.

41
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,659
I had lost a part of my memory.

42
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,359
So I thought
I could fill in that gap...

43
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,930
if more people could remember me.

44
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,770
Since I could play different roles,

45
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,110
it feels like
they're filling in the gap.

46
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,650
I'm thankful.

47
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:26,180
I keep forgetting things,
but they remember them.

48
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:31,120
They remember the expressions
on my face, the things I said,

49
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:34,330
the clothes I wore,
and where I've been.

50
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:38,830
I do feel bad
for you and Ms. Park...

51
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,300
every time
the paparazzi takes photos.

52
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,099
But I like that I can relive
those moments...

53
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:44,939
by looking at the photos.

54
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:47,639
I'm not worried
about forgetting them.

55
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:51,710
Don't get me wrong.
I don't anticipate the paparazzi.

56
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,780
If you're that happy,
why don't you start...

57
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,750
doing live streaming?

58
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,180
Should I start doing that
from tomorrow?

59
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:00,719
Do you want me to confiscate
your phone?

60
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:05,060
Ha Kyung, you're so adorable.
It's getting cold. Let's go back.

61
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:07,759
Stop right there.

62
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:13,900
- Go?
- Go.

63
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,840
- Hello.
- Hello.

64
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:19,669
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

65
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:22,069
- Do you want some tteokbokki?
- What?

66
00:03:22,939 --> 00:03:25,009
Fine, I'll be nice.
One tteokbokki, please.

67
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,110
And this one too.

68
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,210
No.

69
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,120
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

70
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:34,090
Don't eat the rice cakes.
You'll bloat.

71
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,120
Just have the fish cakes.

72
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,960
How could I skip the rice cakes?
Don't be absurd.

73
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,090
Just one.

74
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:42,860
Bite it.

75
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,800
Do you think you can sleep well?

76
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,969
Yes, I'm about to fall asleep.

77
00:03:52,969 --> 00:03:55,569
See? Let me know
if you have trouble sleeping again.

78
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,110
I'll give you
another painful training session.

79
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,849
I should've had the sausage
as well. What a shame.

80
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:05,219
If you're ever hesitant
about eating something, then don't.

81
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:07,120
Don't eat anything past 6 p.m.

82
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,650
Just don't eat.

83
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:10,759
Goodnight.

84
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,590
Sausages taste the best
when you play hooky.

85
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:19,100
Remember when we used
to have them at the Han River?

86
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,629
They tasted so good.

87
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,730
- The Han River?
- Yes.

88
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,569
We used to have two each.

89
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,839
Hurry up and go to bed
when you still can.

90
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,110
Why do you keep bringing up
the past?

91
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,620
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

92
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:50,899
It feels like
they're filling in the gap.

93
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,910
Oh, no...

94
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:05,879
How could this happen?

95
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,579
No...

96
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:15,819
Don't go...

97
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,560
No...

98
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:25,430
Let's go inside.

99
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,870
I can't.

100
00:05:33,069 --> 00:05:35,110
I don't think I can look at her.

101
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:39,839
Still, you should bid her farewell.

102
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:44,850
I feel sorry for her.

103
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,089
I do.

104
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,259
That's why I can't.

105
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,759
I just can't.

106
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,089
- Hello.
- Hello.

107
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,800
- Hello.
- Hello.

108
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,970
("My First Love")

109
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:36,800
Hello, I'm Ji Hyun Geun,
the director of "My First Love".

110
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,199
Thank you for coming.

111
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:40,709
Hello, I'm Jung Ha Jun.
I play the role of Min Seok,

112
00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:41,709
Ha Jin's first love.

113
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:46,410
Hello, I'm Yeo Ha Jin.
I play the role...

114
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,410
of Ae Young. It's nice to meet you.

115
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:52,680
Now, the reporters
will ask questions.

116
00:06:54,089 --> 00:06:55,389
Yes, sir?

117
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,620
This is a question for Ms. Yeo.

118
00:06:58,689 --> 00:06:59,959
This is your first movie...

119
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:01,689
and also your first time
playing the lead.

120
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:04,160
Why did you pick this movie?

121
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:08,930
I didn't. The director picked me.

122
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:13,000
I had a lot of trust in him.

123
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,939
I also enjoyed reading the script.

124
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,439
And since the title was
"My First Love",

125
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:22,649
I thought I could transform
my image into a lovable one...

126
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:24,819
and win the people's hearts.

127
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,180
I took the role immediately.

128
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,319
Your character has high standards
for men.

129
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,230
What did you like about Anchor Lee,
your actual lover?

130
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,870
You don't need to answer that.

131
00:07:46,269 --> 00:07:48,769
Like I've mentioned before,

132
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:51,240
please only ask questions
related to the movie...

133
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,740
That's okay. I can answer that.

134
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,379
Either way, you're still going
to write an article.

135
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,620
But make it write 1, write 1 free.

136
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,149
If you post an article
regarding my dating life,

137
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:03,490
please write one for this movie
as well.

138
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,189
And a good one, if possible.

139
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:12,829
I'll tell you what I liked
about him.

140
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:16,470
He's very intelligent, wise,

141
00:08:17,269 --> 00:08:20,769
has a great voice, is eloquent...

142
00:08:22,339 --> 00:08:23,509
But most of all,

143
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:26,779
he's so sexy when he spews
biting remarks.

144
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,720
Didn't I answer the questions well?

145
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,820
Yes, you did.

146
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,759
You sure did.

147
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:41,190
Good work, Ha Jin.
You looked beautiful today.

148
00:08:41,389 --> 00:08:43,289
Good work to you too.

149
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:45,730
You need to leave right away
for an interview, right?

150
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:46,860
Yes.

151
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:50,100
It's a pity
we can't have dinner together.

152
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,700
Let's make sure to eat together
next time.

153
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,399
Good work today. Bye.

154
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,070
Bye. I'll call you tomorrow.

155
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,269
Goodbye.

156
00:08:56,509 --> 00:08:57,679
Are the articles up?

157
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:59,009
Let me check.

158
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:02,509
("My First Love",
Actress Yeo Ha Jin)

159
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:06,320
What a surprise.
They posted many good articles.

160
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,549
"A New Side of Yeo Ha Jin".

161
00:09:07,549 --> 00:09:08,590
Really?

162
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:11,419
There are many articles
on Jeong Hoon as well.

163
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,820
The titles are all about how sexy
he looks when criticizing.

164
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,460
Why did you have to say that?

165
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,500
Ms. Park?

166
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:21,870
No way.

167
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:27,370
Ha Jin. Ha Kyung. It's number one!

168
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:28,769
What is? The ticket sales?

169
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:32,210
Yes. Do you know what
the current ticket sales are?

170
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:34,950
It's 40 percent.

171
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,250
The movie won't be premiering
until two days later,

172
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,379
but it is higher
than those of current movies.

173
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:42,590
It's the most popular movie
right now.

174
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,559
Are all the current movies that bad?

175
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,230
Did you hoard the sales
or something?

176
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,159
Don't be ridiculous.
The movie's really a hit.

177
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:53,659
All the articles
are complimenting it.

178
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:55,470
People are posting wonderful things
on their social media as well.

179
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,929
It's the most anticipated movie.

180
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,500
I know one of the critics...

181
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,940
who came today, so I asked him.

182
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,769
And he complimented you
on your acting.

183
00:10:04,909 --> 00:10:08,309
He said the movie will be a hit
thanks to you.

184
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,080
Really? He complimented
on my acting?

185
00:10:11,179 --> 00:10:14,620
Goodness, Ha Jin.

186
00:10:14,789 --> 00:10:17,360
You're great
at both acting and dating.

187
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,889
I can't believe you finally snatched
a great guy like Anchor Lee.

188
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,429
"Met", not "snatched".

189
00:10:24,429 --> 00:10:26,629
Thanks to him,
your reputation got better,

190
00:10:26,629 --> 00:10:28,529
and your movie has become a hit.

191
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,000
Great job, Ha Jin.

192
00:10:36,139 --> 00:10:40,580
I hope you and Anchor Lee
date for a very long time.

193
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:42,580
But get married late.

194
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,850
Don't forget
that I'm always cheering for you.

195
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:45,850
Okay.

196
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,759
Yes? I guess you read the articles.
That's right.

197
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:52,419
I bet 10 million people
will watch the movie.

198
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:55,659
Don't be ridiculous.
I didn't hoard the sales.

199
00:10:55,659 --> 00:10:57,830
- Let's keep it a secret...
- From her.

200
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,460
If she finds out
that you two aren't dating,

201
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,169
she'll probably collapse.

202
00:11:01,169 --> 00:11:02,629
She'll be worried sick
about people's finding out...

203
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:04,799
and collapse
from high blood pressure.

204
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,700
You're right.
Let's take it to our graves.

205
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:09,610
I've never seen her so happy.

206
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:10,840
We've finally agreed on something.

207
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,840
We have.

208
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,909
Hold on.

209
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:16,710
This means our movie may be up
for more than two weeks.

210
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,620
You're right.
We'll have to find out,

211
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,019
but judging by
the current situation,

212
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:22,549
I doubt it's a flop.

213
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:23,950
Really?

214
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:29,789
Then should I extend the period
to two months?

215
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:47,710
(Yeo Ha Jin)

216
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:50,950
Forgetting...

217
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,049
Seo Yeon.

218
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,450
I guess...

219
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,389
that was the only way
Ha Jin could cope with this.

220
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:03,090
(Yeo Ha Jin)

221
00:12:11,539 --> 00:12:13,740
- All right.
- Hello.

222
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:15,409
- A little bit more.
- Check that.

223
00:12:15,409 --> 00:12:16,710
- I did.
- Okay.

224
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:17,980
- Hello.
- Hello.

225
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,509
- Here you go.
- From the rehearsal...

226
00:12:20,509 --> 00:12:21,909
Thank you.

227
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,610
- Thank you.
- A bit more.

228
00:12:23,649 --> 00:12:25,080
- Is that good?
- Yes.

229
00:12:25,149 --> 00:12:26,980
That's good. Thank you.

230
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,289
My gosh, they are flaunting
their relationship.

231
00:12:29,289 --> 00:12:30,960
- Who are you talking about?
- Who do you think?

232
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,559
I'm talking about Jeong Hoon.
His article is in the limelight.

233
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:35,559
You know what?
I'm quite surprised...

234
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:37,860
to see Anchor Lee date an actress.

235
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,929
When I first read the article,
I wasn't sure.

236
00:12:39,929 --> 00:12:42,230
But seeing how he's keeping
his silence, he must be dating her.

237
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:45,370
Then, when Ha Jin came
to our show for the interview,

238
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:47,169
did they already know each other?

239
00:12:47,169 --> 00:12:48,909
Gosh, isn't that obvious?

240
00:12:48,909 --> 00:12:51,240
They were already dating
even before the interview.

241
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,179
And that's probably why
he messed up that day.

242
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,309
I'm not sure if they had a fight...

243
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:58,950
or they are head over heels
for each other.

244
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:01,289
You're right. Anchor Lee
was a bit different that day.

245
00:13:01,289 --> 00:13:03,120
Right. He did seem a bit off.

246
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,529
- Here's a revised script.
- He's dating her in secret,

247
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:17,539
and he didn't tell us.

248
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:19,240
Number 7 and 9 got switched.

249
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,409
- That's right.
- Thanks. Thank you.

250
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:23,409
He totally fooled us.

251
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,750
(New message, Yeo Ha Jin)

252
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,779
You're not answering my calls.

253
00:13:32,049 --> 00:13:34,590
Please don't tell me
you're dodging my calls.

254
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,049
Let's meet. I need
to talk to you about something.

255
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,789
Anchor Lee, you're looking good.

256
00:13:39,789 --> 00:13:41,830
You must be happy to be in love.

257
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:43,830
Well, I guess.

258
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,460
"Well, I guess"?

259
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:49,129
Does it mean you're happy or not?

260
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:51,039
You sound quite arrogant.

261
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:54,000
It's not just any woman. You're
dating the actress, Yeo Ha Jin.

262
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,610
You don't have the right to say
that you're not happy.

263
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:58,740
Yes.

264
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:01,009
I am happy.

265
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,480
Thank you.

266
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,320
That's right. You ought to be happy.

267
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,019
You're dating her...

268
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:08,850
after making
a huge mistake on air...

269
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,250
and making our lives very difficult.

270
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,059
You must be happy.

271
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:14,960
Let me ask you a question.

272
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,529
Why did you freeze
during her interview?

273
00:14:17,529 --> 00:14:19,100
Were you not able to speak...

274
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,470
because you couldn't be
so mean to your girlfriend?

275
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:24,600
Or were you not able to focus
because things were going...

276
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,600
so well between you two
and she was sitting next to you?

277
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,970
Were you thinking
about something else?

278
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:32,039
She said you were sexy
when you were critiquing others.

279
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:34,610
What about you? What side of her
do you find so sexy?

280
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:37,149
Wait, you don't have to answer that.
I think I already know.

281
00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:40,779
I saw her photos in the magazine.
She has a fine body.

282
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:44,990
I can't put up with this anymore.

283
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:48,190
What? What will you do
if you can't put up with it?

284
00:15:04,309 --> 00:15:06,539
What just happened? What's he doing?

285
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:09,409
Come on, man.
You went too far with this.

286
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,710
I agree.

287
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,850
What did I do?

288
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:18,590
You know what?
People make mistakes when they talk.

289
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:21,090
That doesn't mean he can be rude
to his senior like this!

290
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,330
What will he do after he storms out?

291
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:25,200
Will he come over here
and punch me or something?

292
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:34,940
Why are you here?

293
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:38,480
Anchor Lee told me to inform you
that he's using the restroom.

294
00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:40,509
- What?
- He couldn't hold it anymore,

295
00:15:40,509 --> 00:15:42,080
so it was urgent.

296
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,879
That jerk.

297
00:15:54,259 --> 00:15:55,889
It's about Ha Jin.

298
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,259
What happens
if she gets her memories back?

299
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:02,370
She'll probably...

300
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:05,070
be in a lot of pain.

301
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,639
And things might get worse
like before.

302
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,110
Is it possible that she might
never get her memories back?

303
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:17,879
Yes.

304
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:21,350
It's rare, but it happens
for some people.

305
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:25,059
Her memories aren't coming back
even after a long time.

306
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:29,789
But I still can't
guarantee anything.

307
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:34,159
A part of me is envious of her.

308
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:36,600
And a part of me feels bad for her.

309
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,940
I can't even imagine
how she must be feeling.

310
00:16:47,179 --> 00:16:49,750
Living a life
without precious memories.

311
00:16:52,049 --> 00:16:53,950
Which one of us is more pitiful?

312
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,990
Me who can't forget my memories
for the rest of my life?

313
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,960
Or Ha Jin who had to forget
her memories to live?

314
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:17,069
(New message, Yeo Ha Jin)

315
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,039
It's me again.

316
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,809
Are you sick?

317
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:23,779
Like do you have the pink eyes,
so you can't read my text?

318
00:17:23,779 --> 00:17:27,019
Or did you hurt your fingers,
so you can't text me back?

319
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:29,849
If it's neither, call me.
It's important.

320
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:35,890
It's mine.

321
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,160
It's mine. Someone is calling me.

322
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,900
It's mine! My phone!

323
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:41,630
(Ms. Park)

324
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,569
Yes, Ms. Park.

325
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:46,839
I see. She has an interview
tomorrow? At what time?

326
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,670
Okay.

327
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:53,079
What are you doing?
Slapstick comedy?

328
00:17:53,779 --> 00:17:55,049
I thought my phone was ringing.

329
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,920
You took yours earlier.
Check your pocket.

330
00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:01,250
Yes, right.

331
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:07,019
What is it? Did you think
Lee Jeong Hoon was calling?

332
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:10,029
Yes. But he still hasn't
gotten back to me.

333
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,529
Is he that busy?

334
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:15,130
Anchors on the news program
are busy, right?

335
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:17,900
Do you think he's not calling back
because he's busy?

336
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:20,839
- No.
- So you know.

337
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:28,309
Are you serious?
Do you really like him?

338
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:30,650
Is it serious?

339
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:33,819
Why aren't you answering me?

340
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:35,920
I was thinking.

341
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,890
What? But you never think.

342
00:18:38,289 --> 00:18:41,730
My gosh. I don't know no matter
how much I think about this.

343
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:44,430
To say that my feelings for him
are serious,

344
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:46,329
we haven't met that many times.

345
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:49,930
- But...
- "But"?

346
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:51,640
I'm curious and worried.

347
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,970
What are you curious
and worried about?

348
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:56,039
Like when he froze on the news,

349
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:58,779
there are times when it looks like
he's somewhere else.

350
00:18:59,609 --> 00:19:01,579
He freezes and stops talking.

351
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,049
I know that he's in front of me,

352
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,950
but it looks like
he's in some other universe.

353
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,019
But whenever that happens,
he looks sad.

354
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:14,259
And it looks like
he's in danger too.

355
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,200
For some reason,
if I don't hold onto him,

356
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,369
he looks like
he might disappear into thin air.

357
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:27,440
What are you talking about?

358
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,569
You won't get it.

359
00:19:30,609 --> 00:19:33,339
Oh, that.
Silence is always harder than words.

360
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,309
You were the one who told me that.

361
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,450
Right, I did.

362
00:19:40,349 --> 00:19:41,950
It's pointless if it's one-sided.

363
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,589
I doubt it's going
to work out for you.

364
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,059
He rejected you right away
and ignored your calls and texts.

365
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:49,259
It's all right.
It's not over until it is.

366
00:19:49,259 --> 00:19:52,059
Gosh. This is not the right time
to use that expression.

367
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:53,259
It's a really cool saying.

368
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:54,829
Excuse me. Hey.

369
00:19:54,829 --> 00:19:57,000
The news must be starting now.

370
00:19:58,269 --> 00:19:59,369
What are you doing?
Answer the phone.

371
00:19:59,369 --> 00:20:01,170
What? Is it mine?

372
00:20:05,509 --> 00:20:06,509
(Anchor Lee)

373
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,210
(Anchor Lee)

374
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,920
Anchor Lee,
we're starting in 10 minutes.

375
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,480
Give me a minute. I'll be right in.

376
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,490
Okay.

377
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:23,789
Hello?

378
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:25,329
This is Lee Jeong Hoon.

379
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:28,299
I'm sorry I didn't get back to you
sooner. I was busy today.

380
00:20:28,869 --> 00:20:31,230
I see. You were very busy today.

381
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,269
Hey, he was busy.

382
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,470
It's all right. I understand.

383
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:37,609
But what's so important
that we needed to talk?

384
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:41,079
Well, the situation has changed.

385
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:42,910
It's a long conversation.

386
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:45,450
I'd like to talk to you
about the details in person.

387
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:48,519
Sure. Let's meet then.

388
00:20:48,849 --> 00:20:50,490
I have something to tell you too.

389
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:52,559
Are you free tomorrow?

390
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:53,720
Tomorrow?

391
00:20:56,029 --> 00:20:58,460
How about today instead of tomorrow?

392
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:01,200
After your news program.
That will work for me.

393
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:03,930
Okay, then. Where should we meet?

394
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:06,140
Well... We failed at the Han River.

395
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,569
Let's meet somewhere else.

396
00:21:07,869 --> 00:21:09,509
I know a cafe.

397
00:21:09,509 --> 00:21:12,410
I'll text you the address.
I'll meet you there at 1 a.m.

398
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,039
Okay.

399
00:21:14,779 --> 00:21:15,779
Okay.

400
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,890
What is this?
He ignored you all day today.

401
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,019
Did he agree to meet you?

402
00:21:24,019 --> 00:21:26,690
Yes. He said he needed
to tell me something too.

403
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:27,890
Like what?

404
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:30,289
I don't know.
What does he want to talk about?

405
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,130
I doubt that
he will agree to your plan.

406
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,900
If you ask him to continue...

407
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,869
this fake relationship
for two months, he'll be appalled.

408
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:40,670
- He won't be appalled.
- I don't think so.

409
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,039
Hello, everyone.

410
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:46,710
Let us begin
"Lee Jeong Hoon's News Live".

411
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,950
But what does he want to say to me?

412
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:53,349
Is it something good or bad?

413
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,450
I don't think
you should be sitting around.

414
00:21:56,789 --> 00:21:57,849
Are you going to see him like that?

415
00:21:57,849 --> 00:21:59,890
What? No!

416
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:02,289
You have to be ready in 40 minutes
to get there in time.

417
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:03,529
Gosh, this is bad.

418
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:07,000
I won't go if you run too late.

419
00:22:09,099 --> 00:22:10,200
Hey!

420
00:22:11,769 --> 00:22:13,200
Which one do you think looks better?

421
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:14,869
Can you see?

422
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:19,309
- The silver dress.
- The silver one? Okay.

423
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:30,990
If you're going to wear whatever
you want, why did you ask me?

424
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:33,920
No, you were very helpful.

425
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,690
I left out everything you liked,
and it ended in no time.

426
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,779
Hey, he's here already.
I'm getting off.

427
00:22:58,279 --> 00:22:59,650
Call me when you're done talking.

428
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,750
Okay.

429
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,460
You got here early.

430
00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:14,500
I just got here.

431
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,670
I enjoyed the news today.

432
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:18,940
Although I only caught half of it
trying to get ready to go out.

433
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:22,640
Your tie looked great on you.

434
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:23,940
Really?

435
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:25,779
I'm glad.

436
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,079
Let's go inside. It's chilly.

437
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:31,779
It's right here.

438
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:43,190
No one is here.

439
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:46,230
Yes, it's not her business hour,

440
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:47,900
but I asked her for a favor.

441
00:23:48,569 --> 00:23:51,500
I'm close to the owner here,
so I came here from time to time.

442
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:53,269
Our table is on the second floor.

443
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,880
Isn't the night view here
awfully pretty?

444
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:06,180
I came here often to see this
with Ha Kyung and...

445
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:07,549
Goodness.

446
00:24:22,869 --> 00:24:24,130
Be careful.

447
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,140
I should never let my guard down
when I'm with you.

448
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,109
Walk up carefully.
Don't fall down again.

449
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,180
Okay.

450
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:49,529
Do you know who Jung Seo Yeon is?

451
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:54,230
Jeong Hoon asked yesterday
whether I knew her or not.

452
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:56,900
Gosh, no way.

453
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,170
I'm sure it's someone
with the same name.

454
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:03,109
It's not like she was the only one
with that name.

455
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,279
I didn't want to interrupt you
in the middle of the news,

456
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:12,549
so I ordered everything myself.
Is that all right?

457
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,220
It's a cocktail.

458
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,789
Yours is a virgin.

459
00:25:15,789 --> 00:25:17,819
You have to drive,
and you don't like alcohol.

460
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,430
I think this is yours.

461
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:40,079
Yes, this is the one
without alcohol.

462
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:43,509
See that?
I can never let my guard down.

463
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:45,880
You're right.

464
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:48,819
It's good.

465
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:51,789
And I like the ambiance here.

466
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:54,490
Right?

467
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,960
One second. It's way too pretty.

468
00:25:58,089 --> 00:25:59,799
May I take some pictures
and come back?

469
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:03,029
I'll leave you out of the picture,
and I won't post it either.

470
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:05,569
I just want to keep it for myself.
Is that okay?

471
00:26:06,369 --> 00:26:07,400
Sure.

472
00:26:07,869 --> 00:26:09,009
I'll be back soon.

473
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:51,279
Don't people like you
usually hate taking pictures?

474
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:54,950
You already get a lot of pictures
taken as a celebrity.

475
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:58,319
You're right.
Some people hate taking pictures.

476
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:01,119
But I like it.

477
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:04,029
It's harder to forget
if I have these pictures.

478
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:10,269
I don't have a good memory,

479
00:27:10,269 --> 00:27:12,039
so I forget a lot of things.

480
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:16,710
But if you take pictures,
these memories don't disappear.

481
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:20,339
And I won't have to be nervous
about not remembering.

482
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,349
When I look at these pictures later,

483
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,180
I feel reassured that...

484
00:27:26,619 --> 00:27:29,589
I've been living very well
and diligently.

485
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:35,859
Why?

486
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,160
Did I seem weird again?

487
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:42,799
No, come to think about it,
I can see why you do that.

488
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:45,839
I have too good of a memory.

489
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:48,710
What is this?

490
00:27:49,569 --> 00:27:51,140
Are you showing off?

491
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:55,279
Anyway, what's this
important thing you have to say?

492
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:59,619
Right, our prediction was
completely wrong.

493
00:27:59,849 --> 00:28:02,849
I think my movie will
become a huge hit.

494
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:06,319
We held a press preview today,
and everyone loved it.

495
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:08,220
And it's the number one
on ticket sales too.

496
00:28:09,329 --> 00:28:10,359
Really?

497
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:13,160
I doubt it'll be taken off
after just two weeks,

498
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,259
so our contract...

499
00:28:16,099 --> 00:28:19,400
I mean, it's not really
a contract, per se,

500
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,670
but I thought
we should extend this period.

501
00:28:24,509 --> 00:28:25,539
How much longer?

502
00:28:26,609 --> 00:28:27,980
At least two months.

503
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,250
Or maybe longer.

504
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:38,420
Well, you know,
it might be a huge failure,

505
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,190
but if I ruin its success...

506
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:42,490
because of my breakup news,

507
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:45,460
I'd feel too bad
for everyone who worked hard.

508
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:50,799
Okay.

509
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:53,539
Let's do as you'd like.

510
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:56,809
Really?

511
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:00,539
I don't care about the period.
You can do that.

512
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:05,619
Okay.

513
00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:15,960
By the way, is something going on?

514
00:29:16,859 --> 00:29:17,859
Like what?

515
00:29:17,859 --> 00:29:20,460
You seem a little different.

516
00:29:22,029 --> 00:29:26,339
How can I put this?
You seem nicer and gentler...

517
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,470
as if you had a change of mind.

518
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:33,509
To be frank,
you were awfully cold to me.

519
00:29:34,309 --> 00:29:35,450
What did you say?

520
00:29:36,049 --> 00:29:37,079
Yes, right.

521
00:29:37,349 --> 00:29:40,920
You hated someone who is reckless,
thoughtless, and inconsiderate.

522
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:44,390
You're a good person.

523
00:29:48,859 --> 00:29:50,690
I want you to always be happy.

524
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,099
I mean it.

525
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:05,680
You mean that in a good way, right?

526
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,880
But it sounds like...

527
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:11,549
you'll never see me again.

528
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:15,119
Yes, you're right.

529
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:18,759
I hope you will never contact me
or ask me to meet...

530
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:21,690
ever again.

531
00:30:23,059 --> 00:30:25,059
That's why I wanted to see you.

532
00:30:29,029 --> 00:30:32,200
You just said you didn't care
how long it lasts,

533
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,470
that I can do whatever I want.

534
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:38,170
That doesn't matter.
It's all fake anyway.

535
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:42,150
So you wanted to say...

536
00:30:42,849 --> 00:30:45,220
you never want to meet me again?

537
00:30:46,779 --> 00:30:47,819
Yes.

538
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,690
What's the reason?

539
00:30:59,829 --> 00:31:01,329
You and I were...

540
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:05,000
strangers until a few days ago.

541
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:10,140
We're just going back to our places.

542
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:12,309
It's simple.

543
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:15,750
"It's simple"?

544
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:20,150
I'm responsible for
playing along with the love scandal,

545
00:31:20,549 --> 00:31:21,819
so you can release...

546
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:25,589
the news of our breakup
when your movie stops playing.

547
00:31:39,069 --> 00:31:40,099
Let's go.

548
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,470
(We thank Kim Ea Na
for her special appearance.)

549
00:33:06,619 --> 00:33:08,890
(Find Me in Your Memory)

550
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:10,829
I ended it well with Ha Jin.

551
00:33:10,829 --> 00:33:12,759
I'm sure the wounds will
become dull over time.

552
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:14,059
Don't be too concerned.

553
00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:16,470
I can never tell what he's like.

554
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:19,569
Did you never think of me once
ever since that time?

555
00:33:19,569 --> 00:33:21,240
I hope you'll be happier...

556
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,309
in the times to come
compared to the times of the past.

557
00:33:24,309 --> 00:33:26,880
There's no way
he can live a normal life.

558
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,079
Someone who's suspicious?

559
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:29,579
Have you ever received...

560
00:33:29,579 --> 00:33:31,650
any weird photos
or threatening letters?

561
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:33,579
We ran into each other
quite a few times.

562
00:33:33,819 --> 00:33:35,019
Don't you know me?
