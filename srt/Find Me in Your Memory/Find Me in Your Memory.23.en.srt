1
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,110
What is it? Why did you
want to see me this late?

2
00:00:05,309 --> 00:00:06,750
You're here.

3
00:00:07,309 --> 00:00:08,609
What is it?

4
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:13,890
There's something
I couldn't tell you.

5
00:00:15,789 --> 00:00:18,690
The reason why
Ha Jin was so tormented...

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:21,989
that she wanted to
take her own life.

7
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:24,899
What do you mean?

8
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:36,909
- Ha Na. Over here.
- Yes?

9
00:00:37,909 --> 00:00:40,450
Ha Na, you look so pretty.

10
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,549
- Don't say that.
- My gosh.

11
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:45,079
No way, you look much prettier now.

12
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:48,189
Ha Na.

13
00:00:48,189 --> 00:00:49,250
Yeong!

14
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,920
(Delivery Service)

15
00:01:12,379 --> 00:01:15,209
(Find Me in Your Memory)

16
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:17,780
Tell me now.

17
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:19,849
She's your friend.

18
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,790
You two learned ballet together
as a kid,

19
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,519
and I heard you two were very close.

20
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:28,590
I've only seen her
a few times with you.

21
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,159
I don't remember her at all.

22
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,500
If I had known her for so long,
how can this happen?

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,209
You never told me about her either.

24
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,180
When you got in
that motorcycle accident,

25
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,349
you were badly hurt and in pain.

26
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:50,349
So your memory wasn't very stable.

27
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,950
Yeong was the one who was with you
at the time of the accident.

28
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:56,590
That's why I didn't bring her up.

29
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:00,290
There was no reason for you
to be reminded of that again.

30
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,459
It was a painful moment for you.

31
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,659
But you said we were close.

32
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:11,400
Why haven't I seen her to this day?

33
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:15,770
She left to study abroad...

34
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:18,780
right after the accident.

35
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,680
She went to study abroad?

36
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,219
Yes, I heard she had been
preparing to go abroad.

37
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:26,919
It was Russia or something.

38
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,050
And she didn't stay in touch
after that.

39
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:32,460
Wait, does this mean
I have no way of reaching out?

40
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,090
And she never contacted me either?

41
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,560
No, she never contacted you
ever since that time.

42
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,729
Do you have a big headache?

43
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:44,240
Do you want some medicine?

44
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:46,939
No.

45
00:02:47,409 --> 00:02:49,740
I'll just get some rest.

46
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,509
Do you want to do that?
You should do that.

47
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:54,550
Go get some rest.

48
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:11,530
I can't go in there.

49
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,039
I can't bring myself to see her.

50
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,780
I feel too sorry.

51
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:30,250
I'm too sorry.

52
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,349
I can't go in there.

53
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:57,039
Yes, hello?

54
00:03:57,379 --> 00:03:59,509
Doctor Yoo, can you talk right now?

55
00:03:59,509 --> 00:04:01,909
Yes, Ha Kyung. What's the occasion?

56
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,449
Wait, is something going on?

57
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:05,780
I'll tell you in person.

58
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,090
May I see you tomorrow?

59
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,819
The earlier, the better.

60
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:11,159
Yes, let's do that. I have time.

61
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,419
I'll see you at the clinic.

62
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:30,170
Ha Jin told the culprit
the passcode to her practice room.

63
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,139
She thought he was her boyfriend.

64
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:37,680
Yeong...

65
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:44,720
Yeong died because of me.

66
00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:49,230
She died because of me.

67
00:04:50,029 --> 00:04:52,560
No, it wasn't your fault.

68
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,129
You didn't do anything wrong.

69
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:57,069
I thought he was Yeong's boyfriend,

70
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,439
so I told him the passcode.

71
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,639
I told him.

72
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,839
I killed her, Doctor Yoo.

73
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:09,980
If it hadn't been for me,

74
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,420
if I was there for her on that day,

75
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,189
this wouldn't have happened.

76
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:20,490
I killed her, Doctor Yoo.

77
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,740
(Ha Jin)

78
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:36,639
Are you asleep?

79
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,920
You weren't asleep?

80
00:05:47,649 --> 00:05:50,220
No, I couldn't sleep.

81
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:53,790
It's pretty late.
Why aren't you asleep?

82
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:56,490
I couldn't sleep either.

83
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:59,360
Why? Are you worried about
having a nightmare?

84
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,569
No, it's not that.

85
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,670
To be honest,

86
00:06:07,769 --> 00:06:11,110
I remembered a friend
I had forgotten.

87
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,949
Ha Kyung said
she was a close friend of mine...

88
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:16,980
who learned ballet with me
as a child.

89
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,790
I don't remember much
other than her name, Yeong.

90
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,290
I wanted to meet her,

91
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:27,990
but she went to study abroad,
and we lost contact.

92
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,529
So I don't think I can see her.

93
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,170
- I see.
- But this felt really weird.

94
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,500
I was frustrated
and hated the fact...

95
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,610
that I couldn't remember.

96
00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:44,910
But after I remembered new things,

97
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,079
I'm starting to get scared...

98
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:52,180
that there may be memories
I regret remembering.

99
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,819
This time...

100
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:01,589
I spend with you is
very precious to me.

101
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,759
I hope that's the case for you too.

102
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:10,230
What's in the past can
only remain in the past.

103
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,970
I know that.

104
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:17,579
And I know how you felt
as you just told me that.

105
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:19,910
Thank you.

106
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,579
And I feel the same way too.

107
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:26,949
Every moment I spend with you is...

108
00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:29,220
very precious to me,

109
00:07:30,189 --> 00:07:31,660
so much so that it scares me.

110
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:38,329
It's late. You should get to sleep.
I'll go to sleep too.

111
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,769
Okay.

112
00:07:41,329 --> 00:07:42,970
Let's talk again tomorrow.

113
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:45,000
Goodnight.

114
00:08:04,589 --> 00:08:07,490
Ha Jin asked you
about Ms. Jung Seo Yeon?

115
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:12,230
Yes. She asked me about Yeong.

116
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,129
She doesn't remember everything.

117
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:18,870
She just remembered
her name and a few moments.

118
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:22,870
So I told her that
she used to learn ballet with her,

119
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,740
and that they're not in touch now
after she went to study abroad.

120
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:29,209
Was she convinced
after you said that?

121
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:30,949
For now.

122
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:34,090
I thought she would
make a visit to you soon.

123
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:35,549
That's why
I wanted to see you right away.

124
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:37,559
We have to keep the story straight.

125
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:38,789
I see.

126
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,190
What will happen...

127
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:44,159
if she remembers...

128
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,529
everything?

129
00:08:48,429 --> 00:08:49,769
Will she try...

130
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,470
to harm herself once again?

131
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:57,309
No. You said she understood.

132
00:08:57,309 --> 00:08:58,610
She wouldn't do that.

133
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,750
Maybe now isn't the right time,

134
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,850
but I'll talk with her later.

135
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:06,649
Don't be too worried.

136
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,350
Okay.

137
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:21,769
This time I spend with you is
very precious to me.

138
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:24,740
I hope that's the case for you too.

139
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,340
What's in the past can
only remain in the past.

140
00:09:44,659 --> 00:09:46,289
Weren't you sleeping?

141
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,129
Where did you go
so early in the morning?

142
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,460
You're up early.

143
00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:53,299
I felt under the weather,
so I took a walk.

144
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,929
You should've woken me up
so I could tag along.

145
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:58,240
I'll do that next time.

146
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,509
How's your headache? Is it better?

147
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,809
Yes. It doesn't hurt anymore.

148
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:10,950
Coffee?

149
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,149
Let me change. Let's have toast.

150
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,620
- Okay.
- Okay.

151
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,289
- I want chocolate jam.
- No.

152
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,600
I'll give you eggs, though.

153
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,929
I'm so thankful.

154
00:10:34,669 --> 00:10:38,240
Hello, everyone.
This is the 9 p.m. news.

155
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:43,610
Hello, everyone.
This is the 9 p.m. news.

156
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:44,980
All the major companies
have started...

157
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:47,019
the open recruitment
for the first half.

158
00:10:47,789 --> 00:10:50,419
"The open recruitment
for the first half."

159
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:55,590
Hello, everyone.
This is the 9 p.m. news.

160
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:57,460
All the major companies
have started...

161
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,730
the open recruitment
for the first half.

162
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,929
In the past, they used to have
two open recruitments a year.

163
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,139
But now, they will be recruiting
all around the year.

164
00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:07,000
This has flustered those
who have been job hunting.

165
00:11:08,409 --> 00:11:09,870
Hey, Jeong Hoon.

166
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,009
Hey. Hello.

167
00:11:11,009 --> 00:11:12,110
Hey.

168
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:14,009
Look at this.

169
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:16,549
The disciplinary committee
has announced the result.

170
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,090
(Disciplinary Result
of "Lee Jeong Hoon's News Live")

171
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,389
(Choi Hee Sang, Kim Chul Woong,
Lee Jeong Hoon)

172
00:11:24,289 --> 00:11:25,759
She only got reprimanded.

173
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,230
(Kim Chul Woong, Lee Jeong Hoon:
3-months' worth of wage cut)

174
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:30,559
"Wage cut"?

175
00:11:31,299 --> 00:11:32,730
Am I seeing this right?

176
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:34,600
(Kim Chul Woong, Lee Jeong Hoon:
3-months' worth of wage cut)

177
00:11:38,139 --> 00:11:41,470
But why? What did I do so wrong?

178
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:44,580
Chul Woong, cheer up.
I'll be going now.

179
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:46,110
- Take care.
- Goodbye.

180
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,289
Hey, can you tell me
your bank account number?

181
00:11:56,289 --> 00:11:57,320
Why?

182
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,120
I'll pay half of the hotel fees
that I paid with your card.

183
00:12:00,789 --> 00:12:02,559
I had purposely chosen
luxurious ones.

184
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:05,700
I'm coming clean in advance
because it'll be a hefty sum.

185
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:07,529
Would you like to do that?

186
00:12:07,529 --> 00:12:10,230
I don't want you to be poor
and not be able to go on dates.

187
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,570
I refuse to take part in that.

188
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,909
Thanks to Il Kwon,
I'm getting free money.

189
00:12:14,909 --> 00:12:17,370
Meals are on me
for the time being, sir.

190
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:20,139
You were never this friendly before.

191
00:12:20,509 --> 00:12:23,750
I'm just paying my dues
for what I've done.

192
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,120
What a loyal guy.

193
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,159
Hold on. Did you become warmhearted
thanks to Ha Jin?

194
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,059
This is why a man should always meet
the right woman.

195
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,799
Why are you saying no?

196
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,600
Gosh.

197
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:46,039
Hey, are you a kid?

198
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:48,139
If you got a wage cut,
you should deal with that.

199
00:12:48,139 --> 00:12:49,269
I'm not giving you an allowance.

200
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,309
Do you want me to feel downhearted?

201
00:12:51,309 --> 00:12:53,539
I won't be able to save face
in front of my juniors...

202
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:54,549
because I have no money.

203
00:12:54,549 --> 00:12:57,549
Don't be ridiculous.
You've never done that before.

204
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:02,019
- You knew everything.
- About what?

205
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:04,019
You knew in advance
about the disciplinary result.

206
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:06,320
That's why you were laughing
while watching that variety show.

207
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,360
You knew everything,
yet you received...

208
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,529
the necklace I gave you...

209
00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:10,159
and even made me do house chores.

210
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:12,259
You volunteered.

211
00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:15,399
And I had absolutely no idea
about the result.

212
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:16,629
I only found out today.

213
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,200
Can you please just give me
some allowance?

214
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,799
I won't be able to pay
for my credit card this month.

215
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:23,440
That's not my problem.

216
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,980
I'm having a headache,
so cut it out.

217
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,409
You better not bring this up again.

218
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:31,019
You're being so cheap!

219
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,879
Then at least give me back
the necklace...

220
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,389
so that I can get a refund.

221
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:43,889
- What is it?
- My goodness.

222
00:13:44,259 --> 00:13:46,129
Why is everyone
looking for me today?

223
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:47,730
Come in.

224
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:52,240
What is it?
Do you also want an allowance?

225
00:13:53,539 --> 00:13:55,009
I won't refuse if you give me some.

226
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,379
Then will you write
a written apology instead of me?

227
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,950
I'd rather get a wage cut.

228
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,210
I seriously don't want to write it.

229
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,620
Congratulations
on your reinstatement.

230
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:09,519
The suspension and this...

231
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,460
are all just warnings
so that I'll be more careful.

232
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,659
I'll do that.

233
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:16,389
You won't be causing
any more trouble, right?

234
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,929
Well... I guess so.

235
00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:23,970
Hey, don't give me
a heart attack like that.

236
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,200
I want to keep my job
for a long time.

237
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,809
Please help me out.

238
00:14:28,809 --> 00:14:32,110
I also want to see you
in that position for a long time.

239
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:34,909
You've become quite cheesy
these days.

240
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,679
Is it because
you're in a relationship?

241
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:39,679
There are so many articles
about you two these days.

242
00:14:40,149 --> 00:14:42,090
Be honest.

243
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,460
You two like each other, right?

244
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,360
Yes, you're right.

245
00:14:47,659 --> 00:14:49,789
You used to say that was not true.

246
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:52,659
I saw this coming.

247
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,230
Hold on.

248
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:57,029
Aren't I the matchmaker?

249
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:59,639
I called you two over for a drink,
and you two argued.

250
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:04,039
I've put in the most work
for you two.

251
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:07,440
If you get married, you better
buy me a really nice outfit.

252
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,509
Gosh, slow down.

253
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:13,080
There's no need to wait until then.

254
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,789
You should buy me one right now.

255
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:17,789
You're dating her thanks to me.

256
00:15:17,789 --> 00:15:20,419
Be easy on me.
I got a three-month wage cut.

257
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,230
Let me rest just one day.

258
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:28,429
My entire body is sore,
and I can't move.

259
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:30,570
Gosh, he's so weak.

260
00:15:38,379 --> 00:15:39,480
Are we done here?

261
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:44,379
Il Kwon, hear me out a bit more.

262
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,519
Don't do this. It's over.

263
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,019
We're finished.

264
00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:52,259
Il Kwon.

265
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,860
I was wrong.
I won't do that anymore.

266
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,830
- Please.
- How may I help you?

267
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:58,860
Sorry?

268
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:00,529
I live here.

269
00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:01,830
- Sorry?
- I know you still like me.

270
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,200
- I'm a resident here.
- Which unit?

271
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,769
I live here.

272
00:16:05,769 --> 00:16:07,200
Where?

273
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,240
Ha Kyung.

274
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:13,340
Oh, hi.

275
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,720
- She's my friend. It's okay.
- I see.

276
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,750
Thank you.

277
00:16:20,549 --> 00:16:22,590
- Bye.
- Where do you think you're going?

278
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,019
Aren't you here to see me?

279
00:16:24,019 --> 00:16:27,019
No. I was just passing by.

280
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,159
- Here?
- Yes.

281
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,559
Who is she?

282
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,500
Answer me.

283
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,940
We know each other through work.
It's nothing special.

284
00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:40,970
I'll let you two talk.

285
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,009
That's not true.

286
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:45,009
You're a special person to me.

287
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,279
So who is she?

288
00:16:48,379 --> 00:16:52,250
She teaches me sports.
You can leave.

289
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,379
Me?

290
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:56,919
Yes, I have no plans
to get back together, so leave.

291
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,320
Don't ever come back.

292
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,360
You're ridiculous.

293
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,099
Shouldn't you follow her?

294
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,500
I heard this is when the guy needs
to grab onto the woman.

295
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,799
- Are you playing hard to get...
- No.

296
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,309
There's someone I like.

297
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,170
In such a short time?

298
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:20,940
When? Who?

299
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,549
She teaches me sports.

300
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:26,549
You were learning another sport?

301
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,390
Which sport?

302
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,890
You really don't get it.

303
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:33,859
Then help me understand.

304
00:17:51,509 --> 00:17:52,609
It was me.

305
00:17:56,009 --> 00:17:57,150
Goodbye.

306
00:17:57,279 --> 00:17:59,680
Where are you going?
Are you leaving?

307
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,619
Yes. I think I should leave.

308
00:18:02,619 --> 00:18:04,619
- What does this mean?
- What?

309
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:06,019
Did I just get rejected?

310
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:07,890
No, it's not like that.

311
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,829
I think I'm right.

312
00:18:09,829 --> 00:18:11,329
I'm not that dull.

313
00:18:11,329 --> 00:18:13,029
No, I...

314
00:18:29,779 --> 00:18:31,480
What is this?

315
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,150
(Cool, hot pouch)

316
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,660
Did you have a good workout session?

317
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:51,839
What's up with her?

318
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,660
Starting today, we're dating.

319
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:20,430
(Sounds good.)

320
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,200
(Sounds good.)

321
00:19:26,069 --> 00:19:28,170
(Okay.)

322
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,079
Sir. Excuse me.

323
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,390
Are you all right, sir?

324
00:19:44,019 --> 00:19:47,890
My goodness. Please wake up.

325
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,529
- Yes, Dad.
- Hello?

326
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,339
Your dad drank too much tonight.

327
00:19:59,339 --> 00:20:02,140
You need to come and pick him up.

328
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:08,849
Lie down, Dad.

329
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:24,599
Lee Jeong Hoon!

330
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,829
Why won't you listen to me?

331
00:20:26,829 --> 00:20:30,170
Dad, I'm sorry.

332
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,400
Please let me out.

333
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,549
It's all my fault.

334
00:21:50,349 --> 00:21:51,720
I ruined...

335
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,549
Ha Na's life.

336
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,519
It should have been me
who got hurt that day.

337
00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:03,460
Don't say such a thing.

338
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:06,329
I feel so sorry to Ha Na.

339
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,970
She can't dance ballet anymore...

340
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,599
and got hurt badly...

341
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,599
all because of me.

342
00:22:16,809 --> 00:22:20,210
It feels like I stole
Ha Na's happiness too.

343
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,309
I feel so sorry.

344
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:26,880
Don't blame yourself.

345
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,990
It was an accident.

346
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:31,789
It's not your fault, Seo Yeon.

347
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,390
I want Ha Na to be happy again.

348
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:43,970
Just like before the accident,

349
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:47,200
I really want to see her...

350
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,809
smile brightly.

351
00:22:57,849 --> 00:22:58,920
Seo Yeon.

352
00:23:03,819 --> 00:23:06,259
I'm going to say
the same thing to Ha Jin.

353
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:09,829
That it's not Ha Jin's fault.

354
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,059
That it was an accident.

355
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:18,970
I can do that, right?

356
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:29,180
You can do this, right?

357
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,779
Of course, we can.

358
00:23:30,779 --> 00:23:32,279
I was talking to Ha Jin, Ms. Park.

359
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:34,150
- I'm so nervous.
- Ms. Park.

360
00:23:37,589 --> 00:23:38,890
Hello.

361
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:40,220
- Hi.
- Hello.

362
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,460
- Hello.
- Hello.

363
00:23:41,789 --> 00:23:44,759
The writer and the director
haven't arrived yet.

364
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,200
I'm going to use the restroom.

365
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,069
We have some time left.
Make it quick.

366
00:23:58,039 --> 00:23:59,839
Your read-through is
starting soon, right?

367
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:02,509
When you get nervous,
your pitch goes up. Be careful.

368
00:24:02,509 --> 00:24:04,480
As long as you get that
under control, it will go well.

369
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:07,720
This message is coming
from my teacher.

370
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,720
What about a message
from my boyfriend?

371
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,690
A message with a lot of love?

372
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:14,059
(Ha Jin: What about a message
from my boyfriend?)

373
00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:16,589
(A message with a lot of love?)

374
00:24:17,859 --> 00:24:19,930
You'll do well. I believe in you.

375
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:21,329
(You'll do well. I believe in you.)

376
00:24:21,329 --> 00:24:23,799
If he's going to send me a heart,
he should've sent me three.

377
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:24,970
(You'll do well. I believe in you.)

378
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:27,339
Ha Jin.

379
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:29,769
We need to go back in.

380
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:30,940
Okay. Let's go.

381
00:24:32,579 --> 00:24:34,009
Are you less nervous now?

382
00:24:34,009 --> 00:24:36,009
I'm good. I wasn't nervous.

383
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:39,079
- Good work.
- Good work.

384
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,890
- Good work.
- Good work.

385
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,190
(Ha Jin)

386
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:57,470
If Ha Jin's memory comes back,

387
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,970
it might be more serious
than you might expect.

388
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:05,339
To tell you the truth,

389
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:09,450
I'm more worried about Ha Jin
than you now.

390
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,950
Anchor Lee.

391
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:21,630
You're in a good mood.
I guess it went well today.

392
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:23,490
Totally. It was perfect.

393
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:24,789
You should have seen me.

394
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:26,559
I was fantastic today

395
00:25:27,099 --> 00:25:29,369
I can tell that
you had a few drinks.

396
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:32,299
The writer sat right next to me,

397
00:25:32,299 --> 00:25:34,069
so I couldn't dump
the drink in the cup.

398
00:25:34,069 --> 00:25:36,710
Are you all right? Do you need to
take something for the hangover?

399
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:37,970
I'm fine.

400
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:41,509
But I'm feeling so good right now.
I don't think I can go home now.

401
00:25:41,809 --> 00:25:43,910
I want to go home after spending
a bit more time with you.

402
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,819
At this hour?

403
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:49,319
- Where are we going?
- You need to decide that.

404
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,789
Lead the way.

405
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,559
How much farther must we walk?

406
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,900
I said I wanted
to get some fresh air.

407
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,029
I didn't want to go climbing today.

408
00:26:03,329 --> 00:26:05,339
You told me to lead the way.

409
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,769
We're here.

410
00:26:08,869 --> 00:26:09,869
Ta-da.

411
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,609
This is beautiful.

412
00:26:15,049 --> 00:26:16,049
Isn't it?

413
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:20,450
I really wanted
to come here with you.

414
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:24,519
Did you want to come here
with me that badly?

415
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:26,559
Yes.

416
00:26:31,859 --> 00:26:34,660
I've been so happy
every single day lately...

417
00:26:35,369 --> 00:26:38,099
to the point that makes me question
if I deserve this.

418
00:26:38,269 --> 00:26:40,170
You deserve to be happy.

419
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:43,869
So don't be afraid or nervous
even during your happy moments.

420
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:45,309
You don't need to.

421
00:26:45,579 --> 00:26:46,680
I know.

422
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,609
But I still get scared
even when I know.

423
00:26:59,589 --> 00:27:02,329
All right. Focus.

424
00:27:04,059 --> 00:27:06,859
Just focus on the present,
where we are,

425
00:27:07,529 --> 00:27:08,769
and just this moment.

426
00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:14,369
What do you feel?

427
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:16,569
Well,

428
00:27:17,539 --> 00:27:18,910
spring breeze.

429
00:27:20,309 --> 00:27:21,910
A beautiful night view.

430
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:24,980
And...

431
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,819
you right next to me.

432
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:37,329
That's all you need.
You don't need anything else.

433
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,099
You tell me yours.

434
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,799
Everything
you see and feel right now.

435
00:27:46,069 --> 00:27:48,339
I can only feel one thing.

436
00:27:49,309 --> 00:27:50,369
What is it?

437
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:54,710
It's something I've been wanting
to tell you for a long time.

438
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:55,950
But...

439
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:00,380
I couldn't tell you because I wasn't
sure if I should and got scared.

440
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,990
You shouldn't be afraid either.

441
00:28:04,619 --> 00:28:06,460
You don't need to be afraid...

442
00:28:06,859 --> 00:28:09,359
or nervous
even during your happy moments.

443
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:15,500
That I love you.

444
00:28:21,069 --> 00:28:23,309
I love you very much.

445
00:28:34,049 --> 00:28:35,589
Me too. I love you too.

446
00:28:51,269 --> 00:28:52,839
Gosh, this is great.

447
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:57,839
I'm hungry. Do you want to
grab something to eat?

448
00:28:58,579 --> 00:28:59,640
Are you hungry?

449
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:00,839
Yes.

450
00:29:01,779 --> 00:29:03,079
Okay, let's do that.
