00:00:01,169 --> 00:00:02,810
("Yeo Ha Jin Admits Her Relationship
With Lee Jeong Hoon")

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:05,440
That looks fine.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,750
That's what I said.

4
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:09,849
I said Anchor Lee and I are
getting to know each other.

5
00:00:09,849 --> 00:00:10,919
What?

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:14,519
What?

7
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:18,620
What did Yeo Ha Jin say?

8
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,690
"We currently have
good feelings for one another..."

9
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,629
"and are
getting to know each other."

10
00:00:22,629 --> 00:00:24,760
"Please continue to
show your support for us."

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
That's what she said.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,129
I can't believe
this attention-seeking lunatic.

13
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:31,440
What is she trying to do?

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,579
Hey, Anchor Lee.

15
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,850
Anchor Lee. Anchor Lee?

16
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:43,850
Anchor Lee.

17
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:46,350
Do you acknowledge your relationship
with Yeo Ha Jin? Do tell.

18
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,689
What do you like about her?

19
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:48,850
When did you two start dating?

20
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:50,289
How do you feel
about revealing this?

21
00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:51,960
- Please share a word.
- Please comment.

22
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,159
- Could you let us know?
- How do you feel?

23
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:55,929
- Anchor Lee, please tell us.
- Please.

24
00:00:55,929 --> 00:00:58,329
- Anchor Lee, how do you feel?
- Please share a word or two.

25
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:03,270
You're here early!

26
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:05,239
What's wrong with you?

27
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,140
What do you mean?
I didn't do anything.

28
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,909
It must've been hard to show up
for work today. Drink this.

29
00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:11,879
No, I'm fine. Is something wrong?

30
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,409
Not at all. Let's talk.

31
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:16,109
There's something we need
to discuss.

32
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:17,549
"Discuss"? With me?

33
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,549
Wait...

34
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:23,959
Hello, Anchor Lee.

35
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,260
I'm Yang Seok Hyun
from Daily Appreciation.

36
00:01:27,459 --> 00:01:29,030
I'm a junior of his from college.

37
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,099
This was it?

38
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:35,569
I mean, you'll need to say something
sooner or later.

39
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,739
In that case, it's better to say it
to someone whom you can trust.

40
00:01:38,739 --> 00:01:40,269
I promise not to exaggerate
or twist your words.

41
00:01:40,269 --> 00:01:42,739
I'll release a simple
and light article.

42
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:46,109
I heard you two are pretty close.

43
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,219
Yes, we're quite close.

44
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,750
Don't waste his time. Hurry up.

45
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:57,390
Okay. Yeo Ha Jin acknowledged
your relationship very quickly.

46
00:01:57,459 --> 00:01:59,790
But you haven't said anything.

47
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,790
That's why some people
are suspecting her of trying...

48
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,530
to promote her new movie
through this scandal.

49
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:10,639
But then again, many have witnessed
you two spending time together.

50
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,740
Just cut to the chase.

51
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,169
Are you two dating or not?

52
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,840
Think carefully before answering me.

53
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,849
Disclosing your relationship
to the public is very exhausting.

54
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:25,120
- We're not dating.
- But then again,

55
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,719
if you say no,

56
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:29,419
you'll be dumping her
in front of everyone.

57
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,590
Then people will coin you...

58
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:37,860
as "Nighttime Playboy".

59
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,300
I have nothing to say.

60
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,400
Jeong Hoon. Hey.

61
00:02:44,169 --> 00:02:46,039
I read the article.

62
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:49,469
I brought you two together
so that you could apologize to her.

63
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,580
So what in the world did you do?

64
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,750
You brought us together?

65
00:02:54,979 --> 00:02:56,409
It wasn't her?

66
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:57,949
What do you mean?

67
00:02:57,949 --> 00:02:59,780
I felt bad about everyone
bashing her,

68
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,919
so I offered her a drink.

69
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:02,620
And I told you to apologize to her.

70
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:28,050
So tell me. What did you like
so much about her...

71
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,710
to make your move?

72
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,349
You didn't seem that happy
when I was there.

73
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,419
You should be the last person
to say such things.

74
00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:37,360
You were there too.

75
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,990
That's not true. I left first...

76
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:42,289
and left you two behind.

77
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:45,460
I have absolutely no idea
what you two did after that.

78
00:03:46,129 --> 00:03:49,430
30 minutes after you left,
we left as well.

79
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,139
That photo was taken
right before we left.

80
00:03:52,969 --> 00:03:54,340
Nothing happened.

81
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:56,539
Are you sure
you didn't confuse her?

82
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:00,310
Are you sure you didn't
show any advances...

83
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:03,150
that made her think
you were interested in her?

84
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:04,620
I'm innocent.

85
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:08,219
So you two aren't dating.

86
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:11,960
But the entire country
thinks you are.

87
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,259
That's why I'm going crazy.

88
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,300
Then release an article,
saying that it's not true.

89
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,959
I want to do that as well.

90
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:24,100
But think about it.

91
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:27,870
They took a photo of us at night.

92
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,709
The employee at the bar,
the taxi driver,

93
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:33,649
and countless others
witnessed us together.

94
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:35,750
Moreover, she acknowledged it.

95
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,750
So if I were to say no immediately,

96
00:04:39,149 --> 00:04:43,420
I would look like a scumbag
to everyone.

97
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,860
I agree.

98
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,290
I don't believe it completely
either.

99
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,860
You do sound like a scumbag.

100
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,029
So imagine
how the people would think.

101
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:56,329
To be honest, the people
don't like her.

102
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:59,300
You'll be gaining nothing
from your relationship.

103
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,310
But denying this scandal isn't going
to look good on you either.

104
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:04,810
Then why did she acknowledge it?

105
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:07,509
Hey, maybe she likes you?

106
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:11,949
She's probably trying
to bring me down.

107
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,689
My gosh.

108
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:17,089
What kind of woman,
especially a celebrity,

109
00:05:17,089 --> 00:05:19,689
admits to a fake relationship
in order to bring a man down?

110
00:05:19,689 --> 00:05:22,829
You're right. It's unbelievable,
yet here she is.

111
00:05:22,829 --> 00:05:24,699
Whatever.

112
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:27,470
Call her yourself and fix it.

113
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,870
However, if this affects the news,

114
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:32,800
I will come for you two. Got it?

115
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,620
Jeong Hoon. Jeong Hoon.

116
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,089
You lied to me, didn't you?

117
00:05:47,089 --> 00:05:48,589
You deceived me.

118
00:05:48,589 --> 00:05:50,389
When did you two start dating?

119
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:52,089
- Hey.
- What is it?

120
00:05:52,089 --> 00:05:54,290
- Be quiet. Shut it.
- What is it?

121
00:05:56,129 --> 00:05:59,860
Can you find out her number?

122
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,699
Not her manager's,
but her personal one.

123
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:05,439
You don't know it?
Are you two not dating?

124
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:08,310
We aren't. I should sew
that mouth of yours.

125
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:09,970
You better listen to me
while I'm being nice.

126
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:13,410
Get her number at all costs, got it?

127
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:14,579
Okay.

128
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:21,519
Hello?

129
00:06:22,189 --> 00:06:23,389
It's me, Lee Jeong Hoon.

130
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:25,990
What? Hello?

131
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,560
It's Lee Jeong Hoon.

132
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:29,959
Who?

133
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,129
Where are you?

134
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:35,199
Are you Anchor Lee?

135
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,100
Yes. It's me.

136
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:42,610
One minute.

137
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:44,980
Let me put on your microphone.

138
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,709
Are we starting right now?

139
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:47,709
Yes.

140
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,310
I need to take this.

141
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,879
- It's Ha Jin.
- Oh, my!

142
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:53,680
Goodness.

143
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,689
You must be talking with Anchor Lee.

144
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,790
Hello?

145
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,420
Can you talk now?

146
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,589
Yes, I can.

147
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,160
When are you free?

148
00:07:04,329 --> 00:07:05,699
Don't we need to talk?

149
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:07,569
Goodness, director.

150
00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:09,129
Over here.

151
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,069
Anchor Lee, hello.

152
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,110
Hello, I'm Hong Yoon Hwa,
the cute reporter...

153
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,069
from "Section TV
Entertainment News".

154
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:19,709
I'm having an outdoor date
with Ha Jin today.

155
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:21,509
Can we talk for a bit?

156
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:27,819
- He must be flustered.
- Yes.

157
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:30,889
Ha Jin filmed a new movie...

158
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:32,420
called "My First Love".

159
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,430
Please cheer for her.

160
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:39,000
- Lee Jeong Hoon, Lee Jeong Hoon!
- Lee Jeong Hoon, Lee Jeong Hoon!

161
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,670
Anchor Lee?

162
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,370
It's him, right?

163
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:43,500
Yes, it is.

164
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,769
Please say something.
We're filming right now.

165
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,750
I cheer for her.

166
00:07:58,579 --> 00:07:59,649
Is that all?

167
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,019
- I think so.
- I see.

168
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,920
I'll call you again
once I'm done filming.

169
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:12,860
What is her deal?

170
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,930
- He must be busy, right?
- Yes.

171
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:17,500
I see. Let's continue talking
about your movie.

172
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,600
How many people do you think
will watch it?

173
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,040
I expect 10 million.

174
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,509
10 million, all right!
Make some noise!

175
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,289
Come in.

176
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:40,289
A few of the patients wanted
to change their afternoon schedules,

177
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:41,659
so I revised it.

178
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:44,600
Thanks. You should go eat.

179
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:46,200
Go eat with Soo Jin.

180
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,070
There will be no patients
any time soon,

181
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,629
so take your time.

182
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,500
You just need to come by 2:30 p.m.

183
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,940
Really? Thank you.

184
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,039
You read up on the scandal.

185
00:08:57,409 --> 00:08:59,080
I was totally shocked.

186
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:01,610
Right. Me too.

187
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:05,049
Does Anchor Lee also know
about her condition?

188
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,220
What do you mean?

189
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:11,960
Ha Jin consulted you once.

190
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,190
I was wondering
if Anchor Lee knew about it.

191
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,830
He's close with you.

192
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,100
That is right.

193
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,299
But still,

194
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:24,870
it's not right to disclose
your patients' information.

195
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:27,710
Do you not think so?

196
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,480
Of course, I do.

197
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:33,039
I'm glad to hear that.

198
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,210
I expect you to continue
thinking that way.

199
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,779
Go have lunch.

200
00:09:37,049 --> 00:09:38,120
Yes, sir.

201
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,299
(Yoo Mental Health Clinic)

202
00:10:01,409 --> 00:10:03,740
- You haven't eaten yet, have you?
- No.

203
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,379
There's a nice Korean table d'hote
restaurant nearby. Shall we go?

204
00:10:06,379 --> 00:10:07,610
I don't need to eat.

205
00:10:08,509 --> 00:10:12,149
Did you know that Jeong Hoon
almost ruined the news yesterday?

206
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,289
Oh, that?

207
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:16,889
I met him after that,
and it was nothing.

208
00:10:16,889 --> 00:10:17,990
You don't need to worry about him.

209
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,759
You shouldn't say that.

210
00:10:20,659 --> 00:10:23,190
Did his results come out?

211
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,460
I stopped by for that.

212
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,129
Jeong Hoon is doing fine.

213
00:10:27,129 --> 00:10:28,570
He'll get those tests done soon.

214
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,399
Since you're here,
you should come up.

215
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,570
I'll give you some coffee,
and you can look around.

216
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:35,009
Forget it. I don't need to.

217
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,110
Just stop by our house soon.

218
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:38,909
Do you know
it's Mom's birthday soon?

219
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:43,379
She raised you, you know?
Be more friendly toward her.

220
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,980
Of course. I'll visit her.

221
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,289
I haven't had a chance.
It's been busy lately.

222
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,289
- I'm leaving.
- Okay.

223
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,809
Ha Jin, if anyone asks you
about the scandal with Anchor Lee,

224
00:11:11,809 --> 00:11:12,980
don't say anything.

225
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,549
Don't respond to that. Just smile.

226
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,750
Okay.

227
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,850
But did you two talk...

228
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,080
after the article was published?

229
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,889
No, not yet.

230
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:24,059
I've been so busy. I had
a lot of shoots here and there.

231
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,519
Could he be mad
that our phone call aired...

232
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,830
during the street interview?

233
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:31,360
My gosh, the MC got me
when he called.

234
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:34,470
Do you think he could be mad
just about the call?

235
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,139
Why don't I have
one piece of chocolate?

236
00:11:39,769 --> 00:11:40,769
Here.

237
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,039
They are beautiful.

238
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,179
They are way prettier in person
than in the photos.

239
00:11:46,179 --> 00:11:47,179
Right?

240
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:49,850
You've been glowing lately.

241
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,350
There was a reason for it.

242
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:54,220
How long have you been dating
the anchor?

243
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,220
Have you been seeing each other
before the interview?

244
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,289
It's not that.

245
00:11:59,289 --> 00:12:00,690
You should try on the clothes.

246
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,059
Is someone inside the fitting room?

247
00:12:07,299 --> 00:12:09,070
I thought
it was getting noisy in here.

248
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,600
You were here, Ha Jin.

249
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:15,370
Hello.

250
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:18,179
Hi. I didn't know you shopped here.

251
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:21,250
Articles about your scandal
have been flooding the media today.

252
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,080
Try to be considerate
in public spaces.

253
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,549
What if you ruin...

254
00:12:24,549 --> 00:12:26,549
his good reputation
because he's lumped up with you?

255
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:30,789
I don't think I saw that
in the catalog earlier.

256
00:12:30,789 --> 00:12:34,360
Yes, this came in to match
the theme of Ha Jin's photoshoot.

257
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,090
The photoshoot is sponsored
by this clothing line.

258
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:37,960
Give me that.

259
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,100
- Let me try that on.
- Pardon?

260
00:12:40,299 --> 00:12:41,899
You can wear my outfit.

261
00:12:42,169 --> 00:12:44,000
I'm the model for this brand.

262
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,700
Since you have a photoshoot,

263
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,100
I'll be generous.

264
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,309
I think she explained it explicitly.

265
00:12:50,309 --> 00:12:53,440
They exclusively asked Ha Jin
to wear this for the photoshoot.

266
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,950
I don't have time.

267
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,620
Sure. I'll give it to you.

268
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,620
What are you talking about?
That's for you.

269
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,149
It's okay. I can wear
her outfit this time.

270
00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:02,919
And I can wear that
for another photoshoot.

271
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:07,360
- But will you be okay?
- What do you mean?

272
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,629
I don't have a problem
wearing your outfit,

273
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:13,230
but I'm afraid I might get an offer
for that brand like last time.

274
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,700
I didn't mean to do that,

275
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:18,070
but I feel bad about stealing
your sponsorships.

276
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:19,970
What?

277
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,970
I have a lot of time
since I'm done with my shoots.

278
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:23,570
Think about it and let me know.

279
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,039
I'll wait outside.

280
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:26,710
- Let's get some coffee.
- Sure.

281
00:13:31,779 --> 00:13:33,720
That little wench.

282
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,059
What a surprise.
You told her off good this time.

283
00:13:40,059 --> 00:13:42,860
It feels great to get back at her
once in our lives.

284
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,299
Don't exaggerate.

285
00:13:44,299 --> 00:13:46,299
Is there a cafe nearby?
Should we walk?

286
00:13:46,299 --> 00:13:47,330
Forget about the cafe.

287
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,870
You go in. I'll take care of this.

288
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:49,929
I noticed that your dark circles...

289
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:51,139
came all the way down
to your chin this morning.

290
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:52,169
Same with you.

291
00:13:52,169 --> 00:13:54,169
Don't upload photos on social media
because you're bored.

292
00:13:54,169 --> 00:13:55,409
Don't answer calls from reporters.

293
00:13:55,409 --> 00:13:57,509
Don't go anywhere. Got it?

294
00:13:57,639 --> 00:13:59,139
Drop her off
and I'll see you at the office.

295
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:00,210
Okay. I'll see you later.

296
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,809
Right. I really don't care
about the clothes.

297
00:14:01,809 --> 00:14:03,149
Don't be so angry when you go back.

298
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:04,620
Okay? Bye.

299
00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:06,080
Bye.

300
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:07,919
My gosh.

301
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,049
She's no villainess.

302
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,429
- She posted another one?
- You startled me.

303
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:19,559
You startled me.

304
00:14:21,169 --> 00:14:22,600
What? Is there a problem?

305
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,799
I'm worried that Ha Jin
might upload another post.

306
00:14:25,169 --> 00:14:27,940
No. Will Anchor Lee upload a post?

307
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:30,809
Chul, you should spy on
Anchor Lee's social media account.

308
00:14:30,809 --> 00:14:32,139
- Okay.
- Ms. Park.

309
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:33,679
If we see it on there,

310
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:35,610
it means everyone else
probably saw it too.

311
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:36,610
Game over.

312
00:14:37,549 --> 00:14:39,580
My gosh. You're right.

313
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,850
Luckily, he's not on social media.

314
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:43,350
I'm not sure
if it's fortunate or unfortunate.

315
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,490
My gosh, it's such a long day.

316
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:47,289
("An Actress and Anchor Are Dating,
the Couple of the Century")

317
00:14:53,129 --> 00:14:55,629
Jeong Hoon, you're not
what I had pictured at all.

318
00:14:55,899 --> 00:14:57,299
What are you talking about?

319
00:14:57,299 --> 00:15:00,500
I had no idea that
you were loved by the ladies.

320
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:03,070
When you won the award
for the most trusted journalist,

321
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,210
I could understand it because
it was about your profession.

322
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:08,509
But I had no idea that
you could win over women's hearts.

323
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:09,750
Stop talking nonsense.

324
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,049
And do your work when I ask nicely.

325
00:15:12,049 --> 00:15:13,149
My gosh.

326
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,919
Look.

327
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,019
- What?
- It's like a combination.

328
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:19,860
This one article is
an either-or situation.

329
00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:20,889
My gosh.

330
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,889
All the comments for you say,

331
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:24,559
"Lee Jeong Hoon
is too good for her."

332
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:26,600
"Jeong Hoon, be happy."

333
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,600
Your comments are positive,
but the comments for Ha Jin say,

334
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,039
"You're going after an anchor too?"

335
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:32,070
"You messed up the live broadcast."

336
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:34,169
"You're trying to fix it
by seducing a man."

337
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:35,539
These are all hateful comments.

338
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:38,080
To be precise,
you were the one who...

339
00:15:38,509 --> 00:15:40,279
Stop reading articles
from the entertainment section.

340
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,649
Or I'll transfer you
to the entertainment department.

341
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:44,679
You can be so mean sometimes.

342
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,929
Is he that mad?

343
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,570
Yes. I should call him.

344
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:09,840
Should I call
after the news is over?

345
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,980
My gosh,
that's such a late hour then.

346
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,850
If you're available,
let's meet after the news.

347
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:24,460
Text me a good place
and time for you.

348
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:27,460
He'll give me an earful.

349
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,039
Where are you?

350
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:44,309
I'm on my way.

351
00:16:44,309 --> 00:16:45,909
I'm almost there.

352
00:16:51,419 --> 00:16:53,519
Must we meet at a place like this?

353
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,919
You said you didn't want
to get photographed anymore.

354
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:57,590
And you don't want people
to spot us.

355
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,220
Then, that's the perfect place.

356
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,659
Wait, did I come to the wrong place?

357
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:05,099
Can you turn
on your emergency lights?

358
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:15,339
There you are.

359
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:16,809
I found you. I'm coming.

360
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,000
We meet again.

361
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,069
You are consistent.

362
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,670
During the interview, you said
that I wasn't consistent...

363
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,210
and was a fickle person, didn't you?

364
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:52,579
Unexpectedly,
you have a good memory.

365
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,609
That wasn't a compliment, right?

366
00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:56,480
You're being sarcastic.

367
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,779
I can read your sarcasm now.

368
00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:00,619
Since you're quick at catching on,
you must know...

369
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,920
that how flustered, puzzled,
and angry I must be.

370
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,259
I can see that with one look at you.

371
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,660
Okay. I misunderstood
the situation yesterday.

372
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,859
So are you trying
to get even with me?

373
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:14,930
Why on earth
are you doing this to me?

374
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,230
Yes, I'm getting even with you.

375
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,900
To be honest,
I wanted you to suffer too.

376
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,369
I thought it was unfair that I came
home without explaining myself.

377
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,339
But the real reason behind is...

378
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:28,809
that you were right.

379
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:32,819
You asked me if I was interested
in you yesterday.

380
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:36,019
As it turns out,
I was interested in you.

381
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:39,519
When I said I was
getting to know you,

382
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:41,589
I wasn't lying.

383
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,059
I am very interested in you.

384
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:46,960
So I want to start seeing you now.

385
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,029
I don't want to.

386
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,170
You could at least say that...

387
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:56,809
you'll think about it.

388
00:18:57,539 --> 00:18:59,039
How could you say no right away?

389
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,509
Because there's nothing
to think about.

390
00:19:01,509 --> 00:19:04,009
You misunderstood
the situation last night.

391
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:06,319
You still don't know about me.

392
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:08,190
That might be true,

393
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,420
but I have another reason.

394
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:12,420
What is it?

395
00:19:14,829 --> 00:19:16,930
I told you I didn't remember
my first love.

396
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,259
That was a lie.

397
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:22,130
I still haven't gotten over her.

398
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,700
I still love her.

399
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,839
That's why I have no intention
of seeing other people...

400
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:29,569
whether it's you or someone else.

401
00:19:31,579 --> 00:19:33,309
I didn't peg you...

402
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:36,609
to be like that.

403
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:38,079
What do you mean?

404
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,980
Did you mean to say that
I'm a romantic or something?

405
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,750
No, not that. You're lame.

406
00:19:44,089 --> 00:19:46,089
You're way more uncool
than I thought.

407
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,930
Think about it.

408
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:49,289
If you haven't gotten over her,

409
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:52,299
it means you two are no longer
involved in a relationship.

410
00:19:52,529 --> 00:19:55,700
You're still holding onto her
when it's over for you two.

411
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,130
That's so uncool.

412
00:19:57,829 --> 00:19:59,299
I might not be completely
correct here,

413
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:01,410
but I doubt that
the lady wants you...

414
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:04,039
to not meet other women
because you haven't gotten over her.

415
00:20:04,609 --> 00:20:06,180
She might hate it.

416
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,809
Anyway,

417
00:20:08,509 --> 00:20:10,480
I hear your rejection
loud and clear.

418
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,750
But if we tell the press
that we're not involved,

419
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,250
both of us will become
the laughing stock.

420
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,460
Let's keep this
until my movie stops showing.

421
00:20:20,259 --> 00:20:21,690
When will that be?

422
00:20:22,059 --> 00:20:24,289
If it's popular,
it will last a month or two.

423
00:20:25,329 --> 00:20:28,029
If it's a flop,
it stops showing in two weeks.

424
00:20:28,029 --> 00:20:29,470
Let's settle on two weeks.

425
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:31,339
Why?

426
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:33,670
Do you think my movie won't do well?

427
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:35,069
To be honest, yes.

428
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:36,910
In fact,

429
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,940
I agree with you.

430
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,849
Let's settle on two weeks.

431
00:20:42,109 --> 00:20:43,109
My gosh.

432
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:46,779
You seem pretty laid back
for a woman burning with resentment.

433
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:50,490
See that?
You still don't know me very well.

434
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:54,519
Even if you regret turning me down,
I won't take you back.

435
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:00,430
Then let's release the article
in two weeks.

436
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:02,170
You know,
with the reasons we always use.

437
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:05,970
"We were too busy to be
more considerate of one another,"

438
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,500
"so we broke up in peace."
Something like that.

439
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,670
And one more thing.

440
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,910
Let's stay as low as we can
for the next two weeks.

441
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,339
Don't make any comments
when it comes to each other.

442
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:16,809
I don't want to see
more articles on this.

443
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,079
It's not a great idea
to be seen often...

444
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:21,549
if we're a couple
who'll break up in two weeks.

445
00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:23,119
Don't worry about that.

446
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:25,920
They follow you around persistently
before you admit to the romance.

447
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,089
Once you make it official,
they'll lose interest.

448
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:36,470
I don't think
they lost their interest at all.

449
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:37,529
You're right.

450
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,769
Start driving so that
they can't take more pictures.

451
00:21:39,769 --> 00:21:40,799
What about your car?

452
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,240
I can come back and pick it up.

453
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,910
If I get off now,
they'll take millions of pictures.

454
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:45,440
Hurry up and go. Hurry.

455
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:00,819
Oh Se Min of Daily Appreciation.

456
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,690
Jang Seo Won of The Prime.

457
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,200
Those reporters?

458
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,700
Yes.

459
00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:08,869
Do you know them?

460
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,569
I don't know them too well.

461
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,640
I've met them a few times.

462
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,369
Where do you live?

463
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:18,710
It's late. I'll give you a ride.

464
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:20,680
I'll punch in my address.

465
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,509
It'll take about half an hour.

466
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,420
Hey.

467
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,619
It's snowing.

468
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:03,180
Seo Yeon.

469
00:24:09,019 --> 00:24:10,049
Seo Yeon.

470
00:24:11,089 --> 00:24:12,119
Seo Yeon.

471
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,529
Seo Yeon, are you okay?
Wake up, Seo Yeon!

472
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:17,660
Seo Yeon...

473
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,670
Seo Yeon, stay with me.

474
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:22,930
- Seo Yeon, stay with me.
- Jeong Hoon.

475
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,730
Stay with me, Seo Yeon!

476
00:24:26,069 --> 00:24:27,339
I'm sorry.

477
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,710
No. No. No, Seo Yeon.

478
00:24:31,109 --> 00:24:32,140
Seo Yeon.

479
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,109
Seo Yeon, open your eyes.
Seo Yeon, open... Open your eyes!

480
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:58,970
What's wrong?

481
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,170
I'm sorry, but you have to get off.

482
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:04,509
What?

483
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,849
I'm not in the right condition
to drive, so I can't drive you home.

484
00:25:09,779 --> 00:25:10,950
Please take a taxi.

485
00:25:11,849 --> 00:25:13,579
Wait, what do you mean?

486
00:25:14,619 --> 00:25:16,019
Why are you suddenly saying that?

487
00:25:17,089 --> 00:25:18,359
Do you feel sick?

488
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:49,190
Does Anchor Lee also know
about her condition?

489
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,450
What do you think you're doing?

490
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,650
Don't you think this is
a bit too much?

491
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,849
Do I look like a joke to you
just because I said I like you?

492
00:26:20,849 --> 00:26:22,319
Do you think you can
just kick me around?

493
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:25,319
Take it however you want.

494
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:28,559
Hey.

495
00:26:29,059 --> 00:26:31,799
You treat me like a weird woman
who suddenly had a crush on you,

496
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:33,559
then who suddenly gets angry,

497
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:37,099
but I didn't suddenly
have a random crush on you.

498
00:26:37,099 --> 00:26:38,940
You're partially responsible too.

499
00:26:41,069 --> 00:26:42,170
It was in the news studio...

500
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,880
when I approached you
and asked if you were okay.

501
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:50,079
The way you looked at me.

502
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,190
That's where everything began.

503
00:26:56,849 --> 00:26:58,990
I kept thinking of your eyes.

504
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:03,259
"Why did he look so sad?"

505
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:07,730
"Why did he look at me
with such eyes?"

506
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:13,299
"What was he saying
in that silence?"

507
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,809
Silence is always harder than words.

508
00:27:23,579 --> 00:27:26,420
We can say more things in silence...

509
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,619
than with fancy words.

510
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:31,349
We say more things in silence...

511
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,329
than the words we say out loud.

512
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,599
It's that face again.

Nothing.

516
00:28:31,819 --> 00:28:34,950
I don't want to do anything.

517
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:45,660
I just want to disappear...

518
00:28:50,869 --> 00:28:52,000
as if...

519
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:58,009
I never existed.

520
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,420
Do you know...

521
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:09,390
someone named Jung Seo Yeon?

522
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,390
Jung Seo Yeon?

(Patient Chart: Yeo Ha Jin)

524
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,400
Yes.

525
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:57,000
Jung Seo Yeon.

526
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,599
Do you know her?

527
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:05,380
No, I've never
heard that name before.

528
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:07,339
Who is that?

529
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,180
It doesn't ring any bell?

530
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,650
No, I don't know anyone
with that name.

531
00:30:15,349 --> 00:30:16,920
Who's Jung Seo Yeon?

532
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:25,730

Why don't you know Ha Jin?

00:31:03,369 --> 00:31:04,670
You knew, didn't you?

537
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:06,240
It was a lie when you said...

538
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,400
you didn't know her.

539
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,970
Ha Jin had changed.

540
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:10,369
It seemed as if
nothing had happened.

541
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:12,210
I feel too bad.

542

What's this truth
that I don't know but you do?

545
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:23,089
It oddly feels like
you'll quickly disappear...

546
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:25,259
if I don't hold onto you tightly.

547
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:27,519
I hope we'll never have to meet...

548
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:28,960
or be in contact again.

549

I mean it.
