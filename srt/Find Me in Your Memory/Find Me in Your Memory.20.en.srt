1
00:00:01,669 --> 00:00:03,140
(Episode 20)

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:04,139
Be careful.

3
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:10,820
Hang in there.

4
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:19,120
Are you all right?

5
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:21,489
- Yes.
- Where's Ji Hyun Geun?

6
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:23,059
He's in the garage.

7
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:25,000
You two can get in the car.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,829
We'll control
the rest of the situation.

9
00:00:26,829 --> 00:00:27,829
Let's go.

10
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:32,539
Ha Jin.

11
00:00:35,509 --> 00:00:36,670
Ha Kyung.

12
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:57,460
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

13
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:01,229
You don't need to be sorry.

14
00:01:06,969 --> 00:01:08,109
I'm so relieved.

15
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,239
What a relief.

16
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,239
It's okay.

17
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,379
It's all over.

18
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,549
Let's go.

19
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:21,620
Let's go.

20
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:28,730
Goodness, Ha Jin.

21
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:31,129
Ha Jin, are you okay?

22
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:33,629
Ha Jin, are you all right?

23
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,099
Wake up, Ha Jin.

24
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,540
- Goodness.
- You jerk.

25
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,609
- Don't come near me!
- Hey!

26
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:46,109
- Don't come near!
- Stop it.

27
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,549
Let me go! Let go of me!

28
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:52,920
Let me go!

29
00:01:54,349 --> 00:01:55,450
Let me go!

30
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,819
- He's here.
- They're back.

31
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:01,829
Is it true that
Ms. Yeo Ha Jin was abducted?

32
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:04,030
How is she doing? Is she all right?

33
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,799
We thought the police
had been protecting her.

34
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:07,170
How was she abducted?

35
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,169
Who's the culprit?

36
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,370
Is her stalker
also the one who abducted her?

37
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,669
Yes, he was.

38
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,610
We will debrief you soon
on the result of our investigation.

39
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,610
- When do you plan on doing that?
- Who was the stalker?

40
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,680
- There he is!
- What is this?

41
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,409
- Who is it?
- How do you feel?

42
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:23,280
- Why did you abduct her?
- Show us your face!

43
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,449
- Say something.
- Why did you do that?

44
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:27,020
- Say something.
- Share a word.

45
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,020
Say something.

46
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,949
- Why did you do that?
- Why did you abduct her?

47
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:32,020
- Since when did you...
- How did you get...

48
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:34,960
Hey, aren't you Ji Hyun Geun,
the film director?

49
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,389
- Ji Hyun Geun?
- It's Ji Hyun Geun!

50
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:37,599
- It's Ji Hyun Geun!
- Hey!

51
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:43,400
I really wasn't trying to hurt her.

52
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:45,240
I know I wasn't
supposed to do that,

53
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,469
but I was in need of money.

54
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:49,469
You wanted to gamble
and buy luxurious goods,

55
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,240
so you stole her sponsored goods,
pocketed clothes that were borrowed,

56
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,250
and broke into her house?

57
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,979
I'm sorry about that.

58
00:02:57,379 --> 00:03:00,789
But I really was going to
tell her everything and apologize.

59
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,289
I waited for her many times
in front of the studio,

60
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:04,719
but she had bodyguards...

61
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,759
("Suspect Ji Hyun Geun Arrested
for the Abduction of Yeo Ha Jin")

62
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:11,400
Man, Ji Hyun Geun, that jerk!

63
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,409
Ms. Park, please stop crying.

64
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:28,509
These are tears of happiness.
Don't worry about me.

65
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:32,280
Why would you cry when you're happy?
You should smile.

66
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,150
She didn't collapse
because she's hurt.

67
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,219
It just means she can finally relax.

68
00:03:36,219 --> 00:03:38,389
She's sound asleep, so don't worry.

69
00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:40,930
I know. I heard that with you.

70
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:44,530
It's her birthday today.
We can't let her feel gloomy.

71
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,599
We should show her a smile
when she wakes up.

72
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:49,430
You're right.
I can't look miserable.

73
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,900
Stop crying.

74
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,939
Ha Kyung.

75
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,770
- Ha Jin.
- Ha Jin.

76
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:56,639
Ha Jin.

77
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:00,280
Ms. Park.

78
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:02,849
Ha Jin, you've done well.

79
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,250
You've done so well
in returning safely...

80
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,719
and waking up bravely.

81
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,520
Thank you, Ha Jin.

82
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:12,020
I'm sorry I made you worried.

83
00:04:12,189 --> 00:04:13,860
You shouldn't have to be sorry.

84
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,460
I'm the one who's sorry.

85
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:18,459
Ha Jin, look over there.

86
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:21,300
Your fans sent you presents
to help you feel better.

87
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,569
Gosh, I got so many presents.

88
00:04:30,379 --> 00:04:32,379
I'm so thankful for all of them.

89
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,509
Look, don't you love
those flowers too?

90
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:38,250
Yes, they're very pretty.

91
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,319
Anyway, it feels like...

92
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,019
what happened yesterday night
was nothing but a dream.

93
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,430
A really bad nightmare.

94
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:51,060
Yes, let's just think of that
as nothing but a nightmare...

95
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,430
and forget all about it.

96
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:54,470
I should do that.

97
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,100
If I don't,
it'll make my birthday way too sad.

98
00:04:57,269 --> 00:05:00,439
Yes, it was a bad dream.
Forget all about it.

99
00:05:02,509 --> 00:05:05,209
Right, where's Anchor Lee?

100
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:07,579
He left right after
you were hospitalized.

101
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,709
Oh, I see.

102
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:11,550
You should call him.

103
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,250
No, he must be busy at work.

104
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,620
I'll wait until he calls me.

105
00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:00,600
You're the one who's insane.

106
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,230
You couldn't get over
your dead girlfriend...

107
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,740
and began to
hit on her friend, Ha Jin.

108
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,300
Stop pretending
like you're so great!

109
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,639
Hey, Tae Eun.

110
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:41,209
You were right...

111
00:06:41,209 --> 00:06:42,509
about Director Ji.

112
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,540
Is everything all right, then?

113
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:47,779
Yes. Hey, I forgot to call you.

114
00:06:47,779 --> 00:06:48,850
I was out of it.

115
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:51,519
Of course, you were out of it.

116
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:53,920
But I'm relieved
the culprit was caught.

117
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,920
Is Ha Jin all right?

118
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,259
She's at the hospital.

119
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:00,589
She's not badly hurt,
but we're checking just in case.

120
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,899
When you have some time,
please give her a hand.

121
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,829
You said you were a good doctor.

122
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,670
All right, man.

123
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,600
And let me know
if you need any help too.

124
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,300
Yes, I will call you,
so I expect huge help from you.

125
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,639
All right, then. I'm glad
everything is okay. Bye, then.

126
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,040
Okay. I'll call you again.

127
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,560
Yeo Ha Jin's stalker
who also abducted her was...

128
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,899
found to be
Film Director Ji Hyun Geun.

129
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,800
- Ji had been obsessing over her...
- Wow.

130
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,639
Look at smiling
even with all those cameras on him.

131
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:47,310
I told you that
he looked really awful...

132
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,240
when he came for the interview,
didn't I?

133
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,339
I did think he was extraordinary,

134
00:07:52,779 --> 00:07:55,209
but I didn't know
he was such a scary guy.

135
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:57,180
You really don't have
a good discernment on people.

136
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,649
Where's the picture that he took?

137
00:07:59,649 --> 00:08:00,850
Let me burn them all.

138
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,949
I already got rid of that.

139
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,660
Ha Jin must've been shocked.

140
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,389
She probably worked very hard for
months filming that movie with him.

141
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:12,430
And he turns out to be her stalker.

142
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:15,529
Goodness, it's really difficult...

143
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:17,269
to live as a celebrity.

144
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,540
It's very hard.

145
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:20,540
Should I call her?

146
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,939
Call who? Jeong Hoon?

147
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:24,079
No, Ha Jin. I'm worried about her.

148
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:27,009
She probably has no time for that.
Let her get some rest.

149
00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:30,009
We can ask Jeong Hoon later
and visit her or something.

150
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:32,419
You're going to visit her alone
with Jeong Hoon, right?

151
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:33,990
You can't do that.
You have to take me.

152
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:39,259
Since when were you so close
to Yeo Ha Jin? Stop overreacting.

153
00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:40,759
Of course, we're close.

154
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:43,259
I even sent Jeong Hoon to her...

155
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:45,230
to comfort her.

156
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,330
Goodness.

157
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:50,269
Why? Are you jealous
that I'm close to her?

158
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,000
Hey, you're really jealous.

159
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,269
Don't look at me like that.

160
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,610
This isn't home.

161
00:08:56,809 --> 00:08:58,779
And stop talking casually.

162
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:01,179
It doesn't matter.
We're here by ourselves.

163
00:09:01,179 --> 00:09:03,850
If you're done watching the news,
get back to work.

164
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,620
Go now. Get up. Go.

165
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,850
And when Jeong Hoon gets here,

166
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,149
bring him to me.

167
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:13,419
This isn't our house, you jerk.

168
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:16,960
Yes, ma'am.

169
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,370
(Call Log)

170
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:22,399
(Anchor Lee)

171
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,909
Has he called yet?

172
00:09:29,539 --> 00:09:30,580
No.

173
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,480
Goodness.

174
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,980
Just call him first.

175
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,809
I'm going to wait.

176
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:40,250
You were always the one
who didn't listen and called him.

177
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:44,289
He helped out a lot.

178
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:46,019
He was searching everywhere for you.

179
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:49,090
If it wasn't for him,
we wouldn't have found that villa.

180
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,259
Really?

181
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,299
He probably thinks
that you're still asleep.

182
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:59,470
Maybe he's not calling you
on purpose so you can rest.

183
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,009
What if that's not true?

184
00:10:02,409 --> 00:10:04,909
"Not true"? What do you mean?

185
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,809
- Never mind.
- What is it?

186
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:11,720
Forget it. I'm going to take a nap.

187
00:10:15,419 --> 00:10:17,590
Cover yourself properly.
There you go.

188
00:10:22,659 --> 00:10:24,029
(Reporter Jo)

189
00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:27,029
How could you do this to me?
I'm truly hurt.

190
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,570
Reporter Jo.

191
00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:41,480
How could you not tell me...

192
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,450
about all the things that happened?

193
00:10:43,549 --> 00:10:45,950
I'm sorry. I'll treat you
to something delicious instead.

194
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,850
I'm really hurt, you know?

195
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,490
I even offered my place
for you guys.

196
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:53,759
I know. I promise to treat you
to something scrumptious.

197
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:55,659
I don't usually
introduce this place to others.

198
00:10:55,659 --> 00:10:57,730
But you're an exception, okay?

199
00:10:58,129 --> 00:10:59,159
Where is it?

200
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,799
Get in first. It'll take some time.

201
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,500
Hurry up.

202
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:08,639
So this was it?

203
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,210
I'm not a big fan of rice soup.

204
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:14,250
How is that possible?
It's a Korean, hearty meal.

205
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:17,250
Try it first. It'll be the best
rice soup you've ever had.

206
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:19,149
Fine.

207
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,120
Here it comes. All right.

208
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,120
It looks so good.

209
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:28,659
Thank you.

210
00:11:28,659 --> 00:11:30,159
- Enjoy your food.
- Thank you.

211
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,029
All right.

212
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,029
I don't like to add
a lot of things to mine.

213
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,480
What? I didn't say
you could do this.

214
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,710
Just try it.

215
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,379
If you don't like it,
I'll order something else.

216
00:11:54,649 --> 00:11:55,690
Isn't it good?

217
00:11:56,289 --> 00:11:59,460
It hurts my pride to say this,
but it is good.

218
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:05,360
It's the best rice soup ever.
It's really delicious.

219
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,830
I told you.

220
00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:09,029
You'll crave this again
tomorrow morning.

221
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:10,899
- Eat up.
- Okay.

222
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:13,940
Director Ji Hyun Geun, who stalked
and abducted actress Yeo Ha Jin,

223
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,539
was arrested.

224
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,809
He broke into her house...

225
00:12:17,809 --> 00:12:19,809
- How dare you smile?
- and stalked her continuously.

226
00:12:19,809 --> 00:12:20,879
He's currently under arrest...

227
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:23,409
for locking her up
in his villa in Gyeonggi Province.

228
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:24,950
Are you okay?

229
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,419
He looks fine.

230
00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:29,750
Even after doing what he did,
that psychopath looks fine!

231
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,259
After locking her up...

232
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:32,919
I should've punched him
when I had the chance.

233
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,690
He cooperated with the police...

234
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,629
- Do you want to throw some punches?
- so that they wouldn't suspect him.

235
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:50,240
Look at your score.

236
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,940
I want to do it again.
Give me a dollar.

237
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:52,940
A dollar?

238
00:12:54,909 --> 00:12:57,080
This won't do. Follow me.

239
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,620
Where are you going?
I'm not done here.

240
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,460
Hey, don't do that.

241
00:13:06,659 --> 00:13:08,190
Why isn't it running?

242
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:13,529
Stop it, stop it.

243
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:18,940
Stop it.

244
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,909
You're no match for me.

245
00:13:21,909 --> 00:13:23,240
I was so close to winning.

246
00:13:23,539 --> 00:13:25,740
Hey, it's a shooting game.

247
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,379
Are you any good?

248
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:33,580
I just enjoy it.

249
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:40,159
I can see that.

250
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,100
You're pretty good.

251
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:56,740
Here you go.

252
00:14:05,049 --> 00:14:07,950
(Ha Jin, Jeong Hoon.
You two look great together!)

253
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:18,830
Come in.

254
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:26,940
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

255
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:30,740
- Happy birthday dear Ha Jin
- Happy birthday dear Ha Jin

256
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,980
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

257
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,409
Happy birthday.

258
00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:37,179
- Happy birthday.
- Congratulations.

259
00:14:37,179 --> 00:14:38,250
Thanks.

260
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,350
Even though things are hectic,

261
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,289
you should still blow out
your birthday candles.

262
00:14:41,289 --> 00:14:42,750
Take your time
and pick what you want.

263
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,059
I'll buy anything for you.

264
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:47,360
Really? Then I'll come up
with something nice.

265
00:14:47,889 --> 00:14:50,759
Ha Jin, it's me.

266
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:52,100
- Hello.
- Hello.

267
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,500
- Could you?
- Sure.

268
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,870
Why are you here?

269
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:00,840
I'm visiting her. And you?

270
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,610
Me too, you punk.

271
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:05,879
I was worried about her.

272
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:07,279
Are you feeling okay?

273
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,610
Yes, I am.
Thank you for your concern.

274
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,750
I'm glad you look well.

275
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,389
By the way, whose birthday is it?

276
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,019
It's yours?

277
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:20,889
Gosh, had I known earlier,
I would've prepared a gift.

278
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:24,899
Why isn't Jeong Hoon here?

279
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:28,169
I came here alone
because he wasn't at work.

280
00:15:36,409 --> 00:15:37,440
Hey.

281
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:38,580
Hello.

282
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,409
What happened to your face?

283
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:43,080
Did he beat you up?

284
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,519
What? Of course, not.

285
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,990
I was being careless
and ran into something.

286
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,820
Go to my office.
I'll be there soon.

287
00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:52,059
Okay.

288
00:15:57,059 --> 00:15:58,629
You went to the pharmacy?

289
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:03,529
Hey, you should take better care
of your face.

290
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,639
Why would you walk around
and show it off?

291
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:08,440
It's not bad.
I even got free ointment.

292
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:11,179
Seeing how you're joking around,

293
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:12,809
you're finally back
to being yourself.

294
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,909
I heard Ha Jin is hospitalized.

295
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:17,879
Did she get hurt?

296
00:16:18,179 --> 00:16:20,419
Fortunately, she's well.

297
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,850
But she must've been shocked.

298
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:24,919
You're right.
She'll need time to recover.

299
00:16:25,789 --> 00:16:28,460
I'm truly glad
that she's safe and sound.

300
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,230
Me too.

301
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,960
I'm trying my best to cover for you.

302
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:37,799
But I don't think the higher-ups
will let you off the hook.

303
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:42,070
No matter what the reason may be,
you did bail on the news.

304
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,409
I know.

305
00:16:45,409 --> 00:16:47,009
Will you be okay today?

306
00:16:47,409 --> 00:16:50,879
You'll have to read news
about Ha Jin.

307
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,279
I'll do it.

308
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:53,879
Thank you...

309
00:16:54,789 --> 00:16:56,549
for letting me off the hook
last time...

310
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:58,090
and for yesterday as well.

311
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,460
I'll come to my senses and do well.

312
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,860
Forget it.

313
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:07,230
Tell the makeup artist
to cover that up well.

314
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:09,900
Okay.

315
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:11,170
You may leave.

316
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:13,099
- I'll be going, then.
- Okay.

317
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,440
- Hey.
- Thank you.

318
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:28,220
- Hey, you were here.
- Yes.

319
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,849
Did you watch the news
about Director Ji?

320
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,190
It was a good one.

321
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:36,789
Who taught you to reveal
a culprit's identity like that?

322
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,529
Whom do you think?

323
00:17:38,529 --> 00:17:41,869
I'm your one and only junior.

324
00:17:41,869 --> 00:17:45,569
The entire world ought to know
who abducted our dear Ha Jin.

325
00:17:45,569 --> 00:17:47,069
- "Our dear Ha Jin"?
- Yes.

326
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:48,470
You two must be close.

327
00:17:48,769 --> 00:17:52,539
Of course. I just got back
from her surprise birthday party.

328
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,549
She had a surprise birthday party?

329
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:56,579
Yes, I went with Ha Kyung...

330
00:17:59,049 --> 00:18:02,549
I visited the hospital
with Ha Kyung...

331
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:03,849
and had a small party.

332
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:06,859
She looks much better now.

333
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,359
Really?

334
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:11,029
I should go work.

335
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:12,029
Sure.

336
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,839
I'm Reporter Lee Ji Jeong.

337
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:30,480
Director Ji Hyun Geun, who stalked
and abducted actress Yeo Ha Jin,

338
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,019
was arrested.

339
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:34,519
He broke into her house...

340
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:36,250
and stalked her continuously.

341
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,450
He's currently under arrest...

342
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,789
for locking her up
in his villa in Gyeonggi Province.

343
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,329
He claimed to have committed
the crime because his love...

344
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,599
- Lee Jeong Hoon...
- was unreciprocated.

345
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:45,799
caught him, indeed.

346
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:47,259
After being rescued,
Yeo Ha Jin fainted...

347
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,569
Who are you?

348
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,680
Why did you want to see me?

349
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:00,880
I'll tell you that later.

350
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,849
But first, you're the one
who killed Ms. Jung Seo Yeon, right?

351
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,220
Who are you?

352
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,089
Don't be so cold.
We're on the same team.

353
00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:13,259
Who are you?

354
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:14,319
I see.

355
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,630
You must be in the dark about
what Lee Jeong Hoon has been up...

356
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:17,960
being locked up in here.

357
00:19:18,329 --> 00:19:19,329
Hold on.

358
00:19:22,069 --> 00:19:23,470
("Yeo Ha Jin's New Boyfriend,
Lee Jeong Hoon")

359
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,539
What is this?

360
00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:30,339
This woman...

361
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:32,279
That's right. It's Yeo Ha Jin.

362
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:34,440
She was a close friend
of Jung Seo Yeon.

363
00:19:35,109 --> 00:19:36,509
Lee Jeong Hoon...

364
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:40,250
is dating this woman right now?

365
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:41,849
It's nothing serious.

366
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:43,750
They're going to break up anyway,

367
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,519
but I got annoyed
when I had to watch him date her.

368
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,529
This can't be.
They can't be together, you know.

369
00:19:49,529 --> 00:19:50,529
So what?

370
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:53,700
What is it that you want from me?

371
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,400
I want you to tell me...

372
00:19:58,369 --> 00:20:00,900
everything you did
to Lee Jeong Hoon.

373
00:20:02,609 --> 00:20:05,880
That way, he'll get scared and
stay away from my Ha Jin quickly.

374
00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:10,150
And you can get your revenge
against Lee Jeong Hoon too.

375
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,549
Isn't that a win-win?

376
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,500
I like it.

377
00:20:31,869 --> 00:20:33,039
That sounds fun.

378
00:20:51,289 --> 00:20:53,789
(Inmate Moon Seong Ho)

379
00:21:00,529 --> 00:21:02,970
So are you going
to start afresh with Yeo Ha Jin?

380
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,640
I can't let you do that.

381
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:17,309
Here.

382
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:21,450
Now, tell me. What is this about?

383
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,450
What do you mean?

384
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,789
You keep saying you're fine today,
but I can tell you're sad.

385
00:21:27,789 --> 00:21:29,160
What's wrong?

386
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,599
Are you still scared?

387
00:21:37,869 --> 00:21:39,599
Are you still anxious?

388
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Is that it?

389
00:21:41,869 --> 00:21:44,680
It's all over now.
You don't have to worry now.

390
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,680
I think it's really over now.

391
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,480
What?

392
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:54,380
I think I have become...

393
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:57,589
his past to Anchor Lee now.

394
00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:03,490
He had been nice to me
all this time...

395
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:05,400
because of the stalker.

396
00:22:07,099 --> 00:22:08,970
Now, he doesn't need
to worry about me.

397
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,769
I'm afraid he might leave me again
and wish me happiness.

398
00:22:15,069 --> 00:22:17,769
Is that why you didn't call him
and have been moping around all day?

399
00:22:19,009 --> 00:22:20,009
Yes.

400
00:22:20,779 --> 00:22:22,009
I'm afraid.

401
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,680
Why don't we get some fresh air?

402
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:31,319
Doesn't it feel suffocating
to stay indoors?

403
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:32,519
Let's go for a walk.

404
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:35,690
Okay.

405
00:22:42,269 --> 00:22:44,029
This feels nice.

406
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,269
The view here is
better than I thought.

407
00:22:48,609 --> 00:22:51,170
How do you feel? Do you feel
better with some fresh air?

408
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,240
Yes.

409
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,049
I think I'll feel much better
with some tteokbokki.

410
00:22:55,049 --> 00:22:56,849
What are you talking about?
No tteokbokki.

411
00:22:56,849 --> 00:22:58,819
- How about fried chicken?
- No fried chicken.

412
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:01,349
My gosh, I feel so sad.

413
00:23:01,349 --> 00:23:03,690
You feel sad?
Fresh air will lift your spirit.

414
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:05,319
It's chilly here.
Let me get some blankets.

415
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:06,420
Just order some food for me.

416
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,259
How about a run around here?
It'll put us in a good mood.

417
00:23:08,259 --> 00:23:09,259
Get the blanket.

418
00:23:09,259 --> 00:23:11,390
Okay. I'll be quick. Wait here.

419
00:23:25,109 --> 00:23:26,339
You're back already?

420
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,180
Are you feeling okay?

421
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,019
I didn't call you because I wanted
you to rest up without distractions.

422
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:39,759
What is it? Did something happen?

423
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:43,859
How could you not call me once today
after leaving me this morning?

424
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:47,400
Do you know how long
I waited for your call?

425
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:52,869
I see. I didn't think
that you'd be waiting for my call.

426
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:55,910
I had to take care of something.
I was distracted.

427
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:14,220
It's your birthday present.

428
00:24:18,329 --> 00:24:20,059
I didn't know what to get you.

429
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:22,000
So it took me some time
to pick out a present for you.

430
00:24:22,269 --> 00:24:24,299
I hope you like it.

431
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:29,069
You left to buy my present?

432
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:31,109
Yes.

433
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,180
Won't you open it?

434
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:52,200
What are all these?

435
00:24:52,529 --> 00:24:54,759
You don't get to sleep well
because of your nightmares.

436
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:57,230
They help you sleep better.

437
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,869
I wanted you to sleep well
without any nightmares.

438
00:25:03,109 --> 00:25:05,009
Picking out one was harder,

439
00:25:05,009 --> 00:25:06,640
so I decided to go for the quantity.

440
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,319
What is it? Do you not like them?

441
00:25:15,789 --> 00:25:17,650
No, I like them.

442
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:21,829
I was touched. I'm very thankful.

443
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,700
But you don't look like
you're touched.

444
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:29,099
I'm really touched, but...

445
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:30,599
But?

446
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,069
I'm afraid...

447
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,509
that this might be the end.

448
00:25:38,309 --> 00:25:41,380
We started this because
of my one-sided crush on you.

449
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:44,880
And then, we realized
there was a stalker.

450
00:25:46,819 --> 00:25:48,690
You were worried about me,

451
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:51,690
so you were taking care of me
in case something happened to me.

452
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,059
But now that he's arrested,

453
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,059
it's really over.

454
00:26:04,269 --> 00:26:05,940
I'm scared that
you'll be nice to the end...

455
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,470
and say goodbye
like the other time.

456
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,779
Is that what this is?

457
00:26:20,849 --> 00:26:22,450
I won't say goodbye to you.

458
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,119
I won't be saying goodbye
to you from now on.

459
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:31,430
Why not?

460
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:36,500
I want to stay by your side now.

461
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,809
So you don't have to worry.

462
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,420
You can't take that back.

463
00:26:55,619 --> 00:26:57,049
That's a promise, okay?

464
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,359
I promise you.

465
00:27:15,069 --> 00:27:16,339
Happy birthday.

466
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:38,119
(Find Me in Your Memory)

467
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,160
What were you doing?
Were you thinking about me?

468
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,059
Square your shoulders.

469
00:28:42,259 --> 00:28:43,859
Straighten your back.

470
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:45,359
We should have a proper first date.

471
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:46,960
Let's officially go on a date
this weekend.

472
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,630
People will recognize us.

473
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:50,829
They can watch us if they want.
We don't have to hide.

474
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:53,700
How could you meet someone new
as if it's not a big deal?

475
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,170
That's why it's fate.

476
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:57,240
We are destined
to meet and fall in love.

477
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,009
Because of you, Ha Jin's memory
might come back.

478
00:28:59,009 --> 00:29:01,539
I don't want to regret
any of the time I have left.

479
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:02,910
What are you thinking?

480
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,309
Grant me a wish too.

481
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:06,349
Whatever situation we may be in,

482
00:29:06,349 --> 00:29:08,819
let's never say
goodbye to each other.
