00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:03,109
(Episode 18)

2
00:00:03,109 --> 00:00:05,440
Ha Kyung, look up some articles.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,440
Yes.

4
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:10,820
People won't blame her for this
since she didn't do anything, right?

5
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,449
Gosh, I doubt that.
She's the victim.

6
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:15,919
What are people saying?

7
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:20,329
We're asking our listeners
for the movie of their life.

8
00:00:20,329 --> 00:00:24,260
We're getting a lot of other texts
that aren't movie recommendations.

9
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,760
"Other texts"?

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,629
From number 2332,
"Ha Jin, cheer up!"

11
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:34,570
Number 1012, "Arrest everyone
who harasses Ha Jin!"

12
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:38,840
Number 3809, "Hey, you, stalker,
you jerk! We'll get you!"

13
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:43,109
Gosh, we're getting bombarded
with messages of support for you.

14
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,079
You have a lot of fans
who show their support for you.

15
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,549
Will you share a word with them?

16
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:48,549
Okay.

17
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,020
Everyone, I'm fine.
Don't worry too much.

18
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,030
Thank you for
giving me your support...

19
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,929
and cursing him instead of me.

20
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,700
I'll cheer up with your support.
Thank you.

21
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,070
You have such a great personality.

22
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,099
Then let's listen to
one more song...

23
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:06,239
to help Ha Jin cheer up.

24
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:17,319
- Ha Jin!
- Ha Jin!

25
00:01:17,379 --> 00:01:20,319
- You're the best!
- I love you!

26
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:21,590
- I love you!
- She's coming.

27
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,120
- Ha Jin!
- You're so pretty!

28
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,760
- Ha Jin, cheer up!
- Ha Jin, keep it up!

29
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,689
- You're so pretty!
- Keep up your spirit!

30
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:29,030
Don't get stressed out!

31
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,500
How about a picture?

32
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,159
- Yes!
- Sounds great!

33
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,400
Can you take a picture for us?

34
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,000
There are too many people here.
Are you sure?

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,939
It's okay. My bodyguards are
here too. Come on.

36
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:39,269
- She's so pretty.
- My gosh.

37
00:01:39,269 --> 00:01:41,439
- Thank you.
- Can you look over here?

38
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,510
- Over here too.
- Look over here too.

39
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:45,340
- I want to take one too.
- I don't think I'm in the picture.

40
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,150
- I think I'm cut out.
- Exactly.

41
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,810
- I want to be in it too.
- She's so pretty.

42
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,379
She has such a tiny face.

43
00:01:50,379 --> 00:01:52,150
- This is amazing.
- It's awesome.

44
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,150
Good.

45
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,420
Did she get all of us?

46
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:56,959
Looks great.

47
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:59,159
- I love you.
- Ha Jin.

48
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,060
- Take another one!
- You're the best.

49
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,930
- It looks so great!
- What about me?

50
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,230
Look, doesn't it look great?

51
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:07,129
- It looks great.
- We look great.

52
00:02:07,129 --> 00:02:09,300
- My gosh, that's so good.
- You look so pretty.

53
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,939
- That's Ha Jin.
- Hey.

54
00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:12,939
- What is this?
- Who is this guy?

55
00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:14,110
- Go away, man.
- You're so pretty.

56
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,770
- Excuse me, everyone. Move aside.
- You have our support.

57
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:19,879
I'm a huge fan.
May I take a picture with you?

58
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:21,509
Haven't we met before?

59
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:23,150
Goodness, you remember me.

60
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,250
I'm the audio director
for "Lee Jeong Hoon's News Live".

61
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,349
- Oh, we've met before. Hello.
- Hello.

62
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:29,449
Yes, hello. May we take a picture?

63
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,289
- Of course.
- Hey, man. Go away.

64
00:02:31,289 --> 00:02:33,889
Chul Woong, come on over.
Let's take one together.

65
00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:36,259
No, I'm all right.

66
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:39,830
I don't like taking pictures,
but if you insist...

67
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,270
Excuse me.

68
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:43,370
- Come, Chul Woong.
- We're acquainted.

69
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:46,240
It's an honor
to take a picture with you, Mr. Kim.

70
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,469
- Okay.
- Yes, sure.

71
00:02:47,469 --> 00:02:48,710
Okay, let's take it.

72
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,310
- In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

73
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,889
Hey, hey. We need to talk.

74
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:03,219
About what?

75
00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:05,319
There's something.
Come up to the rooftop with me.

76
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:09,159
Wait, no. You can tell me here.
Why do we need to go up there?

77
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,629
Mr. Kim, why are you here?

78
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:18,800
You never know.
I set them up like this.

79
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,810
I can't let anything happen.

80
00:03:21,469 --> 00:03:23,810
You won't have to worry about that.

81
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,009
We can handle this.

82
00:03:25,009 --> 00:03:28,050
Come on.
I used to be a good athlete.

83
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:30,080
Oh, sure.

84
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,280
It seemed like
Ha Jin has a lot of fans.

85
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,319
I'm one of them.

86
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,990
Sure, thanks.

87
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:42,759
I just received a call
from the police.

88
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,330
They said Reporter Park Soo Chang
turned himself in.

89
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:48,669
He gave the stalker my photos
in return for money.

90
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:51,240
Right.

91
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:54,340
You helped out, didn't you?

92
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,580
You were investigating it.

93
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,879
Reporter Park isn't the type
to turn himself in like that.

94
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,680
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you
in advance.

95
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,250
I had to sort some stuff out.

96
00:04:07,189 --> 00:04:08,849
You've become strange these days.

97
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:12,360
You're helping me out a lot
these days,

98
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,689
but you keep apologizing.

99
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:18,629
There's nothing to be sorry about,
so don't say that ever again.

100
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,029
I should charge you 50 dollars
every time you apologize.

101
00:04:22,269 --> 00:04:25,069
Better yet, you should grant me
a wish.

102
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:28,009
Whoever apologizes first will grant
the other person's wish.

103
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,310
Fine, I won't apologize ever again.

104
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,509
Darn it. What a disappointment.
I already thought of a wish.

105
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,389
- Here.
- Thank you.

106
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:44,519
Oh, right.

107
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,790
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

108
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:51,100
Jeong Hoon's not up to anything,
is he?

109
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:56,029
No. The last time they met,
he had asked Tae Eun for help.

110
00:04:56,769 --> 00:04:58,100
He's still incarcerated, right?

111
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:00,410
How's Moon Seong Ho doing?

112
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,180
It's a bit strange.

113
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,009
What do you mean?

114
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:09,779
Last time, when he met
with Anchor Lee,

115
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,819
he became very agitated.

116
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,389
But we had expected that.

117
00:05:15,589 --> 00:05:17,589
But this time,

118
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,889
he looks even calmer than usual.

119
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,089
"Calmer"?

120
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:27,670
Yes. So we're keeping an eye on him.

121
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:30,569
But we haven't spotted
anything unusual.

122
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:31,569
I see.

123
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:35,139
Can you please tell me
what this is regarding?

124
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:36,970
Later.

125
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:39,879
I'll tell you
once it's all finished.

126
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,750
(Records)

127
00:05:56,689 --> 00:06:00,129
(Voice Record
of Inmate Moon Seong Ho)

128
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,170
Tell me.

129
00:06:04,769 --> 00:06:05,769
About what?

130
00:06:05,769 --> 00:06:07,370
About everything you know.

131
00:06:10,709 --> 00:06:14,250
(Inmate Moon Seong Ho, Visitation,
Tell me.)

132
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,850
(What?)

133
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:19,279
- Hello.
- Hello.

134
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:20,819
- Hi.
- Hello.

135
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:22,149
The flowers are pretty.

136
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:23,449
Father.

137
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:25,519
Hey.

138
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:27,689
How was the conference?

139
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:30,500
It went well. Prof. Park said hi.

140
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,329
I heard you haven't been
showing up to the gatherings.

141
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:37,300
I have many lectures
and some stuff I need to do.

142
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:39,699
I see.
Don't overwork yourself, though.

143
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,610
I wanted to ask you something.

144
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:43,980
It's about Jeong Hoon.

145
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:45,610
Okay.

146
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:48,250
Is he visiting
the National Forensic Hospital...

147
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,279
because of that woman, Yeo Ha Jin?

148
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,750
I read the articles.

149
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:55,889
I heard the stalker
has been threatening her.

150
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,259
Moon Seong Ho is incarcerated.

151
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:00,529
There's no way he's involved
in what's been happening.

152
00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:01,930
If that's the case,

153
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:04,300
it's even stranger
for him to go there.

154
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,629
I heard he begged you for help.

155
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:07,970
I don't know anything about this.

156
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,870
And even if I did,
I wouldn't be able to tell you.

157
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,370
Why not?

158
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,170
This is his privacy.

159
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:18,579
You don't need to know everything
that's going on with him.

160
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:20,550
I'm his doctor in charge.

161
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,480
No matter how trivial,

162
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,480
I must know about it
if it's related to his illness.

163
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,189
Jeong Hoon has been doing well.

164
00:07:28,189 --> 00:07:29,490
Why are you being...

165
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:36,029
Is this regarding something else...

166
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,399
other than his treatment?

167
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,699
Cut that nonsense and let's go eat.

168
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,310
Are you saying it's impossible
to catch the stalker...

169
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,680
with the evidence Reporter Park has?

170
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,579
There is a way.

171
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,620
First, we'll ask the head office...

172
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,980
of the messenger app he used
for the stalker's IP address.

173
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:02,550
We'll have to track
his cryptocurrency as well. But...

174
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,089
It'll take some time...

175
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:05,920
since both of the servers
are overseas.

176
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,290
You're correct.

177
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,990
Please hurry.

178
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:12,060
We're suffocating here.

179
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,230
We will.

180
00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:15,230
Oh, right.

181
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:17,769
There's something else we found out.

182
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:19,899
Did anything about him
stand out in particular...

183
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,610
when you talked with him?

184
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:25,079
Not really. He was always brief.

185
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,980
Right.

186
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:30,649
He did say one thing.

187
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,679
He was looking at the photos
I took of her at a cafe...

188
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,250
and said she looked similar
to when they first met.

189
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:35,690
"When they first met"?

190
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:37,690
And when was that?

191
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,659
He didn't go into detail.

192
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:43,259
Right. He was boasting.

193
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:46,759
He said he knew her
even before her debut.

194
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,700
That's why she was
even more special to him.

195
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:52,470
He said he knew me for a long time?

196
00:08:52,669 --> 00:08:56,009
Yes. Can you think of anyone...

197
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,639
in particular?

198
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,340
If he knew her before her debut...

199
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:02,549
Chul first joined the agency...

200
00:09:02,549 --> 00:09:04,519
when Ha Jin was about to debut.

201
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,230
How may I help you?

202
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,659
Police.

203
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:21,269
I have a few questions
regarding Ms. Yeo Ha Jin.

204
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:22,629
Why me?

205
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:25,070
I heard you were in charge of her
up until not too long ago.

206
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:28,509
Were there ever times
when you suspected something?

207
00:09:28,509 --> 00:09:29,539
I don't think so.

208
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,610
Nothing really stood out
during my time with her.

209
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,580
I see.

210
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:37,850
Right, I heard you left work early
last Saturday.

211
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:39,580
What did you do after work?

212
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,149
Why do you ask?

213
00:09:41,419 --> 00:09:43,789
I'm just following the procedure.

214
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:47,960
I was stressed out about something,
so I had a drink at my friend's.

215
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,230
I was totally wasted
and blacked out.

216
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,230
I see.

217
00:09:52,429 --> 00:09:56,370
The stalker's motorcycle falls into
one of the higher power classes,

218
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:59,470
so he needed a type two license
for small vehicles.

219
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,009
Do you have a type two license
for small vehicles?

220
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:07,679
Yes, I do.
But I rarely ride my bike.

221
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:12,850
Ever since Ha Jin's debut,
Director Ji Hyun Geun would talk...

222
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,720
about wanting to cast her
for his works.

223
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,750
Didn't the photo turn out great?

224
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,820
Yes, you're right.

225
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:22,090
Are you and Ms. Yeo close?

226
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,000
Of course. We were practically
stuck to each other...

227
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,529
throughout the movie's filming.

228
00:10:25,629 --> 00:10:27,500
I heard you visited her house...

229
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,429
last Saturday.

230
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,500
May I ask why?

231
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,940
I had a gift for her.

232
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,070
It was that photo.

233
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,139
But I couldn't meet her.

234
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,750
And after that?

235
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,480
I came back here and worked.

236
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:47,120
I wrote my scenario
and edited some photos.

237
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:50,549
Was there anyone who saw you?

238
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,429
I like to work alone.

239
00:10:56,259 --> 00:10:59,860
Does this mean
I don't have an alibi?

240
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:03,629
Not at all. I'm just following
the procedure.

241
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,710
Please call me if you remember
anything in particular.

242
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,440
- Sure.
- Thank you for the coffee.

243
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,309
What was this coffee called?

244
00:11:13,309 --> 00:11:14,580
Chanchamayo.

245
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:19,019
By the way,
you must enjoy traveling.

246
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,090
You even bought that coffee
while overseas.

247
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:25,620
It's a lovely place.
You should also visit if you can.

248
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:29,759
Then you must enjoy
riding motorcycles.

249
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:33,000
People who enjoy traveling
tend to bike a lot.

250
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:34,629
I used to bike a long time ago.

251
00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:37,129
But I sold it after finding
another hobby.

252
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,899
Oh, I see.

253
00:11:39,539 --> 00:11:41,669
Thank you for your time.

254
00:11:41,669 --> 00:11:43,009
Not at all.

255
00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:47,139
Sir, please catch the stalker.

256
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,049
I beg you.

257
00:11:50,179 --> 00:11:53,220
Don't you worry about that.
I'll see myself out.

258
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,389
- Okay. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

259
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:14,639
I'm really fine.
Don't worry about me.

260
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,809
All right.

261
00:12:16,809 --> 00:12:20,080
They said the stalker
is 1 of those 2.

262
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,080
We'll catch him soon.
Right, Ha Kyung?

263
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,379
Of course.

264
00:12:24,379 --> 00:12:27,350
The detectives said
they'd catch him. Let's trust them.

265
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:29,490
Let's not worry about it. Let's go.

266
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:35,289
By the way, what was all that stuff
in the supply room?

267
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:39,029
Right. You should take them.

268
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,830
- We should?
- Yes.

269
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:43,500
They're all Ha Jin's birthday gifts.

270
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,669
It's your birthday in two days.
I forgot.

271
00:12:46,669 --> 00:12:47,970
You're right. I forgot as well.

272
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:51,409
We've been receiving so many gifts.

273
00:12:51,409 --> 00:12:54,110
Gosh, I guess she really made it.

274
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,509
You're right.

275
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,450
What will you do on your birthday?

276
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:02,250
I should start thinking about that.

277
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,169
Hey, Tae Eun.

278
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,799
Now?

279
00:13:18,539 --> 00:13:20,200
What in the world happened
to Ha Jin?

280
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,039
Well...

281
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:29,149
I had no clue about any of this.

282
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:31,820
I was too busy to tell you.

283
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:34,149
Things kept happening.

284
00:13:34,149 --> 00:13:36,590
Is she okay?

285
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:40,320
You know that she's cheerful
and strong.

286
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,629
She's dealing with it well.

287
00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:44,600
That's a relief.

288
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,659
What about you?

289
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,600
Are you okay?

290
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm okay.

291
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,639
Don't worry.

292
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:07,179
You got so many presents.

293
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,750
My gosh.
We still have more in the car.

294
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:12,360
How could I forget
about your birthday?

295
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,259
Things are so hectic these days.

296
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:15,289
Right.

297
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,360
Anchor Lee knows
it's my birthday soon, right?

298
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,200
How would he know your birthday?

299
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,929
He can find my information online.

300
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:24,269
He must have looked me up
at least once.

301
00:14:24,269 --> 00:14:26,799
Who would look you up online
and memorize your birthday?

302
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,309
Besides, even if he did,
he probably forgot it.

303
00:14:28,309 --> 00:14:30,039
No way. He wouldn't.

304
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:31,539
Yes, he would.

305
00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:37,480
Don't be disappointed
after your birthday.

306
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,379
You should just
bring that up casually.

307
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:50,090
You're making me nervous again.

308
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,529
I'm worried you'll say goodbye again
like last time.

309
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:00,240
That time, you were nice to me
at first and then said...

310
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,940
you didn't want to see me again.

311
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,480
But I'm not going
to listen to you anymore.

312
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:08,950
You see, I want you to be happy.

313
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:11,779
That's why I'm not going
to say goodbye.

314
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:31,240
I enjoyed the news today as always.

315
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,200
Did you get home safely?

316
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:37,370
Actually, this Wednesday
is my birthday.

317
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:40,340
Do you have some time to spare
before the news?

318
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:43,509
I don't need a present.
Just have a meal with me.

319
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:57,460
You look so pretty
when you're not talking.

320
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,500
Really?

321
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,960
Be quiet. You look so beautiful.

322
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,700
I'll take one for you. Give me that.

323
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:03,899
Sit down.

324
00:16:05,539 --> 00:16:07,169
Smile.

325
00:16:08,309 --> 00:16:09,970
Nice.

326
00:16:14,409 --> 00:16:15,809
I'll take a photo of them too.

327
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,450
Anchor Lee didn't text back yet?

328
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,389
Why isn't he texting me back?

329
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,519
Is he already sleeping?

330
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,320
Look at this.

331
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,559
Instead of counting
millions of things,

332
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:04,259
you should only count 5 or 6 things.

333
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:06,359
What does that mean?

334
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,170
It's saying
we should lead simple lives.

335
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:11,900
So we can finish calculating things
only by using our two thumbs.

336
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,809
That's cool.

337
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,730
Yeong!

338
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,700
(Courier Service)

339
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:54,779
Ha Na. Are you all right, Ha Na?

340
00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:57,579
Ha Na. Are you all right?
Are you okay?

341
00:17:57,579 --> 00:17:58,650
Oh, no.

342
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:00,019
- Ha Na.
- Is she okay?

343
00:18:00,019 --> 00:18:01,019
- Ha Na.
- Is she okay?

344
00:18:01,019 --> 00:18:03,819
- Oh, no.
- Please help!

345
00:18:03,819 --> 00:18:06,619
- Call 911. Please.
- Ha Na.

346
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,509
What's wrong? You can't sleep?

347
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:29,509
What is it? Are you sick?

348
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:32,549
You don't have a fever.

349
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,990
Did you have a nightmare?

350
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:39,789
It's all right.
You can fall back to sleep again.

351
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,230
Let's go back to sleep.

352
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:11,690
(The breath of spring lands
on my lips after meeting you.)

353
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,700
(Dad)

354
00:19:32,779 --> 00:19:34,240
Take this with you.

355
00:19:34,779 --> 00:19:35,910
What is it?

356
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:39,980
Your mother saved them just for you.

357
00:19:41,619 --> 00:19:42,650
All right.

358
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:26,500
Mom!

359
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,670
Be careful.

360
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:30,569
Be careful.

361
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:32,269
Look at this.

362
00:20:32,269 --> 00:20:35,569
Doesn't this look like a turtle?

363
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:38,710
My gosh. You're right.

364
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,750
This is the head.
And this part is the shell.

365
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,549
And these are the legs.

366
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:44,720
Yes, that's right.

367
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,819
My goodness. This is fascinating.

368
00:20:47,819 --> 00:20:49,720
You can keep this, Mom.

369
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,660
It was hard to find this rock.

370
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,089
But I'll give it to you.

371
00:20:54,089 --> 00:20:56,289
My gosh, thank you.

372
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:59,259
I'll keep this forever.

373
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:00,259
Okay.

374
00:21:01,569 --> 00:21:04,099
My good boy, Jeong Hoon.

375
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,269
Thank you.

376
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:27,289
Mom, not that color.

377
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:28,789
Why not?

378
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:30,859
It's my favorite color.

379
00:21:30,859 --> 00:21:32,799
Don't just waste it like that.

380
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,460
I see. Really?

381
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:38,140
I just wanted
to color the roof in gold.

382
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,539
I'm sorry.

383
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,609
My gosh. Then...

384
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:45,740
Use it then.

385
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:51,049
What? You told me
not to waste it. Forget it.

386
00:21:51,819 --> 00:21:55,289
It's your favorite color.
I should lend it to you.

387
00:21:56,089 --> 00:21:57,349
Color with it as much as you want.

388
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,160
What is it?

389
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:02,430
Really?

390
00:22:02,859 --> 00:22:05,400
- I'll waste this away, then.
- No. Hold on.

391
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,559
No. Then, leave me about this much.

392
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,000
If you say that,

393
00:22:09,069 --> 00:22:10,930
I'll use it and leave
only this much.

394
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:15,109
You're really giving me this, right?
I'll color the wall with this too.

395
00:22:15,109 --> 00:22:16,210
Will that be okay?

396
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,710
Okay. Sure.

397
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,950
- My good boy, Jeong Hoon.
- Stop it.

398
00:22:47,569 --> 00:22:48,609
Jeong Hoon.

399
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,640
Even if all the people
in this world don't know,

400
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,109
I'm sure you know...

401
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:58,349
that this box was my treasure chest.

402
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:01,690
The precious moments
you have given me are enough...

403
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,289
to fill up and spill over the chest.

404
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:06,420
I cherished them like jewels.

405
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:09,160
So Jeong Hoon,

406
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,730
I hope you won't doubt me
even for a moment...

407
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:14,700
when I write...

408
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:19,140
that I was very happy...

409
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,309
to have you as my son.

410
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:26,710
Jeong Hoon.

411
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:32,019
Promise me this, please.

412
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,019
Promise me that if you find
something precious,

413
00:23:35,019 --> 00:23:37,750
you won't hesitate to go after it.

414
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:43,390
I truly hope you'll be happy.

415
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,559
Not for someone else's sake,

416
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:49,099
but for yourself.

417
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,099
Have some morning juice.

418
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:26,299
So? what kind of a dream
did you have last night?

419
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:29,569
You know,

420
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,140
just a weird dream.

421
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:37,680
If you aren't doing well,
we can cancel the photo shoot.

422
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,380
We can't do that.
We postponed this once already.

423
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,750
That's not what's important.
You're more important.

424
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:49,960
But we still have to go.

425
00:24:50,029 --> 00:24:52,329
Right? We should, shouldn't we?

426
00:24:52,329 --> 00:24:55,569
You're important, but you can get
more energy by working. Right?

427
00:24:55,569 --> 00:24:56,569
Get ready and come out.

428
00:24:56,569 --> 00:24:58,740
No, I'll get ready
after I finish this.

429
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:03,809
1, 2.

430
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:06,079
Looks great. 1, 2.

431
00:25:07,609 --> 00:25:08,980
Okay. 1, 2.

432
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,109
That's great. 1, 2.

433
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:13,119
Her makeup looks really great.

434
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,480
Okay. 1, 2.

435
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:18,390
Ha Jin, are you doing all right?

436
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:20,089
- Yes.
- You look pretty.

437
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,059
Let me check if they need to take
a few more shots.

438
00:25:22,059 --> 00:25:23,390
Sit down and get some rest.

439
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,630
Okay. Thank you.

440
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,529
I really don't think
that was just a dream.

441

Ha Jin, where are you?
Can you talk right now?

448
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:06,900
I'm at a photo shoot. I can talk.

449
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:10,170
What about you? Where are you?

450
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,869
I came out for a bit.

451
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:15,210
- I didn't return your text. I'm...
- Wait.

452
00:27:16,539 --> 00:27:17,609
I'm what?

453
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:20,079
Wait, you weren't going to say
"I'm sorry", were you?

454
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,809
I'm free on Wednesday.

455
00:27:25,549 --> 00:27:26,849
Let's have dinner together.

456
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:32,119
I hope your shooting goes well.
Go home safely.

457
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,059
And let me know when you get home.

458
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:38,289
Okay. I'll do that.

459
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,910
Ha Jin, we looked through the shots,
and they like everything.

460
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:51,240
They said you look very pretty.
Let's go now.

461
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,809
Okay. I'll get changed.

462
00:27:52,809 --> 00:27:53,809
Okay.

463
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:41,890
- Did you get changed?
- Yes, let's go.

464
00:28:42,029 --> 00:28:44,259
- Wrap up and come. We'll go first.
- Okay.

465
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:47,329
Ms. Park!
What brings you here without a call?

466
00:28:47,329 --> 00:28:51,230
I came to buy something delicious
for you and Ha Kyung.

467
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:55,109
I'm sure you recently had only
delivery food stuck inside home.

468
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:57,710
You're right. She couldn't eat well
because she had no appetite.

469
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:00,910
That's not good. Ha Jin, let's say
this is your early birthday party.

470
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:03,210
Tell me whatever you want.
I'll buy anything for you.

471
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:04,880
Anything is fine with me.

472
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,079
Really? In that case,

473
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:10,549
there's a great eel place nearby.
Let's go there.

474
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:11,619
Sounds great.

475
00:29:11,819 --> 00:29:15,160
Ms. Park,
then let's all take my car.

476
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:17,589
Please wait at the entrance.
I'll bring the car.

477
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:18,960
All right.

478
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,430
- See you soon.
- Okay.

479
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:31,269
Man, who drives like that?

480
00:29:35,549 --> 00:29:36,650
My car.

481
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:55,329
Pick up. Please pick up. Darn it.

482
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,809
Hello?

483
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:09,650
Goodness, Director Song! One second.

484
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,720
What's the occasion?
Wow, it has been so long.

485
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:16,519
You can hop in first. Go ahead.

486
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:41,710
Ms. Park will be here
after that phone call.

487
00:31:02,829 --> 00:31:03,829
(Anchor Lee)

488
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:04,829
(Power Off)

489
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:08,839
What is this?

490
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:13,140
Stop that car!
You have to get that car!

491
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:15,079
- No!
- Wait!

492
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:17,509
Who do you think you are?

493
00:31:17,579 --> 00:31:20,150
- Ha Jin!
- Ha Jin!

494
00:31:57,289 --> 00:31:58,289
Anchor Lee.

495
00:31:58,289 --> 00:32:00,990
Hey. Are you with Ha Jin?

496
00:32:01,089 --> 00:32:02,529
I can't get a hold of her.

497
00:32:03,829 --> 00:32:04,930
She...

498
00:32:05,859 --> 00:32:07,400
She just got abducted.

499
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,069
What?

500
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:35,759
(We thank Yangpa
for her guest appearance.)

501
00:32:50,509 --> 00:32:52,910
(Find Me in Your Memory)

502
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:54,539
Did you track her location?

503
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:55,549
We can't track her.

504
00:32:55,549 --> 00:32:57,680
Do we still have no idea
who did this?

505
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,819
Moon Chul lied about
having a drink with a friend...

506
00:32:59,819 --> 00:33:01,650
on the day
of the motorcycle accident.

507
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:03,049
Then is he the culprit?

508
00:33:03,049 --> 00:33:04,990
I still have a bad feeling
about Director Ji.

509
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:07,220
What happened?
Did you track his location?

510
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,329
So you're trying to
work things out with Ha Jin?

511
00:33:09,329 --> 00:33:10,529
I can't let that happen.

512
00:33:10,529 --> 00:33:11,890
Is anybody there?

513
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:13,829
Ha Jin, wait a little.

514
00:33:14,829 --> 00:33:16,200
Don't come near me!

515
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,970
Who are you, you jerk?

516
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:20,269
No matter what you do
and how much you try,

517
00:33:20,269 --> 00:33:22,140
you will never lay a finger on her.
