00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,580
(Episode 2)

2
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,410
(HBN President Lee Deuk Gyu)

3
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,359
It ended so quickly like a dream.

4
00:00:20,089 --> 00:00:22,260
I know you made a tough decision.

5
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:24,800
Thank you for your courage.

6
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,170
Now that I let it get out,

7
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:31,100
I think I shouldn't have held back
to this day.

8
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:33,609
This probably won't be the end.

9
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:36,539
Chairman Oh will continue
to urge you to settle this case.

10
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:38,579
He'll persuade you, threaten you,

11
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:40,649
and do everything he can.

12
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:42,280
I'm aware of that.

13
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,119
And I'm ready to face him.

14
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:48,490
(Civil Rights Lawyer Kim Jin Tae)

15
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,090
He's a civil rights lawyer I know.

16
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,729
He'll be of help to you.

17
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,159
Thank you.

18
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,689
Are you going to
just sit there and watch?

19
00:03:11,629 --> 00:03:12,860
Give us a hand.

20
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,079
(Tae Eun)

21
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:03,370
Are you all done?

22
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,480
Yes.

23
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:07,480
Isn't this dress pretty?

24
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,209
Yes, it's really pretty.

25
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:10,779
It was tough for me to get that.

26
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:12,480
That wasn't sponsored. We bought it.

27
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,589
You'll be splashed with water today.

28
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,850
Oh, you're right.

29
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:20,089
It's sad to think
that this is the last shooting.

30
00:05:20,089 --> 00:05:21,759
Why would you be sad?

31
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,259
People bashed you so much
while you were on this drama.

32
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:25,930
You were a brat
who stole someone's husband,

33
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,769
someone they want to kill
and someone who should die.

34
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,629
People say you'll live long
if you get bashed,

35
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:31,639
so you'll probably live
until you're 200.

36
00:05:32,269 --> 00:05:35,569
Chul, everyone else has
a few more days of shooting, right?

37
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:37,639
Yes, about three more times.

38
00:05:38,209 --> 00:05:39,879
Then I'll come and visit the set.

39
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:42,449
You're going to come back
to see Ko Yu Ra?

40
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:43,980
You didn't get bullied enough,
did you?

41
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,680
I don't even want to see her face.

42
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,949
Anyone can see that
she's the villain.

43
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:50,250
They definitely cast
the wrong person for the role.

44
00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:55,360
You should come out now.

45
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,259
- Yes.
- Okay. I'll be there now.

46
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,470
- Get ready and come out.
- Okay.

47
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,939
Let's see.

48
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:11,639
You changed your earrings.

49
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,980
Yes. Doesn't this one look better?

50
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,449
Yes. Look.

51
00:06:22,189 --> 00:06:23,250
What?

52
00:06:27,629 --> 00:06:28,629
My gosh.

53
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:31,529
Did you not get your outfit checked
before the shoot?

54
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:34,800
Why do we match?

55
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,899
I definitely got it checked,

56
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:38,699
so why is this happening?

57
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:42,569
Oh, no. You better change.

58
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:45,910
- Me?
- Then?

59
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,750
Should I?

60
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:51,180
It's not that
I don't want to change.

61
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,050
That color doesn't complement
your skin color.

62
00:06:56,019 --> 00:06:57,660
Don't be ridiculous.

63
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:00,019
Jae Hee, does this
not look good on me?

64
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:01,959
No, you look beautiful.

65
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:03,660
It complements your skin color.

66
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,199
Not at all.

67
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:09,699
So are you refusing to change?

68
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:13,439
Do I need to change?

69
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:15,470
That's so harsh.

70
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:16,740
It's such a scary vibe.

71
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,779
We're about to finish shooting.

72
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:19,779
I know.

73
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:21,449
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

74
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:22,910
What's their problem?

75
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,480
I think it's regarding
their outfits.

76
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:26,779
- I'm sick of this.
- She should apologize.

77
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,019
I'll change.

78
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,750
I'm sorry. I'll change.

79
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,860
I knew this would happen.

80
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,060
There's nothing I like about her.

81
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:36,689
- How long do we need to wait?
- Maybe it was intentional.

82
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,730
Can we film today? That's enough.

83
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,500
Look at how brazen she is.

84
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,129
She changed hers first
and now wants you to change?

85
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,769
It's fine. Thank goodness
we brought several outfits.

86
00:07:45,769 --> 00:07:47,240
This doesn't feel good.

87
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:50,610
You just need to throw water
at each other, right?

88
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:53,079
Yes. I'll need to change into this.

89
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:55,180
This feels ominous.

90
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:03,920
Why isn't she done yet?

91
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,329
- That's better.
- She's gorgeous.

92
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:09,959
- She looks much better.
- You're right.

93
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:11,329
It looks good on you.

94
00:08:11,329 --> 00:08:12,860
- She's so pretty.
- Ha Jin.

95
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,470
- The color is so bright.
- You look so much better.

96
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,800
Thank you.

97
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:18,540
It suits her so well.

98
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,269
Director, when are we starting?

99
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:24,279
Right. Let's rehearse first.

100
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:27,310
That's fine. She and I
have good teamwork.

101
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:29,910
We don't have much time.
We should hurry.

102
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,379
Is that fine?

103
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,779
Yes.

104
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,120
Okay. Let's film right away.

105
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,460
- We'll begin now.
- Okay.

106
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,830
They always place the reflectors
toward her.

107
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,659
Standby.

108
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:46,830
Ready. Action.

109
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,740
There you are.

110
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:54,940
Be honest.

111
00:08:56,009 --> 00:08:57,710
What did you tell my husband?

112
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,179
What do you think?

113
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,379
The truth.

114
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:07,080
I told him
that you and I weren't related...

115
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,590
and that it wouldn't
cause any problems to our affair.

116
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,419
I told him to leave you
and come to me.

117
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:18,700
How? How could you do this to me?

118
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,269
After all that Mom did for you...

119
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:24,440
I told you not to mention her.

120
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,639
I told you so!

121
00:09:36,179 --> 00:09:37,480
That crazy wench.

122
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:41,149
Cut.

123
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:45,019
Ha Jin, how could you stop there?

124
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:46,659
It was nice.

125
00:09:47,389 --> 00:09:49,960
Was getting slapped
part of the script?

126
00:09:50,259 --> 00:09:53,529
What? I thought you guys
planned it out.

127
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,269
Did I not tell you?

128
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,769
I thought I did.

129
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:05,210
I'm so busy these days
that I can't keep track of anything.

130
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:08,750
Oh, dear. I'm sorry.

131
00:10:09,179 --> 00:10:10,480
You must've been startled.

132
00:10:13,049 --> 00:10:14,889
Is Ko Yu Ra crazy or what?

133
00:10:14,889 --> 00:10:16,419
She changed her outfit
and the script as well.

134
00:10:16,419 --> 00:10:18,190
She slapped you on purpose, right?

135
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:20,490
Of course.
Even the director didn't know.

136
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:21,659
This is infuriating.

137
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,190
Calm down.

138
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:26,399
My character deserves
to get slapped.

139
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,029
The viewers like refreshing scenes
like that.

140
00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:29,730
I guess my acting was good.

141
00:10:30,669 --> 00:10:32,440
I think we'll get higher ratings.

142
00:10:34,809 --> 00:10:35,809
Why would you hit me?

143
00:10:35,809 --> 00:10:37,509
I'm not that swollen, right? Look.

144
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,750
In order for memory to become
long-term memory,

145
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,549
it needs to go through
long-term potentiation.

146
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:52,389
However, the latter will only...

147
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:56,090
strengthen your synapse,
and that's the problem.

148
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,600
In other words, it'll select...

149
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,799
already-existing memories
and delete them...

150
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:02,730
in order to make space.

151
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:06,899
It'll prevent the neural network
from overflowing.

152
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,879
This result is also called oblivion.

153
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,809
Many people think...

154
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:19,320
that oblivion is a passive action.

155
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,190
However,

156
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:24,789
this state of oblivion
is a direct result,

157
00:11:24,789 --> 00:11:26,919
stemming from the brain,
in order to make space.

158
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:29,629
Think about it.

159
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:35,100
What if your brain lost
the ability to forget?

160
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:39,639
What if it remembered everything?

161
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:41,009
My head would explode.

162
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,779
It's similar.

163
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,309
It'll be overflowing.

164
00:11:48,309 --> 00:11:52,179
It'll have trouble
saving new memories.

165
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,889
And even if...

166
00:11:54,889 --> 00:11:57,620
your brain could take it,

167
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,830
it'd be difficult for you
to live a normal lifestyle.

168
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:06,500
Let's say you broke up
with someone you loved.

169
00:12:07,299 --> 00:12:09,799
It'll pain you that day.

170
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,039
It'll pain you for a while.

171
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,340
But how would you feel
after a year...

172
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,379
or 10 years?

173
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,950
You may not remember their face.

174
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,279
It's all thanks
to your brain forgetting it.

175
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:31,490
But what if
you can't forget anything?

176
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:36,190
What if you're still reliving
the breakup even after 10 years?

177
00:12:36,429 --> 00:12:39,330
- That's terrible.
- Goodness.

178
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:43,029
So you shouldn't blame your brain
for forgetting things.

179
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:47,240
There's actually
a good side to that.

180
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,710
Professor, I have a question.

181
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:54,039
I've read your thesis
regarding hyperthymesia...

182
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:57,350
where one remembers everything.

183
00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:01,720
I couldn't find
any recent information...

184
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,120
on your real-life subject, H.

185
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,259
He was 11 years old back then.

186
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:10,159
That means he's 36 now.

187
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:12,360
I'd like to know how he's doing...

188
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,669
and if anything regarding
his memory has changed.

189
00:13:18,669 --> 00:13:21,970
I'm not sure. We lost touch...

190
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:24,679
after I finished up on my thesis.

191
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:27,649
I can't tell you how he's doing.

192
00:13:28,509 --> 00:13:31,549
But he's probably the same.

193
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,789
There's no cure, after all.

194
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:39,090
Hello, Father.
Why have you called?

195
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,429
Why haven't you sent me
Jeong Hoon's results?

196
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:45,100
We're taking our time.
He's busy, you know?

197
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,600
My goodness.

198
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:49,529
Send it in by the end of this month.

199
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:52,799
If you're not up for it,
just drop it.

200
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,409
He hasn't changed one bit.

201
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,120
Ha Kyung, Ms. Park called.

202
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,620
She's stuck in traffic
and will be late.

203
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,320
- All right.
- Okay.

204
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:12,460
Have you read the questionnaire
for "Lee Jeong Hoon's News Live"?

205
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,659
Not yet. I was busy filming.

206
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:16,259
You don't have much time. Hurry.

207
00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:17,360
Read it thoroughly.

208
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,230
You need to be well-prepared
to survive.

209
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:21,600
I'm already all prepared.

210
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,600
How?

211
00:14:22,669 --> 00:14:24,539
I looked up Anchor Lee.

212
00:14:24,539 --> 00:14:26,139
He's very popular.

213
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:28,269
His nickname is Gentle Tyrant.

214
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,940
He's gentle but can also bombard you
with powerful facts.

215
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:31,980
Everyone's saying how amazing he is.

216
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:35,009
Did you not see
how his guests looked?

217
00:14:35,009 --> 00:14:37,279
From politicians and businessmen
to idol singers and top stars,

218
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,879
all successful individuals
were battered on his show.

219
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,990
Ko Yu Ra, that headstrong wench,
couldn't say a thing.

220
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:46,090
Really? She was on that show?

221
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,960
You're not even a bit prepared
for this.

222
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:50,090
Show me that video
I was watching earlier.

223
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,129
Okay, hold on.

224
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:54,330
("News Live's legendary clip,
Ko Yu Ra delays a flight")

225
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,200
- Here.
- You've said...

226
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,340
you wanted to become
a role model to the people.

227
00:15:00,539 --> 00:15:02,509
Could you elaborate on that?

228
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:07,480
I'm not sure.
I wasn't expecting this question.

229
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,909
Then I'll give you a few examples.

230
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,080
You parked your car
in the handicapped parking lot...

231
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,090
every time you had to film
for a drama.

232
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:16,789
During last year's filming abroad,

233
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:20,159
you delayed the flight
by being an hour late.

234
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,529
Would you say that
you were a good role model?

235
00:15:23,529 --> 00:15:25,629
(She's crying inside.)

236
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:27,429
Minister Blanco of Mexico...

237
00:15:27,429 --> 00:15:30,629
delayed a flight
by being 38 minutes late...

238
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:32,299
and voluntarily resigned
from his position.

239
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,039
Yu Ra.

240
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:38,039
Have you made a formal apology
for this incident?

241
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:44,580
He's so amazing.

242
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:48,090
"Amazing"?
Are you watching the correct video?

243
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:51,720
Yes. I had no idea
watching the news was so fun.

244
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,090
It's so thrilling.

245
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:56,659
In a few hours, you'll become
the star of that thrilling show.

246
00:15:56,659 --> 00:15:59,129
How thrilling!

247
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:00,960
It'll be fun today.

248
00:16:01,429 --> 00:16:03,830
And I'm looking forward to meeting
Mr. Lee Jeong Hoon.

249
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,269
Hello, Ms. Park.

250
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:06,899
Oh, my. What's all that?

251
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:09,070
Relaxing pills. Everyone, take one.

252
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,580
Why did you buy so many?

253
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,440
You can't consume
a lot of the pills at once.

254
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,250
I'm just so worried.

255
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,279
Why did you book her
for "Lee Jeong Hoon's News Live"?

256
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,919
You were the one who booked it.

257
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:21,590
Right. I did.

258
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,549
I only booked it because...

259
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:26,759
I wanted to make Ha Jin look
look elegant and intelligent.

260
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:29,529
Ha Jin, you can do
a good job, right?

261
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:31,129
Of course, Ms. Park.

262
00:16:31,129 --> 00:16:32,759
Don't worry.
There's nothing to worry about.

263
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:34,000
You should take one too, Ha Jin.

264
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,129
You've been on a few radio shows.

265
00:16:35,129 --> 00:16:36,629
This is your first live broadcast
on TV.

266
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:38,000
Can you handle it?

267
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I am a bit nervous.

268
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,139
I don't need the relaxing pill.
I have something better.

269
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,879
- When is Yeo Ha Jin coming?
- I can't see it.

270
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,490
Hello.

271
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:55,919
- Hi.
- Did you get started?

272
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:56,990
Of course.

273
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:00,259
What do you think?
Do you want more makeup?

274
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,460
- I think we're good.
- Okay.

275
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:04,289
- Then, rest for a bit.
- Okay.

276
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,000
- Did you bring it?
- Yes.

277
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,210
You can only take a sip. That's it.

278
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:16,809
If Ha Kyung and Ms. Park find out,

279
00:17:16,809 --> 00:17:17,910
they'll kill me.

280
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:20,279
Okay. I never got caught before.

281
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:21,349
Don't worry.

282
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,849
What is it? What are you two up to?

283
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:29,049
What do you mean?
This is just coffee.

284
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:30,849
I bought one for you too.
Which one is mine?

285
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:32,119
The one on the left.

286
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,019
Aren't they the same thing?

287
00:17:36,329 --> 00:17:37,630
This is Lee Jeong Hoon.

288
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,559
If you're not sure about something,
don't say it.

289
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:40,559
Don't say anything
unless he asks you.

290
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,369
Anyway, don't say anything
you don't need to say.

291
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,700
Come in.

292
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:47,099
- Hello.
- Hello.

293
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:48,609
Hi.

294
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:49,609
Nice to meet you.

295
00:17:49,609 --> 00:17:51,009
I came here because...

296
00:17:51,009 --> 00:17:53,309
I wanted to talk
about today's interview briefly.

297
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,509
You look more handsome in person
than on TV.

298
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:57,920
And you have a great voice too.

299
00:17:59,349 --> 00:18:01,220
What? He is handsome.

300
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,049
I didn't go over the line
or anything.

301
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:04,559
Do you think he's not handsome?

302
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:09,390
I'll leave you two
to talk about the interview.

303
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:10,730
Please help her a lot today.

304
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:11,730
Okay.

305
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,230
You are handsome, Mr. Lee.

306
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,200
You are very handsome.

307
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,200
Thank you.

308
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,509
- Ha Kyung.
- Ms. Park.

309
00:18:31,579 --> 00:18:34,279
Ms. Park, this is the best card
we have, right?

310
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,490
She's bound to cause trouble.

311
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,059
Since everyone gets criticized here,
it's better to get it done here.

312
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:40,759
But why do I feel like we're walking
into the fiery pit voluntarily?

313
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:43,730
Yes, you're right.
This is the fiery pit.

314
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,130
What should we do?

315
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:47,829
I don't know why I agreed to this.

316
00:18:47,829 --> 00:18:49,730
I must have lost my mind
for a second.

317
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,500
Should we pull out now?

318
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,500
No.

319
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,269
They'll criticize us even more then.

320
00:18:54,269 --> 00:18:55,269
Yes.

321
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:57,839
Our interview will be
the first segment of the news...

322
00:18:57,839 --> 00:18:59,710
and will air at 11 o'clock
on the dot.

323
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:01,980
The interview will last
for about 10 minutes.

324
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:02,980
I see.

325
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:07,380
I don't think the questionnaire
will be that helpful.

326
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,890
I'm glad to hear that.
I didn't get to read thoroughly.

327
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:11,859
I see.

328
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:13,259
Don't take it too seriously.

329
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:15,460
Just think of it
as a casual conversation.

330
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,059
I will.

331
00:19:18,329 --> 00:19:22,200
By the way, do you have
another tie instead of that one?

332
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Pardon?

333
00:19:24,769 --> 00:19:26,740
This tie doesn't complement
your skin tone at all...

334
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,309
- and your outfit, either.
- Wait.

335
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,339
A tie without patterns
will be better.

336
00:19:31,339 --> 00:19:33,009
And a light color...

337
00:19:33,009 --> 00:19:34,309
Do you have any bright-colored ties?

338
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,980
Well...

339
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:37,980
I'll look for one.

340
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,250
You have to change it. That doesn't
look good on you at all.

341
00:19:41,019 --> 00:19:42,019
Read the questionnaire,

342
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:43,789
and ask me questions
if you have any.

343
00:19:43,789 --> 00:19:45,059
Okay.

344
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,720
Oh, right. Mr. Lee,
have some coffee.

345
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:49,859
Coffee...

346
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:51,700
Which one...

347
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,569
Take this.

348
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,599
Okay. Thank you.

349
00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:06,609
Is this really coffee?

350
00:20:06,609 --> 00:20:08,150
It tastes like alcohol?

351
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,779
That one tastes like alcohol?

352
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,019
It's switched.

353
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:13,650
That's mine.

354
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:15,619
I must've given you the wrong one.

355
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,430
Were you going to drink alcohol
before the live broadcast?

356
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:22,630
No.

357
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,660
I didn't drink it yet.
You drank it just now.

358
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,299
But only a small amount was mixed.

359
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:30,829
Just a bit.

360
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,740
Are you okay?

361
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,480
Jeong Hoon.

362
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,950
What's she like?
Is she prettier in person?

363
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:45,950
She's beyond my expectations.

364
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,079
She's way prettier?

365
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,319
She's way crazier than I expected.

366
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:49,319
What?

367
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:51,460
What's that smell?

368
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:53,859
You drank alcohol?

369
00:20:53,859 --> 00:20:55,559
I didn't drink much. Just a sip.

370
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:58,500
And one-third of the drink
was coffee.

371
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,230
But I don't know
what kind of liquor it was.

372
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:01,799
I think it's whiskey.

373
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:03,470
What are you saying?

374
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,240
Who spiked the coffee with whiskey
and gave it to you?

375
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,240
Why?

376
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,839
It's a long story.

377
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,210
The live broadcast starts soon.
Will I be okay?

378
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:12,210
Hey.

379
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:14,339
A sip of whiskey is nothing.

380
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:16,079
A sip won't do anything.

381
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:18,279
Just brush your teeth
before you start.

382
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:20,880
Okay. You're an awful doctor,

383
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,849
but I can trust you
when it comes to alcohol.

384
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:27,319
But I might cause big trouble
even if I weren't intoxicated.

385
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:30,190
I need to interview a woman
who's more dangerous than alcohol.

386
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:32,730
Who? Are you talking
about Yeo Ha Jin?

387
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:35,329
Mr. Lee, hurry!

388
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:39,099
I should go in before I mess up
big time on TV. Bye.

389
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:41,200
Okay. Bye. Good luck.

390
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:55,119
Hi.

391
00:21:59,859 --> 00:22:01,890
("Lee Jeong Hoon's News Live")

392
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,430
Why didn't you change your tie?

393
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:11,470
Oh, this. I looked for one,

394
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:12,740
but I couldn't find one.

395
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:13,900
That's a lie.

396
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,910
You had a lot of ties
in your green room.

397
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,140
I found one.

398
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,079
This is perfect for you.
Put this on instead.

399
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:24,049
Ha Jin looks great in red.

400
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,420
I know.

401
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,750
Hurry. We don't have much time.

402
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:32,059
What are they doing?

403
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,789
Must I change it now?

404
00:22:34,089 --> 00:22:36,230
I'm serious.
That one looks terrible on you.

405
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,059
This looks much better on you.
It complements your skin tone.

406
00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:39,430
We'll start in a minute.

407
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,769
Hurry. We only have a minute.

408
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,529
Should I do it for you?

409
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:44,970
No.

410
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:47,599
I'll do it myself.

411
00:22:53,809 --> 00:22:56,680
What's going on?
Why is he changing his tie now?

412
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,880
Anchor Lee, be on standby.

413
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,589
10 seconds before the opening.

414
00:23:14,869 --> 00:23:16,500
Here's the opening.

415
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,440
It's starting.

416
00:23:18,569 --> 00:23:20,269
Anchor Lee, be on standby.

417
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,640
It's not as bright as
I thought it'd look.

418
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:26,740
We're rolling!

419
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:30,609
In 3, 2, 1.

420
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,250
To the anchor.

421
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:36,049
Hello, everyone.

422
00:23:36,049 --> 00:23:39,259
We'll now begin
"Lee Jeong Hoon's News Live".

423
00:23:40,089 --> 00:23:43,589
We have a special guest
in our studio today.

424
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:46,200
It's Actress Yeo Ha Jin.
Nice to meet you.

425
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,329
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
- How long until this is over?

426
00:23:48,329 --> 00:23:50,670
- They just said their greetings.
- I've seen you a lot on TV.

427
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,940
But this time, you were in a movie.

428
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:55,039
Isn't the title of your movie
"My First Love"?

429
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,869
Yes, that's right. I'm the first
love of the main character.

430
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:00,480
You played a lot of villainess roles
that bullied...

431
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,509
the main characters instead of
playing kind characters.

432
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:06,750
You might get this question a lot,
but how was that experience?

433
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:09,190
Which role do you prefer acting?

434
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:10,849
I definitely prefer
the villainess roles.

435
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:15,059
But of course, I liked the role
I played in the movie.

436
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:18,059
To be honest,
I don't think the roles...

437
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:20,230
I played so far aren't that wicked.

438
00:24:20,529 --> 00:24:22,630
I think the characters I played
didn't pretend to be nice...

439
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:25,299
on the outside
and stayed true to their feelings.

440
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:28,000
In that sense, the character
I played in the movie, Ae Young,

441
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,839
is the same way.

442
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:32,210
She's very honest
about her feelings.

443
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:35,509
It's my first time
meeting you, Ha Jin,

444
00:24:35,509 --> 00:24:37,410
so I haven't had a lot of time
to observe you.

445
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:40,619
But I think you are very honest
with yourself in real life too.

446
00:24:40,619 --> 00:24:43,490
That's right. You're spot on.

447
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,819
I'm very honest,

448
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:47,490
so I got criticized for that a lot.

449
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:49,660
- You have a lot of followers...
- That's her charm.

450
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,230
- on her social media.
- She's cool.

451
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,230
Do you like her?

452
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,500
- Of course.
- You were in the top ten...

453
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,670
- of Korean celebrities.
- I follow her on social media.

454
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,069
- You crazy jerk.
- I think I will get more...

455
00:24:57,069 --> 00:24:58,539
after this broadcast.

456
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:01,269
My goal is to get into the top five
within this year.

457
00:25:01,269 --> 00:25:03,009
- Why would she say that?
- Supporter.

458
00:25:03,009 --> 00:25:04,410
or devotee.

459
00:25:04,609 --> 00:25:07,710
That's the definition of the word,
"follower".

460
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:10,880
Of course, I'm not saying
that people who follow you...

461
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,779
on social media are
all supporters or devotees.

462
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:18,019
Just like this huge number,
8.6 million followers,

463
00:25:18,019 --> 00:25:22,160
you can say that you leave
a huge impact on the public, right?

464
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:24,029
Probably.

465
00:25:24,529 --> 00:25:26,759
I have a question now.

466
00:25:27,029 --> 00:25:29,930
This is a personal question for you.

467
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:32,170
I think I should ask
for your permission first.

468
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:35,539
If you don't want that, we can
proceed with prepared questions.

469
00:25:35,539 --> 00:25:37,640
My gosh, just follow the sheet.

470
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,079
This isn't your personal channel.

471
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,940
No, it's okay. You can ask me
whatever you want.

472
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,049
Thank you.

473
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:46,079
Before the interview, I checked out
your social media account.

474
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,720
From what I observed
from your social media account,

475
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,390
you are not consistent...

476
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:53,420
and seem to be a fickle person.

477
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:56,059
Pardon?

478
00:25:56,059 --> 00:25:58,759
- There he goes again. Darn it.
- I'll give you a few examples.

479
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,099
You uploaded countless numbers
of posts...

480
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,900
praising a certain product
and its company,

481
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,099
then you changed what you said...

482
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:09,769
and expressed your dissatisfaction
many times.

483
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:13,710
Then you expressed your support
for a certain political party,

484
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:17,210
then withdrew your support
in just three months.

485
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:21,250
Then a week later, you expressed
your support for that party again.

486
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:23,690
Is there a particular reason?

487
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,759
Yes, there is.

488
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:29,690
I see. May I ask what it is?

489
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:38,569
I don't exactly remember now,

490
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:41,170
but I definitely had a reason.

491
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:44,269
But you can't seem to remember
that definite reason,

492
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,509
although it's definite.

493
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:48,410
- It's...
- If you continuously change...

494
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:52,220
your values and beliefs
for reasons you don't even remember,

495
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,619
don't you think you're
a little too irresponsible...

496
00:26:54,619 --> 00:26:57,250
as a celebrity who has the power
to influence the general public?

497
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:00,390
It's...

498
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:03,859
You just said you're rather honest.

499
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:06,660
I'm not sure. From a different view,

500
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:11,529
it can look like you're covering up
your irresponsibility as honesty.

501
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:13,140
- That's not...
- If that's not it,

502
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,869
you might be using honesty
as your shield.

503
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:17,869
I don't know.

504
00:27:20,309 --> 00:27:21,480
I don't want to...

505
00:27:23,049 --> 00:27:25,720
be that complicated
when it comes to my feelings.

506
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,789
Regardless of making complicated
reasons or calculations,

507
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:31,960
I just want to live...

508
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:36,230
simply counting up to about 5 or 6.

509
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,470
I don't like complicated things.

510
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:46,069
I just want to live
simply counting up to about 5 or 6,

511
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:49,140
so that I can finish calculating
only by using my two thumbs.

512
00:27:50,809 --> 00:27:51,910
Come on.

513
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:55,279
It's my favorite saying,
so you have to remember that.

514
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:57,279
I'll never forget it. Don't worry.

515
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,220
Why isn't he saying anything?

516
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:09,759
Anchor Lee?

517
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:11,589
What's with him?

518
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:14,500
Hey, what are you doing? Anchor Lee?

519
00:28:18,269 --> 00:28:19,940
Excuse me, are you all right?

520
00:28:22,539 --> 00:28:23,539
Mr. Lee?

521
00:28:30,109 --> 00:28:31,109
Hey.

522
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,009
(We thank Park Seong Keun,
Kim Seon Ho, Rowoon, and Yura...)

523
00:28:56,009 --> 00:28:57,109
(for their special appearances.)

524
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:13,220
(Find Me in Your Memory)

525
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,559
Hyperthymesia?

526
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,359
Remembering too much is
a medical condition?

527
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:17,990
It's not that I remember a lot.

528
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:20,029
I just can't forget anything.

529
00:29:20,029 --> 00:29:21,029
Are you going to die?

530
00:29:21,029 --> 00:29:22,970
Does your first love
look like me too?

531
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,200
Wake up, Seo Yeon!

532
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,339
I'm sorry.

533
00:29:25,769 --> 00:29:28,000
I can't stop or end this.

534
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,339
It's as if I'm stuck in that memory.

535
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:31,539
I love you.

536
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:33,279
I'll remember this forever.

537
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:36,079
Why did he look so sad?

538
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:38,549
What was he saying in that silence?

539
00:29:38,579 --> 00:29:41,380
Jung Seo Yeon. Do you know her?
