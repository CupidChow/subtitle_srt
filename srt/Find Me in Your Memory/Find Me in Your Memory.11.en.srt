00:00:01,909 --> 00:00:04,309
(Episode 11)

2
00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:28,100
Hello, Director.

3
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,670
Nice to meet you.

4
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:32,840
I already heard from Tae Eun.

5
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:34,609
Is this your first time here?

6
00:00:34,939 --> 00:00:36,780
Yes, it's my first time.

7
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,140
Please, let's go inside.

8
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,649
May I ask you for the reason?

9
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:48,189
You never visited us
for the last eight years.

10
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:50,990
Why did you suddenly want to visit?

11
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:55,890
I wanted to check...

12
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:04,340
that he was stuck in there...

13
00:01:05,469 --> 00:01:07,609
with no rights whatsoever.

14
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,379
I wanted to know...

15
00:01:11,379 --> 00:01:12,709
(Quarantine Treatment Room 1:
Moon Seong Ho)

16
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:14,280
that there was nothing he could do.

17
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:18,719
And I also wanted to know...

18
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:21,519
that I'd never lose someone again
because of him.

19
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,659
This is the first and the last time
I'm doing this favor for you.

20
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:33,060
Going there doesn't do you any good.

21
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:34,469
I know.

22
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,569
I just wanted to check
that it really wasn't him.

23
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:40,709
I know what you're thinking.

24
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:42,870
It's not true.
That won't ever happen again.

25
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:45,239
You saw him locked up.

26
00:01:46,849 --> 00:01:48,810
Ha Jin is a celebrity.

27
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,019
She may have some obsessed fans.

28
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,920
She can be more careful from now on.

29
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:55,549
So don't take it too seriously.

30
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,920
I thought the same thing
eight years ago.

31
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,530
I thought it was just a coincidence.

32
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:05,799
I thought it wasn't a big deal.

33
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,210
Did you wait for long?

34
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,219
I saw him at the convenience store.

35
00:02:28,389 --> 00:02:30,120
Are these silver?

36
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,719
Doesn't it look nice?

37
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,490
Yes.

38
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:35,930
I saw him at a cafe.

39
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:41,629
I saw him many times
but thought nothing of it.

40
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,300
I thought it was understandable
since he lived nearby.

41
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,740
Had I...

42
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,479
suspected him at least once...

43
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:54,150
Had I taken it more seriously,
I would've been able to stop it.

44
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,150
I'm the reason...

45
00:02:57,449 --> 00:02:58,680
Seo Yeon died.

46
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:05,520
I don't think I'll be able to live
if the same thing happened again.

47
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,389
I can't lose Ha Jin.

48
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:32,349
Are you looking for something?

49
00:03:32,349 --> 00:03:33,990
I can't find the other one.

50
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,389
Didn't you keep them together?

51
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,419
I thought I did,
but I can't find one of them.

52
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:40,659
I had purposely set them aside
for today's meeting.

53
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,729
Maybe it got snatched
by one of your clothes.

54
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,530
Look carefully.

55
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,530
Are you sure you didn't wear it?

56
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,430
Not in a million years.

57
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:52,240
Gosh.

58
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,139
This would've been perfect.

59
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:25,040
You're here early.

60
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:26,769
Hello.

61
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:28,439
Hello.

62
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,410
- Hello. Take this first.
- What?

63
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,509
If you're hesitant
about saying something, then don't.

64
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:37,379
Just answer their questions.
Don't say anything unnecessary.

65
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:39,019
- Okay.
- Should I wait in the car...

66
00:04:39,019 --> 00:04:40,389
around 9 p.m.?

67
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:41,819
- Yes.
- That's okay.

68
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:43,790
I'll drop her home.

69
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:46,920
That'd be great.

70
00:04:48,529 --> 00:04:50,699
- Let's go.
- Okay.

71
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,610
You two look great together. Right?

72
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:02,610
I guess.

73
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,139
Do you have a lot of time today?

74
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:07,449
I'd like to ask you
every single question I have.

75
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:08,649
Sure.

76
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,550
I always study beforehand,

77
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:15,319
but I get stuck
every time I write my scripts.

78
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:18,889
Let's drink. They seem busy.

79
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,360
Okay.

80
00:05:21,089 --> 00:05:22,129
Look at this.

81
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,860
These are all the questions
I have for you.

82
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,860
I see.

83
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,529
I saw your movie.

84
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:31,699
I see.

85
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,970
You looked beautiful
from the opening scene.

86
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,040
I liked your acting as well.

87
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,339
Really?

88
00:05:40,209 --> 00:05:41,379
Let me be honest.

89
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,149
I was a bit hesitant at first.

90
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,579
But after watching it, I was sure.

91
00:05:46,649 --> 00:05:49,790
I realized I could count on you.

92
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,689
Thank you for saying that.
I'll do my best.

93
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:54,959
Okay.

94
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:57,829
Let's eat while we chat.

95
00:05:57,829 --> 00:05:59,430
Our food was served a while ago.

96
00:05:59,529 --> 00:06:01,930
I'm sorry for blabbering on and on.

97
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,740
Enjoy your meal.

98
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:07,110
Ha Jin, this is really delicious.
Try it.

99
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,209
Okay.

100
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:11,079
When Ha Na was young,

101
00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:14,579
she didn't know
she was allergic to shrimp...

102
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:16,750
and thought they always stung.

103
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,079
She always thought it was strange
but continued to eat them.

104
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:22,019
In the end, she was carried
to the ER...

105
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:23,920
but still didn't know
it was because of the shrimp.

106
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,420
Isn't that funny?

107
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,759
Yes, it is.

108
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,129
You can't have shrimp.

109
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:38,899
That was shrimp? I didn't know.

110
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:40,610
What is it? Are you allergic?

111
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,540
Yes, my throat swells.

112
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,740
I break out in hives as well.
It takes me a while to get better.

113
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,579
I'm so sorry.

114
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:48,680
It could've been dangerous.

115
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,649
I'm glad.

116
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:54,420
Your boyfriend knows everything
about you.

117
00:06:54,889 --> 00:06:55,889
Lucky you.

118
00:06:57,259 --> 00:06:59,089
We should eat this.

119
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,759
How did you know?

120
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,000
Have I told you before?

121
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:10,329
Please excuse me.
I need to go to the restroom.

122
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:11,540
Sure.

123
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:19,839
It's probably best for her
to practice reading the news...

124
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,350
as soon as possible, right?

125
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,379
Yes.

126
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,220
But then again,
he'll help you with that.

127
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,850
I have nothing
to worry about, right?

128
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,319
Of course.
I bet he'll be very strict.

129
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:37,430
Excuse me. I need to take this.

130
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,000
Let's drink.

131
00:07:46,269 --> 00:07:47,310
Okay.

132
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:55,850
Are you confident?

133
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,519
This drama won't be easy.

134
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:01,550
I'm not confident,
but if I try my...

135
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:02,649
You're not?

136
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:04,819
Then you shouldn't do it.

137
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,990
You should take work seriously.

138
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,360
Sorry?

139
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,930
Writer Hwang wanted to cast you,
so I said okay.

140
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:14,170
But I'm not happy with this.

141
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:19,000
I want the lead actress
to be elegant.

142
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:21,970
But you're...

143
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,180
You probably know it too.

144
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:26,610
You're far from it.

145
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,889
Let's be honest.

146
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:40,629
Do you think you're fit
for the role as a news anchor?

147
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:44,600
Aren't you embarrassed?

148
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:48,470
I know you picked this
because of your boyfriend.

149
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:53,669
But then again, I guess
it's a talent to date competent men.

150
00:08:56,509 --> 00:08:57,639
I think...

151
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:01,250
you're out of line.

152
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,649
That's great.

153
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:05,549
You don't like me, right?

154
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,090
Then let's not waste any energy
and just put an end to this.

155
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,960
Writer Hwang is just
infatuated with Anchor Lee.

156
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,590
But she'll come to her senses
after hearing you read the script.

157
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,730
So put an end to this.

158
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:20,629
Say that your schedule is busy
or that you're feeling sick.

159
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:22,970
Do you understand?

160
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,789
I'm sorry. It was urgent.

161
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,889
What were we talking about again?

162
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:50,529
Right. We were talking
about how excellent of a teacher...

163
00:09:50,529 --> 00:09:53,059
you'd be for her.

164
00:09:54,269 --> 00:09:57,129
Of course. I'm going to do my best.

165
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:59,139
You'll be taken aback
during the script reading...

166
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:00,539
by how realistic she sounds.

167
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:03,639
Oh, my!
I'm already looking forward to this.

168
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:07,610
By the way,
she didn't win this role...

169
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:09,580
because of our relationship,
did she?

170
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,720
Not at all.

171
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:13,820
I'm just worried...

172
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,620
that people might think
she got this role...

173
00:10:16,789 --> 00:10:18,360
because of her boyfriend.

174
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,090
Not at all. That's absurd.

175
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,929
We wouldn't do that.

176
00:10:22,929 --> 00:10:24,460
After all,
she's the one who'll be acting.

177
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:27,370
Right? I guess that was
unnecessary to ask.

178
00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:29,299
Those who think
such foolish thoughts...

179
00:10:29,299 --> 00:10:30,470
are the weird ones.

180
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:31,840
Of course.

181
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,269
We shouldn't deal
with scumbags like them.

182
00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:35,470
Right?

183
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:37,070
Right.

184
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,250
Ha Jin, don't be hurt
by such rumors, okay?

185
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:42,980
Okay.

186
00:10:54,429 --> 00:10:56,659
Can you buy me a can of beer?

187
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,659
You drank a lot of wine earlier.

188
00:11:01,629 --> 00:11:03,169
Just one can.

189
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:06,240
It's just that I feel so frustrated.

190
00:11:07,539 --> 00:11:09,370
Just buy me one can of beer.

191
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,320
Thank you.

192
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:42,840
Does that hit the spot?

193
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,179
A bit.

194
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:50,350
Here.

195
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:03,059
I'm going to get off.

196
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:57,820
Are you all right?

197
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:01,649
Why did you drink so much?

198
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,990
You heard everything earlier,
didn't you?

199
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,830
You heard everything earlier.

200
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:12,830
The conversation
between the director and me.

201
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:19,740
Not everything.
I caught a few sentences.

202
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:22,840
But why are you speaking
casually to me now?

203
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,740
It's about time that we did.

204
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:27,440
Until when do I have
to address as Anchor Lee?

205
00:13:28,179 --> 00:13:29,679
Is this the alcohol talking?

206
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:31,580
If you think it's unfair,
you can talk to me casually too.

207
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:40,889
Is that what you think too?

208
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:45,059
Do I look cheap?

209
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:48,669
Am I that awful?

210
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,539
Do you have the same opinion
of me as the director?

211
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:56,870
Director, my foot.

212
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,809
He's such a scumbag.

213
00:13:59,909 --> 00:14:01,710
He couldn't say anything
in front of the writer,

214
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,649
but he threatened an actress
behind the writer.

215
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:06,120
Why would you care
about a scumbag like that?

216
00:14:08,049 --> 00:14:10,019
You said you really wanted
to be in that drama.

217
00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:12,120
Then, you should be in it.

218
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,690
Isn't going after what you want
your thing?

219
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:19,000
Can an anchor...

220
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:22,769
badmouth someone like that?

221
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:25,370
Why not?

222
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,070
I'm really good
at badmouthing people.

223
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,049
There's no other way. I give up.

224
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,679
You'll give up on the drama?

225
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:41,649
No, I'll be in the drama.

226
00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:43,889
I must do it out of spite
if I have to.

227
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:47,159
Not the drama. I give up
on speaking casually to you.

228
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:49,389
I won't do it, so you don't get
to talk to me casually.

229
00:14:50,129 --> 00:14:52,230
It makes my heart flutter,
so I can't have that.

230
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,429
And...

231
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,399
don't blame me later.

232
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:04,279
You brought this upon yourself.

233
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:30,799
What is it?

234
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:33,399
We can't do this.

235
00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:35,970
Why not?

236
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:39,080
We'll regret it.

237
00:15:41,009 --> 00:15:42,649
I won't regret it.

238
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,919
No, you will.

239
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:57,159
Perhaps, you'll regret more than me.

240
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:08,539
Gosh, why won't she call?

241
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:17,509
What? I told you to call me
before you got here.

242
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:20,879
How did the meeting go?
Did you do well?

243
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:23,289
Why are you quiet?

244
00:16:23,289 --> 00:16:24,720
Did the meeting go well?

245
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,460
Yes? Hello?

246
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:29,029
Hello? Excuse me.

247
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:34,700
What on earth happened?

248
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:36,029
You reek of alcohol.

249
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,500
Ha Jin, did you get drunk
and cause trouble?

250
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,539
Is that why you look sad?

251
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,509
I didn't cause trouble.

252
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,480
You did. I can tell.

253
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,740
How did you mess it up?

254
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:48,879
Don't tell me you got excited
and overly friendly with them.

255
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,320
You did. That's what you did.

256
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,789
How will you fix this now?

257
00:16:54,789 --> 00:16:56,350
Seriously. You're making
this very difficult for me.

258
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:59,159
What if they say no and reject you?

259
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:01,159
Why not? Why can't I do it?

260
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:02,490
Why can't it be me?

261
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:04,259
You can't do it?
Did they already reject you?

262
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:06,900
- Then, why was he nice to me?
- Nice to you?

263
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,430
He should have let me eat
that shrimp.

264
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,430
Shrimp?

265
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,170
He took care of me, sided with me,
and acted cool for no good reason.

266
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:16,740
Cool? What did you say?

267
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,210
Forget it.

268
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:20,809
I don't want him, either.
Tell him I don't want him.

269
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:23,380
Weren't we talking about the drama?

270
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:25,450
- Get out.
- Hey.

271
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:26,950
Get out!

272
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,549
I don't want you.
Gosh, I don't want this either.

273
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,559
Goodness.

274
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:34,990
Unbelievable.

275
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:45,799
Aren't you hungry?

276
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:48,529
There's a famous sushi restaurant
nearby. Should we get some?

277
00:18:48,529 --> 00:18:50,769
I'm tired. Let's eat at home.

278
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:52,339
Okay.

279
00:18:52,869 --> 00:18:54,740
You're not asking
about Anchor Lee today.

280
00:18:55,309 --> 00:18:56,670
Whenever you came
to do a radio show,

281
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,640
you would think about calling him.

282
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:02,380
Something happened
between you two, right?

283
00:19:02,849 --> 00:19:04,279
What is it?

284
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:06,720
Nothing happened.
I'm just tired today.

285
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,730
Yes, I just came down.

286
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:15,960
- Where are you?
- What are you doing?

287
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:21,869
I'm in the lobby
on the first floor. Where?

288
00:19:23,569 --> 00:19:24,569
What is this?

289
00:19:24,569 --> 00:19:26,569
You said nothing happened.
Why are we hiding?

290
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:28,970
Right.

291
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:31,710
Why did I hide?
I didn't do anything wrong.

292
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,150
What about Mr. Jo? I thought
the three of us were meeting.

293
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,250
He'll be back soon.

294
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,849
I told him to pay for the meal
since he's late.

295
00:19:38,849 --> 00:19:39,920
So order something expensive.

296
00:19:40,849 --> 00:19:42,519
You did something wrong.

297
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:43,650
When you met the writer
and the director,

298
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,519
did you mess up
in front of Anchor Lee?

299
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:46,589
Mess up?

300
00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:48,890
I didn't do anything wrong.

301
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:51,700
Right.

302
00:19:52,029 --> 00:19:54,029
Why must I avoid him?
I didn't do anything wrong.

303
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:56,799
I can just say hello to him.

304
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,069
We can surely exchange greetings.

305
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,970
I'm not sure if I'll be of any help
in writing the article.

306
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:03,539
Schizophrenia
isn't my area of expertise.

307
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:05,509
You'll be just advising him.

308
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:08,109
But make it sound
as difficult as you can.

309
00:20:08,109 --> 00:20:09,180
I want him to suffer a bit.

310
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,109
Let's go say hi.

311
00:20:11,849 --> 00:20:12,849
What?

312
00:20:23,329 --> 00:20:25,299
What brings you here, Doctor Yoo?

313
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:27,599
Hi, Ha Jin.

314
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,230
It's been a while.

315
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:31,869
My gosh. It's been so long.

316
00:20:31,869 --> 00:20:34,039
I had no idea
that I would run into you here.

317
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:38,640
By the way, do you know each other?

318
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,380
Why are you guys together?

319
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,849
I'm sorry. I'm late.

320
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,720
Hello. I've heard a lot about you.

321
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,789
I didn't know it was possible
for Jeong Hoon to have any friends.

322
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,289
You're his only friend, right?

323
00:20:51,089 --> 00:20:52,119
"Friends"?

324
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:54,930
Doctor Yoo and Anchor Lee?

325
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:58,700
- Goodness, hello.
- Hello.

326
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:01,529
Are we all eating together?

327
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:03,369
Oh, no. We aren't.

328
00:21:03,369 --> 00:21:05,440
If I'm not too much of a nuisance,
may I go with you?

329
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,309
I'd like to ask something too.

330
00:21:18,579 --> 00:21:21,150
Doctor Yoo was here to give advice
for my article.

331
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,289
I took on a new report...

332
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,160
on crimes committed
by schizophrenic patients.

333
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:28,690
Oh, I see.

334
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,529
But it doesn't look so great.

335
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:34,200
I wouldn't have come if I had known.

336
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,099
Exactly. You shouldn't have.
You're very slow.

337
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,369
Excuse me. I'd like
three sushi A sets for that table...

338
00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:44,009
- and three sets for us.
- Okay.

339
00:21:44,009 --> 00:21:46,180
Three for us?
Are we expecting someone else?

340
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,579
No, I just like sushi a lot.

341
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,279
Why? Is this your 1st time
seeing someone eat 2 sushi meals?

342
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:52,519
Yes, it's my first time.

343
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,150
My girlfriend can't even finish one.

344
00:21:55,849 --> 00:21:58,490
She must eat very little.

345
00:21:58,519 --> 00:22:01,789
People usually eat
at least two sushi meals.

346
00:22:01,789 --> 00:22:04,190
No way. People usually eat one.

347
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,529
That's why it's called one serving.

348
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,460
You eat a lot. That's what.

349
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,500
Yes.

350
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,500
Anyway, isn't something weird
about the three of them?

351
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,240
No. Not at all.

352
00:22:14,869 --> 00:22:16,710
Stop minding that table.

353
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,680
It's none of your business.

354
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:23,750
It really is a small world.

355
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,279
I never imagined that
you two would be friends.

356
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:31,589
Anchor Lee, I told you before...

357
00:22:32,089 --> 00:22:33,190
that...

358
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:35,990
there was a problem with my memory.

359
00:22:37,859 --> 00:22:41,359
Doctor Yoo was actually
my counselor for about two years.

360
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:45,640
Then we lost contact
as I went into acting.

361
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,170
It wouldn't be good
if people found out I was counseled.

362
00:22:50,009 --> 00:22:51,039
I see.

363
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,849
It's shocking to think
that it had been five years already.

364
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,349
Isn't that so, Doctor Yoo?

365
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:57,910
You're right.

366
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:02,390
But you two seem like
an unlikely match.

367
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:04,119
Since when were you two friends?

368
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:11,059
For a long time.
Since when we were 11.

369
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:13,660
Yes, it's
a pretty gross relationship.

370
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:16,869
You two must be very close.

371
00:23:17,769 --> 00:23:18,839
Oh, right.

372
00:23:19,099 --> 00:23:22,170
Anchor Lee, may I have
a word with you after we eat?

373
00:23:23,609 --> 00:23:24,640
Sure.

374
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,210
I've been here once
for a production presentation.

375
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:34,150
It's kind of strange
to see how quiet it is.

376
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:39,660
There aren't a lot of places in our
building where we can have privacy.

377
00:23:50,369 --> 00:23:52,200
I didn't know...

378
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,970
what to say or how I should face you
when I ran into you again.

379
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:03,509
Did you already know...

380
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,549
that I had a problem with my memory?

381
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:13,990
And that I had
Doctor Yoo as a counselor?

382
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,730
Did you know?

383
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:20,900
Yes.

384
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,740
Was that why you were so good to me?

385
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,079
Did you pity me?

386
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,250
No.

387
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:39,019
You pitied me, didn't you?

388
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:40,450
I never pitied you.

389
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,720
I'm not in a position
to pity anyone,

390
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:48,059
and there's no reason
for you to be pitied.

391
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:52,000
You are very difficult,

392
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:53,900
Anchor Lee.

393
00:24:59,269 --> 00:25:02,269
You always seem to tell the truth,

394
00:25:02,269 --> 00:25:04,170
yet it doesn't seem like the truth.

395
00:25:05,509 --> 00:25:07,539
I hear a lot from you,

396
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,009
but it seems like I heard nothing.

397
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,279
It's frustrating at times,

398
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,849
but I keep wanting to know more.

399
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:20,859
I find you very difficult,

400
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:24,630
Anchor Lee.

401
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,390
Hello?

402
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:50,990
Doctor Yoo, this is Yeo Ha Jin.

403
00:25:51,819 --> 00:25:53,490
You haven't changed your number.

404
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,859
This place is still the same.

405
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:01,730
And it's still empty.

406
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,869
There are a lot of customers
during lunchtime.

407
00:26:03,869 --> 00:26:04,900
I see.

408
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,109
You're still the same too,
Doctor Yoo.

409
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:10,539
You haven't gotten old at all.

410
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:14,480
Wouldn't it be heartbreaking if
I grew noticeably old in five years?

411
00:26:14,809 --> 00:26:15,980
Is that so?

412
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:18,880
It's really great to see you again.

413
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:21,849
I was too shocked before
to celebrate our reunion.

414
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:25,420
- Hello. What would you like?
- Hello.

415
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,589
Two bowls of rice soup, please.

416
00:26:26,589 --> 00:26:27,890
- Okay.
- Yes.

417
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:32,430
Right, what did
Anchor Lee say about me?

418
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,230
I'm sure you two talk a lot
since you're friends.

419
00:26:36,069 --> 00:26:38,269
Well, I don't know.

420
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,200
I'm guessing
it wasn't anything great.

421
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:45,079
To be honest,

422
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:48,279
I like him a lot.

423
00:26:50,049 --> 00:26:51,950
But he won't accept my feelings.

424
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:55,990
It feels unfair
to have him push me away...

425
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,259
after he confuses me
by leading me on.

426
00:26:59,859 --> 00:27:02,529
I've always wondered
why he acted like that.

427
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,460
But I think I kind of get it...

428
00:27:07,099 --> 00:27:08,400
thanks to you.

429
00:27:09,829 --> 00:27:11,299
What do you mean?

430
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:13,740
You once told me...

431
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:19,380
that your best friend has a disease
where he can't forget anything.

432
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,950
I had so much fun
and was very happy.

433
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:30,490
I remember those feelings vividly.

434
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,390
But I have...

435
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,990
no idea who I was with at that time.

436
00:27:37,529 --> 00:27:39,359
It definitely wasn't Ha Kyung.

437
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:41,769
There's no need
to remember everything.

438
00:27:42,099 --> 00:27:43,900
People all forget and move on.

439
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,599
That's normal.

440
00:27:46,769 --> 00:27:48,369
This is normal?

441
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:52,680
I know one person
who isn't like that.

442
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:57,680
He's my best friend
since when we were 11.

443
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:02,349
He can't forget anything.

444
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:04,619
Why not?

445
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:05,890
Because of a disease.

446
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,319
A disease that won't let him forget.

447
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:18,400
I can tell by your face
that I must be right.

448
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,039
I thought so.

449
00:28:22,109 --> 00:28:23,970
Anchor Lee often said...

450
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:26,279
he has too good of a memory.

451
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:30,779
- That's... Did I...
- I heard many things from you...

452
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:32,920
when I was counseled,

453
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:37,789
but I could never forget
what you said about your friend.

454
00:28:39,859 --> 00:28:42,190
I guess it's because
that sounded very special to me.

455
00:28:45,829 --> 00:28:47,900
It feels like
I finally resolved my riddle.

456
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,099
Did you say it was hyperthymesia?

457
00:28:55,869 --> 00:28:57,140
The name of that disease.

458
00:28:58,980 --> 00:28:59,980
(Hyperthymesia)

459
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,109
Reporter Choi Yul.

460
00:29:01,309 --> 00:29:03,509
I heard people who were arrested...

461
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:05,880
for using violent language
and behavior...

462
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,250
against medical staff has doubled
in the last three years.

463
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:10,890
Yes, although the punishments
became reinforced...

464
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:13,359
after the amendment of
the Medical Service Act in April,

465
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:15,630
there aren't many people
who became detained...

466
00:29:15,829 --> 00:29:18,529
because most cases are settled.

467
00:29:18,529 --> 00:29:19,529
Not many can easily...

468
00:29:19,529 --> 00:29:21,970
- deal with a lawsuit.
- "There is no known cure."

469
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:25,440
In the end, it'll be
the most important...

470
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,640
to stop these things
from happening...

471
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,869
and to efficiently control
the situation when this happens.

472
00:29:31,309 --> 00:29:32,910
Thank you, Reporter Choi Yul.

473
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,779
Thank you for watching
"Lee Jeong Hoon's News Live".

474
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:37,579
Have a great night.

475
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,950
- Great work.
- Great job.

476
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,220
- Great work.
- Great work.

477
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,619
- Great work.
- Great work.

478
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,390
- Great job.
- Great work today.

479
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:55,930
Great work.

480
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:04,509
You're very difficult,

481
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,279
Anchor Lee.

482
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,279
You always seem to tell the truth,

483
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:14,119
yet it doesn't seem like the truth.

484
00:30:16,349 --> 00:30:18,289
I hear a lot from you,

485
00:30:19,019 --> 00:30:20,920
but it seems like I heard nothing.

486
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:25,329
It's frustrating at times,

487
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:28,900
but I keep wanting to know more.

488
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,670
I find you very difficult,

489
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,700
Anchor Lee.

490
00:30:39,609 --> 00:30:41,210
(Tae Eun)

491
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:52,690
What suddenly brings you here?

492
00:30:53,259 --> 00:30:54,960
I caused a bit of an accident.

493
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:56,730
Like what?

494
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,599
Ha Jin found out...

495
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:01,230
about your disease.

496
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:04,369
It's my mistake.

497
00:31:04,569 --> 00:31:07,539
I once mentioned you
during our session.

498
00:31:07,539 --> 00:31:10,640
It was just once,
but she remembered it.

499
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:14,410
I'm sorry.

500
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,180
It's not your fault
I have that disease.

501
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,849
There's no reason
to hide it from everyone forever.

502
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,490
So...

503
00:31:23,289 --> 00:31:26,190
how much does she know
about her condition?

504
00:31:26,819 --> 00:31:29,490
Why does she think
there's a problem with her memory?

505
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,460
A motorcycle accident.

506
00:31:32,329 --> 00:31:33,559
She thinks she got badly hurt...

507
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:36,829
because of that accident,
fell unconscious, then woke up,

508
00:31:37,369 --> 00:31:40,940
and that it caused a momentary
problem with her memory.

509
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,470
That's what she knows.

510
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:44,940
By any chance,

511
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:49,079
did she ever tell you
about her condition?

512
00:31:49,609 --> 00:31:51,509
I heard she said she isn't normal.

513
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:54,150
Yes.

514
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:58,319
She still thinks
there's a problem with her memory.

515
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,490
And she seems to be confused.

516
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:02,759
Why didn't you tell me?

517
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:04,990
It seemed like
she didn't want others to find out.

518
00:32:06,259 --> 00:32:08,970
I can't tell you
something she wants to hide.

519
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:14,700
To be honest, I'm nervous...

520
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,039
that things will
get out of our hands.

521
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:19,240
If...

522
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:21,940
she remembers Seo Yeon,

523
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:24,349
you also know what could happen.

524
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,319
I don't want to see you
or Ha Jin get hurt.

525
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,619
Don't do anything you'll regret.

526
00:32:31,089 --> 00:32:32,390
I'm doing my best.

527
00:32:33,019 --> 00:32:35,430
I also don't want her to be hurt.

528
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:37,630
Don't worry.
