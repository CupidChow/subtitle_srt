00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:05,179
(Episode 5)

2
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:09,679
Jung Seo Yeon?

3
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,449
Yes. Jung Seo Yeon.

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:14,890
Do you know her?

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,129
No, I've never
heard that name before.

6
00:00:22,629 --> 00:00:23,829
Who is that?

7
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:27,570
(Patient Chart: Yeo Ha Jin)

8
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,880
Why are you asking me?

9
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,719
You need to explain
to help me take a guess.

10
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,719
Is she famous? Is she an actress?

11
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,890
I may have met her,

12
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:54,060
but I could have forgotten.

13
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,890
I don't have a great memory.

14
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,159
You said you got injured
and stopped doing ballet, right?

15
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,829
When exactly was that?

16
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:05,000
My first year in college.

17
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,340
I got into a motorcycle accident...

18
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,569
and hurt my ankle badly.

19
00:01:11,209 --> 00:01:12,879
Why do you suddenly ask me this?

20
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:14,180
What's with you?

21
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,250
(Ha Kyung)

22
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,390
Take that call.

23
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:27,730
Call your sister here and go.

24
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,530
What do you think you're doing?

25
00:01:31,629 --> 00:01:32,730
No.

26
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:34,930
I can't leave like this. I won't.

27
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:36,670
You need to tell me...

28
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,640
why you're doing this
and who Jung Seo Yeon is.

29
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,569
I'll go once you tell me.

30
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:42,469
I can't tell you.

31
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,579
So you need to go.

32
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,079
Call your sister,

33
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:50,420
take a taxi, or walk.

34
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,049
You need to go.

35
00:01:58,989 --> 00:02:00,689
Then I'll drop you off.

36
00:02:13,169 --> 00:02:15,969
(Find Me in Your Memory)

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,800
Why wouldn't she explain anything
and just tell me to come?

38
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:49,740
I think we're here. Could you stop?

39
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:50,740
Sure.

40
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,250
Please wait a minute.

41
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,090
Hello.

42
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,560
- Hello.
- Hello.

43
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:08,990
You're early.

44
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:10,530
Where are we?

45
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:11,860
It's his house.

46
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:12,900
"His house"?

47
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,939
What did you two do in there?

48
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:19,370
Nothing.

49
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:22,710
I just dropped him off.

50
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,280
You did what?

51
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:27,379
Can't a grown man go home alone?

52
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,879
It's late. Let's talk at home.

53
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:39,060
What are we doing outside
so late at night?

54
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,909
Please go back.

55
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:19,230
Why did she leave her car here?

56
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,930
So what? Am I supposed
to get it back?

57
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:25,800
Of course, I should. Right.

58
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,810
Let's go.

59
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,860
There wasn't a traffic jam, right?
Do you want some coffee?

60
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,399
Forget about coffee.
Let's straighten things out.

61
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,329
What did you do with Anchor Lee?

62
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:58,600
I already told you everything
yesterday.

63
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,709
I want to check.

64
00:05:00,709 --> 00:05:04,509
So you two decided to act
as if you're dating.

65
00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:07,879
No, wait.
You officially asked him out,

66
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:09,009
but he said no?

67
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:10,449
You heard me right the first time.

68
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,420
I'm so speechless.

69
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:15,389
Why would he dump you then ask
to be dropped off at home?

70
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:18,759
I offered to do so. It's nothing.

71
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:20,629
Why are you getting all worked up?

72
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,490
I know you're the exhausting type...

73
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,459
and have been dumped often.

74
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:26,860
But no one has ever rejected you
from the beginning.

75
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,699
I was dumped only once
for being too exhausting.

76
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:30,569
No, there were numerous times.
They just didn't tell you.

77
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:32,939
Like who? Dong Joon? Min Seok?

78
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:35,040
Forget it. What's the point?

79
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:37,110
There's no way.

80
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,209
Forget what I said.

81
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:40,610
I'm getting hungry
from getting all worked up.

82
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:41,680
Are you going to have ramyeon?

83
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,310
Yes. You can't, right?

84
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:46,879
No, I'm on a diet. Lucky you.

85
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,850
Tell me right now
if you're going to have some.

86
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,759
If not, I'm going to cook
just enough for myself.

87
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:52,689
No, I won't eat.

88
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,660
Right, do you know
who Jung Seo Yeon is?

89
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:03,269
Are you okay?

90
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:09,470
I'm so famished
that I have no energy.

91
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:13,079
What was the name again?

92
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:15,810
Jung Seo Yeon.

93
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:18,420
Do you know her? I don't.

94
00:06:19,149 --> 00:06:20,550
Me neither.

95
00:06:21,149 --> 00:06:22,589
But why all of a sudden?

96
00:06:23,019 --> 00:06:25,920
Jeong Hoon asked yesterday
whether I knew her or not.

97
00:06:26,089 --> 00:06:27,990
He did? Why?

98
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:30,360
I don't know. He didn't say why.

99
00:06:32,529 --> 00:06:34,800
I can't take this.
I'll have half of the ramyeon.

100
00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:36,800
I can exercise afterward, right?

101
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:38,000
Yes.

102
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,069
Don't cook it for too long.

103
00:06:51,649 --> 00:06:52,850
"Jung Seo Yeon"?

104
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,050
(Ha Na and Yeong's Exchange Diary)

105
00:07:27,649 --> 00:07:29,649
(Ha Na's)

106
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:31,060
(Yeong's)

107
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,060
Get ready. And one.

108
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:38,699
And 2, and 3.

109
00:07:38,829 --> 00:07:40,769
Plie, up.

110
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:42,699
And passe.

111
00:07:44,069 --> 00:07:45,069
Two.

112
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,370
Three.

113
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:50,910
Hold on. You guys got it wrong.

114
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:53,740
You've made the same mistake again.

115
00:07:55,149 --> 00:07:57,009
You have something in your teeth.

116
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,379
Ha jin, Seo Yeon.
What did I tell you?

117
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,949
You shouldn't eat anything
before your performance.

118
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,560
- Look at that.
- This won't do.

119
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,160
- Come on out.
- It's nothing.

120
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,459
- Why did you laugh?
- What?

121
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:13,560
You laughed first.

122
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:18,600
- Bend your knees.
- It's all because you laughed.

123
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,470
I laughed because you did.

124
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:24,079
I'm so hungry.

125
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:25,709
Let's go have tteokbokki.

126
00:08:25,779 --> 00:08:27,410
"Tteokbokki"?

127
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:28,550
Right now?

128
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,980
Yes, let's sneak out.
My arms are getting sore.

129
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:36,789
Sure. I got allowance today,
so it's my treat.

130
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,559
Let's go.

131
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,289
And 2, and 3.

132
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,899
Up and...

133
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:49,230
You two.

134
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:52,440
- Oh, no.
- Hurry!

135
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:58,539
Hurry up!

136
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,379
Hurry!

137
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:06,950
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

138
00:09:10,289 --> 00:09:12,090
We need to change our shoes.

139
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:21,169
- Yeo Ha Jin! Jung Seo Yeon!
- Let's go!

140
00:09:21,169 --> 00:09:23,330
Stop right there!

141
00:09:24,669 --> 00:09:25,740
Let's go!

142
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:30,980
That one! We need to get on that!

143
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,710
Stop!

144
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,919
Hello. Two people.

145
00:09:45,789 --> 00:09:47,789
Oh, yes. We did it.

146
00:09:51,429 --> 00:09:52,629
Gosh.

147
00:09:53,029 --> 00:09:54,169
I'm out of breath.

148
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,799
What should we do?

149
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,809
I thought you had everything
planned out.

150
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,509
We can start now.

151
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:05,539
Then do you want to bike
along the Han River?

152
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:07,480
- Let's have cup noodles too.
- I want a sausage as well.

153
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,549
Okay. I'm starving.

154
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,720
Isn't the weather so nice?

155
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,789
I know.

156
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,139
- Sausages are the best.
- They are!

157
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,039
It's so hot.

158
00:10:39,409 --> 00:10:42,080
- Why am I still hungry?
- It's delicious.

159
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:45,320
- It really is.
- What should we tell them tomorrow?

160
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,320
Worry about that tomorrow.
Let's go to karaoke. Okay?

161
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,320
Okay.

162
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:52,320
What should we have there?

163
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:54,259
- Tteokbokki.
- And?

164
00:10:54,259 --> 00:10:55,759
And the sweet and sour chicken
we talked about before.

165
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:57,059
I love that.

166
00:10:57,059 --> 00:10:58,100
It's really good, right?

167

Ha Kyung, come on out.
The ramyeon is getting too soggy.

169
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:13,610
I'm going to finish it.

170
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:15,950
Stop right there. I'm coming.

171
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:23,919
- Look this way!
- Ha Jin!

172
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:25,259
I love you!

173
00:11:26,259 --> 00:11:29,059
Ha Jin, so many of your fans
are here.

174
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:30,190
Really?

175
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,639
We'll begin now.

176
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:40,840
I'm Kim Ea Na,
and this is "Nighttime Letters".

177
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:45,179
Ever since its release, the movie
has received a lot of love.

178
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:46,809
I'm here with Yeo Ha Jin,

179
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:49,649
the female lead of "My First Love".

180
00:11:49,649 --> 00:11:52,820
Could you describe the movie...

181
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,990
in one phrase?

182
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:59,090
I could say
that it's a sadistic movie.

183
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:00,419
"Sadistic"?

184
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:01,659
Is it the same definition...

185
00:12:01,659 --> 00:12:04,230
that I'm aware of
as in to abuse someone?

186
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,360
Yes, that's correct.

187
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,700
This movie can shake things up
emotionally,

188
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,669
so if you watch the movie,
it might be painful.

189
00:12:10,669 --> 00:12:14,710
I see. So you chose
that description in a positive way.

190
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:17,980
Yes. Here's a story from the movie.

191
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:21,779
Love can shake things up
for people, you know.

192
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:23,179
So it gets painful.

193
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,980
And the most painful moment is...

194
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,350
when your happiest moments...

195
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:31,659
become the saddest memories.

196
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,860
So on some days,
you want to forget about them.

197
00:12:36,529 --> 00:12:39,129
But on some days,
you never want to forget.

198
00:12:41,669 --> 00:12:44,399
So in the movie, Ae Young is torn...

199
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,139
because once she forgets about them,

200
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:47,809
it means she'd lost
her brightest moments.

201
00:12:48,169 --> 00:12:49,740
So in the end, she...

202
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:52,610
Go on.

203
00:12:53,909 --> 00:12:55,379
Please watch the movie
to find out what happens.

204
00:12:55,379 --> 00:12:58,379
My gosh, that was
great timing to stop.

205
00:12:58,379 --> 00:12:59,919
You're a pro.

206
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:02,320
All right. Let me stop here
for a moment then.

207
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,190
Let's listen to a song.

208
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:06,990
Ha Jin, you chose
this song yourself.

209
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:09,059
Yes, it's one of my favorite songs.

210
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:10,490
The lyrics are beautiful.

211
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,700
Great.

212
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,970
Let's listen to "Two People"
by Sung Si Kyung.

213
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,289
You're early.

214
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,159
Look at this.
You ordered my coffee too.

215
00:14:11,389 --> 00:14:12,990
I like you very much these days.

216
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:15,190
You're doing very well.

217
00:14:28,169 --> 00:14:29,909
My favorite song is playing.

218
00:14:30,509 --> 00:14:32,840
I guess the owner of the cafe
also likes this song.

219
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,480
This cafe plays this song often.

220
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,120
Right. Did I tell you?

221
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,990
Ha Na was the one
who introduced this song to me.

222
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:42,990
She told me
the lyrics were beautiful.

223
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:45,889
For some time, she recited
the lyrics as if they were a poem.

224
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:51,259
I am still learning a lot

225
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,799
And I'm still lacking in many ways

226
00:14:55,529 --> 00:15:01,169
But I will always stay by your side

227
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:07,850
Even if we get lost in the dark

228
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:11,350
The two of us

229
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:16,720
Will become each other's light

230
00:15:20,289 --> 00:15:22,159
Ha Na is a terrible singer.

231
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:23,759
She keeps saying she's not,

232
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:24,759
but she is.

233
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,299
Come to think of it,

234
00:15:27,299 --> 00:15:29,470
I've done a lot of things
for the first time with Ha Na.

235
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,500
The two of us went to karaoke
for the first time.

236
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,440
And we drank alcohol
for the first time together.

237
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,169
We drank whiskey together,
swam together,

238
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:40,940
and went on a blind date together.

239
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,850
You have a long way to go
if you want to catch up...

240
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,419
with our friendship.

241
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,090
Work harder.

242
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:49,990
Sure.

243
00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:02,669
I hope we get
to see her together next year.

244
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,740
I think I've met...

245
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,809
your friend, Ha Na.

246
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:17,879
It took me a while to recognize her
because her name changed.

247
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:30,929
I'm sorry. I'm late.

248
00:16:30,929 --> 00:16:32,399
No, it's all right.

249
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:39,500
I apologize
for suddenly asking you to meet me.

250
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:41,710
It really has been a long time.

251
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:45,240
I don't think we've met
after Seo Yeon's funeral.

252
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,909
Yes, you're right.

253
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:52,879
By the way, what is this about?

254
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,990
I had a question...

255
00:16:58,389 --> 00:17:00,159
about her friend, Ha Na.

256
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:03,389
Seo Yeon
and Ha Jin were really close.

257
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,529
You'd never met her before?

258
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:07,930
No,

259
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,470
I had never met her.

260
00:17:10,769 --> 00:17:13,569
So you're right. Ha Jin is Ha Na.

261
00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:16,140
You know, when you're young,

262
00:17:16,539 --> 00:17:19,279
you change your friend's name
for a nickname.

263
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:21,650
Seo Yeon was Yeong.

264
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,109
And Ha Jin was Ha Na.

265
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,349
That's how
they used to call each other.

266
00:17:45,339 --> 00:17:47,099
You're not nervous at all.

267
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:48,309
You're good with words too.

268
00:17:48,309 --> 00:17:51,410
Gosh, no. You made me
feel very comfortable here.

269
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:52,880
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

270
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:13,799
What?

271
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:16,869
Where did he go?

272
00:18:19,569 --> 00:18:22,539
My gosh, a radio show
is more exhausting than I thought.

273
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:26,440
What are you thinking?

274
00:18:26,779 --> 00:18:28,250
I need to go upstairs for a second.

275
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,349
Go where? To the newsroom?

276
00:18:30,349 --> 00:18:32,920
Yes. I definitely saw
Jeong Hoon earlier.

277
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,750
Ha Jin, no one likes it
when you barge into their offices...

278
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,089
without an appointment.

279
00:18:37,089 --> 00:18:39,420
This is why people say
they get sick of you.

280
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,460
No, that can't be true.

281
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,730
I'm so sick of you.

282
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,660
Wait. Hello.

283
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,000
Okay. Thank you.

284
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,869
What? This is Reporter Jo Il Kwon.

285
00:18:47,869 --> 00:18:50,170
- Hello. It's been a while.
- Hi.

286
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,170
Don't be like that.
It's Reporter Jo.

287
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,609
I see. I thought
he was your fan or something.

288
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:57,410
But which program do you work for?

289
00:18:57,839 --> 00:18:58,980
"News Live".

290
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,440
You and I talked on the phone.
And before the interview,

291
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,480
I even said hello to you.
Do you not remember me?

292
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,450
I'm sorry. I'm usually good
at remembering people's faces.

293
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:07,180
- But you...
- What about me?

294
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,690
That's a common face you have.

295
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,450
I do? No way.

296
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,890
A lot of people tell me
I have unique looks.

297
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:15,490
I see. Well, I see.

298
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:18,730
Is Jeong Hoon in the office?

299
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:20,900
No, he stepped out.

300
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,970
I see. Really?

301
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:27,839
- Doctor.
- Yes?

302
00:19:28,069 --> 00:19:29,440
You have a visitor.

303
00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:30,640
A visitor?

304
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,579
I'm here.

305
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:36,250
You should have just come in.

306
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,519
I must go
through the proper channels.

307
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:41,789
You're the director of the biggest
psychiatric clinic in this area.

308
00:19:43,089 --> 00:19:44,660
Do you want something to drink?

309
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,619
We're fine. You should all go home.

310
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:48,130
Okay. Have a nice time.

311
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:49,130
Thanks.

312
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,500
You didn't answer any of my calls.

313
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:53,200
What brings you here
all of a sudden?

314
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,099
I need to hear something from you.

315
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,539
About what?

316
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,980
You said you didn't know Yeo Ha Jin.

317
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,710
That was a lie.

318
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:11,420
You knew, didn't you?

319
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,950
That Ha Jin was Seo Yeon's friend.

320
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,789
But Ha Jin doesn't seem
to remember Seo Yeon at all...

321
00:20:23,329 --> 00:20:25,460
when I know for a fact
that they were friends.

322
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,230
Explain to me now.

323
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,769
What on earth happened?

324
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:35,470
What is the truth that you know,
but I don't?

325
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,509
I can understand why people...

326
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,779
who were interviewed by you had
the same look on their faces.

327
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:49,220
Well, there's no way
I can get out of this mess.

328
00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:55,789
Ha Jin has been my patient
for a very long time.

329
00:20:57,029 --> 00:20:58,829
Two months after...

330
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:00,859
what had happened to Seo Yeon,

331
00:21:02,299 --> 00:21:04,170
Ha Jin's mother came to me.

332
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,039
At first, I didn't know...

333
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:11,170
that Ha Jin was Seo Yeon's friend.

334
00:21:14,009 --> 00:21:16,710
After finding out everything,
I wanted to stop being her doctor,

335
00:21:19,549 --> 00:21:20,849
but I couldn't...

336
00:21:22,289 --> 00:21:23,289
because she reminded me...

337
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:26,390
of you back then.

344
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:06,930
Seo Yeon died.

345
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:10,869
Goodness, Jeong Hoon.

346
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,869
Goodness.

347
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:25,779
Seo Yeon...

348
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:30,119
died.

349
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:36,859
Nothing.

350
00:22:41,829 --> 00:22:45,039
I don't want to do anything.

351
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:53,109
I just want to disappear...

352
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,980
as if...

353
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,220
I never existed.

354
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:08,329
Ha Jin had
as much of a tough time as you.

355
00:23:11,029 --> 00:23:13,059
She was much different back then
compared to now.

356
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:15,769
She was like an empty shell,

357
00:23:16,329 --> 00:23:17,799
completely empty inside.

358
00:23:18,769 --> 00:23:21,099
It was as if
she couldn't hear or see anything,

359
00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:24,140
as if she's unable to feel anything.

360
00:23:25,309 --> 00:23:27,109
She would never eat or sleep,

361
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,349
collapse, get taken to a hospital,
and be woken up against her will.

362
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,819
After about three months...

363
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,720
Ha Jin, how are you feeling today?

364
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:44,230
The weather is so nice
that I want to go ride a bicycle.

365
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:46,599
What about you?
Do you want to do anything?

366
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:56,140
I'm not athletic at all,

367
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,680
so it was really tough for me
to learn to ride a bike.

368
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,740
I'd always fall down and get hurt.

369
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,549
Are you good at riding a bike?

370
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,119
- How does it sound? Why don't we...
- Sleep.

371
00:24:09,289 --> 00:24:12,589
I want to sleep for a bit.

372
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:16,029
It was the first time...

373
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,900
she said she wanted to do something.

374
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:24,200
I thought it was a positive sign.

375
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,339
That she was getting better.

376
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:29,240
So I prescribed
sleeping pills for her...

377
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:31,269
many more times after that.

378
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,250
Ha Jin.

379
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:42,119
Ha Jin.

380
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,750
Ha Jin!

381
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:46,890
Mom!

(Psychiatric clinic, Yeo Ha Jin)

383
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,869
That was the first thing...

384
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,200
she wanted to do.

385
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:04,569
She was unconscious for days.

386
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:07,740
When she finally woke up
at the brink of death,

387
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,180
she was completely different.

388
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:15,990
It was as if nothing had happened.
She was happy and bright.

389
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:20,720
I guess that was the only way
Ha Jin could cope with this.

390
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:23,789
Forgetting...

391
00:25:24,859 --> 00:25:25,900
Seo Yeon.

392
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,869
At first, she was very confused.

393
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,970
All the memories and time
she had with Seo Yeon...

394
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,839
turned into complete darkness.

This is her only picture
with Seo Yeon.

397
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:15,650
We got rid of all the pictures
of Seo Yeon which she had...

398
00:26:16,349 --> 00:26:19,750
as well as everything
that could remind her of Seo Yeon.

399
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:24,750
It was her family's choice and mine.

400
00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:28,589
We wanted to help her
forget Seo Yeon...

401
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:31,259
and live a normal life.

What's your plan?

404
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:47,779
I'm not sure. I can't seem to
put everything together.

405
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:51,380
Once you take care of
the scandal in two weeks,

406
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:53,779
you'll never have to see her again.

407
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:59,089
What could I say to someone
who erased her memories to live?

408
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:03,930
I'll turn everything back
as if nothing had happened.

Can't you see?

412
00:28:02,819 --> 00:28:05,519
You caught me drinking the bottles
I bought with my money. What?

413
00:28:05,789 --> 00:28:07,690
Exactly. You were asleep.
Why are you suddenly drinking?

414
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,930
I have a press conference tomorrow,

415
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:11,900
so I'm too nervous to sleep.

416
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,900
I can't seem to sleep
no matter what I do.

417
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,829
You were completely fine before
the live broadcast of "News Live",

418
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:19,470
yet you can't seem to sleep
over a mere press conference?

419
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:20,869
Man, that's why back then...

420

No.

424
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:33,849
I was going to, but I couldn't.

425
00:28:33,849 --> 00:28:35,089
I just had a smell.

426
00:28:35,349 --> 00:28:36,549
I see.

427
00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:38,819
You're insane. You're so crazy.

Fine. You had no idea
before I told you either.

Hurry!

434
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,140
How dare she treat
her older sister like this?
