1
00:00:02,509 --> 00:00:04,780
All right, this is the last sign.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,210
(Episode 1)

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:10,880
(Hello, let us begin...)

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,750
Check the newsreader's line
changed on the teleprompter...

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,189
for the third story.

6
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:15,419
Yes, sir.

7
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:16,690
(Hello, let us begin
"Lee Jeong Hoon's News Live".)

8
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,260
Opening video, standby.

9
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:25,300
Play the opening.

10
00:00:27,969 --> 00:00:29,769
Okay, in 10 seconds.

11
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,570
The audio is fine.

12
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,079
We'll begin with camera two.

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,149
Anchor Lee, we've sent you
the revised script.

14
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:45,380
Do check.

15
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:48,750
Three,

16
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:50,759
two,

17
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,390
one.

18
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,560
Go.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,399
Hello, everyone.

20
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:03,740
We'll now begin
"Lee Jeong Hoon's News Live".

21
00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:07,010
Today afternoon in Gangnam, Seoul,

22
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:08,569
there was a fire
at Hwarang Department Store.

23
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:12,109
The customers and employees
had to evacuate.

24
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,480
Thankfully,
there were no casualties,

25
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,579
but it could've been...

26
00:01:16,579 --> 00:01:18,579
- dangerous.
- Go.

27
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,849
Reporter Jo Il Kwon
will tell you the details.

28
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:23,319
Hwarang Department Store,

29
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:24,390
which is situated
in the middle of the city,

30
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,420
is full of smoke.

31
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:31,560
Anchor Lee, we don't have
much time today.

32
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:34,000
Make sure to add a bit to it.

33
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:36,939
Teleprompter, make sure
to keep the pace.

34
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:38,200
Yes, sir. I'll begin now.

35
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,040
On the fifth floor...

36
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,239
We have 20 seconds left.

37
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:44,340
- What? What's going on?
- Due to the lack...

38
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,780
of safety devices,
the fire worsened.

39
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,609
What's wrong? Is it broken?

40
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:51,780
Yes. What's wrong with this?

41
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,719
The fire authorities brought
25 pieces of equipment...

42
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:56,859
and countless firefighters
to extinguish the fire.

43
00:01:56,859 --> 00:01:59,090
As a result, the fire was put out...

44
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,090
What's wrong with this?

45
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,430
How could the teleprompter
have issues...

46
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,530
in the middle of the news?

47
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,400
Did you not check it beforehand?

48
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,269
I did. It was fine just a while ago.

49
00:02:07,269 --> 00:02:09,129
We have five seconds left.

50
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,240
Darn it.

51
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,069
3, 2, 1.

52
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:16,710
- Go.
- I'm Reporter Jo Il Kwon.

53
00:02:17,509 --> 00:02:19,310
In order to make the people
become more aware...

54
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,949
- of fire safety...
- This is driving me crazy.

55
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:23,750
The fire authorities decided
to carry out an inspection.

56
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:27,349
They are planning to inspect
16 different public areas...

57
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:29,349
such as airports, department stores,

58
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:32,289
and accommodations regarding
the current state of fire safety.

59
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,389
It includes a fire exit...

60
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:38,159
- Why is this so long?
- And obstacles...

61
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:42,270
Those are the criteria.

62
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,370
Reporter Choi Yul
will tell you the details.

63
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,539
This inspection will be carried out
all throughout the country.

64
00:02:46,539 --> 00:02:48,639
He probably remembered it, right?

65
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:50,009
He must have.

66
00:02:52,009 --> 00:02:53,580
The teleprompter is off.

67
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,479
Do you think we don't know that?

68
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:57,680
Go find someone who can fix it!

69
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,719
Yes, sir.

70
00:03:00,849 --> 00:03:03,659
Anchor Lee, the teleprompter
is having issues.

71
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:04,789
I know.

72
00:03:04,789 --> 00:03:06,590
We don't know when it'll get fixed.

73
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,030
How much of the script
have you memorized?

74
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,759
Can you continue
without the teleprompter?

75
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,659
I'll try.

76
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:13,500
Gosh.

77
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:16,569
Don't cause a scene by saying
unnecessary things.

78
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:19,370
Check your script
while the VTR is running.

79
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,270
If you're afraid of stuttering,
just read the script.

80
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,439
That's better.

81
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,080
Darn it.

82
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:28,550
Where's the management team?

83
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,250
I think it'll be fine.

84
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,719
Seeing how he's acting,
he looks confident.

85
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:34,919
You know how good his memory is.

86
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:36,090
We all know that.

87
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,120
When interviewing his guests,

88
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,759
he never really reads the script.

89
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:42,289
That's because he memorized it
the day before.

90
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:44,099
This is different.

91
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,199
Being too proud will ruin you.

92
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:47,199
But the issue here is that...

93
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:49,930
if he's ruined,
I'll be ruined as well.

94
00:03:50,469 --> 00:03:52,539
Where are they?

95
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:54,240
- I'm sorry for being late.
- He's here.

96
00:03:55,509 --> 00:03:57,139
Can you fix it in 10 seconds?

97
00:03:57,139 --> 00:03:58,810
No, it'll take another 10 minutes.

98
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,650
Darn it.

99
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,580
The law of time is fixed.

100
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,689
Time only moves forward,
and you can never rewind it.

101
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:20,769
But there is one way
to go back in time.

102
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,269
It's through your memory.

103
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:29,209
(To You Who Remembers)

104
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:18,459
It's the last sentence.
Anchor Lee, check your script.

105
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,459
Five seconds.

106
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,829
3, 2, 1.

107
00:05:28,069 --> 00:05:29,100
Go.

108
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:32,269
In the past, phone scams
were simple...

109
00:05:32,269 --> 00:05:34,040
and targeted only the elderly...

110
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,639
while the fraudsters disguised
themselves...

111
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:37,180
as prosecutors or the police.

112
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,180
However, those fraudsters
have become more clever.

113
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:42,949
Recently, they stole other people's
photos from their social media...

114
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:46,949
and asked for money
while pretending to be them.

115
00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:48,819
There have been many victims.

116
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:51,089
In order to avoid getting suspected,

117
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:53,759
they usually asked
for 1,000 dollars or less.

118
00:05:54,459 --> 00:05:56,529
- Certificates are needed...
- Unfortunately,

119
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,300
I remember one too many things.

120
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,670
(Find Me in Your Memory)

121
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:14,009
Hello.

122
00:06:14,649 --> 00:06:17,079
My name is Lee Jeong Hoon.

123
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,220
Like this?

124
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,220
Yes.

125
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:25,959
This time, tell me
about an old memory of yours.

126
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:29,889
What's the oldest memory
that you have?

127
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,629
What's the oldest thing
you remember?

128
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,870
A firetruck toy. It was red.

129
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,939
(I fell off a carousel
and badly hurt myself.)

130
00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:26,680
- It fell on my head.
- Mommy!

131
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,550
It really hurt.

132
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,790
- Oh, dear. Jeong Hoon.
- Mommy.

133
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,930
- Mommy.
- I'm here.

134
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,860
I was crying.

135
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,230
And then, my mom came running
and hugged me.

136
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:42,199
I'm here. It's okay. Good boy.

137
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:44,000
What a good boy.

138
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,439
She always smelled good.

139
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,009
How old were you?

140
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:50,680
I was very little.

141
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:53,680
I asked my mom about it,

142
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:55,949
and she said I could barely talk
back then.

143
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,579
Don't lie.

144
00:07:57,579 --> 00:07:58,920
I'm not!

145
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,220
Yoo Tae Eun.

146
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,689
You promised to stay quiet
while I asked him questions.

147
00:08:04,689 --> 00:08:08,490
We all forget things that happened
when we were that little.

148
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:11,129
He may not actually remember them.

149
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,259
Someone may have told him
about it,

150
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,269
and he could be mistaking it
as his own memory.

151
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,370
You're wrong.

152
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,670
My mom had never told me
about that story...

153
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,639
until I asked her.

154
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:22,209
I see.

155
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,139
Then do you remember everything...

156
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:28,410
since you were a baby?

157
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,050
No.

158
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:36,120
I only remember bits
from when I was that little.

159
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:41,259
Then since when did you start
remembering every little thing?

160
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:45,059
Since February 11 of 1990.

161
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:48,070
I was six back then.

162
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,840
Can you tell me about that day?

163
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,870
February 11.

164
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,639
It was a Sunday.

165
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:57,509
I woke up,
and my mom wasn't next to me.

166
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,450
We had slept in the same bed.

167
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,250
I went to the living room,
and she was making some toasts.

168
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,889
She drew a shape with ketchup.

169
00:09:09,889 --> 00:09:12,019
It was a mess.

170
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,929
What else do you remember?

171
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:18,529
By any chance, do you remember
anything you've read or seen...

172
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:20,870
in the newspaper or on TV?

173
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,370
Yes. The morning newspaper said...

174
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:26,000
that Nelson Mandela
would be discharged.

175
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,840
"Mandela..."

176
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:31,210
"From South Africa..."

177
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:32,809
"Is Discharged".

178
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:36,480
"President Frederik Willem de Klerk
had an urgent press conference."

179
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,250
"He said Mandela
would be discharged..."

180
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:43,450
"from Victor Verster Prison
near Cape Town..."

181
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,320
"on the 11th at 3 p.m.,
which is 10 p.m. KST."

182
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,960
My mom said...

183
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,929
that I was lucky...

184
00:09:55,169 --> 00:09:57,000
because I could cherish...

185
00:09:57,539 --> 00:10:01,710
all the happy and precious memories.

186
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,480
But...

187
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,110
I think she's wrong.

188
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,250
I don't only remember
the good things.

189
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,750
- Good job.
- Good job.

190
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,190
Good job.

191
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,389
Good job.

192
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,629
Why do you look so gloomy?

193
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,570
I'm the one who had to suffer
thanks to the broken teleprompter.

194
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,370
You were amazing today.

195
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,669
You're the best. I admire you.

196
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,870
Are you teasing me?

197
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,269
Of course, not. I'm not crazy.

198
00:10:36,809 --> 00:10:38,679
- It's not that.
- Then, what is it?

199
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,549
Did Chairman Oh Taek Won say no
to this week's interview?

200
00:10:42,049 --> 00:10:44,149
- How did you know that?
- It's obvious.

201
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:46,179
There was a fire
at his department store.

202
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,750
I doubt that he wants to brag about
the award he won on the news.

203
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,350
Exactly.

204
00:10:50,419 --> 00:10:51,559
Why does it have to be now?

205
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:53,620
What should we do now?

206
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,029
He's just playing hard-to-get
to demand a few conditions.

207
00:10:56,029 --> 00:10:57,899
It's probably not mentioning
the fire at his department store.

208
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:00,529
I see. Then, what should we do?

209
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:05,500
We'll say we'll comply
and convince him.

210
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,070
Get it confirmed by tomorrow morning
no matter what.

211
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,340
And release an article
for his appearance on our program.

212
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,610
But you will talk
about the fire, won't you?

213
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:15,980
No, I won't.

214
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,620
- Really?
- Yes.

215
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,620
Come on. I know that's a lie.

216
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,750
What if he really sues you for that?

217
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,450
You're a reporter,
but you never keep your word.

218
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:26,190
This is next week's guest.

219
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:27,629
(Guests for the 1st Half of 2020)

220
00:11:27,629 --> 00:11:29,230
(Yeo Ha Jin, "My First Love")

221
00:11:29,429 --> 00:11:31,129
Next week's guest is Yeo Ha Jin?

222
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:33,629
Yes. You know who she is, right?

223
00:11:34,129 --> 00:11:37,330
Why is she trying to promote
her movie on the news?

224
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,370
Do you think I can ask
to get the guest changed?

225
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,870
Of course, not.
It's coming from the director.

226
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:44,039
We'll keep the interview simple
at least once a month.

227
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:46,909
But why do you look so happy
when you're talking about that?

228
00:11:46,909 --> 00:11:48,279
You seem to be in a good mood.

229
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:49,950
No, I'm not. How could I be?

230
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,580
Wrap up the confirmation from
Chairman Oh by tomorrow morning.

231
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:55,620
And come to Hwarang
Department Store by noon.

232
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,950
Let's check the scene a bit more.

233
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:59,590
Are you serious?
So you are going to bring that up!

234
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,269
Gosh.

235
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,440
Hey, you're back.

236
00:12:17,809 --> 00:12:19,610
This isn't a house. It's a pigsty.

237
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,149
Hey, keep some food at home.

238
00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:22,850
I bought everything here.

239
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,250
Clean up when you eat.

240
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,279
Fine. I got it. I'll clean up.

241
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,649
Don't make it sound like
I don't clean.

242
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:29,820
You have a house.

243
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,820
Why do you always hang out
at my place?

244
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,659
It takes five minutes to get
to your place from the hospital.

245
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:36,029
Why do you come to my place
when it takes 30 minutes?

246
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:37,159
Isn't that odd?

247
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:40,230
Hey, I came because
I really needed to talk to you.

248
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:42,129
- About what?
- You.

249
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,100
You had an appointment,
but you didn't show up.

250
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,639
I'll sleep over here tonight and
take you to the hospital tomorrow.

251
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,809
Was my appointment today?

252
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:50,340
I forgot.

253
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,779
You forgot?

254
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:55,450
My gosh, that's the funniest thing
I ever heard come out of your mouth.

255
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:58,379
The mighty Lee Jeong Hoon
forgot an appointment?

256
00:12:58,379 --> 00:12:59,580
It's cracking me up.

257
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,519
I never said yes to the appointment
to begin with.

258
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:05,259
The doctor set it up without
getting the patient's consent.

259
00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:06,919
When my father was your doctor,

260
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,960
you always got your checkup
every year.

261
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,460
But I'm your doctor now.
Are you favoring certain doctors?

262
00:13:11,629 --> 00:13:13,330
To be honest, it's bound to happen.

263
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,429
Professor Yoo is
a renowned neurologist...

264
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:16,500
and teaches at a university.

265
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,570
But you just...

266
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:20,200
run a small private practice
in your neighborhood.

267
00:13:20,669 --> 00:13:23,539
In that neighborhood,
my practice is the biggest one...

268
00:13:23,539 --> 00:13:24,940
when it comes to neuropsychiatry.

269
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,139
Forget it. I'm not going.

270
00:13:26,409 --> 00:13:27,649
Listen to your doctor.

271
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:29,580
I'll drag you there
even if I have to.

272
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,350
- Just get ready to...
- It's probably the same anyway.

273
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,120
My memory doesn't change.

274
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,620
And it will stay the same forever.

275
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,960
I don't want to undergo tests
to confirm that it hasn't changed.

276
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,789
We did it for 25 years.
Haven't we done enough?

277
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,600
Have we been doing this
for 25 years already?

278
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,830
We're old.

279
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:53,240
That's awful.

280
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,169
Right. Do you know Yeo Ha Jin?

281
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:58,779
The actress?

282
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,509
Doesn't everyone know who she is?

283
00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:02,049
I was wondering if you knew her
on a personal level.

284
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,019
My next week's guest is Yeo Ha Jin.

285
00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:07,279
People talked about her social media
a lot, so I checked it out.

286
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,750
And I saw she follows you
on social media.

287
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,490
I see. Really?

288
00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:14,429
I didn't know.
I have a lot of followers.

289
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:15,830
I'm quite popular.

290
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,490
Gosh. You're so annoying.

291
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,399
Clean up the place
before I kick you out.

292

00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,279
- Yes, there was.
- With whom?

325
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:21,120
Are you seriously asking me that?
Who do you think?

326
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:24,419
Yeo Min. No, is it Gwang Jin?

327
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:26,320
- So you know.
- I got it right.

328
00:16:26,659 --> 00:16:28,289
So it was with Gwang Jin.

329
00:16:28,289 --> 00:16:29,330
But that's not true.

330
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,230
The scandal is both
with Joo Yeo Min and Seo Gwang Jin.

331
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:33,899
What?

332
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:39,370
("Yeo Ha Jin Becomes the Talk of
the Town for Two-timing Two Men")

333
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:41,000
("Sad News for Seo Gwang Jin
and Joo Yeo Min")

334
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:43,340
"Two-timing"?

335
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,960
You didn't have breakfast.
Can you drink coffee?

336
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,360
Sure. It's fine.

337
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,629
You don't have much time.
You have a practice.

338
00:17:03,629 --> 00:17:06,460
But still. I came all the way here.
We have to get a meal together.

339
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:09,700
I found a really good sashimi place
when I came here for a shoot.

340
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,500
I'll tell my manager
that I'll be late.

341
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,200
Don't do that.

342
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,609
Today isn't the only day.

343
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:18,680
Okay. Let's go for a drive today.

344
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,839
Once you go on a break,
promise me to go there with me.

345
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,109
- You got it.
- Okay.

346
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:23,480
Here we go.

347
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:30,519
It feels great to be out.
It's been so long.

348
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:32,289
I know, right? It's been too long.

349
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:34,529
Gosh, we have been so busy.

350
00:17:35,259 --> 00:17:37,490
- You know the restaurant?
- Yes.

351
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,900
We really have to go there
sometimes. I'm serious.

352
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,059
- The sashimi place?
- Yes.

353
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:42,230
What a shame.

354
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:44,170
- The ambiance is nice too.
- We should go there next time.

355
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,799
I told you to get me iced Americano.
Why did you get me hot coffee?

356
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,470
We just grabbed coffee together.
That can't be a love scandal.

357
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,339
Grabbing coffee wasn't the problem.

358
00:17:51,339 --> 00:17:54,039
The problem is that you went
all the way to Gangneung...

359
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:55,079
to have that coffee.

360
00:17:56,049 --> 00:17:58,019
I left you alone for one day
to hang out with my friend.

361
00:17:58,019 --> 00:17:59,619
It didn't take that long
for you to cause trouble.

362
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:01,950
After driving along the coast,
I came back home right away.

363
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,819
I didn't even get off the car.

364
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,759
If they were going
to get our photos,

365
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:08,160
we should've had sashimi.

366
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,859
Sashimi, my foot.

367
00:18:10,029 --> 00:18:11,660
My face looks
really big here, right?

368
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,000
Only Yeo Min looks good
in the photo.

369
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,730
So when you came back home
after the drive,

370
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:17,269
did you meet up with Gwang Jin?

371
00:18:17,269 --> 00:18:20,470
Yes. Gwang Jin and I had set it up
to meet a week ago.

372
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:22,109
I hung out with Yeo Min
on the spur of the moment.

373
00:18:22,109 --> 00:18:25,079
I see. And you stayed with Gwang Jin
at his house?

374
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:26,809
Why would I go to Gwang Jin's house?

375
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:28,279
We just had dinner
and parted our ways.

376
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:31,180
Then, why did you get photographed
at Gwang Jin's parking lot?

377
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,390
There's a spot!

378
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:37,450
I parked my car there.

379
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:40,460
That's my point.
Why did you park your car there?

380
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,460
You know I'm bad at parking.

381
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:44,700
My gosh.

382
00:18:47,329 --> 00:18:48,599
- Reverse.
- The restaurant has...

383
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:50,170
a small parking lot.

384
00:18:50,269 --> 00:18:52,470
They don't have valet service
because they are packed.

385
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:53,970
I parked it there...

386
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,170
because the restaurant
is in front of his house.

387
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,640
Turn the handle to the left?

388
00:18:58,109 --> 00:18:59,279
I'm done.

389
00:19:09,819 --> 00:19:11,859
My gosh, what took you so long?

390
00:19:12,259 --> 00:19:13,690
You already parked your car.

391
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:14,890
I was...

392
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:18,160
I was going to park it for you.

393
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,730
What's wrong?

394
00:19:23,569 --> 00:19:25,069
Because of the paparazzi?

395
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:27,099
No.

396
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,910
Come here.

397
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,480
Wait.

398
00:19:34,309 --> 00:19:36,279
Just in case.

399
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,950
You don't look warm at all.

400
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:40,950
I'm not cold at all.

401
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:43,250
No, you must be cold.
It's cold outside.

402
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,490
It's cold.

403
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:46,119
- You must be cold.
- It's stuffy.

404
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:47,789
You should put it on.

405
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:49,230
- It's hot. It's stuffy.
- Wait.

406
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,630
No, you look pretty
with the hoodie on.

407
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:53,200
No, my hat is the key point
of my outfit.

408
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,299
Why don't we put on
our hoodie together?

409
00:19:56,299 --> 00:19:58,069
What are you talking about?

410
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:00,799
I won't eat then.

411
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:03,769
What's wrong with him?

412
00:20:04,609 --> 00:20:06,140
Fine.

413
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:09,509
No. Come here. Cover up first.

414
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:13,220
In the photo, Gwang Jin
looks really affectionate.

415
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,190
But he's really timid
when you get to know him.

416
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,589
What do you think about this photo?

417
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:20,259
Don't I exude a nice presence
in this photo?

418
00:20:21,529 --> 00:20:22,690
I'll save it.

419
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:27,230
You know what's going on now, right?

420
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:28,230
I do.

421
00:20:28,329 --> 00:20:30,200
I got 2 love scandals in 1 day.

422
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,440
With two different men.

423
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,640
You do know that.

424
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,400
If you do, how could you
spend your time...

425
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,109
saving photos from the articles?

426
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:38,640
What can I do?
The articles are already out.

427
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:42,549
You must be spiritually enlightened.
You might rise up into the sky.

428
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:45,420
But come on, two-timing is too much.

429
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,690
I'm not dating any of them.
Two-timing, my foot.

430
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,460
Goodness, they never give me
any time to flirt with anyone.

431
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,519
We need some time to learn about
each other while we flirt...

432
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:57,390
before we start dating to keep
the relationship going for long.

433
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,559
Isn't that so, Chul?

434
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,160
Yes, sure. Right.

435
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:03,470
Wow, you're very thoughtful.
Isn't that so, Chul?

436
00:21:03,569 --> 00:21:04,640
You're right.

437
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,500
What are they doing?

438
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,109
What? Who's doing what?

439
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:12,740
My movie must've become a huge hit.

440
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:13,809
Isn't that Yeo Ha Jin's car?

441
00:21:13,809 --> 00:21:15,950
I got a lot of new fangirls.

442
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,980
Your movie hasn't even premiered.

443
00:21:18,049 --> 00:21:20,849
And look at them. Is that
the face of someone who's thrilled?

444
00:21:21,349 --> 00:21:23,190
They're here to fight you.

445
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:32,059
How dare you date my Yeo Min?

446
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:34,529
Someone ugly like you
shouldn't dare to date Yeo Min!

447
00:21:34,529 --> 00:21:36,799
You hit on Gwang Jin first,
didn't you?

448
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,269
You dirty brat!
Who do you think you are?

449
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,740
They were Yeo Min
and Gwang Jin's fans.

450
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,079
Yes, Ms. Park.
Can you send someone out here?

451
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:47,039
We got here, and it's huge chaos.

452
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:53,980
Goodness, what's going on?
This isn't good.

453
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:20,680
(Stop hitting on my Gwang Jin!)

454
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,069
Goodness, my knees.

455
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,539
Gosh, Ms. Park.

456
00:22:49,339 --> 00:22:50,339
Are they gone?

457
00:22:50,339 --> 00:22:54,910
Yes, it was tough to make them go.
Kids these days are scary.

458
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:56,509
Where's Ha Jin?

459
00:22:56,509 --> 00:22:58,920
She went to the restroom
and hasn't come back...

460
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:04,049
Wait, did she go in there
with her phone?

461
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:07,420
She uploaded something already.
This has to be some kind of disease.

462
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,660
She uploaded it again?

463
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:10,730
Darn it.

464
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:20,000
No way! Two-timing?
Wrong, this is far from the truth.

465
00:23:20,569 --> 00:23:23,339
Yeo Min and Gwang Ji are
both great guys,

466
00:23:23,339 --> 00:23:26,440
but I'm not dating any of them.
Please don't misunderstand.

467
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:30,779
(Yeo Ha Jin, Actress)

468
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,819
(You're so pretty.
So pretty, I'll lie down here.)

469
00:23:33,819 --> 00:23:35,390
(Why are you so cool?
And you're so pretty too. Why?)

470
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:39,559
Hashtag love scandal.
Hashtag surprise.

471
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:41,730
Hashtag we're just friends.

472
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,769
Where are you going?

473
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:58,240
Oh, to the waiting room.

474
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,980
Chairman Oh Taek Won arrived.

475
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,009
Are you heading out?

476
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:03,480
What are you going to do?

477
00:24:04,349 --> 00:24:05,920
Are you going to bring up...

478
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,680
the fire at Hwarang Department Store
during your interview with him?

479
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,690
Yes.

480
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:11,289
Hey, stop laughing.

481
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:15,190
My gosh. You make it impossible
for me to die my natural death.

482
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:16,960
Come here.

483
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,329
This morning,

484
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,829
Chairman Oh had breakfast
with our president...

485
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:26,569
- to make sure it's not mentioned.
- I see.

486
00:24:26,569 --> 00:24:28,000
What are you going to do now?

487
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:34,339
If you tell me not to do it,
then I won't.

488
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:38,720
My gosh, you.
You little... Goodness.

489
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:41,049
I can't believe you.

490
00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:44,420
Since when were you so obedient?

491
00:24:49,089 --> 00:24:51,259
- Hello, Mr. Hwang.
- Hello.

492
00:24:51,259 --> 00:24:52,599
Wait, one second.

493
00:24:53,329 --> 00:24:55,400
You should probably
talk to him in a little bit.

494
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,569
He's getting ready right now.

495
00:24:57,569 --> 00:24:58,569
Is that so?

496
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,369
Then I'll wait.

497
00:25:01,369 --> 00:25:02,410
Okay.

498
00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:20,990
It seems like...

499
00:25:21,789 --> 00:25:23,630
you change your glasses often.

500
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,160
I'm rather clumsy,

501
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,670
so I keep breaking them.

502
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:40,680
Did you also hurt your face
when you fell down?

503
00:25:52,289 --> 00:25:54,119
First off, congratulations.

504
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:00,259
This award is very prestigious
that it's called the Oscars...

505
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:02,470
- of the business world.
- Camera one, zoom in a bit more.

506
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:05,839
You won the biggest honor,
the Businessman of the Year Award.

507
00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:07,740
How do you feel?

508
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:11,470
I feel more burdened than happy.

509
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:15,279
I accepted it as a way
of telling me to do even better.

510
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:19,480
What kind of spirit do you think
a businessman should have?

511
00:26:19,549 --> 00:26:20,579
Let's see.

512
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:23,890
This may seem like a cliche,

513
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:27,119
but I believe
it's all about trust and honesty.

514
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:28,289
What about you?

515
00:26:29,289 --> 00:26:31,160
Have you been keeping that spirit?

516
00:26:31,859 --> 00:26:33,730
I always do my best to do so,

517
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:36,130
and I don't think
I deviated too far from that.

518
00:26:36,269 --> 00:26:37,599
I see.

519
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,200
You had great news,

520
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,839
but recently, there also was
an unfortunate accident.

521
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:47,279
Yes, a fire broke out
from our department store.

522
00:26:47,509 --> 00:26:50,150
The fire was caused by the flame...

523
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,480
during the welding process.

524
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,250
Our team found a few problems...

525
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:55,220
after investigating the incident.

526
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,420
I'm aware of that.

527
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:00,920
You are?

528
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,529
After the fire, we conducted
an internal investigation...

529
00:27:03,529 --> 00:27:05,829
to prevent the reoccurrence
of such accidents,

530
00:27:05,859 --> 00:27:07,500
and there were
quite a number of problems.

531
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:11,700
This is a shame for me,
but I'd like to share the truth...

532
00:27:12,269 --> 00:27:15,640
to apologize to our customers
and our people...

533
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:17,269
- with this chance.
- Bad news.

534
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:19,579
Anchor Lee loves to expose
and accuse people's faults,

535
00:27:19,579 --> 00:27:22,650
but he's sitting there
like a fish out of water.

536
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,880
On top of that,
when the fire broke out,

537
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,319
- the sprinkler system didn't work.
- What?

538
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:32,119
I finally realized it could have
led to a bigger disaster.

539
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:36,160
We promise to conduct
timely inspection and education...

540
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:39,630
to make sure something like this
does not happen again.

541
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:44,099
Once again, I sincerely apologize
for what had happened.

542
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,869
What a relief.

543
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:53,109
This is a relief in two ways.

544
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,140
One,

545
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:57,750
we feel reassured to make a visit
to Hwarang Department Store.

546
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,079
And the other reason is...

547
00:27:59,579 --> 00:28:02,720
that you answered my question
much faster than I thought,

548
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,349
so we now have enough time.

549
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:07,359
- I always go over my limit...
- What? Isn't he done?

550
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:09,430
during these interviews,
so the control room hates me a lot.

551
00:28:09,529 --> 00:28:12,559
But I can ask you more questions
without a burden on my heart.

552
00:28:13,329 --> 00:28:16,099
It took me such a long time
to ask you this...

553
00:28:16,099 --> 00:28:17,829
in this studio.

554
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:20,700
It's thanks to the fact that
you came out here for an interview,

555
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,839
but above all,
this was made possible...

556
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:25,710
thanks to someone
who mustered up the courage.

557
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,750
Chairman Oh Taek Won,
for the last three years,

558
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,920
you abused your personal assistant,
Mr. Hwang Seo Hoon,

559
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:36,450
both verbally and physically.
Do you admit to what you did?

560
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:38,519
What is this...

561
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:43,660
I have no idea
what you are talking about.

562
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,859
What is he saying?

563
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:48,970
There's zero value
in answering that question.

564
00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:52,839
August 12, 2017.

565
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:55,309
A dent in the face
and fractured ribs.

566
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:57,710
February 3, 2018.

567
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:00,279
Fractured knee bones
and ruptured eardrums.

568
00:29:00,609 --> 00:29:02,650
May 25, 2018.

569
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,079
- Bruises all over the body...
- What's with him?

570
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:05,349
and ruptured eardrums.

571
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,950
January 13, 2019.

572
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:10,349
Fractured ribs and teeth damage.

573
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:12,920
September 23, 2019.

574
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:16,630
Fractured cheekbones
and damaged eyeballs.

575
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:22,869
These are the medical records
of your assistant, Mr. Hwang.

576
00:29:24,069 --> 00:29:25,500
Do you not recall?

577
00:29:26,369 --> 00:29:30,670
I'm telling you.
What does that have to do with me?

578
00:29:31,609 --> 00:29:34,740
You seem quite rude
to the interviewee you invited.

579
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:39,180
I once visited you three years ago
to cover a story.

580
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:42,289
Oh, but you won't remember.
I didn't get to meet you in person.

581
00:29:42,819 --> 00:29:44,390
Back then,

582
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:47,619
you said this to
Mr. Hwang, your assistant.

583
00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:53,329
"You're worse than pests.
Are you deaf or something?"

584
00:30:03,609 --> 00:30:06,940
You're worse than pests.
Are you deaf or something?

585
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:09,809
- I said, don't step on the brakes.
- I'm sorry.

586
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:13,380
I told you not to step on it
until we get here, you idiot.

587
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:18,890
I'm sorry.

588
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:21,420
You'll get a hold of yourself
after a good beating.

589
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:23,789
Won't you? Won't you?

590
00:30:23,829 --> 00:30:26,130
You idiot. Get up.

591
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:28,200
I'm sorry, sir.

592
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:30,130
Stop touching me.

593
00:30:30,269 --> 00:30:32,140
You crazy idiot.

594
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,480
Do you still not recall?

595
00:30:43,849 --> 00:30:46,349
Darn it. He was trying to
expose that from the beginning?

596
00:30:46,349 --> 00:30:48,890
- I remember like it was yesterday.
- My gosh, that kid.

597
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:51,390
But if you can't seem to remember,

598
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:53,559
I guess you have a bad memory.

599
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:56,259
There are more witnesses
other than me,

600
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,890
these hospital records,

601
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,559
and even the dashcam footage.

602
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:01,730
I already have enough evidence.

603
00:31:02,029 --> 00:31:03,470
You mentioned before that...

604
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,069
you adhere to trust and honesty.

605
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,700
Your trust is already broken,

606
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,609
but I can give you a chance
to keep your honesty.

607
00:31:11,109 --> 00:31:14,539
Let me word it differently
and ask you once again.

608
00:31:15,109 --> 00:31:17,880
Chairman Oh Taek Won,
for the last three years,

609
00:31:18,049 --> 00:31:20,380
you abused your personal assistant,
Hwang Seo Hoon,

610
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,920
both verbally and physically.

611
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:25,490
Do you deny it?

612
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:34,500
What's wrong with him?

613
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:36,869
I'm sorry.

614
00:31:37,299 --> 00:31:39,039
I'll patch this up.

615
00:31:41,069 --> 00:31:43,009
I think I'll become
Lee Jeong Hoon's fan.

616
00:31:43,009 --> 00:31:44,069
That's amazing.

617
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:46,380
- This is going to be huge.
- Seriously.

618
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,910
- He's nothing to Lee Jeong Hoon.
- That's Lee Jeong Hoon.

619
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:50,450
I knew that chairman
would do something like that.

620
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,910
- He got him.
- I knew it.

621
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,319
Hey, stop right there and cut it.

622
00:31:56,819 --> 00:31:58,690
Cut it off. Assistant Director?

623
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,990
Cut it off already, you idiot!

624
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:01,990
Cut it off!

625
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:05,460
Goodness.

626
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,460
We ran out of time,

627
00:32:07,829 --> 00:32:10,599
so we'll need to
hear your answer next time.

628
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,839
Thank you for coming out today.

629
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:19,740
That was Chairman Oh Taek Won
of Hwarang.

630
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,309
Play the ending credit.

631
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:44,569
Anchor, standby for the closing.

632
00:32:46,539 --> 00:32:49,769
In 3, 2, 1.

633
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:51,769
Go.

634
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,640
I am sure...

635
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,410
many of you are flustered
with the unexpected situation.

636
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:59,480
Everything that was exposed
through this interview...

637
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,650
will be dealt with
in follow-up coverage...

638
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:03,519
as soon as possible.

639
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:07,359
That's all for
"Lee Jeong Hoon's News Live".

640
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:09,190
