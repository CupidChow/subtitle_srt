1
00:00:01,669 --> 00:00:04,139
(Episode 9)

2
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:43,649
How did you know I was here?

3
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,149
What's wrong?

4
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,460
Is something going on?

5
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:52,990
It's all right now.

6
00:00:53,659 --> 00:00:54,859
It's all right.

7
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:01,170
What?

8
00:01:03,469 --> 00:01:04,469
Who are you?

9
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:05,870
Who do you think you are
to suddenly run in...

10
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,269
and why are you hugging her
out of nowhere?

11
00:01:07,269 --> 00:01:09,109
Then who are you?

12
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:11,280
It's Anchor Lee.

13
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:12,879
It is him.

14
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:15,010
He's her boyfriend.

15
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:17,480
"Boyfriend"? Is that true?

16
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:19,650
Yes. I'm her boyfriend.

17
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,650
So what were you doing with her?

18
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:27,359
It's a misunderstanding.
I made a mistake.

19
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:29,890
There was an accident.

20
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,430
"An accident"?

21
00:01:34,629 --> 00:01:37,269
I was distracted
for a split second...

22
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,269
and crashed into their car.

23
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:43,409
- Gosh.
- Get out.

24
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:46,209
- Gosh.
- It's a brand new car.

25
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:48,579
Are you okay? Oh, no.

26
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,950
I'm sorry. I am.

27
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,549
This is totally my fault.

28
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:56,219
I'll compensate for everything
as you wish.

29
00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:57,219
Hold on.

30
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,519
Are you...

31
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:02,459
Yeo Ha Jin? You are, right?

32
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:03,459
No way.

33
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:07,599
We... We were just on our way
back home after watching your movie.

34
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:12,240
Really? Yes, it's me.

35
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,539
I can't believe this!

36
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:19,009
- Could we take a photo?
- Can I shake your hand?

37
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:21,080
- Sure.
- Thank you.

38
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,650
Let's take a photo too.

39
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:23,949
Let's go somewhere
that's not too dark.

40
00:02:23,949 --> 00:02:26,050
- Sure.
- Let's go.

41
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,819
(Anchor Lee)

42
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,159
You called me a lot.

43
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,500
You must've been worried sick.

44
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,340
Don't misunderstand.

45
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,840
Anyone would've gotten worried
in this situation.

46
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,110
It's late.

47
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,039
You went to the movies alone,
and I couldn't reach you.

48
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:54,550
I see.

49
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,280
Is that why
you called Ha Kyung incessantly...

50
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,979
and went all the way
to the movie theater?

51
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:03,560
Okay, I won't misunderstand this.

52
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:09,789
From now on,
don't go anywhere alone.

53
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:13,530
And be wary of people.

54
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:15,530
"People"?

55
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,310
They're good people.

56
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,039
They were kind to me.

57
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:24,340
Just because people are
kind to you...

58
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,310
that doesn't mean
they're good people.

59
00:03:27,979 --> 00:03:29,780
Don't trust people so easily.

60
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:32,979
Okay, I'll be careful.

61
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:38,590
You're not a teenage runaway.

62
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,889
Why would you go out
so late at night and cause trouble?

63
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:42,759
I'm sorry. I knew you'd take
at least three hours...

64
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:44,000
to come home from the gym.

65
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,199
I was going to watch a movie
and go home.

66
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:47,370
I didn't know this would happen.

67
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:50,469
It's getting late. Get home safely.
Goodbye.

68
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,770
Already?

69
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,169
Then what? Are you going
to work out together or something?

70
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:56,270
Let's go.

71
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,610
Go home safely.

72
00:03:58,610 --> 00:03:59,610
You too.

73
00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:02,409
I'll text you when I arrive home.

74
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,650
I don't want you to worry again.

75
00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:07,550
Okay, please do that.

76
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:10,219
What?

77
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,689
Goodbye.

78
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,670
What are you looking at?

79
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:31,209
I'm waiting to see if any photos
are getting posted.

80
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:34,009
Those men promised me...

81
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:36,009
not to tell anyone
about the accident.

82
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:37,019
Don't worry about that.

83
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:38,649
I'm not talking about those photos.

84
00:04:38,649 --> 00:04:39,920
Then what?

85
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:41,620
Photos of Anchor Lee and me.

86
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,699
It would've been nice
if there were photos.

87
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:58,540
I'd like to look at them
whenever I wish.

88
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,509
There weren't many people.

89
00:05:00,769 --> 00:05:01,870
It's a shame.

90
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,709
You should be relieved.

91
00:05:03,709 --> 00:05:04,709
Had more people been there,

92
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:06,209
we wouldn't have been able
to keep this on the low.

93
00:05:06,379 --> 00:05:08,009
I don't even want to imagine it.

94
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,319
Do you know what he said
to those men?

95
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:13,850
What?

96
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,689
He said he was my boyfriend.

97
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:17,990
What?

98
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:20,990
He said that himself.

99
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:23,430
What's going on?

100
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,930
What do you think? It's a romance.

101
00:05:26,029 --> 00:05:28,199
After all, he ran over there
because he was worried about me.

102
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,899
You're right.
He seemed pretty worried.

103
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:33,470
He made it seem like
something happened to you.

104
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,939
Yes. This is romance, indeed.

105
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:40,550
Are there seriously no photos of us?

106
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:48,189
It's Jeong Hoon.

107
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,019
I need to talk to you
regarding Ha Jin.

108
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,519
Please call me
when she's not around.

109
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:05,199
What are these photos?

110
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,089
Jeong Hoon speaking.

111
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,019
These photos were sent to you?

112
00:06:24,089 --> 00:06:26,819
Yes. I had received them
a while ago,

113
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,259
but I only opened them today.

114
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:31,129
I didn't check
every single one of them,

115
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:34,199
but I don't think these photos
were from articles or online.

116
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:38,670
Are you saying they took them
while stalking her?

117
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:41,839
Don't take it too seriously
just yet.

118
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:45,040
Like you said, she's a celebrity.

119
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,079
A fan of her could just
be obsessed over her.

120
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:48,550
It's highly likely.

121
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,379
But nevertheless,

122
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,680
I thought you should know
about this.

123
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:56,050
It's better safe than sorry.

124
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,560
I'll keep this a secret from her.
I don't want her to feel anxious.

125
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:02,730
If you notice anyone suspicious
around you...

126
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:05,459
or receive strange mail,
let me know right away.

127
00:07:06,329 --> 00:07:09,129
I will. Let me know as well.

128
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:10,370
All right.

129
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:38,829
My goodness!

130
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,769
Who are you?

131
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:44,439
Who do you think?
They're security guards.

132
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:45,899
"Security guards"?

133
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:48,639
My security guards?

134
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,839
We're late. Let's go.

135
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:50,910
This way.

136
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,350
Why do I have security guards
all of a sudden?

137
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,910
What's going on? Tell me.

138
00:07:57,449 --> 00:07:59,649
Hey, your older sister
is asking you a question.

139
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,149
I'm going to get mad.

140
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,089
Tell me.

141
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:06,959
- Put on your seatbelt.
- We're departing.

142
00:08:12,329 --> 00:08:14,730
All those men will be escorting me?

143
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,670
Stop asking.

144
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,439
Why would they?

145
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:19,740
I've been fine alone all this time.

146
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,269
Things have changed now.

147
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:23,439
You're no longer the old you.

148
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:25,279
Plus, all the other celebrities
have security guards.

149
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,680
We were the exception.

150
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,750
Right, Chul?

151
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:31,250
She's right.
Your fan base grew significantly.

152
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:33,049
We can't manage them
on our own anymore.

153
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,289
I don't think it's that much.

154
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,549
Did you look into it?

155
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,710
I visited the post office.

156
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,220
But I got nothing.

157
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,590
The post office requires you
to write down your information...

158
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:10,090
in case the mail gets sent back.

159
00:09:10,289 --> 00:09:12,690
They said this mail was put
in a mailbox.

160
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,730
We can't identify them through this.

161
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,399
And this type of envelope
can be seen everywhere.

162
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:21,570
Did I receive any more mail?

163
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:24,470
No. You did receive more,

164
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,899
but none of them look suspicious.

165
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,539
Okay, I'm heading back right now.

166
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,340
("Romantic Nurse, Director Choi")

167
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,110
These scripts are all for me?

168
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,750
These were handpicked.

169
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,549
We had twice as much.

170
00:09:37,549 --> 00:09:39,250
We rejected any with you
as a supporting actress.

171
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,789
You? Supporting actress?
That's absurd.

172
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,149
You're the lead actress
in all of those.

173
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:44,490
We took out any that centered
around the lead actor...

174
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,789
and only picked the ones
with you in the center.

175
00:09:46,789 --> 00:09:48,559
What if the drama is a flop?

176
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:51,129
Can I just be a supporting actress?

177
00:09:51,129 --> 00:09:52,799
It won't be a flop.

178
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:54,570
You need to be in the limelight.

179
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:57,100
Your schedule will be
less hectic for the time being,

180
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,370
so focus on picking out
your next work, okay?

181
00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:02,669
Then do I only have
the signing event for tomorrow?

182
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:06,279
That was canceled.

183
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:07,809
Why all of a sudden?

184
00:10:07,809 --> 00:10:10,350
We had issues with the venue.

185
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,750
That's disappointing.
I love signing.

186
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,750
That's ridiculous. It's just tiring.

187
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,919
This is actually better for you.

188
00:10:19,659 --> 00:10:20,830
Hello?

189
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:25,460
Not at all.
We're not looking down on you.

190
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,470
Ha Jin isn't the type
that becomes pompous...

191
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,399
just because of fame.

192
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,600
There was another reason.

193
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,570
Let me take this outside.

194
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:36,340
Hello?

195
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:38,139
Yes.

196
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,279
- What was that?
- What do you mean?

197
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:42,950
We canceled the signing event,
didn't we?

198
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:45,679
The whole security guard thing
is fishy too.

199
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,279
What is it? What's going on?

200
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,389
Nothing. It's true that
the signing event got canceled.

201
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,519
Don't lie to me.

202
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:55,230
I'm not. Why can't you believe me?

203
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,929
I really hate it...

204
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:03,100
when I'm the only one in the dark.

205
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,240
Tell me what's going on now.

206
00:11:12,809 --> 00:11:15,080
Anchor Lee got a threatening letter.

207
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,279
A threatening letter?

208
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,480
I think
your stalker sent him the letter.

209
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,049
There were some photos.

210
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,350
What about the photos?

211
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,720
Do you have them now? Let me see.

212
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,210
(Yeo Ha Jin)

213
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,080
Hello?

214
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:54,320
You're answering
your phone right away now.

215
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,690
Before, I'd call you several times,
but you wouldn't answer.

216
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:58,519
You must be busy
preparing for the news,

217
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:00,259
so I'll cut to the chase.

218
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,230
Hiring security guards is the best,

219
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:04,529
but I'm sure
you'd never go for that.

220
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:06,429
So be careful
when you go home at night.

221
00:12:06,429 --> 00:12:08,200
And don't go out by yourself.

222
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,870
And make sure you always lock up.

223
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,940
I'll be worried,

224
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,440
so after the news,
when you get home,

225
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,809
please leave me a text. Okay?

226
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,240
Did Ha Kyung tell you?

227
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:22,350
She told me about the stalker
and I saw the photos too.

228
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,480
But when I thought about it,

229
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:28,789
you're in bigger danger than I am.

230
00:12:29,389 --> 00:12:30,960
The stalker
who sent you the photos...

231
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,990
is angry at you, not me.

232
00:12:35,059 --> 00:12:37,259
He cut your face in the photos.

233
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:39,429
And he sent the photos to you.

234
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,899
I doubt that's the case.

235
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:45,600
The stalker wants you
and is obsessed with you.

236
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:51,379
Now that you say it like that,
it does bother me a bit.

237
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,809
Okay. I'll be careful.

238
00:12:54,809 --> 00:12:56,649
Then, we both should be careful.

239
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,149
I have my own security team.

240
00:12:59,149 --> 00:13:01,750
And I won't be attending events
that could put me in danger for now.

241
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,519
So the signing event was canceled.

242
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,490
In other words,
don't worry about me.

243
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:06,620
I'm glad to hear that.

244
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,230
And...

245
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,129
if something like this
happens again,

246
00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:13,659
tell me that in person
instead of telling Ha Kyung.

247
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:15,470
I'm not a kid.

248
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,169
I'm somewhat professional.

249
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,039
Okay. I'm sorry.

250
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,940
I wasn't fishing for an apology.

251
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,639
Anyway, it starts today.

252
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,509
When you get home, text me.

253
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:29,450
Will do.

254
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,509
I am...

255
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,419
madly in love.

256
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:26,669
(Director Ji Hyun Geun)

257
00:14:34,409 --> 00:14:35,409
Hey.

258
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:39,250
I saw Director Ji Hyun Geun
in the studio earlier.

259
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:40,779
In the studio?

260
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:42,750
My gosh, he must think
he owns this place.

261
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,690
He's been all over the place
with a camera.

262
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:45,990
I wanted to give him...

263
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,429
By the way,
what are you up to these days?

264
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:53,330
I'm not up to anything.

265
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:56,399
Yes, you are. The blue envelope.

266
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,769
- I see.
- I was right. There's something.

267
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:03,710
What's in it? Why is Il Kwon
going around with that envelope?

268
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,779
I'm sure you were the one
who gave him the assignment.

269
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:07,950
What is it?
Did someone give you a tip?

270
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:10,009
Come to my office.

271
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:12,419
Director Ji Hyun Geun
is in my office.

272
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,250
What is it?

273
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,490
I don't know what you mean.
I'll ask Il Kwon about that.

274
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:19,320
Director Choi wants to see me
in her office.

275
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:25,600
Come on.

276
00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:27,669
They always leave me out of that.

277
00:15:27,669 --> 00:15:29,600
Great. Excellent.

278
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,000
Can you smile more broadly?

279
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,100
Okay. Great. That's great.
All right.

280
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,269
All right. Smile!

281
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:39,610
This is excellent. Yes.

282
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:42,110
It's the last one. Smile.

283
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:45,120
Great.

284
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,750
Can you smile more broadly?
A bit more.

285
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,419
- Great. Nice.
- Hey.

286
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:49,789
Anchor Lee, you're here.

287
00:15:49,789 --> 00:15:51,059
Come in. Come on in.

288
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:53,019
Can we stop now?

289
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:54,259
Yes, I got great shots.

290
00:15:54,259 --> 00:15:56,389
These photos look amazing.

291
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:58,100
The director has
such a likable face.

292
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,330
I begged her
to let me take photos of her.

293
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:02,929
I thought taking her photos
would inspire me.

294
00:16:03,169 --> 00:16:04,799
- I see.
- By the way,

295
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:06,440
are you here to get me?

296
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:07,970
Hold on.

297
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,740
Look at the time.

298
00:16:11,409 --> 00:16:14,240
Time flew by when I was
talking to Director Choi.

299
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,980
Right. I think it'd be better
if you start getting ready.

300
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,779
Well, it's a live broadcast.

301
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:20,950
So you'll be more nervous
than you expected.

302
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,090
I think it will be a lot of fun.

303
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,590
I'll get going.

304
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,460
I'll give you the photos
as my present when I develop them.

305
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,860
- I'll see you then.
- Sure.

306
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,899
- Good luck with the interview.
- Okay. Bye.

307
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,740
Hey.

308
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,840
I need to talk to you. It's urgent.

309
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,840
Come here.

310
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,649
Goodness. He's such a weirdo.

311
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:59,059
Are all artists
off-the-wall like him?

312
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:01,330
What were you doing?

313
00:17:02,259 --> 00:17:04,859
I mean, he barged into my office
out of the blue.

314
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:07,430
And he bragged about himself
for 10 minutes.

315
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:09,329
He talked about his inspirations
and such.

316
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:11,000
And he started taking photos.

317
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,970
I thought he'd go away
if I played along.

318
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:15,509
My gosh, but that was endless.
Seriously.

319
00:17:15,509 --> 00:17:16,640
Gosh.

320
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,250
By the way,
are Director Ji and Ha Jin close?

321
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:23,380
- Why do you ask?
- He sounded...

322
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,619
as if he knew something.
He kept sussing me out.

323
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:27,849
You know,
about your fake relationship.

324
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,950
He kept sussing me out,

325
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,720
so I shut it down.

326
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,690
But I don't know what he's thinking.

327
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,160
Hello.

328
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:43,170
What a great studio.

329
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:45,339
You're here.

330
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,410
You have a fine studIo.

331
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,920
Isn't Ha Jin beautiful?

332
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,220
Yes, she is.
She's especially pretty in my eyes.

333
00:18:02,589 --> 00:18:04,460
You must keep a close eye on her.

334
00:18:04,859 --> 00:18:06,490
As passionate as she is,

335
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:08,930
she's not the type to go steady
with just a man.

336
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:11,359
That's why there were
countless love scandals.

337
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:14,099
Not every guy can handle
a girl like her.

338
00:18:18,269 --> 00:18:21,839
That's why I still can't believe it.

339
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:26,039
Are you guys taking
your relationship seriously?

340
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:30,980
I mean, the photos
I saw in the articles...

341
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,849
seemed a bit awkward.

342
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,390
To tell you the truth,
I think you're faking it.

343
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,519
Well, I'm pretty sure I'm wrong.

344
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:43,490
We'll put on the microphones.

345
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:44,599
Okay.

346
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,869
I think it's too early to talk
about my next project.

347
00:18:50,069 --> 00:18:53,440
Just like the title, this film
is like first love to me.

348
00:18:53,539 --> 00:18:55,309
I want to get immersed
in this movie for the time being.

349
00:18:55,309 --> 00:18:59,279
Did you hear him? He kept bugging
you to scout for the next film.

350
00:18:59,579 --> 00:19:01,980
I see. Unfortunately,
we will have to...

351
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,980
patiently wait for your next film.

352
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:06,319
- Text him and say he did well.
- Thank you for coming today.

353
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:07,750
- Thank you.
- Okay.

354
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,819
Should I?

355
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:11,460
- That was Director Ji Hyun Geun.
- Can I send this during the news?

356
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,789
What if I distract him?

357
00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:15,759
No, I meant the director.
Not Anchor Lee.

358
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,859
I see. You want me
to text the director?

359
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:21,059
(Director Ji)

360
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:22,069
(Director Ji Hyun Geun)

361
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:24,539
Director Ji is calling.

362
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:50,289
You're here.

363
00:19:52,029 --> 00:19:53,099
Anchor Lee.

364
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,710
I didn't know you were joining us.

365
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:07,980
Why didn't you tell me?

366
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,509
You said you needed to talk to me.

367
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:11,779
I just assumed that you'd know.

368
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,720
That's odd.

369
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,690
Isn't this when couples can't
wait to be with each other?

370
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:18,960
Couples text and call each other
all the time in the beginning.

371
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:22,730
Anchor Lee, do you drink?

372
00:20:23,029 --> 00:20:24,730
No. I don't.

373
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:27,730
Come on. That's no fun to hang out
with a man who can't drink.

374
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,299
Join us.

375
00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:35,539
Sure.

376
00:20:43,849 --> 00:20:44,849
Cheers.

377
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,329
I drank it on his behalf.
I'm his stand-in.

378
00:20:56,829 --> 00:20:59,500
What was that? That was rude.

379
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,930
He really can't drink.

380
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:03,630
Please be understanding about it.

381
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,200
I'll drink this instead.

382
00:21:08,509 --> 00:21:10,440
You're an awfully boring person.

383
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,940
Yes, I'm like that.

384
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:17,049
What? No way. He's really funny.

385
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:20,019
You'll know if you meet him
a few more times.

386
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,420
Okay. All right.

387
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,119
Excuse me.

388
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:27,990
Excuse me!

389
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,029
Excuse me! Is anybody here?

390
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:37,730
What were you going to do?

391
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:40,569
- Were you really going to drink it?
- We need more drinks!

392
00:21:40,569 --> 00:21:41,609
No.

393
00:21:42,339 --> 00:21:44,539
I wanted to steal your move.

394
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:53,079
This isn't a move
that anyone can make.

395
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,250
It's really humiliating
if anyone catches you doing this.

396
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,180
It seems like he's quite drunk.

397
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:22,180
We should break it up
once he comes back.

398
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,680
Can you keep a watch?

399
00:22:23,849 --> 00:22:25,720
What? Keep a watch?

400
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,980
Let me know right away
if he comes. Hurry.

401
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:33,890
Hurry up. Go.

402
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,599
Why do you ask me to keep a watch?

403
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,529
What are you doing?

404
00:22:51,009 --> 00:22:52,509
Are you going to steal...

405
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:54,380
No, right?

406
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,210
No. What do you think of me?

407
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:57,779
Keep looking out. Hurry.

408
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:16,000
He's coming.

409
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,799
What do we do? Hurry. Hurry up.

410
00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:25,609
He's almost here. He's near.

411
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,910
Hurry up!

412
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,049
I think I might catch his eyes.

413
00:23:29,049 --> 00:23:31,079
Hurry up. He's almost here.

414
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:33,150
- He's almost here.
- What are you doing? Sit down.

415
00:24:02,049 --> 00:24:03,549
They didn't bring the drink yet?

416
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:05,920
Excuse me!

417
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:09,390
You look quite drunk. Let's go home.

418
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,319
Yes, Director Ji.

419
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:18,829
Ha Jin.
I need to talk alone with you.

420
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,700
Director Ji, you're drunk.
Let's talk next time.

421
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,670
No, I have to talk to you now.
Come on, you and I are going out.

422
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,609
Let me go.

423
00:24:28,609 --> 00:24:31,170
Let me go while I'm still nice.

424
00:24:31,339 --> 00:24:32,440
That's enough.

425
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,549
No. Let me go. Let go of me!

426
00:24:35,609 --> 00:24:36,680
Let go!

427
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:51,490
Why is he so drunk?

428
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,730
Anchor Lee, you really didn't have
any alcohol, did you?

429
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:56,029
He didn't.

430
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:58,269
Then please take care of her.

431
00:24:58,269 --> 00:24:59,299
Sure.

432
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:01,640
You know where he lives, right?

433
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,710
You've been there once.

434
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,539
Yes, the address should be
saved on the GPS.

435
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,880
Drive safely.

436
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,910
Okay.

437
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:08,579
Call me when you get there.

438
00:25:20,859 --> 00:25:22,829
Why did you do that before?

439
00:25:22,829 --> 00:25:25,500
You looked through his stuff
and got angry at him.

440
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,430
Do you still meet him often?

441
00:25:29,099 --> 00:25:31,230
We met every day
while we filmed the movie...

442
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,170
and pretty often
while we did the promotion,

443
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:35,640
but not recently.
We had no reason to meet.

444
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,339
Why do you suddenly ask?

445
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,480
You didn't know that he likes you?

446
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,609
Me?

447
00:25:44,779 --> 00:25:46,920
Come on, no way.

448
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,319
Anyone could tell.

449
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:51,119
You're pretty slow in this area.

450
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:53,859
No way. I'm very quick-witted.

451
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,730
Do you think...

452
00:25:59,329 --> 00:26:02,769
it was Director Ji
who sent you those pictures?

453
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,069
Why would someone like him do that?

454
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,839
It really isn't him. There's no way.

455
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:11,269
You never know.

456
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:15,349
People like that have
no reason for doing such things.

457
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:19,980
I told you before.
Don't trust people that easily.

458
00:26:25,089 --> 00:26:26,420
Then what about you?

459
00:26:28,289 --> 00:26:29,930
May I trust you?

460
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,069
I'm not sure.

461
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,970
Don't trust me too much.

462
00:26:41,369 --> 00:26:43,869
But I'm definitely not your stalker.

463
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:57,750
Thank you for the ride.

464
00:27:58,009 --> 00:27:59,920
You must be tired.
You should get some rest.

465
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,680
Okay.

466
00:28:02,789 --> 00:28:05,720
It was great to have spent
some time with you today.

467
00:28:07,259 --> 00:28:10,089
I'm afraid I'll ruin everything
if I tell you this now,

468
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:12,829
but I thought I should say it.

469
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:16,170
I'll lose my chance to tell you
if I hesitate any longer.

470
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:18,599
What is it?

471
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:23,170
I'm saying this for the first time
to you, Anchor Lee.

472
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,109
To be honest,

473
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:32,779
my head isn't normal.

474
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:37,519
I don't remember the things
that I should remember.

475
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,690
There are moments when I remember
something I know nothing about.

476
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:45,029
That means I'm weird.
I'm not all right.

477
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:50,329
I thought I wasn't the only one
who was weird.

478
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,799
I mean, you.

479
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:58,640
You always left me
with question marks...

480
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:03,009
from the day we first met
and to this day.

481
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:08,150
Why do you want me to be happy?

482
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:13,119
Why are you so concerned
and are sensitive about me?

483
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,890
But you don't even like me.

484
00:29:17,829 --> 00:29:20,960
I want to know
why you're doing that.

485
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:24,900
Does it have something to do
with the things I forgot?

486
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:28,710
You know something, don't you?

487
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:31,170
Have we always known each other?

488
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,779
Have you always known me?

489
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:36,450
Are you a part of that time...

490
00:29:37,049 --> 00:29:38,579
which I can't recall?

491
00:29:43,819 --> 00:29:45,019
Tell me.

492
00:29:50,589 --> 00:29:52,500
I don't exactly understand...

493
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,170
what you mean by that,

494
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:58,029
but we first met at...

495
00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:00,799
the waiting room of the TV station
on the day of your interview.

496
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:03,809
And I worry about you...

497
00:30:05,609 --> 00:30:08,240
because I had a friend
who got into a similar accident.

498
00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:12,380
That's why I was concerned
and sensitive about you.

499
00:30:14,819 --> 00:30:16,289
Does that answer your question?

500
00:30:20,859 --> 00:30:22,890
I'm sorry
I suddenly brought this up.

501
00:30:25,059 --> 00:30:26,599
But since when...

502
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:27,700
Ha Jin!

503
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:31,769
Hello, Anchor Lee.

504
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:33,039
Hello.

505
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,970
Why are you suddenly here?
Did something happen?

506
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:36,509
Ha Kyung told me to come.

507
00:30:36,509 --> 00:30:38,509
She told me not to let you
be alone at home.

508
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:41,640
That's not necessary.
She'll be back soon.

509
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,180
She said she'll be a little late.

510
00:30:43,309 --> 00:30:45,650
Director Ji threw up in the car,
so she has to clean it up.

511
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:46,980
It'll take a while.

512
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,450
Really?

513
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:53,960
Go inside. Hurry.
