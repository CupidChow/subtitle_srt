00:00:01,409 --> 00:00:04,009
(Final Episode)

2
00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:06,379
I saw it! I saw it!
I saw everything!

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:07,910
See what?

4
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:10,779
I saw you and Anchor Lee
in each other's arms!

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,419
What's going on?
Are you two an item again?

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,820
- Yes.
- I'm so glad.

7
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:17,190
Don't ever break up with him again.

8
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,559
You've done well,
so you can have this.

9
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,660
I'm never going to
break up with him.

10
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,300
You need to step it up, though.
Try not to break up with him.

11
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,000
Your relationship might end first.

12
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:46,250
I have something to say.

13
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:47,950
I need to see you after work.

14
00:00:48,189 --> 00:00:49,420
I'll be at your office.

15
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,670
This was such a great opportunity
to talk to you face to face,

16
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,269
not through a video call,

17
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,310
but we lost days...

18
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,670
because of my stupidity.

19
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,280
It's okay. I can see why
you misunderstood that.

20
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:17,349
But I'm so glad
I can talk to you like this.

21
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:19,950
Let's grab a seat.

22
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:29,329
Things were really tough for me
while I was in the US.

23
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:31,799
I wanted to see you, but I couldn't,

24
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,900
and it was difficult to reach you
with the time difference.

25
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:35,799
Really?

26
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:38,000
We had been apart for too long,

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,239
so the anxiety
began to make me feel troubled.

28
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,980
To be honest,
you're popular at the TV station.

29
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,180
You don't have to worry about
something like that.

30
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,609
You're the only one for me.

31
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,319
I understand why you got angry too.

32
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:53,549
You must feel nervous as well.

33
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,790
You're right about that.

34
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:58,359
I gave this a thought.

35
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,760
I don't know
when I'll be back from the US,

36
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,430
and you don't seem to get chosen
as a correspondent.

37
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,700
Wait, what are you talking about?

38
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,169
You aren't asking me
to break up with you, are you?

39
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:15,439
We can't keep dating like this.

40
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:16,810
Ha Kyung.

41
00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:18,909
Here.

42
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,409
(Let's live together.)

43
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:26,419
Only death awaits you
if you turn me down.

44
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,689
Of course, I'll say yes.

45
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,860
Thank you.
Let's live together forever.

46
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,289
I'll kill you
if your feelings change.

47
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,629
Should we move in together
starting today?

48
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:37,830
I can't do that today.

49
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,330
Why not? Then tomorrow?

50
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,699
- No.
- Why not? Then when?

51
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:43,840
No idea.

52
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,000
So when?

53
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,740
Ji Won.

54
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,439
Tae Eun.

55
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,210
Why are you out here?

56
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,710
My mom kept telling me
to go out and check.

57
00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:00,150
Goodness, she gets worried
way too easily.

58
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,319
Hey, you're here.

59
00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:06,259
Was there a lot of traffic?

60
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:09,090
No, I left early,
so it was all right.

61
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,500
I didn't think
Father would be here too.

62
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,199
I thought you two
wouldn't want to meet...

63
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:15,530
unless I set you up like this.

64
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:16,530
Sit down.

65
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:18,240
Honey, what are you doing?

66
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,810
Tae Eun is here. Say hi to him.

67
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:23,210
It's not like
he did anything special.

68
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,740
Take a seat.

69
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:26,840
Mother, take a seat.
Ji Won, you too.

70
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,849
Okay.

71
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,120
Mother, how are you doing?

72
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,020
I heard you pulled your back
trying to carry something heavy.

73
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,289
I've gotten much better
after I went to the hospital.

74
00:03:37,289 --> 00:03:38,460
I'm fine now.

75
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,060
But still, be careful.

76
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:41,759
Don't carry anything too heavy.

77
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:43,259
Make Ji Won do it.

78
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:45,060
I help her out a lot.

79
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,400
All right.

80
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:51,039
But you look much better now
than the last time...

81
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:52,669
you sent me a picture.

82
00:03:52,669 --> 00:03:54,039
- Really?
- Yes.

83
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:55,840
I think I gained a bit of weight...

84
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,439
thanks to the side dishes
you sent me.

85
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,180
Her side dishes aren't that good.

86
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,680
That's an overstatement.

87
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,680
No way, it was really good.

88
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,150
Fine, I guess that can happen...

89
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,590
if you live abroad for too long.

90
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,689
Goodness, you.

91
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:10,889
Ouch.

92
00:04:13,729 --> 00:04:15,889
Have you been well, Father?

93
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,560
Mother told me about you
from time to time.

94
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,899
Let's order first.

95
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,800
It seemed like
they've been waiting for us.

96
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,240
Right, okay.

97
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:26,870
- Okay, let's do that.
- Let's see.

98
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,910
- What should we eat?
- The most expensive dish.

99
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,040
- This looks good.
- You can choose something.

100
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,509
- That looks good too.
- This one and...

101
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:43,089
Father.

102
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,660
You could've called me in instead of
coming out if you're done.

103
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,730
Let's go back in.

104
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,329
Do you still blame me?

105
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,370
I heard you quit
your teaching job...

106
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:59,069
and only stayed in your study
after that happened.

107
00:04:59,569 --> 00:05:01,569
Mother had been
really worried about you.

108
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,709
I feel sorry in a certain aspect,

109
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:05,610
but I don't regret it.

110
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,009
I did it for your sake too.

111
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:10,009
Let's not talk about that.

112
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:11,779
It's all in the past anyway.

113
00:05:14,149 --> 00:05:16,420
So are you doing this
to protest against me?

114
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:18,120
- Pardon?
- Why don't you...

115
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,019
come home?
Why do you keep traveling around?

116
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,089
Is it because of me?

117
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,959
It's not like that.
I really enjoy doing this.

118
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,629
And it's rewarding to be there...

119
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:30,600
to help the people that are in need.

120
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,069
I really feel alive.

121
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:35,810
Goodness, I worked hard
to turn you into a doctor,

122
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:38,139
but you feel rewarded
by doing something that petty?

123
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:40,480
I feel much happier now
than when I ran my clinic.

124
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:43,750
But of course,
I'm sure you won't like it.

125
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,519
You'll have to live
doing what you're destined to do.

126
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:49,149
Anyway, don't go anywhere
that's too dangerous.

127
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,560
Let's go inside.

128
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,230
Father.

129
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,160
You should come and see
the exhibition with Mother.

130
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,060
I'll keep some tickets for you.

131
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,129
Maybe.

132
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:10,110
("News Live": Jo Il Kwon)

133
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:16,649
Jeong Hoon, don't you think
you're way too inconsiderate?

134
00:06:16,649 --> 00:06:18,420
Why are you saying that to me
as soon as I walk in?

135
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,350
I heard you're dating Ha Jin again.

136
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,250
Do I have to report
something like that to you?

137
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,959
Ha Kyung will find out
everything you've been doing.

138
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,500
Come on.
You don't have to go that far.

139
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:33,829
I'll give you my full support...

140
00:06:33,829 --> 00:06:36,870
for your relationship
to come to fruition.

141
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:38,970
I'll manage my own relationship.

142
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,839
Just focus on Ha Kyung.

143
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:42,209
Go work.

144
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,639
You better brace yourself.

145
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,610
A long-distance relationship
isn't as easy as you think.

146
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,379
You should go on as many dates
as possible before she leaves.

147
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:54,850
Isn't she leaving next Monday?

148
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:13,600
I'm sorry. I had to finish
watching the news.

149
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,769
That's okay.

150
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,379
Is there anything you'd like to do?

151
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,410
Or anywhere you'd like to go?

152
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:25,550
I do, but it's too late today.

153
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,980
Really?

154
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,120
I shouldn't have said yes
to returning to the news.

155
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:33,360
I have no time to waste
if we're going to make up...

156
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,889
for all the lost dates.

157
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:38,100
When will you be coming back?

158
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:40,730
I think it'll take a month.

159
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,329
There are several things
I need to take care of.

160
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,839
That's fine. I even waited for you
for two years.

161
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:49,410
Promise me we'll go on many dates
before you leave.

162
00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:52,879
I do. Let's go.

163
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,389
What are you thinking about?

164
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:05,959
"People will start talking again."

165
00:08:07,089 --> 00:08:11,129
"Some people
may still criticize us."

166
00:08:11,129 --> 00:08:12,360
Things like these.

167
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,829
They haven't forgotten about it.

168
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,569
I don't think they ever will.

169
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,269
Are you afraid?

170
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:21,569
No.

171
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,410
What I feared the most...

172
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:28,009
was not being able
to hold your hand anymore.

173
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:31,120
The same goes for me.

174
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,320
That's why I have nothing to fear.

175
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:37,860
As long as you're okay.

176
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,289
I've always been okay.

177
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,460
As long as you were.

178
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:46,860
Then we're good.

179
00:08:48,269 --> 00:08:50,940
I finally know my top priority.

180
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:53,399
Is that me?

181
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,139
It's us.

182
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:58,340
- Us?
- Yes.

183
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,220
Aren't you exhausted?

184
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,620
Not one bit.

185
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,690
I'm going to listen to your voice
a bit more before going to bed.

186
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,899
Oh, right. I have a dilemma.

187
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,029
What is it?

188
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,799
I have to make
an important decision.

189
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:27,340
I need to choose...

190
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:30,210
between a Korean movie
and "Kill the Venus 3".

191
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,009
They're both great opportunities,

192
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:33,980
so I'm in a big dilemma.

193
00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:37,879
Which one do you think
I should take?

194
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:40,220
I'm not sure.

195
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:43,350
If I were to be selfish,
I'd like you to stay here...

196
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,919
instead of going back.

197
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,590
But that's wrong.

198
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,159
If that's what you want,
then I'll do that.

199
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:58,399
You see, I don't know much
about movies.

200
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,909
Give me some time,
and I'll think about it.

201
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:03,870
Sure.

202
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:08,309
(Yang Jin Woo)

203
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,919
("Director Yang Knows How to Make
Blockbuster, Cinematic Movies")

204
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:32,700
Of all the things you've made,
this coffee takes the cake.

205
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,210
I'm going to crave this every day.

206
00:10:34,409 --> 00:10:36,139
Just let me know.

207
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:39,509
I'll buy it for you anytime.
I have a lot of money.

208
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,779
You picked the right one.

209
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,549
Oh, right.
Have you thought about it?

210
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:52,259
I'm terribly torn between the two.

211
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,730
I've looked into it.

212
00:10:56,029 --> 00:10:58,759
Director Yang's movies...

213
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:01,269
were generally liked
by the audience.

214
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:04,470
Many of them complimented
his characters.

215
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,299
They especially complimented...

216
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:08,639
on how charming
the female leads are.

217
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,909
As for "Kill the Venus",

218
00:11:11,309 --> 00:11:14,509
it's true that it's a blockbuster.

219
00:11:14,509 --> 00:11:18,279
It'll help you become
more globally famous.

220
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,419
Hold on.

221
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:22,850
You actually looked into all this?

222
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:24,559
Yes, during my spare time.

223
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:28,029
You said it was important.
I had to be thorough.

224
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:31,360
I didn't want to think about it.

225
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,230
I asked you, hoping that...

226
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:37,600
you'd tell me to just stay here.

227
00:11:38,669 --> 00:11:41,110
I feel bad that you put
so much effort into this.

228
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:44,110
Of course, I'd want that.

229
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,409
But you like your job.

230
00:11:48,049 --> 00:11:49,509
You feel happy when acting.

231
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,950
So don't put me first.

232
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,149
Think about what's best for you.

233
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,460
Have I told you before...

234
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:03,490
that I extremely love you?

235
00:12:06,429 --> 00:12:07,470
I love you even more.

236
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:23,009
I don't want to.

237
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:24,679
Why not? You look too...

238
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:27,379
- You look too boring.
- It's suffocating.

239
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:28,919
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Whatever.

240
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:31,519
Hold on. You really don't listen.
Come here.

241
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:33,960
Stand there.

242
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:38,799
Why are you going this far?
Let me dress like how I always do.

243
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,100
Still, this is your first day...

244
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,200
as the team manager
for the 9 p.m. news.

245
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:45,399
You should look like one.

246
00:12:48,169 --> 00:12:51,279
Should we eat something tasty
after work?

247
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,679
This isn't a big deal.

248
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:54,279
I want beef.

249
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:58,779
All right.

250
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:00,850
You're now
a part of the 9 p.m. news.

251
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:01,950
Buying beef is nothing.

252
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,090
- But we're going dutch.
- No, thanks.

253
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:05,120
Come on, now.

254
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:10,860
By the way, you really look nice.

255
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,629
Really? Do I look okay?

256
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:15,299
Yes. You look so handsome.

257
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:20,600
Hey, are you crazy? Hurry up.
You're late for the meeting.

258
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,610
Yes, ma'am.

259
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,950
Are you sure you're free right now?

260
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:31,379
I am. I already did all the work
in advance...

261
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:32,649
so I could be with you.

262
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,789
It's been a long time
since I've come here.

263
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:39,690
Don't we have so many memories
of this place?

264
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,860
Are you free for lunch tomorrow?

265
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:46,830
Yes.

266
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:49,370
Why? Are we going somewhere nice?

267
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:51,539
It's not that.

268
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,710
There's someone who really wants
to meet you.

269
00:13:55,509 --> 00:13:56,639
Who is it?

270
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:00,240
What? Look who's here.

271
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:05,220
Ha Jin, it's been a long time.

272
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,419
Hello.

273
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:09,820
Have you heard? I'm the team manager
of the 9 p.m. news.

274
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,690
Really? Congratulations.
That's a promotion, right?

275
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:15,129
Yes, it is.

276
00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:18,830
You and I have climbed up the ladder
in the past couple of years.

277
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,629
You're a world-class star,

278
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:22,470
and I'm the team manager
of the main news.

279
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,970
Jeong Hoon's the only one
who's still the same.

280
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:25,600
You're right.

281
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:29,169
By the way, would you be interested
in doing an interview?

282
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:30,269
For "News Live"?

283
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:33,480
No, for the 9 p.m. news.

284
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,750
"News Live" is no longer
what it used to be.

285
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,879
You can't be personal
when it comes to work, you know?

286
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:39,980
You don't have to say yes
to all of his requests.

287
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,320
Choose what's best for you.

288
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,049
I will.

289
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,960
All right, then.
I hope to be hearing from you soon.

290
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,529
If you're done speaking,
we'll go now.

291
00:14:50,129 --> 00:14:51,460
We're running out of time.

292
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,700
Okay, okay.

293
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,070
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

294
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,769
They're making me jealous.

295
00:15:01,309 --> 00:15:02,940
Lucky them.

296
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,409
Wait. How do I look?

297
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:11,720
You look pretty.

298
00:15:12,549 --> 00:15:15,019
I'm more nervous right now
than when I auditioned for a movie.

299
00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:18,519
Don't be. I'm sure he'll like you.

300
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:19,990
Let's go.

301
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:30,000
You should stop staring
and start eating.

302
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,740
She may have an upset stomach
thanks to you.

303
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,409
All right.

304
00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:37,639
Enjoy the meal.

305
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:39,139
You too.

306
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,159
Eat up.

307
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:53,759
Thank you.

308
00:15:54,289 --> 00:15:57,159
Thank you for dating my son.

309
00:15:58,929 --> 00:16:01,129
You two look happy.

310
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:03,269
It makes me happy as well.

311
00:16:19,549 --> 00:16:22,389
This one looks really nice.
It looks artistic.

312
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:24,789
I'm going to hang this in my car
when I go back to the States.

313
00:16:24,789 --> 00:16:26,419
Didn't you say you'd do the same...

314
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:28,460
with the photo you took
while having lunch yesterday?

315
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,600
Then I'll hang this in my bedroom.

316
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,899
That's what you said
about the one we took...

317
00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:35,129
three days ago at the observatory.

318
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,740
You should stop using
your excellent memory...

319
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,100
for teasing me.

320
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,340
You look cute when I tease you.

321
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,139
I plan to use my memory often.

322
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,909
Just when you tease me?

323
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,509
Thank you.

324
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:50,409
For what?

325
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:53,580
For suggesting
to visit my mother's grave first.

326
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,590
I asked you
because I wanted to pay her a visit.

327
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,919
And it didn't have anything
to do with you.

328
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:00,820
She and I got along really well.

329
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,860
I think she thought the same...

330
00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:05,930
on the day when you met her.

331
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:10,130
I've never seen her smile like that.

332
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:15,210
I'm thinking about visiting her
whenever I come back to Korea.

333
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,240
I can say hello to her
and go for a drive with you.

334
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,240
That will be nice.

335
00:17:21,009 --> 00:17:22,250
Sounds good to me too.

336
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,549
Then, let's take one more photo.

337
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,849
In 1, 2, 3.

338
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,240
Yes, Ha Kyung.

339
00:17:53,579 --> 00:17:55,079
I'm in front of my house.

340
00:17:55,779 --> 00:17:57,410
There are a lot of reporters.

341
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,279
Well, we saw this coming though.

342
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:00,380
Don't worry.

343
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:02,650
Okay.

344
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,559
Are you ready?

345
00:18:14,099 --> 00:18:17,069
I just needed to rely on you
from the beginning.

346
00:18:17,299 --> 00:18:18,900
Aren't I really reliable?

347
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,940
Yes, I'm not scared at all...

348
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,670
now that I have you by my side.

349
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,539
I feel the same way.

350
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:31,720
Shall we go in?

351
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,150
Yes.

352
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,599
- There's Yeo Ha Jin.
- It's Lee Jeong Hoon.

353
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:48,470
Did you come back to Korea
because of Anchor Lee Jeong Hoon?

354
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,329
- Why did you suddenly come back?
- What's your plan?

355
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:53,170
- Why did you come back to Korea?
- Do you plan to get married?

356
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,170
- What's your plan?
- Please answer our question.

357
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:58,180
- Did you get back together?
- Are you guys dating again?

358
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:01,079
- Do you love him?
- Anything for your fans?

359
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:03,509
- Are you going to marry him?
- Anything for the press?

360
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:06,980
- What's your plan?
- What does this mean?

361
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:11,890
My gosh, who is it?
It's too early in the morning.

362
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:14,529
That's for me!

363
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,730
That's for me! Mine! Don't touch it.

364
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,059
Don't touch it! It's mine!

365
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,069
(Hana Camping Mall)

366
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,910
What's all this?

367
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,640
Are those clothes for Anchor Lee?

368
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:33,779
No, camping gear.

369
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,279
You can't stay out all night.

370
00:19:40,819 --> 00:19:41,890
Camping?

371
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,789
Yes, I really wanted to go camping,

372
00:19:43,789 --> 00:19:45,660
but I've never gone camping before.

373
00:19:46,089 --> 00:19:48,230
Have you ever gone camping before?

374
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,789
No, me neither.

375
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:51,230
That's great.

376
00:19:51,529 --> 00:19:53,430
I bought everything we might need.

377
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:54,930
Already?

378
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:58,700
You're going camping with me
this weekend, okay?

379
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,440
Here you go, Anchor Lee.

380
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,579
Okay. Is this everything we need?

381
00:20:08,579 --> 00:20:10,109
We loaded everything.

382
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:11,480
And this is my finishing touch.

383
00:20:13,049 --> 00:20:14,049
Do I look good?

384
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,519
Perfect.

385
00:20:17,089 --> 00:20:18,819
- Let's get going.
- Let's go.

386
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,269
No way. Is it raining right now?

387
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:36,809
I do see some raindrops drizzling.

388
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:42,279
And now, it's pouring.

389
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,420
Can we still go camping in the rain?

390
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,460
Yes. We can.

391
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:04,769
How much longer?

392
00:21:04,769 --> 00:21:07,170
I'm hungry. Do you need some help?

393
00:21:07,569 --> 00:21:10,170
No, it's going well.
Go get some rest.

394
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:13,210
You're sure it's going well, right?

395
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:14,750
I'm following the recipe,

396
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,180
but I can't guarantee
that it'll be tasty.

397
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:20,619
All right. I just need
to put beer in it and cook it.

398
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:23,119
What? Gosh.

399
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,490
What is it?

400
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:27,160
I was supposed to marinate
the meat for three years.

401
00:21:28,059 --> 00:21:29,289
It's okay.

402
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:31,089
I don't mind eating bland food.

403
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:32,359
Okay.

404
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,769
Then, I just need to cook it now.

405
00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:37,470
All right. I'm supposed
to cook this on a charcoal fire.

406
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:38,839
I see. A charcoal fire.

407
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,240
"When you don't have
a charcoal fire,"

408
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,670
"cook it on the stove for..." What?

409
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:47,279
- What is it now?
- It takes four hours to cook this.

410
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:51,079
What should we do?
You must be starving.

411
00:21:51,549 --> 00:21:53,150
Do you want to cook ramyeon instead?

412
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,720
Are you sure that will do?

413
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,549
I love ramyeon.

414
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,920
Ta-da.

415
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,339
- Is it that good?
- It's so good!

416
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,569
Eat a lot.

417
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,440
No, I shouldn't.
I need to save some space for beer.

418
00:22:17,509 --> 00:22:19,539
Let's watch a movie
while drinking beer.

419
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,950
When will you go home?

420
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,609
I can't go home tonight.

421
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,250
Why not?

422
00:22:25,819 --> 00:22:27,150
I'm eating ramyeon.

423
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:30,019
Didn't you watch that movie?

424
00:22:30,019 --> 00:22:32,359
When you eat ramyeon
at a man's place, you can't go home.

425
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,930
I see. Really?

426
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,490
- Yes.
- I see.

427
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,259
Eat up.

428
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,539
We were best friends.

429
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:50,740
Here.

430
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:53,380
- Hey.
- This is nice.

431
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:57,410
Hey, are they...

432
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,619
Doesn't this feel like
we're camping?

433
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,950
You're going to drink one too?

434
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:04,990
I'm good at drinking beer now.

435
00:23:05,089 --> 00:23:06,089
Cheers.

436
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:11,529
Hey, listen. He's so handsome.

437
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,630
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

438
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:19,170
I've dreamed of drinking beer
with you for so long.

439
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,309
I also dreamed of drinking
beer with you too.

440
00:23:24,009 --> 00:23:26,380
Then, we can drink beer
together often from now on.

441
00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:29,980
This is not good.

442
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:31,210
What do you mean?

443
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,450
I keep getting ambitious.

444
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:36,150
In what ways?

445
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:41,190
I want to make you
the happiest woman on earth.

446
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:46,359
My gosh, this is not good either.

447
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:49,299
Why?

448
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,599
Because I want to make you
happier than that.

449
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,490
It's done.

450
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:53,230
Where are you?

451
00:24:53,529 --> 00:24:55,029
I'm on my way now.

452
00:24:56,269 --> 00:24:57,670
I'm so nervous.

453
00:24:58,299 --> 00:24:59,700
Did you take the calming pill?

454
00:24:59,769 --> 00:25:01,640
I took it 30 minutes ago.

455
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,910
But why am I so nervous?

456
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:05,579
I'm more nervous than...

457
00:25:05,579 --> 00:25:07,180
when I had to attend
promotional interviews in the US.

458
00:25:08,009 --> 00:25:10,480
Don't worry.
I'm sure you'll do a great job.

459
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:14,420
But I'll only be able to calm down
once I see your face.

460
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:17,450
I'll try to get there
as soon as possible.

461
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:19,660
Okay.

462
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,730
I'll try to hang in there
until you arrive.

463
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:22,930
Get here safely.

464
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:25,660
Okay. I'll see you there.

465
00:25:39,009 --> 00:25:42,049
I still remember too many memories.

466
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:47,950
I'm pretty sure these memories
will not fade away...

467
00:25:49,349 --> 00:25:51,049
for the rest of my life.

468
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,819
They will remain inside me
like tree rings.

469
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:10,039
(Find Me in Your Memory)

470
00:26:19,349 --> 00:26:21,420
Isn't this more nervous
than the actual filming?

471
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,720
I think so.

472
00:26:23,289 --> 00:26:25,890
Now, we will receive questions
from the reporters.

473
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,730
You decided to come back
with a Korean movie.

474
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:31,390
After you've been active
in Hollywood,

475
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,700
it's been a while since you've been
active in the Korean movie industry.

476
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:34,859
How does it feel?

477
00:26:35,069 --> 00:26:36,130
Well,

478
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,440
first of all, it was really great
to say my lines...

479
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,670
in Korean, not English.

480
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:45,940
I thought I was used to doing that,
but it felt new.

481
00:26:46,579 --> 00:26:49,180
Ms. Yeo, you came back to Korea
after two years,

482
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:51,750
so it has been a while
since you met with your Korean fans.

483
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,680
Please share a few words for them.

484
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:01,690
("Find Me in Your Memory")

485
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:12,069
I missed you so much,

486
00:27:15,869 --> 00:27:17,240
and I wanted to see you.

487
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:23,250
I could adapt quickly
in an unfamiliar environment...

488
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:26,079
thanks to the support my fans showed
even while I was overseas.

489
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:28,549
I really want to thank you.

490
00:27:29,049 --> 00:27:32,059
We're very glad to
have you back in Korea,

491
00:27:32,059 --> 00:27:34,089
but you must have been torn.

492
00:27:34,089 --> 00:27:37,730
Why did you decide to film
"Find Me in Your Memory"...

493
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:40,599
instead of "Kill the Venus 3",
which is guaranteed to be a hit.

494
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:47,740
Actually, I begged her to join me
because I desperately wanted to...

495
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,670
make this film with her.

496
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:56,049
Of course, it's because I trusted
the scenario and the director.

497
00:27:56,109 --> 00:27:57,950
And the story was perfect too.

498
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:01,750
That's my official statement,

499
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:05,119
but someone made an analysis...

500
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:09,990
and said doing this film will be
a huge plus to my future career.

501
00:28:10,329 --> 00:28:11,430
Really?

502
00:28:11,829 --> 00:28:16,000
I should show
my deepest gratitude to that person.

503
00:28:16,369 --> 00:28:17,500
Thank you.

504
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:21,940
Ms. Yeo, why did you decide...

505
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:24,970
to return to Korea
after your long hiatus?

506
00:28:25,309 --> 00:28:29,210
Is there any other reason
other than the film itself?

507
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:32,380
Is it because of
Anchor Lee Jeong Hoon?

508
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:43,630
No.

509
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:46,230
It was for me.

510
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:49,930
I decided...

511
00:28:51,269 --> 00:28:54,440
to become a person
who's remembered daily and forever.

512
00:28:57,509 --> 00:28:59,680
I wanted to remember and love...

513
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,380
in this place.

514
00:29:11,789 --> 00:29:13,289
I'm Lee Jeong Hoon of HBN.

515
00:29:22,069 --> 00:29:24,670
There's a question
I'd like to ask you.

516
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:33,309
Now I know how to etch
those memories in my heart...

517
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:35,910
and move forward.

518
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,549
I know how those memories can become
good memories, not wounds.

519
00:29:45,859 --> 00:29:49,230
I just need to
live this moment beautifully.

520
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,369
(We thank Park Jin Woo
for his guest appearance.)

521
00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:48,890
(We support our viewers' tomorrow
along with Jeong Hoon and Ha Jin.)

522
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:54,819
(Thank you for watching
Find Me in Your Memory.)
