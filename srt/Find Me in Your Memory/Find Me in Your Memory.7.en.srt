1
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,089
Gosh, why is it
taking them so long to chat?

2
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,500
Is everything going well?

3
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,260
What did he say?
Is he okay with extending this?

4
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,629
Yes, he is.

5
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:30,140
He'll let me go on with this
as much as I want.

6
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:32,939
But he's acting
a little weird today.

7
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,539
He's weird? How so?

8
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,679
Isn't it a good thing
that he agreed?

9
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:40,280
He's treating me way too nicely,
and it feels like something is up.

10
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:43,450
I think he wanted to see me...

11
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:45,119
to ask me out.

12
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:50,759
Ask you out? That's nonsense.

13
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,420
(Ha Kyung)

14
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:55,859
Feel free to pick up your phone.

15
00:00:55,859 --> 00:00:58,060
It's just my sister.
It's not a big deal.

16
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:00,899
Man.

17
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:03,770
Is she reading
too much into everything again?

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,370
I hope you will never contact me
or ask me to meet ever again.

19
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:12,640
That's why I wanted to see you.

20
00:01:16,579 --> 00:01:19,750
You just said you didn't care
how long it lasts,

21
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,049
that I can do whatever I want.

22
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,159
That doesn't matter.

23
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,790
It's all fake anyway.

24
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,730
So you wanted to say...

25
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,900
you never want to meet me again?

26
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:35,469
Yes.

27
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:42,739
I'm responsible for
playing along with the love scandal,

28
00:01:43,209 --> 00:01:44,579
so you can release...

29
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:48,379
the news of our breakup
when your movie stops playing.

30
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,459
I'm sorry.
She wouldn't pick up the phone.

31
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:03,659
It's okay. We're all done talking.

32
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,760
Please excuse me.

33
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:10,599
Goodbye.

34
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,610
What is this? What's going on?

35
00:02:52,009 --> 00:02:55,409
Man, I should have splashed water
on his face or something.

36
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:56,919
What are you talking about?

37
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:58,520
I should have told him off...

38
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,020
that he shouldn't do that
and that he'll regret this.

39
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,550
What are you saying?

40
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:04,259
I couldn't do anything. I couldn't.

41
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:05,659
I should have done something.

42
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,289
You got turned down again.

43
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:08,960
You thought he was
going to ask you out,

44
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,530
but you overreacted
and got turned down.

45
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,900
There was no time for me to do that.

46
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:17,270
I'm the best at splashing people,
slapping them, and cursing them.

47
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,500
I've done it
dozens of times in dramas,

48
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,639
but I couldn't do anything
when it happened in real life.

49
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:23,340
What happened?

50
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,909
I thought he said he'd let you
do everything as you wish.

51
00:03:25,909 --> 00:03:27,409
You said he was way too nice.

52
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,680
That's why I spaced out
without doing anything.

53
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,389
You're a good person.

54
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,759
I want you to always be happy.

55
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,090
He said something like that
with the kindest face.

56
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:46,500
That doesn't matter.
It's all fake anyway.

57
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,469
Then he suddenly became cold
and treated me coldly.

58
00:03:50,469 --> 00:03:52,569
He was way too different.

59
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:55,210
He hugs me, then slaps me.
Then he hugs me again and slaps me.

60
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,810
What? He slapped you?

61
00:03:56,979 --> 00:03:58,639
- That jerk...
- No.

62
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,650
It's not that
I was actually slapped.

63
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,650
That's just how I felt. My feelings.

64
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:05,819
So? In conclusion,
you were turned down again.

65
00:04:07,189 --> 00:04:08,189
Yes.

66
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,659
Figures.

67
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,789
It would've been overreacting...

68
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:14,629
for me to splash him or curse him.

69
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:18,129
I couldn't do anything else
other than sitting there.

70
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,329
What is this?
It's not like you to get depressed.

71
00:04:22,569 --> 00:04:24,670
You said it's not over
until it's really over.

72
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:31,870
(Find me in Your Memory)

73
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:48,019
Why are you making
such a face from the morning?

74
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:55,829
Why does the weather
have to be so nice?

75
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,689
(Posts)

76
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:28,829
Good morning.

77
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:30,600
I woke up to a depressing morning,

78
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,560
but I feel much better
thanks to your love and support.

79
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,699
Hashtag even when I'm lonely or sad,

80
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:36,569
hashtag I will not cry,

81
00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:38,170
hashtag, have a great day, everyone.

82
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:41,170
I knew it.
People should always be the same.

83
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,720
- Ha Jin!
- My gosh.

84
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,860
What is it? It's way too early.

85
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,259
That's what I want to say.

86
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:00,829
Why are you doing this so early?

87
00:07:00,829 --> 00:07:02,329
Hey, look at me.

88
00:07:02,329 --> 00:07:03,560
What do you mean
by a depressing morning...

89
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,129
and when you're lonely or sad?

90
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:07,170
Why are you possessed
by Candy this early?

91
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,500
I'm right.

92
00:07:08,769 --> 00:07:11,199
Everyone thinks I'm dating,

93
00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:13,870
but I'm sad and lonely right now.

94
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,870
I'm in distress and anger right now.

95
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,639
Have you been dying
to cause trouble...

96
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:19,509
after seeing only good articles
for a few days?

97
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:23,449
They'll write articles about
how you covet for attention.

98
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:25,350
It looks like your movie will
do pretty well, so let's try...

99
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,920
to keep this vibe going, okay?

100
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,850
I was just being honest.

101
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,660
I had more malicious comments
than compliments,

102
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,860
but people are now supporting me
and sending heart emojis. Look.

103
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,529
I'm sure one person
wrote everything.

104
00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:35,629
Get ready to go out!

105
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:37,759
You have a full day
starting with a photo shoot.

106
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,600
Okay.

107
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:43,230
Yes, I should feel better.

108
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,170
There's no need
for me to be depressed.

109
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:47,339
You're so cute, my sister.

110
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:48,439
I'm taking a shower!

111
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:52,009
What's with her ups and downs?

112
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:09,689
(Ha Jin, you're mine.
Only I can have you.)

113
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,899
It's been a long time.

114
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,069
We've been busy lately, haven't we?

115
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,040
I finally have a day to myself.

116
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,610
But thanks to you, I'm out here
instead of resting at home.

117
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:26,709
Hey, this is resting.
You can get some fresh air.

118
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:28,750
Being home alone in the dark
isn't resting.

119
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:32,480
I haven't been home alone
in some time now.

120
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:36,450
I didn't come over that often.
You're so harsh.

121
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,720
I can list the dates for you.

122
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:43,360
I'm sorry.
I'll just focus on fishing.

123
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:55,309
I settled everything with Ha Jin.

124
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:57,039
What?

125
00:08:57,379 --> 00:08:59,139
No good will come out of
meeting her.

126
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,009
Don't worry too much.

127
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:04,980
I see.

128
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,889
I did it to spare her
from getting hurt.

129
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,120
But I'm afraid I did the opposite.

130
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:15,990
Time will heal everything.

131
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:18,830
Don't worry.

132
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,669
Can you look toward your left?
Good. 1, 2.

133
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:32,009
Good. Good. 1, 2.

134
00:09:32,909 --> 00:09:35,379
You seem to be
the most popular these days.

135
00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:38,220
Your first movie
is going to be a hit.

136
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,419
How do you feel?

137
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,620
I'm truly grateful.

138
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,659
I was worried about it.

139
00:09:44,659 --> 00:09:48,330
But for now, it seems like
the majority likes it. I'm glad.

140
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:51,129
There's also something else
to celebrate.

141
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:53,730
You're dating Anchor Lee Jeong Hoon.

142
00:09:54,629 --> 00:09:56,600
Right.

143
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,539
How is he as a boyfriend?

144
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,669
As a boyfriend?

145
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:06,210
I'm sure he's a bit different
from what we see on the news.

146
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:10,480
I...

147
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,220
don't know. What do you think?

148
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,690
That's understandable.

149
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,820
She's been too busy lately,
so they couldn't meet.

150
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,860
Right?

151
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,289
Yes.

152
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:23,559
Let's skip that question
and move onto the next one.

153
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:32,539
Did I wake you up? I'm sorry.

154
00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:34,240
No, it's okay.

155
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,940
We're almost there.

156
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,009
Look.

157
00:10:39,009 --> 00:10:41,909
I asked him to send the photos.
Don't you look pretty?

158
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:43,850
Yes, I look nice.

159
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,519
Let's go.

160
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:48,289
- What's going on?
- My goodness.

161
00:10:48,289 --> 00:10:49,419
She's here!

162
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:51,389
Ha Jin!

163
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,860
Did you cause another trouble
without my knowing?

164
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:56,289
No, I didn't.

165
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,200
I did nothing.

166
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:02,769
- Ha Jin!
- Ha Jin!

167
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,669
- Move aside!
- Can you see?

168
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,279
What's going on?

169
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,580
- Where is she?
- Ha Jin, you're pretty!

170
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,480
- "You're pretty"?
- Ha Jin!

171
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,750
- Ha Jin!
- You're forever my number one!

172
00:11:20,049 --> 00:11:22,789
- I'm forever her number one?
- Look this way!

173
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:26,090
- We can't live without you!
- We can't live without you!

174
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:29,029
- Ha Jin!
- We love you!

175
00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:32,460
- I love you!
- Look here!

176
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:02,360
What are these?

177
00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:05,029
Jeong Hoon, can you take these?

178
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:07,360
- No, take them to your desk!
- What?

179
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,700
Take them to your desk!

180
00:12:11,299 --> 00:12:13,240
These are all yours.

181
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:15,269
These were mailed.

182
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:18,009
They carried those all the way here.

183
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:21,580
Why do they do this?

184
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,879
They must have nothing to do.

185
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:25,379
Come on, don't say that.

186
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:26,850
They're showing their love
and interest in you.

187
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,490
I don't care.

188
00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:31,059
- You can have them all.
- Really?

189
00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:34,330
Here. Take this. Take everything.

190
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,029
Take them or throw them away.

191
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:40,330
Are you sure?
There are some nice gifts.

192
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,870
There are matching t-shirts, hats,
and even watches.

193
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:46,169
You can take all the men's items...

194
00:12:46,169 --> 00:12:47,509
since you don't have a girlfriend.

195
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:50,240
What do you mean?
I have a girlfriend.

196
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:54,679
You have a girlfriend? Really?

197
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,009
Since when?

198
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:57,919
It's been over six months now.

199
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:00,679
What is it? Am I not supposed
to have one?

200
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,649
Are you the only one
who's allowed to date?

201
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,990
We're not dating.
I've told you this before.

202
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:09,389
Forget it.
I won't be deceived any longer.

203
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,659
To be honest,
I've been playing dumb all along.

204
00:13:13,129 --> 00:13:14,830
I know you two had a date
by the Han River yesterday.

205
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,730
Don't try to feign innocence.

206
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:17,740
Who did?

207
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,570
Me?

208
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:23,009
There are news articles
about you guys.

209
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:25,809
("Ha Jin and Jeong Hoon Have a Date
by the Han River at Night")

210
00:13:25,809 --> 00:13:27,779
Why did they post these photos now?

211
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:31,820
You and your girlfriend
are currently most-searched online.

212
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:33,080
Did you not know that?

213
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,490
"Girlfriend"? She isn't.

214
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:38,320
Those were taken ages ago,
and we weren't on a date.

215
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,090
You can't fool me.

216
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:42,629
Anyway, you better not go back
on your word.

217
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:44,259
These are all mine, now.

218
00:13:44,429 --> 00:13:45,730
Sure.

219
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,399
You must have good news.

220
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:52,870
Goodness, you're the couple
of the century.

221
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,370
No wonder you're so elated.

222
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,240
You're here early.

223
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,980
Is something wrong?

224
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,009
Like you don't know?

225
00:13:59,909 --> 00:14:02,750
Since when was our news used
for your own benefits?

226
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,980
Are you trying to make sure
the movie becomes a total hit?

227
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,090
What do you mean?

228
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,190
(Guests for the 1st Half of 2020)

229
00:14:10,419 --> 00:14:11,720
(This week's guest is
Director Ji Hyun Geun.)

230
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,090
(Ji Hyun Geun)

231
00:14:14,059 --> 00:14:16,289
Thanks to your actress girlfriend,
you've become good at acting too.

232
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,460
I know you told Director Choi that
you'd like to interview Director Ji.

233
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:27,539
It was so awkward to hear them say
how pretty you are.

234
00:14:27,539 --> 00:14:28,570
I got goosebumps.

235
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:31,809
Goodness, they love you.

236
00:14:31,809 --> 00:14:33,879
Are they seriously my fans?

237
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:34,879
Of course.

238
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:37,509
That's why I called you in today.

239
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:40,320
I wanted to give them a chance
to see you.

240
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,250
What's going on?

241
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,320
Many of her haters came
all the way here,

242
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,789
but we never had
fans' visiting before.

243
00:14:45,789 --> 00:14:47,559
I guess the movie truly is a hit.

244
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:49,929
People love you these days.

245
00:14:49,929 --> 00:14:51,799
They blame the roles
you've had in the past.

246
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:54,299
They argue that you're pure
and intelligent in real life.

247
00:14:54,299 --> 00:14:56,200
And people say...

248
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,240
that's why Anchor Lee
fell in love with you.

249
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:01,470
We had so many wonderful comments
on today's article as well.

250
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,309
"Article"? What article?

251
00:15:03,309 --> 00:15:04,309
Did you miss it?

252
00:15:04,309 --> 00:15:08,080
The article about the date
by the Han River was released.

253
00:15:08,379 --> 00:15:11,220
He went on a date
by the Han River? With whom?

254
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,620
Whom do you think?

255
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,889
With you, of course.

256
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:16,690
Me?

257
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:17,789
It's true.

258
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,220
Let me see.

259
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,029
Let me see.

260
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:22,559
Did you see it?

261
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:25,799
Why did they release this now?
This happened a long time ago.

262
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,730
What? It wasn't last night?

263
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:30,169
No, these photos were taken
a while ago.

264
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,700
"Lovely Date Night", my foot.

265
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,269
What's wrong?
Are things not going well?

266
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:38,940
It's because she's busy.
Her schedule has been hectic.

267
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:42,009
Right, it has been.

268
00:15:42,049 --> 00:15:43,809
I know you're tired,
but hang in there for a few months.

269
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:46,080
You need to become
as famous as possible.

270
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,320
Right, take some of these
on your way home.

271
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,759
Your fans keep sending you
letters and gifts every day.

272
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:59,330
Director Choi.

273
00:15:59,629 --> 00:16:03,029
Hey. I'm glad you're here.
Let's go eat.

274
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:05,100
Wait. I'd like you
to change the guest.

275
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,899
I'm not following you.

276
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,940
Please don't invite
Director Ji Hyun Geun.

277
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:12,980
No. I won't allow that.

278
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,750
Don't you know that
"My First Love" was nominated...

279
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,980
for the Beijing International
Film Festival?

280
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:21,149
You should be grateful
for his appearance on our news.

281
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,919
You should be bowing down to him.

282
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:26,620
Many people are trying
to invite him to their shows.

283
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,460
People are going to talk.

284
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:33,730
If he comes out,
we'll have to talk about Ha Jin.

285
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:36,269
People will think
I'm promoting the movie.

286
00:16:36,269 --> 00:16:38,299
It's obvious
that they'll talk about it.

287
00:16:38,299 --> 00:16:40,940
Exactly. It is obvious.

288
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,470
That means they'll be interested
in our news...

289
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,909
which means our ratings
will skyrocket.

290
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:49,850
Don't tell me you've planned
all this for the ratings.

291
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:52,450
That's true, but I also
couldn't allow other shows to do it.

292
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:55,450
The boyfriend of the lead actress
in that movie...

293
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:56,990
is our news anchor.

294
00:16:57,019 --> 00:17:01,559
Let's get
the highest ratings possible.

295
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:04,089
You're so materialistic.

296
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:07,430
Does it make you happy
to gain high ratings...

297
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,430
by sacrificing your junior?

298
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:11,140
It'll benefit you as well
if we have high ratings.

299
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,440
And I didn't sacrifice you.

300
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,109
Did I tell you two to pretend
that you're dating?

301
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:18,680
Did I encourage you?

302
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,509
My gosh.

303
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,579
Why don't you grab a megaphone...

304
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,119
so that everyone here can hear you?

305
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:34,059
Are you guys still pretending
to like each other? It's not real?

306
00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:35,289
Of course, not.

307
00:17:35,289 --> 00:17:37,390
You should do better.

308
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:40,130
You know
you don't deserve her, right?

309
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:42,829
Why are you singing
a different tune now?

310
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:46,000
Didn't you say that
she didn't have a good reputation?

311
00:17:46,069 --> 00:17:47,700
Didn't you say
I'd be at a disadvantage...

312
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,809
if I were to date her?

313
00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:51,609
That was in the past.
Things have changed now.

314
00:17:51,609 --> 00:17:53,039
How could you call yourself
a reporter...

315
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,450
when you're so dull
about your surroundings?

316
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,950
We don't need to promote the movie.

317
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:00,779
It's number one in the box office.

318
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:03,150
Thanks to that movie,
everyone likes her now.

319
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,519
She became the symbol of first love.

320
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:06,019
The symbol of first love?

321
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:08,960
- No way.
- I watched the movie last week.

322
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,390
- No way.
- I watched the movie last week.

323
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,400
Hey, the movie was pretty good.

324
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,200
It's entertaining.

325
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,799
And it's artistic.

326
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:18,400
And Ha Jin's acting in the movie
was pretty good.

327
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,670
Halfway through the movie,
she cries...

328
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,210
and delivers a monologue.

329
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:24,269
I read it in an interview...

330
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,910
that she came up with the monologue
herself at the shoot.

331
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:29,650
I'm sure you watched it.
What did you think?

332
00:18:30,049 --> 00:18:31,880
- I didn't watch it yet.
- Hey!

333
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,920
She startled me.

334
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:36,750
Enjoy your meal.

335
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,460
You still haven't watched it?

336
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,759
You'd better watch it soon.

337
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:41,230
You have to watch the movie...

338
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:43,130
if you're going to interview
the director.

339
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,230
Hey. Anyway,

340
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:50,170
the interview with the director
is a done deal.

341
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:53,599
And bring Ha Jin up in a subtle
manner during the interview.

342
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:54,769
You know what I mean, right?

343
00:18:54,769 --> 00:18:58,509
People go like this and cringe,
but they enjoy hearing about them.

344
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,150
Seriously.

345
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:03,980
What happened to the righteous
reporter, full of conviction?

346
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:06,779
You became a materialistic director
who only cares about the ratings.

347
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:08,119
Hey, put yourself in my shoes.

348
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:09,990
You can't just ignore
the TV ratings.

349
00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:14,119
Look at the time. Hey,
this materialistic director...

350
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:16,329
is leaving because she has
a meeting with the higher-ups.

351
00:19:16,329 --> 00:19:17,900
Finish your meal.

352
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,480
It's a promotion for the movie.

353
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,289
Why does she want to cook
and pack meal boxes?

354
00:19:41,289 --> 00:19:43,250
Other actors and actresses
will just hold a signing event.

355
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,589
So this is what
you want to make, right?

356
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,029
(Ingredients: Eggs, cheeses...)

357
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,539
But I thought
she wasn't a good cook.

358
00:19:59,539 --> 00:20:02,009
That's an overstatement.
She's an awful cook.

359
00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:04,140
When she cooks,
even ramyeon doesn't taste good.

360
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,740
Then, how is she going to make this?

361
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,380
And she'll make 100 meal boxes.

362
00:20:08,509 --> 00:20:10,680
- I did it.
- Are you already done?

363
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,180
No, I separated the yolk.

364
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,650
- Look at this.
- Just one?

365
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,450
I can't watch this.

366
00:20:18,019 --> 00:20:19,990
I'll take care of the eggs.
You do something else.

367
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:22,930
But I promised to make them.
Is that okay?

368
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,400
You can make the rolled omelets
and decorate them.

369
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,930
We don't have much time left.

370
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:35,710
You're really good.

371
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,309
Let me try it. Go away.

372
00:20:37,309 --> 00:20:39,740
No, why don't you drizzle
the cooking oil on the pan?

373
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,210
You know you have
to preheat it, right?

374
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:43,609
Don't drizzle too much.
And be careful with the fire. Okay?

375
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:45,819
Be careful with the knife.
And don't get hurt.

376
00:20:45,819 --> 00:20:46,980
Go away.

377
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,180
I did it.

378
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:20,220
Already? You made 100 of them?

379
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,190
No, just one.

380
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:26,319
What? Okay. Just one?

381
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:28,829
Don't open it. Or the decoration
will get messy.

382
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:32,460
Oh, no.

383
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,069
- We're late. You must change now.
- What?

384
00:21:35,069 --> 00:21:36,500
What about the rest?

385
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,900
I want to do more than giving
them autographs.

386
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,339
You should do what you're good at.

387
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:40,599
Give them autographs
and take photos with them.

388
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:42,769
Your fans would prefer that
over a bad meal box.

389
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:45,240
That's right. If you prepare a lot,

390
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,609
there's a lot of pressure
on the next person.

391
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:48,150
- Let's wash up.
- Is that so?

392
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:50,480
Let's give that one to the fan
who watched my movie the most.

393
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,849
- Sure. Do whatever you want.
- She's so pretty!

394
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,480
- She's so beautiful!
- Ha Jin is so pretty.

395
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,150
She took a photo with me.

396
00:21:56,289 --> 00:21:59,089
- Come here.
- She's such a beauty.

397
00:21:59,089 --> 00:22:01,259
- I can't believe this.
- She's so pretty.

398
00:22:04,259 --> 00:22:06,930
My goodness.
It was a long wait, wasn't it?

399
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,029
Here you go. Thank you, little one.

400
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:12,069
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you.

401
00:22:12,069 --> 00:22:13,839
You're so pretty!

402
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:16,509
you're prettier than Elsa.

403
00:22:16,509 --> 00:22:17,740
Thank you.

404
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,210
Let's go, Joo Hee.

405
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,680
No! I don't want to go.

406
00:22:22,609 --> 00:22:25,279
Listen to Mommy. People
are waiting in line to see her.

407
00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:28,490
I'm not leaving!
I'm going to stay here.

408
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:32,490
My goodness. What should I do?

409
00:22:33,259 --> 00:22:35,990
Oh, right. Do you want a present?

410
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,990
There's only one of this
in this world.

411
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:41,259
But in return, you have to
listen to your mom. Okay?

412
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,500
Ha Kyung, where's the meal box?

413
00:22:45,269 --> 00:22:46,269
Where is it?

414
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,000
- She's so pretty.
- I can't wait.

415
00:22:49,339 --> 00:22:50,410
You'll give this to her?

416
00:22:50,609 --> 00:22:51,779
Think carefully about this.

417
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:53,039
Okay.

418
00:22:58,579 --> 00:22:59,880
All right.

419
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,190
Ta-da. Open it.

420
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,450
Thank you, Ha Jin.

421
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,160
Let's open up the present
she gave you.

422
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,160
All right. 1, 2, 3.

423
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:10,160
Isn't it cute?

424
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:15,500
Mom, why is Pengsoo bleeding?

425
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,339
You're right. Pengsoo is bleeding.

426
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:21,440
The box must have shaken
on our way here. I'm sorry.

427
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,640
Okay. It's all right.
Let's go, Joo Hee.

428
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,279
All right. Take this.

429
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:27,410
Bye.

430
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:29,180
Bye.

431
00:23:29,549 --> 00:23:30,980
Next. You can come now.

432
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:32,450
I made this myself.

433
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:34,579
My gosh, thank you.

434
00:23:34,819 --> 00:23:35,950
Goodness.

435
00:23:36,019 --> 00:23:37,849
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you.

436
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:39,190
Go home safe.

437
00:23:40,589 --> 00:23:41,759
- Hello.
- Jeong Hoon.

438
00:23:42,329 --> 00:23:43,589
Isn't that Ha Jin?

439
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,569
The couple of the century
is right here.

440
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:51,799
She's doing it here because of
the variety show she's on.

441
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:54,569
Why don't you go and say hello?

442
00:23:54,569 --> 00:23:56,210
She's only a few steps away
from our station.

443
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:58,069
It'd be disappointing to leave
without saying hello.

444
00:23:58,069 --> 00:23:59,279
Stop it.

445
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:05,250
My gosh. She's greeting
everyone with a smile.

446
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,420
She's such a professional.

447
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,089
Your girlfriend is amazing.

448
00:24:09,589 --> 00:24:10,650
Let's just go.

449
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,390
- Ha Jin, give me an autograph!
- You're so pretty!

450
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:18,900
- We love you!
- Bye!

451
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,299
- You're so pretty!
- Thank you.

452
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:23,900
Should I give Jeong Hoon a call?

453
00:24:24,269 --> 00:24:26,599
Ha Jin, you're full of energy.
Aren't you even tired?

454
00:24:26,769 --> 00:24:28,369
His office is
right around the corner.

455
00:24:28,569 --> 00:24:29,970
Chul, how long do we have
until the next one?

456
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,309
We must go now.

457
00:24:31,309 --> 00:24:32,410
Do we even have time to eat?

458
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:34,140
- There's no time to even breathe.
- Let's go now.

459
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,809
But still. Give me my phone.

460
00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:00,599
Mom! Dad! A guy asked me out!

461
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:02,539
He asked me out!

462
00:25:02,539 --> 00:25:04,809
My gosh, he's handsome.

463
00:25:04,809 --> 00:25:05,910
- My gosh.
- What do you think?

464
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:08,849
- He looks nice.
- Come on. No, he doesn't.

465
00:25:08,849 --> 00:25:10,980
- I'm way too pretty for him.
- You brat.

466
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:14,279
- Hey, Tae Eun.
- Hey.

467
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:16,319
- Sit down. Let's eat.
- Okay.

468
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:18,619
I barely get to see you these days.

469
00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:20,289
- Are you dating a girl too?
- No.

470
00:25:20,289 --> 00:25:21,829
Why are you suddenly asking me that?

471
00:25:21,829 --> 00:25:24,529
Jeong Hoon is dating a girl.

472
00:25:24,529 --> 00:25:26,230
And everyone knows it.

473
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,759
Had I known he was available,

474
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:30,170
I should have told him
about my feelings.

475
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,869
I had a crush on him
ever since I was little.

476
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:37,470
Really? You should have told me.

477
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:38,880
I didn't know. You hid it well.

478
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,849
Stop talking nonsense.

479
00:25:41,849 --> 00:25:44,750
- You can't date him.
- Why not?

480
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,380
He's a good guy, isn't he?

481
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,190
When I tell you that you can't,
you just can't.

482
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:51,789
Is it because of his condition?

483
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:55,359
But he's all right now.

484
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:56,359
"All right"?

485
00:25:57,029 --> 00:25:58,599
He may seem all right
on the outside,

486
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:00,400
but he's still a patient.

487
00:26:00,829 --> 00:26:02,099
He's not normal.

488
00:26:02,569 --> 00:26:05,839
He's living with a time bomb
that could go off any minute.

489
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:09,539
But he got a lot better
thanks to you.

490
00:26:09,809 --> 00:26:13,109
He's strong.
I'm sure he can handle it.

491
00:26:13,109 --> 00:26:14,609
Don't worry too much.

492
00:26:14,609 --> 00:26:16,480
You call yourself a doctor.

493
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,549
But how could you say
something irresponsible like that?

494
00:26:18,549 --> 00:26:20,319
He's your patient.

495
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:22,319
He's not your friend.

496
00:26:22,619 --> 00:26:24,750
Can't you do your job right?

497
00:26:25,259 --> 00:26:26,819
If you won't treat him,
just be his friend.

498
00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:28,930
Don't be his doctor.

499
00:26:29,289 --> 00:26:32,730
My goodness.
The food is getting cold.

500
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:34,970
I take it back.
I take back what I said.

501
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:36,500
How is it? Is it seasoned well?

502
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,900
- It's nice.
- Okay.

503
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:40,599
- It's perfectly seasoned.
- Yes.

504
00:26:52,849 --> 00:26:54,049
We're here.

505
00:26:55,349 --> 00:26:56,950
Wake up. We're home.

506
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:59,589
Okay. Which show is this?

507
00:26:59,589 --> 00:27:01,160
No shows. We're at home.

508
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,829
Let's go in and sleep on our beds.

509
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:03,890
Okay.

510
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,200
- My gosh.
- Hurry.

511
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,940
Close the door for me.

512
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:17,569
Hey, where are you?
Why aren't you home?

513
00:27:18,309 --> 00:27:19,410
What do you mean?

514
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,410
Are you at my place again?

515
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:24,049
Of course.

516
00:27:24,049 --> 00:27:25,849
The fried chicken is getting cold.
Come home quickly.

517
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:27,650
Do I run a fried chicken joint
at home?

518
00:27:27,819 --> 00:27:30,319
Why are you always eating
fried chicken at my house?

519
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,819
I can't go home right away.

520
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:34,259
I'm at a movie theater.

521
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:37,230
A movie? Which movie
are you going to watch?

522
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:38,900
"My First Love".

523
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:41,329
Next week's guest is
Ji Hyun Geun, the director.

524
00:27:41,329 --> 00:27:44,170
So did you go to the movies
by yourself?

525
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:46,269
- Yes.
- You should have told me sooner.

526
00:27:46,269 --> 00:27:47,440
I could have gone with you.

527
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,470
Two guys watching a movie
late at night?

528
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,309
Not just any movie, a romance movie?

529
00:27:51,309 --> 00:27:53,009
Just the thought of that
makes me shudder.

530
00:27:53,009 --> 00:27:54,839
Yes. That doesn't sound fun.

531
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:56,680
Will you be okay?

532
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:58,880
If people spot you,
they'll talk about this.

533
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,420
I'm wearing a cap, so I'll be fine.

534
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,750
What about Ha Jin? Has she called?

535
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:06,119
No.

536
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,789
And she'll never contact me again.

537
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:13,160
I thought I sounded like
a bit of a lunatic too.

538
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:15,029
Okay.

539
00:28:15,829 --> 00:28:19,539
Hey, right.
I heard Ji Won used to like you.

540
00:28:19,539 --> 00:28:20,599
She did?

541
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,710
Why is it in the past tense?
She doesn't like me anymore?

542
00:28:25,109 --> 00:28:26,809
You're insane.

543
00:28:28,509 --> 00:28:30,049
Did you go home today?

544
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:33,079
Yes, my mother told me
to stop by for dinner.

545
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:35,150
Is Professor Yoo still the same?

546
00:28:35,349 --> 00:28:37,119
He's always the same.

547
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:39,990
He still doesn't approve of his son.

548
00:28:40,289 --> 00:28:42,960
Is that why you're
getting depressed at my place?

549
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:46,359
Yes, I'm pathetically depressed.

550
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:51,029
So? Do you want me to
cancel the movie and go home?

551
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:53,000
Forget it. Get lost.

552
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:55,339
I'm going to sleep
after another can of beer.

553
00:28:55,339 --> 00:28:56,710
Don't wake me when you're back home.

554
00:29:04,849 --> 00:29:06,549
Don't run. We're late anyway.

555
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:08,150
It's because of you.

556
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:12,089
This is the evacuation plan
in case of an emergency.

557
00:29:12,089 --> 00:29:14,519
For your safe experience,

558
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:16,259
make sure you check
where the emergency lights...

559
00:29:16,259 --> 00:29:17,390
and the nearest exit...

560
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:19,859
Let's see. Is this it? Row K?

561
00:29:19,859 --> 00:29:21,759
- K? Is this it?
- Is this it?

562
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:24,269
- No, it's the one behind.
- Darn it. This isn't it.

563
00:29:24,269 --> 00:29:25,569
She has no eyes.

564
00:29:25,569 --> 00:29:27,769
- Just sit there, okay?
- Please exit safely...

565
00:29:27,769 --> 00:29:28,769
What was that?

566
00:29:28,769 --> 00:29:31,009
I have to go to the restroom.

567
00:29:31,009 --> 00:29:33,140
Again? It's probably a disease.

568
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,349
- This is the 3rd time.
- The 3rd time?

569
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:43,019
What is this? Is that really
Yeo Ha Jin? She's so pretty.

570
00:29:43,019 --> 00:29:45,420
I told you. She's like a goddess.

571
00:29:45,819 --> 00:29:46,819
Seriously.

572
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,789
I can see why
Lee Jeong Hoon fell for her.

573
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:52,559
I hate Lee Jeong Hoon.
He's kind of cheesy.

574
00:29:53,029 --> 00:29:54,529
You're cheesy too.

575
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,630
- Do you want to die?
- Be quiet.

576
00:29:58,369 --> 00:30:00,000
You laughed too.

577
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,240
Just watch the movie, will you?

578
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:04,640
Look at her.

579
00:30:09,109 --> 00:30:10,779
Look at you.

580
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:13,779
I told you to get changed.
Why are you sleeping here?

581
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:17,250
And why are you eating chips
at this hour? Confiscated.

582
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:18,859
Why? What's this shooting?

583
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:20,420
We aren't shooting anything.
We're at home.

584
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,420
Right.

585
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,589
We have nothing tomorrow morning,
so go get a good sleep.

586
00:30:25,299 --> 00:30:26,299
My phone.

587
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,529
Where's my phone?

588
00:30:30,269 --> 00:30:31,269
Here.

589
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,109
You should just give him a call.

590
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:39,480
No. It's better not to call him.

591
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,539
If he doesn't pick up,
I'll feel even more pathetic.

592
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:43,380
Then just get over him.

593
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,710
You check your phone
for his call every day,

594
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:46,579
look miserable,
and watch the news every day too.

595
00:30:46,579 --> 00:30:49,990
You're the only one who watches
the news with such a sad face.

596
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,619
I really don't get it.

597
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:55,490
What's wrong with this guy?

598
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:58,730
He said I'm a good person.
He said he wants me to be happy.

599
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,230
Then he never wants to see me again.
So what's going on?

600
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,299
What is this?

601
00:31:02,299 --> 00:31:04,930
Gosh, that again.
You said that over 100 times.

602
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:07,569
It's because
I don't have the answer.

603
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:12,839
Just consider him insane
and forget about it.

604
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:15,180
You aren't the Yeo Ha Jin
you used to be.

605
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:18,509
You're now everyone's first love.
You have nothing to be sorry for.

606
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:22,150
It's just a phase
thanks to my movie.

607
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:23,519
That's a good attitude.

608
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:26,990
Do you think he watched my movie?

609
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:28,160
Why would he watch your movie?

610
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:32,200
I mean, people who hated me
began to like me after watching it.

611
00:31:32,529 --> 00:31:34,630
So? Do you think
he will fall for you...

612
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:36,500
after he watches the movie?

613
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,529
Yes.

614
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:39,000
Don't get hopeful.

615
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,470
If he watched your movie
after turning you down many times,

616
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:43,069
that means he's really crazy.

617
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,180
It was too much for me.

618
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:50,380
It was too tough.

619
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:54,779
I couldn't breathe.

620
00:31:58,119 --> 00:31:59,390
I was too scared...

621
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:04,630
all of the times
I'll have to spend...

622
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:08,259
without you.

623
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,440
Could I forget about you now?

624
00:32:19,609 --> 00:32:21,279
I know I'm shameless,

625
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,450
but could I...

626
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:31,220
forget you and move on?

627
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:35,329
I can't even imagine
how she must be feeling.

628
00:32:36,589 --> 00:32:38,960
Living a life
without precious memories.

629
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,099
Which one of us is more pitiful?

630
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:46,240
Me who can't forget my memories
for the rest of my life?

631
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,940
Or Ha Jin who had to forget
her memories to live?
