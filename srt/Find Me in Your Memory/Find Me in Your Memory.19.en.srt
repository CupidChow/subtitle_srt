1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,480
(Episode 19)

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,780
Hello?

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:07,349
Goodness, Director Song!

4
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:08,810
One second.

5
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:10,650
What's the occasion?

6
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:12,779
Wow, it has been so long.

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,349
You can hop in first. Go ahead.

8
00:00:16,589 --> 00:00:18,620
It's always the same with us.

9
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:40,750
Ms. Park will be here
after that phone call.

10
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:45,780
Okay, sure.

11
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:48,090
What is this?

12
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,590
Stop that car!

13
00:00:50,689 --> 00:00:52,560
You have to get that car!

14
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,289
- No!
- Wait!

15
00:00:54,289 --> 00:00:56,799
Who do you think you are?

16
00:00:56,899 --> 00:00:59,259
Ha Jin!

17
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,140
Anchor Lee.

18
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,879
Hey. Are you with Ha Jin?

19
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:14,549
I can't get a hold of her.

20
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:16,849
She...

21
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,450
She just got abducted.

22
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:22,819
What?

23
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:29,790
(Find Me in Your Memory)

24
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:45,609
Ha Kyung.

25
00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:47,609
Anchor Lee.

26
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:50,250
What's the situation?

27
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,049
Her phone was turned off
right after the situation broke out,

28
00:01:53,049 --> 00:01:54,150
so we can't track her.

29
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,689
What about her location?

30
00:01:55,689 --> 00:01:57,290
We're tracking down that car.

31
00:01:58,019 --> 00:02:00,459
Are we yet to find out who did this?

32
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:03,159
We found a security camera nearby
and are looking into it,

33
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:04,930
but we'll have to see.

34
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:07,769
And the current suspects,
Ji Hyun Geun and Moon Chul.

35
00:02:07,769 --> 00:02:09,469
We're looking for there whereabouts,

36
00:02:09,469 --> 00:02:11,039
but they're both unreachable.

37
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,639
Goodness, Ha Jin.

38
00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:15,969
- Yes?
- What will happen to her?

39
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:17,379
You found the car?

40
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,740
Where is it?

41
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,550
- Did you find anything?
- Over here.

42
00:02:33,729 --> 00:02:35,729
I think he changed cars here
and ran away.

43
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,199
Hey. Sir!

44
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,199
What is it?

45
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:42,870
Darn it.

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Hey.

47
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:49,439
He found a place
with no security camera,

48
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:51,439
prepared another car to run away in,

49
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:53,139
and even used anesthetics?

50
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:55,750
This jerk had this planned.

51
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:56,849
Take this.

52
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,930
- Yes.
- Where are you?

53
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:11,560
Do you know what time it is?
Why aren't you at work?

54
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,240
Come in.

55
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,840
What's going on?
Are you coming in just now?

56
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:29,909
Mr. Kim has been
looking for you everywhere.

57
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,819
I have something to tell you.

58
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:34,120
What's going on? What is it?

59
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,189
Something happened to Ha Jin.

60
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,719
I think she was
abducted by her stalker.

61
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:42,129
What?

62
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,960
Are you saying
Ha Jin is abducted right now?

63
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,900
The police are investigating this
behind closed doors.

64
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,330
How long has it been?

65
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,539
Do you have any information?

66
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:52,939
They're still investigating.

67
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:54,710
And they don't know
her location yet?

68
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:56,469
No.

69
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:00,849
Okay, I understand.

70
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,210
Don't worry about the news and go.

71
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,550
- I'm sorry.
- Hey.

72
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,289
I told you to hurry over.
Why are you here?

73
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:10,319
- Do you think I'm a joke?
- That's enough!

74
00:04:10,689 --> 00:04:12,490
Why do you always tell me to stop?

75
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,889
What's with you two?

76
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:15,229
I told you to stop.

77
00:04:16,129 --> 00:04:18,199
- What's wrong?
- Hurry up and go.

78
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:19,629
Yes, ma'am.

79
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:23,769
What's going on?

80
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,269
What is it?

81
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,970
Shouldn't he be preparing
for the news?

82
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:30,170
Jeong Hoon won't be able
to read the news today,

83
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,480
so tell Reporter Cha to do it.

84
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,350
I'm his team leader!

85
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,910
So why can't you tell me
why he can't do it?

86
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,279
Actually,

87
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:41,850
Ha Jin was abducted by her stalker.

88
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,290
- What?
- The police is investigating it...

89
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,660
behind the closed doors,
so we'll have to wait and see.

90
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:50,089
Darn it! What kind of a lunatic
would do something like that?

91
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,750
Really? Okay, I'll call you back.

92
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,050
- Sir.
- Yes?

93
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:45,420
Moon Chul lied about
having a drink with a friend...

94
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,389
on the day
of the motorcycle accident.

95
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:48,389
What?

96
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:50,290
He wasn't picking up his phone
since yesterday.

97
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,420
I just talked to that friend,

98
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,230
and he said the last time
the two met was over a week ago.

99
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,790
Darn it. I knew
something was fishy about him.

100
00:05:58,129 --> 00:06:00,870
I think it was his doing.

101
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,000
Hold on.

102
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,240
It's Ji Hyun Geun.

103
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:08,610
Hello?

104
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:11,610
I just got in touch
with Ji Hyun Geun.

105
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:15,449
According to him, he was
at his studio since last night.

106
00:06:15,649 --> 00:06:17,149
I'm going there right now to check.

107
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,089
We're sorry for disturbing you
when you must be busy.

108
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:23,220
Thank you for your cooperation.

109
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,259
Not at all.
I'm sorry I didn't pick up sooner.

110
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,189
I'll answer my phone on time
from now on,

111
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:29,329
so call me
whenever you need my help.

112
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:31,399
- Okay.
- Goodbye.

113
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,240
How did it go?

114
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:47,910
We looked around,

115
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:49,509
but we couldn't find
anything suspicious.

116
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,579
I see.

117
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:55,449
It's become highly likely
that Moon Chul is the culprit.

118
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:59,120
Once we dig deeper,
we'll be able to find a lead.

119
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,689
- So please be patient.
- Okay.

120
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:04,129
Did you not receive
any suspicious calls?

121
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,800
No, I didn't.

122
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:10,430
If you do receive any in the future,

123
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,040
please let us know.

124
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:13,470
All right. I'll do that.

125
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,310
- All right. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

126
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,300
Stop.

127
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:44,540
I got you, you rat.

128
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,899
Isn't this enough evidence?

129
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:49,610
Request for an emergency warrant...

130
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:50,939
and put out an APB for Moon Chul.

131
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:52,879
Find out which way he drove...

132
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,310
and get his credit card activity.

133
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,310
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

134
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,120
Ha Kyung.

135
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:00,819
Ms. Park.

136
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,019
Are you okay?
Do you want some water?

137
00:08:06,089 --> 00:08:08,860
Did the police call?

138
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,100
No.

139
00:08:18,269 --> 00:08:19,439
Hello, detective.

140
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:23,170
Chul was at the scene?

141
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,709
Are you saying he's the culprit?

142
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:32,320
Okay, I'll be waiting for your call.
Goodbye.

143
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:37,019
Is it Chul?
Did he really abduct her?

144
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:39,490
They're not certain yet.

145
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,990
They're going
to search his house first.

146
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:44,559
Oh, dear. Poor Ha Jin.

147
00:08:45,429 --> 00:08:47,100
She must be terrified.

148
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:45,389
- Open it.
- Yes, sir.

149
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,269
There's no one here.

150
00:09:54,429 --> 00:09:56,169
I think it's been vacant
for some time.

151
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:00,200
What? These are all luxury items.

152
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:01,669
Really?

153
00:10:01,669 --> 00:10:03,740
I'm sure managers don't earn
hefty wages.

154
00:10:04,409 --> 00:10:06,080
- Did you find anything?
- No, sir.

155
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,149
What is this?

156
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,019
What is this?

157
00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:17,490
What? It's an earring.

158
00:11:26,789 --> 00:11:27,929
Don't you know me?

159
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:32,159
We met several times with Seo Yeon.

160
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:36,429
Who is this? Why are you
answering Seo Yeon's phone?

161
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,370
Jeong Hoon, save me.

162
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,539
- Save me, Jeong Hoon!
- Are you okay, Seo Yeon?

163
00:11:41,539 --> 00:11:43,470
- Jeong Hoon!
- Seo Yeon?

164
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,440
Please get yourself together,
Seo Yeon!

165
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:46,779
You scumbag.

166
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:48,879
Jeong Hoon.

167
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:50,820
This is all your fault.

168
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,820
Seo Yeon changed all because of you.

169
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:58,460
It's all your fault, Lee Jeong Hoon!

170
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:12,370
Hey, Tae Eun.

171
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,809
Are you saying her stalker
mimicked Moon Seong Ho?

172
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,549
I think he became more aggressive
as he met with Moon Seong Ho.

173
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,620
Had it not been for me,
he would've never known about him.

174
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:30,820
Then none of this would've happened.

175
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,289
Don't blame yourself.

176
00:12:32,289 --> 00:12:33,559
Even if you weren't involved,

177
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:35,190
scumbags like him
would've found a way.

178
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:38,029
You're also a victim,
so don't be ridiculous.

179
00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:41,899
Didn't you say the police
were after her manager?

180
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:45,100
Now that they know their target,
he'll get caught soon.

181
00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:48,940
There's something unsettling
about Director Ji.

182
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,039
What do you mean?

183
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,879
It's hard to explain.

184
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:56,179
But I've always felt this way.

185
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,649
He reminds me of Moon Seong Ho.

186
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:04,590
After seeing Moon Seong Ho recently,
this feeling became even stronger.

187
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:06,289
Did you tell this to the police?

188
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:10,429
It's just a feeling that I have.

189
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:15,200
If all the evidence they found
point to Moon Chul,

190
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,730
then he must be the culprit.

191
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:22,039
Is this Ms. Yeo's earring?

192
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:24,279
Are you looking for something?

193
00:13:24,409 --> 00:13:26,039
I can't find the other one.

194
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:27,580
Didn't you keep them together?

195
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:29,679
I thought I did,
but I can't find one of them.

196
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:33,419
This would've been perfect.

197
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:37,450
Yes, it is. She lost it a while ago.

198
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,090
We found it at Moon Chul's place.

199
00:13:40,789 --> 00:13:43,490
He must've been sneaking
into your house for some time now.

200
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,669
We were like family,
so it must've been easy.

201
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:50,200
He knew the passcode as well.

202
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,870
How dare he?

203
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,909
Ma'am.

204
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:59,110
Is there anything you know
about his family...

205
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,149
or his close friends?

206
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,250
Do you know whom he'd visit
during this situation?

207
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,549
He said his parents lived
in Gangwon Province.

208
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,549
He said it was a very rural area
and that I wouldn't know.

209
00:14:10,419 --> 00:14:12,490
He could be hiding there.

210
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:16,129
Call his parents and ask
if he has contacted them recently.

211
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,230
Yes, sir.

212
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:30,309
Don't get the wrong idea.

213
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:33,539
Seo Yeon loves me.

214
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,879
(Don't get the wrong idea.
Ha Jin loves me.)

215
00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:39,019
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

- Yes.
- This is Lee Jeong Hoon.

224
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:57,360
When you recently
questioned Director Ji,

225
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,899
are you sure he said he only stayed
in his studio as he was working?

226
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:00,960
Yes, he did.

227
00:16:01,769 --> 00:16:03,429
I stumbled across something
that doesn't make sense.

228
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:06,200
You don't need to worry
about Director Ji anymore.

229
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,240
- What?
- We located the culprit.

230
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,240
Her agent, Moon Chul,
is the culprit.

231
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:13,080
I can't explain to you
in detail right now.

232
00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:16,450
Anyway, we just located him
and we are on our way there now.

233
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:18,620
Did you locate Ha Jin?

234
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,879
Moon Chul who was on the run
called his cousin...

235
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:22,220
who lives in Gangwon Province...

236
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,990
and asked his cousin
to reserve a vacation rental.

237
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:26,789
I think he'll probably go there
with the abducted victim.

238
00:16:26,789 --> 00:16:28,389
Where is that? I'll meet you there.

239
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:29,389
No.

240
00:16:29,929 --> 00:16:32,230
Your presence
might provoke the culprit.

241
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:34,600
Trust us on this and wait, please.

242
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:36,299
Okay.

243
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:08,230
You, go into the house.
And we'll go to the other side.

244
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,559
Open it.

245
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:43,329
Moon Chul.

246
00:17:44,569 --> 00:17:46,369
Freeze. Don't move.

247
00:17:46,369 --> 00:17:47,670
Look for Yeo Ha Jin first.

248
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,470
- Search the house.
- Hey, check upstairs too!

249
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,589
- What's that?
- My gosh.

250
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:08,660
- She's not here.
- No?

251
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:11,029
- What about upstairs?
- She's not there either.

252
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,730
I'm sorry.

253
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:19,569
Please let me off the hook
just this time. I'm sorry.

255

00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,769

264
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:06,650
Put him in the van now.

Hey.

274

Ha Jin, you're awake.

275
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,259
It was you, Director Ji?

276
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:21,730
Were you the one who sent
the threatening letters,

277
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,960
broke into my house,

278
00:20:25,059 --> 00:20:26,930
and tried to run over Ha Kyung
on a motorcycle?

279
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,799
It was all your doing?

280
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:31,440
You must have a headache
because of the drug.

281
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,069
Don't strain yourself, Ha Jin.

282
00:20:34,339 --> 00:20:36,769
How could you do this to me?

283
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,509
You must be very angry, Ha Jin.

284
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,210
First, why don't you eat some food?

285
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,920
Sit down.

286
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,349
Let's talk after you eat.

287
00:20:49,619 --> 00:20:51,019
Don't come near me.

288
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:53,759
Don't come near me.

289
00:20:53,859 --> 00:20:55,029
Don't come near me.

290
00:20:55,089 --> 00:20:56,529
That's dangerous.

291
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,200
- Don't do that.
- Don't come near me.

292
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:13,309
This isn't right.

293
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:17,509
This is not like you, Ha Jin.

294
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:21,650
You were always kind to me.

295
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,259
Weren't you?

296
00:21:35,769 --> 00:21:38,339
I prepared them because
I wanted you to have a proper meal.

297
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,599
Sadly, I should put them away.

298
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,740
They might be dangerous for you.

299
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,140
I'll bring other utensils.

300
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:48,880
I'll be back soon.
Sit down and wait for me.

301
00:21:55,549 --> 00:21:56,549
Right.

302
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,460
Ha Jin.

303
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:02,029
Happy birthday.

304
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,559

a proper party later. Okay?

Oh, you mean Yeo Ha Jin's stalker?

308
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:17,569
I don't know.

309
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:20,599
We just exchanged a few letters.
That's all.

310
00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:30,109
I gave him all the hints.

311
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:37,250
I wonder if he understood them.

312
00:23:47,529 --> 00:23:48,829
So...

313
00:23:49,069 --> 00:23:52,200
you don't know
where Ms. Yeo Ha Jin is, correct?

314
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,769
What happened?

315
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:57,240
Did you locate Director Ji?

316
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,980
No one is at the studio.

317
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,640
But he canceled his appointment
at the editing studio...

318
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,309
in the evening unilaterally.

319
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:05,849
How about this? Why don't
we disclose this to the public...

320
00:24:05,849 --> 00:24:08,119
and launch a nationwide manhunt
on Ji Hyun Geun?

321
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:09,119
No.

322
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:12,160
He's a famous celebrity
everyone knows.

323
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,589
If we publicly expose him that
he's a stalker and a kidnapper,

324
00:24:14,589 --> 00:24:17,130
I don't know what that crazy jerk
will do to Ha Jin.

325
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:18,359
She has a point.

326
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:20,859
- That's too dangerous.
- I understand that, but...

327
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,130
Man, this is driving me insane.

328
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:46,390
Yes, Anchor Lee.

329
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:48,230
I found out where Ji Hyun Geun is.

330
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,759
I think he's with Ha Jin.

331
00:24:50,859 --> 00:24:52,900
You found out where Ji Hyun Geun is?

332
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:56,470
I'll see what's going on
and try to stall for time.

333
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:57,529
Come as soon as you can.

334
00:25:07,809 --> 00:25:11,509
("Actress Yeo Ha Jin Abducted,
the Police Are Under Investigation")

335
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,789
So? What did you two talk about?

336
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:26,960
Wait, are you serious?

337
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:32,539
You really have
feelings for Yeo Ha Jin?

338
00:25:41,309 --> 00:25:43,950
Jeong Hoon, have you been well?

339
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:47,720
When you have some time,
can you stop by to get examined?

340
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,150
Why haven't you eaten?
Don't you have an appetite?

341
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:25,750
It probably got cold.
I'll make it again.

342
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,789
You can have this for now.

343
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,569
Ha Jin will soon find out...

344
00:27:45,339 --> 00:27:47,269
that you're human garbage,
Jeong Hoon.

345
00:27:59,619 --> 00:28:01,420
No one can keep us apart anymore,

346
00:28:02,819 --> 00:28:03,920
Ha Jin.

347
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:12,200
What is this?

348
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:20,940
A blackout?

349
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:22,869
You little...

350
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,640
Darn it.

351
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,549
Why are you here?
How did you know we were here?

352
00:29:43,789 --> 00:29:44,849
You lunatic.

353
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:47,819
No matter what you do
and how much you try,

354
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:49,690
you will never lay a finger on her.

355
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:53,359
You're the one who's insane.

356
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:55,029
You couldn't get over
your dead girlfriend...

357
00:29:55,029 --> 00:29:57,400
and began to
hit on her friend, Ha Jin.

358
00:29:57,569 --> 00:29:59,400
Stop pretending
like you're so great!

359
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:21,960
Over here, I'm locked up in here.
Over here!

360
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,200
Darn it, you.

361
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:38,710
How dare you mess with my plan?
How dare you?

362
00:30:38,809 --> 00:30:41,180
This is a place
only for me and Ha Jin.

363
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:44,049
This isn't a place
where jerks like you can show up!

364
00:30:46,349 --> 00:30:48,220
Come here. Come.

365
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:07,400
Over here!

366
00:31:36,329 --> 00:31:39,200
Lee Jeong Hoon. Lee Jeong Hoon!

367
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,609
Come here, Lee Jeong Hoon!

368
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:46,279
Open this!

369
00:31:47,009 --> 00:31:48,680
Open this immediately!

370
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:54,650
How much longer will it take?

371
00:31:55,019 --> 00:31:56,119
We'll be there soon.

372
00:31:56,589 --> 00:31:58,150
Could you go a little faster?

373
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,190
Sure.

374
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:03,359
Is anybody here?

375
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,529
Over here!

376
00:32:08,829 --> 00:32:09,829
Ha Jin!

377
00:32:10,569 --> 00:32:11,569
Anchor Lee.

378
00:32:12,269 --> 00:32:13,269
Ha Jin.

379
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,170
Anchor Lee, I'm in here.

380
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:16,509
Give me a moment.

381
00:32:26,019 --> 00:32:27,079
Ha Jin.

382
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,549
Are you hurt?

383
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:31,450
Anchor Lee.

384
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:37,259
Thank you.

385
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:39,930
Thank you for staying safe.

386
00:32:49,109 --> 00:32:51,769
We have to get out of here.
We don't know when he'll be here.

387
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,910
He can't come.

388
00:32:54,579 --> 00:32:55,849
Don't worry.

389
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,980
Look at your face, Anchor Lee.

390
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:05,990
I'm fine.

391
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,460
Can you walk?

392
00:33:10,529 --> 00:33:11,529
Yes.

393
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:12,829
Let's go.
