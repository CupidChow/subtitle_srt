1
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,679
It's really great weather.

2
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,050
Have you been well?

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,119
Are you feeling all right?

4
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:15,390
(Episode 26)

5
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:19,260
I'm feeling okay.
As you can see, I'm doing well.

6
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,300
I wanted to see you
because I had to tell you something.

7
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:32,340
I thought about this a lot
and came to this decision,

8
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,869
so I hope
you could respect my decision.

9
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,579
Let's go back to the time...

10
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:43,420
when we weren't in any relationship,

11
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:46,079
no, when we didn't know each other.

12
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:52,020
It's not your fault.

13
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:55,789
It's just that
I can't stay by your side.

14
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:58,000
So let's stop here.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
No.

16
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,469
I can't do that.

17
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,870
I told you.

18
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,469
I love you very much.

19
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:11,980
I know it'll be really tough.

20
00:01:12,109 --> 00:01:13,849
I know that you'll need time.

21
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,079
So let's bear through this together.

22
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,849
I don't want to.

23
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:24,890
I don't want to be a bad person.

24
00:01:25,189 --> 00:01:26,829
What makes you a bad person?

25
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:29,890
Because of me, Seo Yeon...

26
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,000
Why is that because of you?

27
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,629
Her stalker is the one at fault,
not you.

28
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:38,769
You were only deceived too.

29
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,739
You are...

30
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:45,379
just another victim
who lost a precious friend to him.

31
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,579
You knew?

32
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,349
Yet you stayed by my side?

33
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,590
No one has any right to blame you.

34
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,829
So please don't be hard on yourself.

35
00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:04,829
Don't forgive me that easily.

36
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:09,370
That makes me feel
even sorrier for you...

37
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,870
and for Seo Yeon.

38
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:15,909
Don't worry about me anymore.

39
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,710
I can't make any rash decisions now.

40
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:24,080
I feel way too sorry for you
to do anything like that.

41
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,650
I'll be very busy from now on.

42
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:34,090
I probably can't stop myself
from thinking about you,

43
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:38,199
but I'll try my best.

44
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,300
So let's stop here.

45
00:02:48,009 --> 00:02:49,069
Ha Jin.

46
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,509
You promised...

47
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,719
never to say goodbye.

48
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,590
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,460
I don't think I can keep my promise.

50
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,090
Ms. Park, you're here.

51
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:39,860
Where's Ha Jin?

52
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:41,560
She's in her room,

53
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,960
but she must be asleep.
She has been pretty quiet.

54
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:45,830
Is she all right?

55
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,400
I'm not sure.
She looks fine on the outside,

56
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,939
but that makes me feel
even more nervous.

57
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:53,810
I feel so bad for our dear Ha Jin.

58
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:56,270
I'm sorry we ended up
making you worried too.

59
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,939
Don't be sorry.

60
00:03:57,939 --> 00:04:00,009
It's not like
I didn't know about this.

61
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:03,849
You already told me everything
about Ha Jin from the beginning.

62
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,389
That's when I realized
how much you love her...

63
00:04:08,389 --> 00:04:10,520
and how considerate you are.

64
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,889
You said you wanted her to be happy,

65
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:15,189
and you asked me
to make her into an actress...

66
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:17,629
because she's a person
who shines very brightly.

67
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,060
Thank you so much
for accepting her back then.

68
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,430
Don't say that.
I'm thankful for her.

69
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,839
I never thought of you two...

70
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:27,740
just as my business partners.

71
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,509
You seem like my daughters,

72
00:04:29,509 --> 00:04:31,379
so I'm always worried about you.

73
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:33,480
You two are both way too kind.

74
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:37,550
I thought you were asleep.

75
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:39,579
You're here, Ms. Park.

76
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:42,350
Hey, Ha Jin.
I brought some side dishes.

77
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:45,519
Ms. Park,
I have a favor to ask of you.

78
00:04:45,689 --> 00:04:47,060
Do you want to get some rest?

79
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,689
Yes, you probably should
get some rest for a while.

80
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,000
I'll keep your drama schedule,

81
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,769
but I'll drop everything else.

82
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,269
Can you get me more work?

83
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,740
I want to be extremely busy...

84
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,300
to not think of anything else.

85
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,560
We look so good.

86
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,970
This is unfair.

87
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:38,540
Why am I always home alone?

88
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,360
There you go again.

89
00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:55,730
You're not picking up.

90
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,649
What time is it?

91
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,319
(Jo Il Kwon)

92
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:24,389
I'm in front of your house.
I'll be waiting until you come out.

93
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,910
Why did you come all the way here?

94
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:52,879
What took you so long?
I thought you weren't coming.

95
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:03,129
Did I do something wrong?

96
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,569
If I did, tell me.
I promise I can change.

97
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,740
They say people don't change easily,
but I'm different.

98
00:07:11,569 --> 00:07:12,740
I can change very easily.

99
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,139
What are you talking about?
You did nothing wrong.

100
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:19,209
Then...

101
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,079
If you've developed feelings
for someone else...

102
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,220
Don't go. I'll do better.

103
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:28,850
I'll work out much more.

104
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,089
It's not that.

105
00:07:30,089 --> 00:07:31,689
Then what's wrong?

106
00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:33,620
You neither pick up my calls
nor reply to my texts.

107
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,529
You say you're too busy to meet.

108
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:36,660
About that...

109
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:39,360
I'm sorry.

110
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,899
Do you not like me anymore?

111
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:44,439
That's definitely not true.

112
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,209
Something just...

113
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,009
came up.

114
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:54,610
I had no idea.

115
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,009
Is everything okay?

116
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:01,389
She's fine. She's smiling again.

117
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:02,850
She's working hard as well.

118
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:04,860
But I feel anxious.

119
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,060
I'm afraid she's crying
on the inside.

120
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:12,100
No. I'm asking about you.
Are you okay?

121
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,199
What?

122
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:18,800
It must've been tough.

123
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,540
I'm fine. Ha Jin's the one
who had it rough.

124
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,379
My suffering is nothing
compared to hers.

125
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:32,279
I'm sure she and Jeong Hoon
are both having a rough time.

126
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:35,690
But I'm worried about you the most.

127
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,460
You matter the most to me.

128
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:43,389
You must've kept this
all to yourself up until now.

129
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,259
I'm sure you were suffering.

130
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:52,340
Tell me whenever you're going
through a rough patch.

131
00:08:53,139 --> 00:08:54,610
I want to be there for you.

132
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:58,909
Okay.

133
00:08:59,909 --> 00:09:00,980
Okay.

134
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:05,379
Shall we cheer ourselves up
with something tasty?

135
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:07,889
I'm not hungry.
I'm not craving anything.

136
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:12,090
Then shall we have a drink,
your favorite?

137
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:14,429
You can't even drink well.
No, thanks.

138
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,759
This won't do. Follow me.

139
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:19,299
- Why?
- Hurry up.

140
00:09:19,299 --> 00:09:21,200
- Where are we going?
- Just follow me.

141
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:38,350
This is the best thing you can do
when you feel frustrated.

142
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,090
Shout until your throat gives out.

143
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,919
- What?
- Come on.

144
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:45,860
Look straight ahead
and shout for 10 seconds!

145
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:49,960
I can't do it.

146
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:00,200
Do it. It's really effective.

147
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,169
Ready, set, go.

148
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,710
What was that?
Were you calling out for someone?

149
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,649
Where's all that power you had
when you subdued me? Summon that.

150
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:12,649
- Okay?
- All right.

151
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:15,389
Okay. Let's do it once more.
Ready, set, go.

152
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:20,289
Jo Il Kwon! You're an idiot!

153
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:24,600
Why am I an idiot?

154
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:27,730
You're an even bigger idiot
than I am!

155
00:10:32,669 --> 00:10:35,769
- This is nice.
- Yes, it is.

156
00:10:57,629 --> 00:11:00,029
(You will understand me as well.)

157
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,700
(You should lose someone you love.)

158
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,470
(Don't kid yourself.)

159
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:10,710
(You will be punished.)

160

("Moon Seong Ho Has Run Away,
Possibility of Another Victim")

161
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:23,250
(Wanted: Escaped Prisoner)

162
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Hello, Father.

163
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:34,169
Are you busy?

164
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:35,570
I can talk.

165
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,639
I'm sorry about last time.

166
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:41,039
Don't drink too much.
You should take care of your body.

167
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:44,309
Okay. Are you all right?

168
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,480
Yes.

169
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,610
I'd like to meet...

170
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:51,480
your girlfriend.

171
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,419
Can you make some time?

172
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:57,320
Okay.

173
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,860
I'll call you again. Goodbye.

174
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,070
What is this for?

175
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:20,440
You seem exhausted these days.
It's on me.

176
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:22,679
Thanks.

177
00:12:24,549 --> 00:12:27,350
How is everything with Ha Kyung?

178
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,850
It's great.

179
00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:31,759
But we rarely meet these days,

180
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,690
thanks to Ha Jin.

181
00:12:34,929 --> 00:12:35,960
Right.

182
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:38,230
Anyway, thanks.

183
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,259
No problem.

184
00:12:56,649 --> 00:12:58,950
1, 2. Good. 1, 2.

185
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,789
That's good. 1, 2.

186
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:03,389
Good.

187
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,190
Great.

188
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:09,330
All right, then.
Let's change her clothes.

189
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,000
Don't I seem too stiff?
Should I smile?

190
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,470
No, I like it.
You look relaxed and charismatic.

191
00:13:24,009 --> 00:13:26,080
Can I see the previous photos?

192
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,080
Okay.

193
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,789
Can I have some water?

194
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,759
You haven't eaten anything.
Do you want some snacks?

195
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:44,960
Later.

196
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,700
Yu Jin, can I see the photos
you took back there?

197
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,730
Here you go.

198
00:13:56,909 --> 00:13:58,639
That was quick.

199
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,179
I'd like to change the concept
and incorporate some items.

200
00:14:02,179 --> 00:14:03,509
What do you think?

201
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,950
Since I'm a news anchor,
should I sit down?

202
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,220
That's brilliant.

203
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,690
You seem to really love your role.

204
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,460
I do.

205
00:14:17,059 --> 00:14:19,830
- Okay. Please prepare a chair.
- Yes, ma'am.

206
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:25,799
1, 2.

207
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:47,629
(It's chilly today.
Make sure to dress warmly.)

208
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:56,029
(My feelings will never change.
I'll be waiting for you.)

209
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:13,250
(Is everything all right?
I miss you.)

210
00:15:28,669 --> 00:15:30,200
Let me see all the calls
we got so far.

211
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,700
This is it.

212
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,139
Okay. Thank you.

213
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,620
Ha Jin, we're going home.

214
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,120
I want to work out.

215
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,820
Drop me off, and you can go.

216
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,789
You've been working
since the morning.

217
00:15:50,789 --> 00:15:52,960
Don't overwork yourself.
Get some rest.

218
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:57,059
I'll sleep better
once I run for a bit.

219
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,029
Okay.

220
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,250
(Doctor Yoo)

221
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,590
Come on.

222
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:28,730
- Hello.
- My gosh, Anchor Lee.

223
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,590
Any update on Moon Seong Ho?

224
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,559
He's still on the run.

225
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,669
I'm not sure if that jerk knows
where we're searching...

226
00:16:34,669 --> 00:16:37,500
or if he's just getting lucky
when he's moving around.

227
00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:39,039
But we're still pursuing him.

228
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,639
I'm sure it will
mentally pressure him.

229
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,340
Okay. Right.

230
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,240
He might be quiet now,
but we don't know what he might do.

231
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,179
Right. So we must try harder
to catch him, right?

232
00:16:50,179 --> 00:16:52,120
We'll call you if we get a lead.

233
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,120
- Okay.
- Bye.

234
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,160
You're early.

235
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:06,829
Hi.

236
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:12,099
You wanted to see me
because you were worried, right?

237
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:14,509
I'm sorry.

238
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:16,440
Why are you sorry?

239
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,380
You didn't give me these memories.

240
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,880
These were my memories,
to begin with.

241
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,720
I just found my place now.

242
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,119
I'm fine. Don't worry.

243
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:31,690
But you're not okay.

244
00:17:31,859 --> 00:17:33,490
If it's hard, you can say it is.

245
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,960
Cry if you want to.

246
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,029
That way, people around you
can comfort you. That way,

247
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,269
I won't be a fool like before...

248
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:44,670
and finally do something for you.

249
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:50,170
I'm really okay, Doctor Yoo.

250
00:17:51,339 --> 00:17:52,880
I'm handling it.

251
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,680
Are you trying your best
to endure this pain...

252
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,390
out of guilt...

253
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,950
or for the sake of Jeong Hoon?

254
00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:08,930
When you came to me a while ago...

255
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:11,730
and told me that you had dreams
about your past,

256
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:13,700
to be honest, I was very worried...

257
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,170
in case you got your memories back.

258
00:18:17,569 --> 00:18:20,500
So I told Jeong Hoon
to break up with you.

259
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:25,410
I said you might be remembering
your past because he was with you.

260
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,180
So I told him to stop.

261
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:31,420
But Jeong Hoon told me...

262
00:18:32,849 --> 00:18:35,390
that he didn't want to hide
because he was scared.

263
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:39,519
Even if you get your memories back
and have a hard time,

264
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:42,589
he said he wanted
to stay by your side.

265
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:50,099
Is that what Anchor Lee said?

266
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,500
Yes.

267
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,609
I've been his friend
for a very long time.

268
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,769
I've never seen him
so determined like that day.

269
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,079
I know that...

270
00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:02,849
it took a lot of courage
for him to decide that.

271
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,880
Ha Jin,

272
00:19:07,549 --> 00:19:09,319
don't get scared and hide.

273
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:11,589
Be courageous.

274
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:05,480
She's an anchor in the drama,

275
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,109
so going with
a sophisticated career woman...

276
00:20:08,109 --> 00:20:10,910
might be a win-win for both of us.

277
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:14,589
Secret tips on how to take care of
yourself from a career woman.

278
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,289
I like it.

279
00:20:16,589 --> 00:20:18,759
I think we settled on the concept.

280
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,529
Once you give us the draft,
we'll check it and call you.

281
00:20:21,529 --> 00:20:22,859
Okay. Let's do that.

282
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:27,799
Can you also think
about sponsorships for the drama?

283
00:20:28,069 --> 00:20:31,799
Ha Jin, you're so invested
in this drama.

284
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,769
This drama is all I have right now.

285
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,839
Are you sure you want to cut it?
Won't you regret it?

286
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:40,809
The writer said
you could just tie it up neatly.

287
00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:43,180
Since I'm going with a new image,
I want to do it right.

288
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,420
Isn't it better
with a visible change?

289
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,950
Yes, it is.

290
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,450
But it took so long
to grow your hair.

291
00:20:49,819 --> 00:20:51,319
Can you reconsider?

292
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:53,589
I'll be okay. Please cut it.

293
00:20:54,259 --> 00:20:55,789
Will this do?

294
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:57,829
No, that's too short.

295
00:20:57,829 --> 00:20:59,759
No. We need to get an offer
for a shampoo commercial.

296
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,869
It's fine. Just cut it up to here.

297
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:08,109
Yes, Ms. Park.

298
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:10,539
What?

299
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,740
What do you mean
the drama might be canceled?

300
00:21:14,309 --> 00:21:15,480
How...

301
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,650
We already did a read-through
and had a test photoshoot.

302
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,519
Why are they canceling it now?

303
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:26,490
I don't know the details.

304
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:28,430
The production company
and the TV station...

305
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,789
were negotiating
on the final terms.

306
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:31,559
And there was a dispute.

307
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:33,930
This is making me anxious.

308
00:21:35,769 --> 00:21:37,400
- Hello.
- Hello.

309
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,769
Hi.

310
00:21:42,069 --> 00:21:44,680
I'm sorry for asking you
to come all this way.

311
00:21:45,109 --> 00:21:49,880
I thought it was better
to tell you the news in person.

312
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,150
We already did the read-through
and the test photoshoot.

313
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,619
What is this about?

314
00:21:54,619 --> 00:21:56,950
We asked you to come in...

315
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:00,019
because I have unfortunate news.

316
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:01,859
It seems like...

317
00:22:02,329 --> 00:22:04,759
this drama will be canceled.

318
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:12,099
- Pardon?
- I mean,

319
00:22:12,269 --> 00:22:14,299
this is different
from postponing the shoot.

320
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:16,869
How could you just cancel
a project like this?

321
00:22:17,309 --> 00:22:19,980
We invested all of our time
and energy into this drama.

322
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,779
Right. I'm sorry.

323
00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:24,349
We were negotiating
on the final terms.

324
00:22:24,349 --> 00:22:26,650
When a new management team
took over the company,

325
00:22:26,819 --> 00:22:28,519
the negotiation fell through.

326
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:31,589
The scale of the drama is quite big
as it is Writer Hwang's drama.

327
00:22:31,589 --> 00:22:34,059
And it was one of the blockbusters
for the year.

328
00:22:34,059 --> 00:22:36,190
But it is the company's decision...

329
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:38,829
that we cannot proceed
with high-risk factors.

330
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:42,299
Then, does it mean this drama can
air on a different TV channel?

331
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:44,000
Well,

332
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
the terms of Writer Hwang's contract
are quite complicated.

333
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:50,369
This drama can only air on HBN.

334
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,509
On top of that,
the current production company...

335
00:22:52,779 --> 00:22:55,680
is facing a lot of trouble...

336
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,710
regarding the crew's wages
of the previous project.

337
00:23:03,819 --> 00:23:05,019
What is this?

338
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,529
What's going on?

339
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,470
Excuse me, Ha Jin.

340
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:18,440
I heard the production of the drama
will be halted. Is this true?

341
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,799
I heard it's halted because of...

342
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:22,609
the high appearance fees
of some actors and actresses.

343
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:24,039
Are you one of them, Ha Jin?

344
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:25,609
She's a victim too.

345
00:23:25,609 --> 00:23:28,450
- Ha Jin, please give us a comment.
- Give us a comment.

346
00:23:35,089 --> 00:23:37,519
Try to comfort her.

347
00:23:37,619 --> 00:23:40,789
She's been pouring
all of her energy into this drama.

348
00:23:40,789 --> 00:23:43,990
Right. I don't know why things are
getting so hard for her.

349
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:03,109
("Production of 'Hello, Everyone'
Is Halted Due to a Budget Problem")

350
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:14,829
("Hello, Everyone")

351
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,200
Try again. This time,
pronounce them more clearly.

352
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,099
Now, say your line.

353
00:24:25,539 --> 00:24:27,900
- Korean conglomerates...
- No.

354
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:29,910
I want you to enunciate
one at a time.

355
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:35,150
Square your shoulders.

356
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,650
Keep your back straight.

357
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:40,319
Hello, everyone.

358
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:42,490
This is the 9 p.m. news.

359
00:26:09,339 --> 00:26:10,369
Ha Jin.

360
00:26:11,509 --> 00:26:12,539
Ha Jin.

361
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,880
Where did she go?

362
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:34,930
("The Production of Yeo Ha Jin's
'Hello, Everyone' Gets Canceled")

363
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,869
Yes, Ha Kyung.

364
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:43,940
Anchor Lee, are you with Ha Jin?

365
00:26:45,009 --> 00:26:47,710
No, why? Is something going on?

366
00:26:47,779 --> 00:26:50,109
She's suddenly gone,
and she left her phone at home.

367
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:51,750
What?

368
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:54,720
Since when?

369
00:26:55,789 --> 00:26:57,150
Do you know anywhere
she could have gone to?

370
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,539
But I'll stop saying yes so easily
like I did back then.

371
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:54,079
I want you to be happy.

372
00:27:55,309 --> 00:27:57,009
So I'll stop saying goodbye to you.

373
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:15,099
Where on earth are you?

374
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,819
Ha Jin.

375
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:43,559
Where have you been?

376
00:28:44,529 --> 00:28:46,230
I've been worried sick.

377
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,170
At the least,
you should have told Ha Kyung.

378
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:53,940
Anchor Lee,

379
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,640
don't you hate me?

380
00:28:57,509 --> 00:28:58,839
Why would I hate you?

381
00:29:00,579 --> 00:29:03,109
There is no reason
for me to hate you.

382
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:06,279
No.

383
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:10,089
I'm a really bad person.

384
00:29:18,859 --> 00:29:19,900
Ha Jin.

385
00:29:24,369 --> 00:29:28,099
Do you know what I thought about
as I sat here waiting for you?

386
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:34,839
I'm the one who broke up with you,

387
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:45,859
but I missed you to death.

388
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,200
I couldn't even breathe...

389
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,200
to think I'll never see you again.

390
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,440
May I just stay by your side?
