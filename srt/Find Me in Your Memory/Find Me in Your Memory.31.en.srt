00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,169
(Episode 31)

2
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:04,940
Hey, isn't that Yeo Ha Jin?

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:05,940
Where?

4
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:08,710
No way.

5
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,679
She's in the US right now.

6
00:00:10,849 --> 00:00:12,080
Oh, you're right.

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,089
Do you think
she won't come back to Korea?

8
00:00:14,289 --> 00:00:15,849
I doubt she'll come back.

9
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,859
I heard she's really popular there.

10
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:20,359
I heard she'll be filming
"Kill the Venus 3" too.

11
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:22,089
Really? She's so big.

12
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,829
Here's your coffee.

13
00:00:26,829 --> 00:00:28,000
I ordered chocolate.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,500
I canceled it for you.

15
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,269
Do you think I can drink chocolate
before I die?

16
00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:33,409
You can probably have some
when you're about 60.

17
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:34,810
That's earlier than I thought.

18
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:36,670
The sunlight is great in Korea.

19
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:39,439
Is it different from the US?

20
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:41,810
Of course. It even smells different.

21
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,679
The lack of sugar is
making you way too sensitive.

22
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,619
How is it for you
to be back in Korea?

23
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,590
It's great.

24
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,789
Goodness, my babies.
You two were here already.

25
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,659
- You're here.
- Hey.

26
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,159
Wait, is coffee enough for you?

27
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:58,560
Aren't you hungry?

28
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,700
We're fine. We already had lunch.

29
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,829
I'm almost finished
getting your home ready.

30
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:04,500
You can come back home.

31
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,700
What about your niece?

32
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,439
She must've been flustered that
she suddenly had to empty the house.

33
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:10,409
Exactly.
We could've stayed at a hotel.

34
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:12,510
Goodness, you'll be
way more comfortable at home.

35
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,680
Thanks to you, she was
practically living there for free...

36
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,680
in return for
taking care of your house.

37
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,219
I gave her some money
to go travel for a few days.

38
00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:21,519
She's completely excited right now.

39
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:22,689
I'm glad.

40
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,159
So the meeting with the director
will be held tomorrow, right?

41
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,189
He wanted to
book the meeting for today,

42
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:30,629
but I asked him to postpone it
because you have to...

43
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:31,700
take a rest today.

44
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:35,400
Do you absolutely love the scenario?

45
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,239
I do.

46
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,510
But I'll decide
after I meet the director.

47
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,980
Okay.
This is urgent for them, not us.

48
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,239
Slowly.
Let's take our time and think.

49
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,879
Slowly.

50
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:51,349
Ms. Park, do you have to keep adding
English to your vocabulary?

51
00:01:51,349 --> 00:01:52,719
I have to keep trying to get better.

52
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:54,650
Ha Jin is now a star worldwide,

53
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,549
and I should be able to speak...

54
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,859
proper English
as the CEO of her agency.

55
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:01,359
Exactly.
You need to speak it properly.

56
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:03,359
It was just a joke.

57
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:05,000
"Joke", no. Joke.

58
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Joke.

59
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:07,969
Exactly.

60
00:02:24,449 --> 00:02:27,419
(Ju Ri and Woo Hyun's Happy Place)

61
00:02:50,509 --> 00:02:51,979
Nothing has changed.

62
00:02:51,979 --> 00:02:55,379
They loved the decoration,
so they left it as it is.

63
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:57,250
The second floor is
almost the same too.

64
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,419
You can clear your mind
and get a good rest today.

65
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,620
I will.

66
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,590
We have to go back to the office
right away. Is that okay?

67
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,490
It's all right. I'll get some rest.

68
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:07,860
We'd rather stay with you,

69
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,500
but we have mountains of work
after staying away for so long.

70
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,330
We're very busy.

71
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,000
Don't get too strained.
You need to look after your health.

72
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,370
Yes, I'll do that.

73
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:18,539
- Get a good rest, then.
- Goodbye.

74
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,069
I'll get something delicious
on my way home.

75
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:22,210
Do you want anything?

76
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,879
No. Go work,

77
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,639
eat dinner, and go on a date too.

78
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,580
You haven't called Mr. Jo yet,
have you?

79
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:29,879
No.

80
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,080
He'll be thrilled to see you.

81
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,550
I want to be alone,
so you need to go.

82
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,289
Okay.

83
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:40,159
Text me if you want anything.

84
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,759
Don't go out alone.

85
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:42,759
Okay.

86
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,469
(Dear my Ha Kyung.
My dear Ha Kyung! How was your day?)

87
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,229
I miss my Ha Kyung.

88
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,769
I wonder what she's doing right now.

89
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,740
Hello?

90
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,040
Hey, Ha Kyung!

91
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:36,680
Why isn't this
an international call?

92
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,350
What do you think?

93
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,649
I'm in Korea right now.

94
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,089
Really?

95
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,990
Where are you? I'll be there.

96
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,889
Are you at home?
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

97
00:05:00,939 --> 00:05:01,939
Ha Kyung...

98
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:05,310
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

99
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,350
Jo Il Kwon!

100
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,060
What was that just now?

101
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:18,459
What?

102
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,040
What's wrong?

103
00:05:31,939 --> 00:05:33,170
Don't you know?

104
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,670
Who was that guy just now?

105
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,769
Who is he that you gave him a hug?

106
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:39,480
He's someone from the agency
in the US, and he gave me a ride.

107
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,050
And that wasn't even a hug.

108
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,850
I was just saying goodbye.

109
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,319
That's not just saying goodbye.

110
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:46,779
If you said goodbye to him again,
things will get even more heated up.

111
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:48,350
Everyone does that in the US.

112
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,620
Will you keep getting angry
over nothing?

113
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,829
Are you saying you hugged
any old guy you met over there?

114
00:05:54,029 --> 00:05:55,089
What?

115
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,959
Why are you so uptight today?

116
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:59,399
What about you?
You must feel very free...

117
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:01,800
after staying in the US for a while.
You seem very open.

118
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,199
We finally met after a long time.
Will you keep making me tired?

119
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,370
"Tired"?

120
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:07,769
If you're tired,
go home and get some rest.

121
00:06:07,769 --> 00:06:09,639
Why did you come all the way here?

122
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:13,079
Fine! I should do that!

123
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:14,810
What?

124
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,180
I'm leaving!

125
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:18,920
Fine! Goodbye, then.

126
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,490
Okay!

127
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,689
How could she really leave?

128
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:53,790
Ha Kyung, are you still angry?

129
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:56,750
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

130
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,490
I like you too much,

131
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,089
so that's why
I must've been jealous.

132
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,060
Can we meet and talk it out?

133
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:04,329
I miss you, Ha Kyung.

134
00:07:04,329 --> 00:07:06,800
(Jo Il Kwon)

135
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:09,100
You need to feel more desperate.

136
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:16,569
Goodness, after you became
a prominent actress overseas,

137
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:18,939
everyone is dying to see you.

138
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,509
- Goodness, hello.
- Hello.

139
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:23,149
It's so nice to see you, Ha Jin.

140
00:07:23,149 --> 00:07:24,279
Hello.

141
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:25,949
I finally get to meet you.

142
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:28,689
Do you know
how long we waited to see you?

143
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,490
The director is in the meeting room.

144
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,689
You two can have
a great conversation.

145
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,060
Okay.

146
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:35,689
- I'll be back.
- Go ahead.

147
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,600
I heard her scenes...

148
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,269
in "Kill the Venus 2"
increased by double.

149
00:07:44,269 --> 00:07:46,000
It's not exactly double, per se.

150
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:52,209
Actually, Ha Jin only signed
the contract for the first movie,

151
00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:55,050
but after the movie premiered,

152
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:59,350
the director went out of his way to
persuade her to do the second one.

153
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:02,720
Ha Jin will end up
becoming a huge world star.

154
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:07,290
- That's her class right now, right?
- Yes.

155
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:10,189
She once went to
a famous brunch place,

156
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:11,800
and Justin Bieber...

157
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,199
Wait, that Justin Bieber?

158
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,329
Yes, he recognized her and said hi.

159
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,370
Oh, my.

160
00:08:17,569 --> 00:08:20,670
I think they're still in touch.

161
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,079
He only said hi,

162
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:26,240
thinking we were his fans
since we were staring at him.

163
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:28,610
Do you like him?

164
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:29,750
Of course.

165
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,980
I'm sorry about last time.

166
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,519
You came all the way
to the filming site...

167
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:35,889
but couldn't see me.

168
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,860
It seems like my trip
to the States paid off.

169
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,129
Aren't you back in Korea
because you felt bad?

170
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,259
You're right.

171
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:50,299
Did you read the revised scenario?

172
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,100
Yes. I read it.

173
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:55,169
I had more lines than before,

174
00:08:55,169 --> 00:08:57,809
but the male lead
seemed less interesting.

175
00:08:58,309 --> 00:09:00,610
I liked your original one better.

176
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:02,580
I see.

177
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,049
Speaking of, I'd like to ask you
a question.

178
00:09:06,049 --> 00:09:07,149
What is it?

179
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,690
You do know that
I was involved in a scandal...

180
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,590
before leaving for
the States, right?

181
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:16,529
They could bring it up again.
Will you be okay with that?

182
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:19,159
Oh, that?

183
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,200
If you think you may back out,

184
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,429
please let me know right now.

185
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,940
I've gone through such incidents
quite often.

186
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,840
It's best not to waste
each other's time.

187
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,480
Do you remember...

188
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,820
when I told you that I had written
this scenario with you in mind?

189
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:40,179
That was long before...

190
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:44,460
you had left for the States.

191
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,460
Even after what happened,

192
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:52,059
I never thought twice...

193
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:54,929
about casting you.

194
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,899
What do you say?
Was that a good enough answer?

195
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,639
Yes, it was.

196
00:10:04,909 --> 00:10:06,080
I'm exhausted.

197
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:10,549
Why am I so tired?

198
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,080
That's because
you've been bluffing all day.

199
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:15,590
Your English hasn't improved,
but your bluffing has.

200
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:16,820
I wasn't bluffing.

201
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,990
I just slightly sugarcoated
the facts.

202
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,490
You should've heard her.

203
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:24,529
She was bluffing so much
in front of the CEO.

204
00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:25,629
Really?

205
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,429
How was the talk with the director?

206
00:10:28,429 --> 00:10:29,929
It went great.

207
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,470
He's so nice, and the scenario
is exactly what I expected.

208
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,309
It's soft but has a decisive topic.

209
00:10:36,309 --> 00:10:38,580
Did you tell him
you'd think about it?

210
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,279
Yes, he said that was fine.

211
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,610
So what do you want to do?

212
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,720
I'm not sure yet.

213
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,850
I'm greatly interested in the movie,

214
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,190
but there are many things
to consider.

215
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,159
What do you think?

216
00:10:53,659 --> 00:10:54,830
To be honest, it hasn't been
that long...

217
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:57,029
since you've succeeded
in the States.

218
00:10:57,029 --> 00:10:59,600
Perhaps, it's too early
to come back.

219
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,029
If you're not planning to work
in Korea again, then it's fine.

220
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,600
But if not,

221
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,440
I think this is your opportunity.

222
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,740
We'll support you no matter what,

223
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,509
so take your time.

224
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:13,639
She's right.
You've been working relentlessly.

225
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,809
You should take some good rest
and think about it.

226
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:18,049
Okay. I'll do that.

227
00:11:30,129 --> 00:11:31,129
Thanks.

228
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:36,000
I asked Anchor Lee to add
more comments...

229
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,970
since we had too much free time.

230
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,070
He's not here yet, is he?

231
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,139
No, I think he's getting ready.

232
00:11:41,139 --> 00:11:42,809
Ask him how long it'll take.

233
00:11:42,809 --> 00:11:43,840
Yes, sir.

234
00:11:44,409 --> 00:11:45,940
Hold on.

235
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,679
Tell him that I'm not rushing him.

236
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:53,919
Do explain that
I'm just simply anxious.

237
00:11:54,049 --> 00:11:55,049
Okay.

238
00:11:57,389 --> 00:11:59,019
Did you just smirk?

239
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:02,659
It seems like you're walking
on eggshells around him.

240
00:12:02,659 --> 00:12:04,429
Of course, I should.

241
00:12:04,659 --> 00:12:07,399
He's the face of our news channel.

242
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,879
Is the team manager
asking for the revised manuscript?

243
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:29,149
He wanted you to know
that he's not rushing you.

244
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,990
Here. Can you print me a copy
as well?

245
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,090
Okay.

246
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,100
Hi.

247
00:12:41,429 --> 00:12:43,830
Yes, this is it.

248
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,240
I feel so much at peace.

249
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,070
Are you going to come here...

250
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,639
every time I'm preparing
for the news?

251
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,179
I want to enjoy this happiness
for the next month.

252
00:12:54,179 --> 00:12:57,620
Is everything fine?
Do you want a softer chair?

253
00:12:58,179 --> 00:13:01,019
Do you want anything to drink?
How about that honey drink?

254
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,919
I'm fine, so you may leave.

255
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:04,419
All right, I got it.

256
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:06,490
You're not worried
about the interview, are you?

257
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:08,330
This is your first interview
after returning.

258
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:12,100
I'm not sure. You've invited
a very special guest.

259
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:15,929
I think I saw him in the green room.
You should visit him.

260
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:19,639
That's okay.
He'll feel uncomfortable.

261
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:20,799
It's better that we don't meet.

262
00:13:21,169 --> 00:13:24,179
Hasn't it been ages
since you've last met?

263
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:25,279
You're right.

264
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,279
It's been two years.

265
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:32,480
3, 2, 1.

266
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,820
Anchor!

267
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:37,019
Many people have been interested
and supportive of him...

268
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:39,620
for what he's been doing abroad.

269
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,190
He's with us today as a guest.

270
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,500
It's nice to meet you,
Doctor Yoo Tae Eun.

271
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,870
Hello.

272
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,830
I'm Doctor Yoo Tae Eun,
a psychiatrist.

273
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:56,210
You've been counseling those
who have received trauma...

274
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,340
due to violence in countries...

275
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,909
that are at war for free.

276
00:14:01,409 --> 00:14:03,649
How long has it been
since you were last in Korea?

277
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,320
Due to the environment I was in,

278
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,419
time flew by so quickly.

279
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,659
But when I checked my passport
this time,

280
00:14:11,659 --> 00:14:13,220
I realized that
it had been two years.

281
00:14:13,289 --> 00:14:16,490
That's not a short amount of time.

282
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:18,659
What do you think?
Have things changed around here?

283
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:21,200
At first, I thought so.

284
00:14:21,669 --> 00:14:23,070
But after some time,

285
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,500
I could spot the things
that hadn't changed.

286
00:14:25,669 --> 00:14:28,370
For example, you're still
the news anchor.

287
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:30,809
You're right.

288
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,179
I heard you came back
for a reason.

289
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:35,110
You're holding an exhibition?

290
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:37,480
Yes, I'm displaying the drawings
made by the children...

291
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,879
I had counseled
during drawing therapy.

292
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:44,490
The profit will be used
to educate children...

293
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:47,190
in countries that are at war.

294
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:51,299
Since he's such a righteous doctor,
Jeong Hoon won't criticize him.

295
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,730
So what if he does?

296
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:58,240
No matter what he does,
you love him so much.

297
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,039
Most of them
are victims of violence.

298
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:03,009
- Is it that obvious?
- Extremely.

299
00:15:03,009 --> 00:15:05,710
Because of that,
they become traumatized.

300
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:12,750
Why are you
in such a hurry to leave?

301
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,590
I'm meeting a reporter
early tomorrow morning...

302
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:15,919
regarding the exhibition.

303
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:18,919
It's too late for you to treat me
to something nice anyway.

304
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,019
You can treat me next time.

305
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,159
You seem to be busier here.

306
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:25,629
Then you shouldn't have invited me
as a guest.

307
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:28,100
Just now, I received two calls.

308
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,899
I think I'm born to appear on TV.

309
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:35,309
Aren't charity events supposed
to make you humbler?

310
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,570
You've changed.

311
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:40,309
It's only natural.
It's been two years.

312
00:15:40,309 --> 00:15:42,850
It's actually strange
that you haven't.

313
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:44,480
Really?

314
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:47,379
Goodness.

315
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,419
Are you still waiting for her?

316
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,960
Ha Jin.

317
00:15:54,659 --> 00:15:56,429
Why don't you just call her first?

318
00:15:58,129 --> 00:15:59,899
Actually, I saw her yesterday.

319
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:01,629
You did? Where?

320
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:04,539
It was a coincidence.
I saw her while driving.

321
00:16:04,539 --> 00:16:06,470
Then you should've stopped her.

322
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,809
Should I have?

323
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,549
If it's fate, then we'll meet again.

324
00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:18,279
Gosh, you're so pitiful.

325
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:21,049
I'll clear my schedule
for this weekend, so call me.

326
00:16:21,049 --> 00:16:22,289
I'll treat you to a meal.

327
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:24,190
- Okay.
- Bye.

328
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:27,289
- I'll call you.
- Sure.

329
00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:34,399
Many people have been interested
and supportive of him...

330
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,269
for what he's been doing abroad.

331
00:16:37,669 --> 00:16:39,639
He's with us today as a guest.

332
00:16:40,169 --> 00:16:42,039
- What are you doing?
- It's nice to meet you...

333
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:43,370
- Hey.
- Hello.

334
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,679
I'm so sleepy. I'm going to bed.

335
00:16:46,179 --> 00:16:47,480
You were awake until I came in.

336
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,279
I'm going to bed now.

337
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:52,220
What's that sound? What is it?

338
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,820
Let me see.

339
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,389
Move.

340
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:57,690
- Move.
- It's nothing.

341
00:16:57,789 --> 00:16:59,159
Move!

342
00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:03,059
You were watching the news.

343
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:07,099
Yes. Doctor Yoo was on the news.

344
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:09,400
Is that so?
But that's Anchor Lee.

345
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,339
You're right.

346
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:13,539
I'm not sleepy.
You're not either, right?

347
00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:15,910
Judging by what you're doing,
I think I'm right.

348
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,839
You are. That's why
I was watching Doctor Yoo.

349
00:17:19,009 --> 00:17:21,079
I'm going out for a bit. Wait here.

350
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:22,410
Where are you going?

351
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:24,849
Answer me.

352
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:26,380
Just keep watching.

353
00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:33,589
Let's talk about charity.

354
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:37,960
You're counseling those
in countries that are at war.

355
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,160
This is something new.

356
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,569
What is all this?

357
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,039
Let's have a drink.

358
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:49,140
We're having wine?

359
00:17:50,109 --> 00:17:52,140
- Tada.
- It's makgeolli.

360
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,140
This is a cure for insomnia.

361
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,109
Gosh, it's been ages.

362
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:58,680
There's makgeolli, kimchi pancakes,
and cartilage.

363
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,019
Eat as much as you want.

364
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:02,789
What's gotten into you?

365
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:05,720
You're free tomorrow.
You'll be running.

366
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,089
I should've known better.

367
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,259
Fine, then.

368
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:11,200
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

369
00:18:18,269 --> 00:18:19,740
This is so good.

370
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,039
It hits the spot.
It's the taste of Korea.

371
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,410
It's so good!

372
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,650
Staying with you at home
feels surreal.

373
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:36,720
Why is that surreal?

374
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:39,160
When we were in the States,

375
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,660
my time in Korea seemed
like a dream,

376
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:45,230
but now that I'm in Korea, my time
in the States feels like a dream.

377
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:50,470
It's been a long time
I've been away,

378
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,400
but it feels like I'm circling
around the same spot.

379
00:18:56,609 --> 00:18:58,109
Is it because of Anchor Lee?

380
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,750
Why you can't decide on this movie
and are still thinking about it?

381
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,819
It's not just about him.

382
00:19:08,619 --> 00:19:09,950
I'm just scared.

383
00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:14,589
And I'm not sure if it's okay
for me to come back to Korea.

384
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:17,289
Forget about other reasons.

385
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:20,599
If you still like him
after all this time has passed,

386
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:22,269
you should just get back with him.

387
00:19:24,769 --> 00:19:26,069
Don't regret it.

388
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:48,490
- Yes, Ha Kyung.
- Where are you?

389
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:49,930
I came out to shop.

390
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:51,500
To shop?

391
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:54,130
Jamie is hooked on Korean
historical drama these days,

392
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,730
so Jamie told me to bring back
some traditional fans.

393
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:58,769
Then, you should have asked me
to go with you.

394
00:19:58,769 --> 00:20:01,410
What if people recognize you
when you're all by yourself?

395
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,539
But no one knows
that I'm in Korea.

396
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:05,039
And if I cover up my face,
I'll look more suspicious.

397
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,380
But still.
You should have put on a hat.

398
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:09,109
Gosh, okay.

399
00:20:09,109 --> 00:20:11,549
If something happens,
call me right away. I'll be there.

400
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,920
Don't worry.
I'll call you on my way home.

401
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:15,450
Okay.

402
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:21,160
My gosh, where can I get the fans?

403
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:29,599
I'm hungry.

404
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:31,500
What should we eat?

405
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,069
Hold on. Wait.

406
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,609
Aren't you Ms. Yeo Ha Jin?

407
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:37,670
No.

408
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:40,380
Do I look like her?
I get that quite often.

409
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,910
Yes. You totally look like her.
Right?

410
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,549
You're really not her?

411
00:20:44,849 --> 00:20:46,920
She's in the States right now.

412
00:20:47,019 --> 00:20:48,119
Right.

413
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:50,349
But thank you for telling me
that I look like a pretty actress.

414
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:51,990
She's an awesome actress.

415
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:53,720
- I see. Right.
- Yes.

416
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,859
- I'm sorry about that.
- Bye.

417
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,490
- She looks nothing like Ha Jin.
- Isn't that her?

418
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,829
Come here. Let's go.

419
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:10,329
Ha Jin.

420
00:22:16,609 --> 00:22:17,869
How are you here?

421
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:22,349
Well,

422
00:22:23,049 --> 00:22:24,920
I needed to buy something.

423
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,089
Have you been well?

424
00:22:35,289 --> 00:22:37,759
Yes. I have been well.

425
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:42,829
What about you, Anchor Lee?

426
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:48,000
Did you come back to Korea for good?

427
00:22:50,609 --> 00:22:51,910
No.

428
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,339
I need to go back to the States.

429
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,480
I see.

430
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,450
Isn't that Yeo Ha Jin?

431
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,920
- She is. Let's take a photo.
- I can't believe it.

432
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:06,019
I'll get going.

433
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:35,480
The number you have dialed
has been suspended...

434
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,480
for the time being as requested.

435
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:42,250
The number you have dialed
has been suspended...

436
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:12,750
I'm sorry.

437
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,279
I was in a hurry.

438
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:16,450
It's all right.
I can call my insurance company.

439
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:18,690
- Are you hurt?
- No, I am okay.

440
00:25:19,089 --> 00:25:21,930
To cover all four corners, why don't
we pull over and discuss this?

441
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:23,430
I have a customer inside.

442
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:25,200
I might have to let
my customer go first.

443
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,529
- Okay, let's do that.
- Okay.

444
00:25:29,329 --> 00:25:30,430
Are you okay?

445
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,279
Anchor Lee.

446
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:50,519
We meet again.

447
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,670
Are you hurt?

448
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:04,630
No, I'm okay.

449
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:06,900
What about you?

450
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,269
I'm okay too.

451
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,240
Out of all taxis,

452
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,779
I was in an accident
with a taxi you were in.

453
00:26:14,609 --> 00:26:15,779
Right.

454
00:26:16,309 --> 00:26:18,180
So that's our destiny.

455
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,180
We're destined to fall in love.

456
00:26:23,349 --> 00:26:26,460
They run into each other three times
on the same day in the same place,

457
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,660
then they miss each other by a hair.

458
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:33,960
Then they get into
a ridiculous accident on a street.

459
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:37,569
Don't you think there are
way too many coincidences?

460
00:26:37,569 --> 00:26:39,400
That's why they're meant to be.

461
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:42,740
They're destined to meet each other
and fall in love.

462
00:26:48,579 --> 00:26:51,509
The way we met tells us
we're destined to be together.

463
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,220
Isn't that right?

464
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,490
Where were you going?
Let me drop you off.

465
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,759
I think it will be harder
for you to run away now.

466
00:27:15,339 --> 00:27:16,670
We got here too fast.

467
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,309
I took my time on purpose
to get to your place.

468
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:37,589
Thank you for the ride.

469
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,660
I didn't know you were staying here.

470
00:27:40,299 --> 00:27:42,700
Someone else was living here,
so I thought you sold the place.

471
00:27:43,069 --> 00:27:45,700
Ms. Park's niece and her husband
have been staying here.

472
00:27:46,099 --> 00:27:48,240
But they let me have the place
for the time being.

473
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,640
I see.

474
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:53,279
You're sure
that you're not hurt, right?

475
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:55,950
If you're hurt, please call me.

476
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,009
I still have the same number.

477
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:01,990
I will.

478
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,660
I'll go in now. Bye.

479
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,960
Wait.

480
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,900
I wanted to tell you something,
but I couldn't.

481
00:28:24,509 --> 00:28:25,910
You asked...

482
00:28:27,009 --> 00:28:28,279
if I have been well.

483
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,250
I tried my best,

484
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:35,920
but I couldn't do that.

485
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:40,859
I missed you
and wanted to see you too much.

486
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:46,759
On the last day I saw you,

487
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:52,299
even if you turn me down many times,
I shouldn't have broken up with you.

488
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,039
I should've begged you and said
we have to overcome this together...

489
00:28:57,309 --> 00:28:59,009
to be happy.

490
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:05,079
I regretted everything
from the moment you left.

491
00:29:07,849 --> 00:29:09,289
I regretted it too.

492
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:15,359
I'm so sorry that I left you here...

493
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,200
all alone.
