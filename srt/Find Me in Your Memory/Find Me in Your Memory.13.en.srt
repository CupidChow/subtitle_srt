00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,809
(Episode 13)

3
00:00:04,809 --> 00:00:06,879
(Funeral Hall 5)

4
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:52,619
What happened, Father?

5
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:55,990
Why is Mother's picture up there?

6
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,600
She was fine until yesterday. Why...

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,770
Say something, Father.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,810
What happened to her?

9
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:14,980
How did you know
you'll find her here?

10
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:17,180
What did you say?

11
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,950
Why didn't you call me?

12
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:22,120
Why do I have to...

13
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,060
find out about this right here
in this way?

14
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,390
What did you hide and not tell me...

15
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:32,430
about Mother's condition
to this day? What is it?

16
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,299
When we found it out
three months ago,

17
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,569
she was already in her
last stage of cancer.

18
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,840
Thankfully, she was able
to receive chemotherapy,

19
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,109
so we had set a surgery date.

20
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,379
The success rate was low,

21
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,590
but your mom...

22
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:55,950
wanted to fight until the end.

23
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,120
And...

24
00:01:57,859 --> 00:02:00,730
you hadn't told your own son
about that?

25
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:03,629
You should've...

26
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:08,930
You should've told me
about this sooner!

27
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:14,870
How could you not let me
say my last goodbye?

28
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:18,740
This was what she wanted.

29
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:21,849
It was all for you.

30
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:23,879
She...

31
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:26,419
pitied you.

32
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:32,060
She's not doing too well.

33
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:34,389
Her neutrophil count is very low,

34
00:02:34,389 --> 00:02:36,159
so the cancer cells are spreading.

35
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,629
I think it's best
that you prepare for the worst.

36
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,780
It is time.

37
00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:56,180
We should tell Jeong Hoon.

38
00:02:56,379 --> 00:02:57,479
No.

39
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,090
No, honey.

40
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,120
Stop being stubborn.

41
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,120
Don't you miss him?

42
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:08,590
You should see him
before it's too late.

43
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:11,229
I'm not going to see him.

44
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:15,069
I'm not going to let him see me.

45
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:18,500
Don't show my body...

46
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,680
to him.

47
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,150
What are you talking about?

48
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:30,650
You know very well.

49
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,379
Our son...

50
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,849
can't forget anything.

51
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,060
I can't let him...

52
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:45,759
go to bed every night,

53
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,969
thinking about
my cold, lifeless body.

54
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,740
After some time,

55
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,610
you will be able...

56
00:03:56,539 --> 00:03:58,740
to forget that image.

57
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:02,979
But...

58
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,150
that's not the case for him.

59
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,460
That poor kid...

60
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:18,129
won't forget it.

61
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,970
I pity him.

62
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,370
So please...

63
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:28,939
Please...

64
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,310
listen to me.

65
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,850
I beg you.

66
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:48,459
So...

67
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,399
let's just let her go.

68
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:58,639
Wish her a peaceful journey.

69
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:25,459
(Son: Lee Jeong Hoon,
Husband: Lee Dong Young)

70
00:05:44,149 --> 00:05:45,180
Ha Jin.

71
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,149
Why are you out here alone?

72
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,050
Hello.

73
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,089
Hello.

74
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:54,329
I brought Jeong Hoon's clothes.
Where is he?

75
00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:24,120
Here.

76
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,990
Come on.

77
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,860
That's strange.

78
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:34,470
You're not happy to see
your favorite snack, cotton candy.

79
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:38,069
Something's up, isn't it?

80
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,069
Can you tell me?

81
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:43,740
My friends...

82
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,379
don't want to play with me.

83
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,019
They said I'm weird.

84
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,889
They said I'm like an alien.

85
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:58,959
They're the stupid ones
who forgot everything.

86
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:01,160
Jeong Hoon.

87
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:06,129
Being able to remember more
than everyone else...

88
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,529
is an amazing talent.

89
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:13,339
Most people tend to forget
important things.

90
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:16,009
That's why they make mistakes...

91
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:18,240
and hurt each other.

92
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,180
But since you remember
every single thing,

93
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:26,620
you will neither make mistakes
nor hurt others.

94
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,860
You mean like how
you were disappointed in Dad...

95
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,620
because he forgot
that it was your birthday?

96
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,990
Exactly.

97
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:38,300
Then it's a good thing...

98
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:40,430
to have a good memory.

99
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,930
Of course.

100
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,470
I'm so jealous of you.

101
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,209
You are...

102
00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:53,279
the most special person
in the world.

103
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,600
It's okay.

104
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,009
It's okay.

105
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,179
It'll be okay.

106
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,799
It's okay.

107
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:50,740
It'll be okay.

108
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:03,809
I will...

109
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,250
I will be by your side.

110
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,990
It's okay.

111
00:09:16,929 --> 00:09:19,759
That's a lie.

112
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:22,159
Did you not know either?

113
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,000
No.

114
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,029
How could she pass away
so suddenly?

115
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,169
She had stomach cancer...

116
00:10:33,169 --> 00:10:35,740
but hid it from Jeong Hoon
in case he'd get worried.

117
00:10:36,509 --> 00:10:37,909
Did you speak with him?

118
00:10:37,909 --> 00:10:40,950
No, but I spoke with his friend.

119
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,710
I couldn't reach Jeong Hoon.

120
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,350
I'm going to head
to the funeral hall right now.

121
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,149
It's going to become more hectic
in the evening.

122
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,250
You should go as well.

123
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,759
Of course.

124
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:52,590
You can go first.

125
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,330
Let me know if something happens.

126
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,690
Okay. Goodbye.

127
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,000
We should go home now.

128
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,200
Let't stay a bit longer.

129
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,169
I don't have anything today anyway.

130
00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:19,009
Is that Reporter Park?

131
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,379
Has he been following us
the whole day today?

132
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:38,200
Come on, you shouldn't
have blocked my shot.

133
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,559
The look on Ha Jin's face
was really nice just now.

134
00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:42,299
What are you doing?

135
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:44,370
I mean, I still have work to do.

136
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:45,970
I should get a photo
since I made this trip.

137
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,399
Please leave when I ask nicely.

138
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,309
Come on, don't be like that.
Where is that?

139
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:52,309
I'm here to pay my respect too.

140
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,779
My gosh, you must have cried a lot.

141
00:12:56,779 --> 00:12:58,649
Your eyes are all puffy.

142
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,789
I guess you and Anchor Lee
must have gotten very close.

143
00:13:02,789 --> 00:13:04,519
I thought
you two wouldn't last long.

144
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:06,460
Your relationship is
lasting longer than I thought.

145
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,990
That's enough, Reporter Park.

146
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,990
Seeing how you came
to his mother's funeral,

147
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,059
- does it mean the families met...
- Hey.

148
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:14,059
Do you want to do this even
at a funeral?

149
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:16,000
It's my job, you know.

150
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,600
Hey, you should leave.

151
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,500
- Let go of me. Let go.
- Please leave.

152
00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:21,539
Il Kwon, are you out of your mind?
How dare you push me?

153
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:23,009
Why don't we get out of here?

154
00:13:23,009 --> 00:13:24,139
Let's talk outside.

155
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:25,740
Come on, let's go.

156
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,149
You come here.

157
00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:29,850
What are you doing? Hold on.

158
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,350
Be quiet. Quiet down.

159
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,450
My gosh. Come here.
Stand right here.

160
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,149
- Attention.
- Darn it.

161
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,990
Are you really out of your mind?

162
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:40,990
Hey, don't you have any respect
for your seniors?

163
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,490
If you are,
why don't you act like one?

164
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,659
Look at the stunt you pulled
at a funeral. That was rude.

165
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,570
Rude? I see. Rude.

166
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:50,529
(Funeral Hall)

167
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:52,600
I was meaning to teach you a lesson.

168
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,710
I heard that you've been
asking around about me.

169
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,110
Did Lee Jeong Hoon make you do it?

170
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:58,279
- No.
- As if.

171
00:13:58,279 --> 00:13:59,610
He acts all classy and all,

172
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:01,049
but he treated me like a criminal...

173
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:03,210
just because I took a photo
of his girlfriend.

174
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,720
That petty jerk thinks he's the most
important man in the world.

175
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,919
Be careful with what you say.

176
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:08,350
I should tell you that.

177
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:09,919
And...

178
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,389
I will...

179
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,990
- What are you doing?
- kill you...

180
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:18,330
if you ask around about me again.

181
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,629
Hey, you just crossed the line.

182
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:26,570
You're asking for it.
Let me just punch you.

183
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:27,940
Let me just punch you once.

184
00:14:33,809 --> 00:14:36,210
- Apologize to him.
- Why are you butting in?

185
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,750
Apologize to him.

186
00:14:38,549 --> 00:14:39,549
I'm sorry.

187
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:41,450
I'm sorry. Sorry!

188
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,559
Please excuse me.
I can't stand injustice.

189
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:46,960
But this was too much.

190
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,259
You almost broke my arm.

191
00:14:48,259 --> 00:14:50,429
No way. This isn't enough
to break someone's arm.

192
00:14:50,429 --> 00:14:52,799
If that was my goal, I would've done
that the moment I grabbed it.

193
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,500
You and I will be seeing each other
a lot now.

194
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,870
You're not going to report this
to the police, are you?

195
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:00,340
It's not like you were exactly
a saint to Reporter Jo.

196
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:01,570
Well, right.

197
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:04,210
Excuse me. Reporter Jo and I
need to talk in private.

198
00:15:04,509 --> 00:15:05,840
Goodbye.

199
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,440
Let's go.

200
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,750
Bye.

201
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,720
Thank you.

202
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:16,789
I didn't do it for you.

203
00:15:16,789 --> 00:15:18,919
I've been wanting
to teach him a lesson.

204
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,389
By the way,
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

205
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:24,559
But why were you looking
into Reporter Park?

206
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,230
Well, that's...

207
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:31,169
Did you hear anything
from Jeong Hoon?

208
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,240
Like what?

209
00:15:53,289 --> 00:15:54,929
You should go out.

210
00:15:55,929 --> 00:15:58,799
Yeo Ha Jin.
That girl is sitting outside.

211
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,929
You should go and take care of her.

212
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,710
Your mother...

213
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:14,480
kept staring at this.

214
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:26,820
Your mother seemed to
really like that girl.

215
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:39,240
Why didn't you go home?
Why are you sitting out here?

216
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:43,169
Anchor Lee.

217
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:46,409
I was going to stay
just a bit longer.

218
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:49,679
You don't have to waste your time
and exhaust yourself.

219
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:52,320
You should leave now.

220
00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:00,720
Get some rest at home.

221
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,359
Let's go now.

222
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,230
Now.

223
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,579
Why are you so thin?

224
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,079
- Are you sick?
- Do I look slimmer?

225
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:27,049
That's great. I'm working out
a lot these days.

226
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,650
Are you sure you're all right?

227
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:31,819
I'm totally fine.

228
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,559
Later.

229
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,259
I'll tell you everything later.

230
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,430
I've always kept my word.

231
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,430
Jeong Hoon.

232
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:44,470
Jeong Hoon.

233
00:17:45,339 --> 00:17:46,339
Lee Jeong Hoon.

234
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,839
I know it's hard.

235
00:17:52,579 --> 00:17:53,940
But let's get through this.

236
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,380
Don't crumble now.

237
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:58,750
I'll help you. I'll do everything.

238
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,019
- So...
- Can you fix my condition?

239
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:06,660
You said you'll do everything.

240
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,390
You're a doctor.

241
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:11,829
You can't, can you?

242
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,470
Then, leave me alone.

243
00:18:21,269 --> 00:18:22,970
You must be exhausted too.

244
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,710
Let's go home and rest.

245
00:18:25,339 --> 00:18:26,940
You'll be really busy
starting tomorrow.

246
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,079
We got the suspect.

247
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:30,880
The suspect was trying to steal
the drunk victim's money.

248
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,980
How could that happen?

249
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,390
How? How could this happen?

250
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:37,490
Oh, no. My poor girl.

251
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:39,990
Seo Yeon. My poor daughter.

252
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:44,059
Oh, no. Seo Yeon.

253
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:45,460
Oh, no.

254
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,359
Please don't go.

255
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:50,799
No, Seo Yeon. I'm right here.

256
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,069
Seo Yeon.

257
00:18:52,069 --> 00:18:54,470
How could someone do such a thing?

258
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:56,670
- Ha Jin, what's wrong?
- Oh, no. My poor child.

259
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:57,670
What?

260
00:18:58,009 --> 00:18:59,539
What am I going to do?

261
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:02,710
- What? It's nothing. Let's go.
- Oh, no. I can't live anymore.

262
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,880
(Funeral Hall)

263
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,819
How could this happen to my baby?

264
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,960
What are all these people
doing here?

265
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,160
Are they reporters?

266
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,359
Since when did funerals of anchors'
families become worth writing about?

267
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:21,730
I'm sure they came here
to take photos of Yeo Ha Jin.

268
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,430
Seeing how they are still here,

269
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,170
I guess they didn't
get her photo yet.

270
00:19:25,339 --> 00:19:26,569
You should hurry here.

271
00:19:26,869 --> 00:19:29,809
- My gosh, where is she?
- When is she coming?

272
00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:30,809
Hold on.

273
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,509
What is it now?
What are you going to do?

274
00:19:33,509 --> 00:19:34,750
Okay. Let go of me.

275
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,779
Excuse me, everyone.

276
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:40,380
Excuse me, everyone. Hello.

277
00:19:41,019 --> 00:19:42,190
Hi.

278
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,450
You know who I am, right?

279
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,859
I'm the director of HBN's newsroom.

280
00:19:48,259 --> 00:19:51,190
I recognize some faces.
And some faces are new to me.

281
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,529
Let me ask you one thing.

282
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,000
Are you lounging around...

283
00:19:56,369 --> 00:19:58,970
after paying respects
to the bereaved family?

284
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,269
We're all reporters here,
but this isn't right.

285
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:04,579
I know that your sense of journalism
is all messed up...

286
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:05,980
because you're just trying
to make a living.

287
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,410
Even so,

288
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:10,480
you shouldn't cross the line.
Surely, I'm not asking too much.

289
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:13,119
Did you not get that?

290
00:20:14,619 --> 00:20:16,019
Just leave!

291
00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:18,190
Don't embarrass yourselves
by staying here.

292
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:20,589
- That's right. Just go.
- But...

293
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,829
Just go.

294
00:20:22,829 --> 00:20:24,230
Leave.

295
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,529
Please leave, everyone.

296
00:20:26,029 --> 00:20:27,400
Hurry up.

297
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,869
- Come on.
- Let's just go.

298
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:32,240
- Forget it.
- What is this?

299
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,900
Let's just go. Whatever.

300
00:20:51,789 --> 00:20:55,359
She's a good person.
I'm sure she went to a good place.

301
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:56,890
Thank you.

302
00:20:57,529 --> 00:20:58,859
Please have a meal before you go.

303
00:20:58,859 --> 00:20:59,859
Okay.

304
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,769
Tae Eun, go with your father
and have a meal.

305
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:04,970
- Okay.
- When did you get here?

306
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:05,970
Are you okay?

307
00:21:06,269 --> 00:21:07,970
You must've been shocked too.

308
00:21:09,069 --> 00:21:11,410
How could this happen
out of the blue?

309
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:13,079
Let's go.

310
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,240
Okay.

311
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:19,950
What about Jeong Hoon?

312
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:22,720
He went outside for a moment.
He'll be back soon.

313
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:26,259
How is he? Is he himself?

314
00:21:27,289 --> 00:21:28,859
He's fine.

315
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:31,359
It's natural for him to grieve now.

316
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:32,859
His mother passed away.

317
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:34,460
Keep an eye on him.

318
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,069
You never know
where he'll cause trouble.

319
00:21:37,369 --> 00:21:39,339
Keep a close watch over him.

320
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,210
"Keep a close watch"?
Why should I keep a watch on him?

321
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:45,309
If you don't want to use that word,
call it "looking after" or whatever.

322
00:21:45,309 --> 00:21:47,309
There's no time
for wordplay right now.

323
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,109
Honey.

324
00:21:50,549 --> 00:21:52,920
He was out of his mind
when his girlfriend died...

325
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,420
eight years ago.

326
00:21:55,019 --> 00:21:57,089
And you also said
he'll be fine back then.

327
00:21:57,089 --> 00:21:58,420
But what happened?

328
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:01,359
He took the wheel while he was
out of his mind and almost died.

329
00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:03,690
- That's...
- And you said you're his friend...

330
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,230
before you're his doctor.

331
00:22:05,529 --> 00:22:09,069
Should a friend just sit and watch
while he slowly destroys himself?

332
00:22:09,099 --> 00:22:12,140
Dad, I'm sure he'll manage.

333
00:22:13,569 --> 00:22:15,140
Let me know if you can't do it.

334
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,140
I'll find someone else
to watch over him.

335
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:20,079
I can't
let Jeong Hoon get destroyed.

336
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:24,079
Do you know how hard I tried to
let him function as a decent human?

337
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,779
Let's eat.

338
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,799
You were home?

339
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:42,000
I thought you were at the funeral.

340
00:22:42,769 --> 00:22:44,970
Hey, I just got home.

341
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,069
How's Ha Jin?

342
00:22:48,069 --> 00:22:50,940
She must've been shocked to hear
Anchor Lee's mother passed.

343
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,880
She's all right.

344
00:22:55,809 --> 00:22:57,509
You received more of those pictures?

345
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:01,490
Yes. So Jeong Hoon had been
investigating this continuously,

346
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:04,190
including Soo Chang
and other people he's suspicious of.

347
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,660
"Other people he's suspicious of"?
Who are they?

348
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:11,289
This is about my sister.
I need to know.

349
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,369
Well, Director Ji Hyun Geun
and her manager, Moon Chul.

350
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,000
Chul?

351
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,140
I knew something was odd
about Director Ji,

352
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,410
but why Chul?

353
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:25,279
After all, he's one of
her closest associates.

354
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:28,480
Over 70 percent of stalkers are
known as acquaintances.

355
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:31,750
I'm so sorry about yesterday.

356
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,849
I had to meet a friend
who lives far away.

357
00:23:35,049 --> 00:23:36,650
I left as soon as possible,

358
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:38,519
but the traffic was
worse than I expected.

359
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:39,920
It's okay.

360
00:23:41,789 --> 00:23:43,730
Anyway, why are you suddenly here?

361
00:23:43,829 --> 00:23:46,630
Oh, because of the outfit she wore
last week for that variety show.

362
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:48,599
Eun Jeong said she has to
return it to the clothing sponsor,

363
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:49,869
so she asked me to bring it.

364
00:23:50,269 --> 00:23:52,670
What outfit? I returned everything.

365
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,940
Really?

366
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:56,769
That's odd.

367
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:00,539
She must've been confused.
I'll check.

368
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:05,480
Let us know before you come home.
Don't barge in like this.

369
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,349
Yes, I understand.

370
00:24:08,589 --> 00:24:11,390
If you don't have anything else
you need me to do, I'll get going.

371
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:12,759
Okay.

372
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,210
No, how can this happen?

373
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:33,509
How can this happen to her? No...

374
00:24:47,089 --> 00:24:48,230
Yes, Doctor Yoo.

375
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:51,559
Did you go home safely? I had
no time to greet you when you came.

376
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:56,299
Yes. How's Anchor Lee?

377
00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:00,240
It must be very tough for him.

378
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,009
And it won't be easy
for him to get better.

379
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:07,980
I don't even know
what I can say to comfort him.

380
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:11,619
Time...

381
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,690
can't help him either.

382
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:27,599
(The late Seo Mi Hyun)

383
00:26:24,289 --> 00:26:25,859
He's doing that again.

384
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,890
- He's a clean freak.
- He's very clean.

385
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,589
Why is he making a fuss?

386
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:31,359
He's very clean, that's all.

387
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:36,569
He's doing that again.
He must be awfully clean.

388
00:26:36,569 --> 00:26:39,700
Does he do this
as a part of his live news ritual?

389
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:43,509
Goodness, let him be.
He said he's sensitive to dust.

390
00:26:43,509 --> 00:26:44,769
There's no dust in there.

391
00:26:45,579 --> 00:26:47,210
He's such a drama king.

392
00:26:47,309 --> 00:26:50,180
After all, Anchor Lee is the best,
isn't he?

393
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:54,380
Wait, do you miss him already?

394
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,720
- Me?
- Yes.

395
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:59,059
Are you insane?
I just don't like him, that's all.

396
00:26:59,059 --> 00:27:01,690
I know he's just a fill-in,
but don't we have better anchors?

397
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:03,289
Even I could do better than him.

398
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:05,430
Chul Woong.

399
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:08,569
I wanted to tell you this
since yesterday.

400
00:27:08,769 --> 00:27:11,029
Yes? What is it?

401
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:13,569
You know how you count down
from three after the video?

402
00:27:13,569 --> 00:27:15,509
Can you stop doing that?

403
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:20,309
Why? I do that to tell you
when you should begin to talk...

404
00:27:20,309 --> 00:27:21,309
so that you won't make a mistake.

405
00:27:21,309 --> 00:27:23,480
I can manage to go in
without you counting,

406
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,609
so don't do it.

407
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:28,180
It's way too annoying.

408
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:30,450
The tone of your voice...

409
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:32,490
doesn't go well with me.

410
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:33,789
What are you talking about?

411
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:36,930
Who cares about
the tone of my voice?

412
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:38,160
Anyway, do that for me.

413
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:41,700
What was that?
What's so bad with my voice?

414
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,730
Hey.

415
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,740
Isn't that Anchor Lee?

416
00:27:45,869 --> 00:27:48,809
What are you talking about?
Are you lovesick?

417
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,710
There's no way he's back already...

418
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:53,480
Or there is.

419
00:27:58,049 --> 00:27:59,880
Why are you suddenly here?

420
00:28:00,349 --> 00:28:02,789
I thought today was
your mother's burial.

421
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:05,460
Yes. Thanks for filling in for me.

422
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,890
You may go now.

423
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,890
Wait, what are you talking about?

424
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:12,230
Can you bring the script to me?
I'll get ready.

425
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:13,559
What?

426
00:28:41,789 --> 00:28:42,789
Hey.

427
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:45,960
You were supposed to be away
until next week. Why are you back?

428
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,700
I don't need to be away.
I'll begin again as of today.

429
00:28:49,069 --> 00:28:50,799
That's nonsense.

430
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,940
You were at the funeral
for three whole days.

431
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,799
You can't do the news
in that condition.

432
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,309
I can do it.

433
00:28:56,309 --> 00:28:57,809
What's with you, man?

434
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,509
Hey.

435
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:06,720
Go. Go home!

436
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,589
Lee Jeong Hoon, what is this?
Why are you here?

437
00:29:08,589 --> 00:29:10,250
He's out of his mind.

438
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:12,960
He suddenly barged in
and said he'll read the news.

439
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,990
What?

440
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,890
Let me do it, Director Choi.

441
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:18,630
How can you do the news?
You're burning up with fever!

442
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:20,430
If you go on air like this,

443
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:23,000
you'll collapse
before the second story.

444
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,400
Will you give us a moment?

445
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:35,710
What are you doing here?

446
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:36,980
I can do it.

447
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,480
You know that I have
enough time to remember the script.

448
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,549
No.

449
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:44,549
You can't do the news
in this condition.

450
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,720
Director Choi.

451
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,119
Go home, get some rest,
and we'll talk again tomorrow.

452
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:52,230
No, you're coming with me
to the hospital.

453
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:54,329
I need to put you on an IV.

454
00:29:58,769 --> 00:30:00,470
I have to do the news, Director.

455
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:03,970
What is wrong with you?
Why are you so stubborn?

456
00:30:06,309 --> 00:30:07,839
It's what my mother wanted.

457
00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:10,950
So I have to do the news.

458
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:12,420
I'm sorry.

459
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:15,390
I can't let you do the news
unless I'm 100 percent confident.

460
00:30:16,619 --> 00:30:18,349
I can't gamble with the news.

461
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:21,059
You're taking a week off
no matter what.

462
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:22,059
I'll call you.

463
00:30:28,329 --> 00:30:30,069
What will change
even if I take time off?

464
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:35,509
I can't forget anything anyway.
