1
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:03,540
(Episode 30)

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,980
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

3
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,320
Why are you calling me this early?

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:12,550
Me?

5
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:15,349
I'm on my way to the airport.

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,960
The airport? Why?

7
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,660
I'm leaving
to volunteer as a doctor.

8
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:24,300
I've been thinking about this
for a while,

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,760
but I finally got
a great opportunity.

10
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:30,269
Volunteering as a doctor?
What are you talking about?

11
00:00:30,469 --> 00:00:31,469
What about your clinic?

12
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,810
I already closed it last week.

13
00:00:34,009 --> 00:00:35,539
And you're telling me this now?

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,679
On your way to the airport,
over the phone?

15
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,280
I forgot to tell you.

16
00:00:39,509 --> 00:00:42,079
Everything was decided in a flash,
so I've been out of it.

17
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,149
Right, let me say this just in case.

18
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:46,920
I'm not leaving because of you,

19
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,320
so don't take this the wrong way.

20
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,490
You don't mean that much
in my life anyway.

21
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:52,590
Don't be so hard on yourself.

22
00:00:53,859 --> 00:00:55,329
How can you joke around right now?

23
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,799
Then should I be crying?

24
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:00,869
I'm not running away.

25
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:04,769
For the first time, I seriously
thought about what I wanted to do,

26
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,840
then made this decision.

27
00:01:07,269 --> 00:01:09,209
So I mean it. Don't worry about me.

28
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:11,879
It's a relief
if that's really the case.

29
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,549
But why didn't you tell me before?
What is...

30
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,849
I couldn't even say goodbye.
What is this?

31
00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:18,920
It's not like I'm leaving for good.

32
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:22,150
I do feel a little bad
for leaving...

33
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,719
when your life is hectic.

34
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,989
So you don't know
when you'll be back?

35
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,500
I'll decide...

36
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
once I get there.

37
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:36,230
Okay, then. Be careful.

38
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,569
And report to me
as soon as you get there.

39
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:40,969
Okay. I'll call you again.

40
00:02:07,069 --> 00:02:08,069
(I took part in a campaign
for abandoned animals.)

41
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:09,569
You make a living with your image
as the nation's first love.

42
00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:11,000
How can you do that?

43
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,270
Are you happy dating
your dead friend's boyfriend?

44
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,370
Yeo Ha Jin, stop being
so fake, okay?

45
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,879
I'm getting chills.
How can you do that?

46
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,909
They're still the same.

47
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:30,560
Ha Kyung.

48
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,360
Hey, Ha Kyung.

49
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,400
I had to do something,
so I'm at the office.

50
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,210
Make sure you eat breakfast.

51
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:49,569
I'll call you in the afternoon
once I'm done with work.

52
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,979
She said she didn't have
any plans today.

53
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,699
What is this? Hey!

54
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,199
You! Hey, you jerk!

55
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,469
Hey! Who are you?

56
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,099
Hey!

57
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:21,969
Goodness.

58
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,530
Ha Jin.

59
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,259
- Hello.
- Hey, Chul.

60
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,400
Ms. Park told me that
you've been working hard lately.

61
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,469
Gosh, that's the least I could do...

62
00:03:49,469 --> 00:03:50,969
to pay you back.

63
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:52,539
Yes, keep working hard.

64
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:56,169
I'm keeping my eyes on you.

65
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:59,080
Okay. Do you want some coffee?
Or chocolate?

66
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,250
Chocolate. And don't tell Ha Kyung.

67
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,750
Okay.

68
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:11,819
Director, this is not
what you told me last time.

69
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,490
We were going to make a draft
of the contract for discussion.

70
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,800
Doesn't that mean
we're pretty much in contract?

71
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,029
The least you could've done is
tell me about this beforehand.

72
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:24,399
No, it's not like
we violated the contract.

73
00:04:24,569 --> 00:04:26,000
You can't suddenly demand penalty.

74
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,639
You can't keep changing
your statement like this.

75
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,480
This is making me very flustered.

76
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:33,310
What do you mean,
she caused controversy?

77
00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:36,079
Do you think
she's a criminal or something?

78
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:41,819
What is going on?

79
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,290
Ha Jin.

80
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:45,620
What penalty charge?

81
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,089
What contract?

82
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:51,300
Ha Jin.

83
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,899
Let's talk inside.

84
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,069
Please be honest with me.
I have the right to know.

85
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:02,310
You're right.
There's nothing I can hide.

86
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:05,839
Since Reporter Park's
did that live broadcast,

87
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:08,209
the public started to criticize you.

88
00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:10,920
We have no work at the moment.

89
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:13,079
No one's been offering us work.

90
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:16,750
What about that drama
we had a meeting for?

91
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,990
They just called and backed out.

92
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:21,589
We're trying to persuade them,

93
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:23,629
but I don't think it'll work out.

94
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:26,360
Same with the penalty charge
for the advertisement.

95
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,199
If we do that,

96
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:30,670
the other places
will demand theirs as well.

97
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,810
As of now, I don't know
what we should do.

98
00:05:37,709 --> 00:05:39,379
I didn't know it'd be this bad.

99
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:42,480
It's not like
you did something terrible.

100
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,620
Does she deserve all this hate?

101
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,980
That stalker is the bad guy.
I don't understand...

102
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,990
why she should take the blame
just because she's a celebrity.

103
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,889
Is there absolutely no work?

104
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:55,430
I don't need to be the female lead.
I can play a villainess.

105
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,629
I'm willing to do anything.

106
00:05:57,459 --> 00:05:59,459
Everyone is hesitant
about hiring you,

107
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:00,870
so I don't think it'll work.

108
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,339
If that doesn't work,
we could go abroad.

109
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,040
"Abroad"?

110
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,339
Yes. It's not a big role.

111
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,740
But it's a nice character.

112
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,750
How far have you guys talked?

113
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,649
First of all,

114
00:06:15,649 --> 00:06:18,449
they suggested having a meeting.

115
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,079
You need to try out
for the audition.

116
00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:22,350
I had been postponing that offer...

117
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,759
because your schedule was so hectic.

118
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:31,000
Should I tell them that
we'd like to try it out?

119
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:37,470
You want to switch the news anchor?
What do you mean?

120
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:40,269
I'm sure you know what I mean.

121
00:06:40,269 --> 00:06:41,910
After Jeong Hoon became
the news anchor,

122
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:45,110
we've been at the top
when it came to news quality,

123
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,350
viewer ratings, and credibility.

124
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:49,480
It'd be ridiculous
to swap him for someone else.

125
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,120
Everyone is against him.

126
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,519
Our viewer ratings
have been dropping for a week now.

127
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:55,949
Our viewers have been bombarding
the bulletin board for a long time.

128
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:00,730
We need to replace him
if we want to save the news.

129
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:02,459
So what if the ratings went down?

130
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:05,399
After all, he's the one
who raised the ratings.

131
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,670
And this will all subside
after some time.

132
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:11,839
- So please...
- I don't want to hear it.

133
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:14,509
I'm not going to change my mind.

134
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:18,779
I just want you
to do as you're told.

135
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,579
Then you'll have to fire me as well.

136
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,290
You...

137
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:40,029
Do they not clean the machine?
The coffee tastes terrible.

138
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,399
It's probably because
you're troubled. It's tasty for me.

139
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:43,939
Why aren't you troubled?

140
00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:45,899
Aren't we on the same news team?

141
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,110
Do I look like a pushover to you?
Why are you venting at me?

142
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,579
Gosh. I want to vent at someone.

143
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,579
Our viewers have given us nothing
but compliments.

144
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,550
They've never criticized us before.

145
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:58,720
You're right.

146
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,889
It's all thanks to that scumbag
who blabbered such nonsense.

147
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:05,259
You're right.
What was that jerk's name again?

148
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:06,990
It's Park Soo Chang.

149
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,459
Yes, him.

150
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:11,500
If I ever see him, I'll...

151
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:12,800
Hello.

152
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:15,670
It's been a long time,
Reporter Choi.

153
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:17,569
Sir.

154
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,399
Are you okay?

155
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,209
Me? Why?

156
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:24,439
Your team is having it rough
right now...

157
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,110
because of Jeong Hoon.
And to make things worse,

158
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:29,649
Director Choi's future
doesn't look too great either.

159
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:33,220
Her future doesn't look too great?
What are you talking about?

160
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:42,659
Is something wrong?

161
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,200
I don't want to talk about it
with you.

162
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,970
That must mean...

163
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:53,909
it's related to me.

164
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,840
What is it?

165
00:08:55,909 --> 00:08:58,409
Thanks to you two
being awfully close,

166
00:08:58,409 --> 00:09:00,139
I can never have peace.

167
00:09:01,179 --> 00:09:03,279
Is something going on with her?

168
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,049
The president wanted to replace you.

169
00:09:06,049 --> 00:09:08,450
And of course, she said no.

170
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,250
So they're discussing
whether to appoint...

171
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,159
Mr. Han of business
as the new director.

172
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,029
What? That's absurd.

173
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,700
How could they replace her
that easily?

174
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,799
She received her first warning
last time...

175
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:22,399
from the disciplinary committee.

176
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,399
Don't you know that two strikes
are all that you need to get fired?

00:10:15,049 --> 00:10:16,090
Come in.

180
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:24,529
If you're done with the news,
you should have gone home.

181
00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:25,629
Why are you here?

182
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,169
I have something to tell you.

183
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:31,769
Why does my heart pound...

184
00:10:31,769 --> 00:10:34,639

(Letter of Resignation)

187
00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:46,620
Thank you for allowing me
to be the news anchor.

188
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,590
I was especially honored...

189
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,519
to have worked
with someone like you.

190
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:54,629
You put up with whatever I did.

191
00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:57,090
And thanks to that, I was able
to do everything that I wanted.

192
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,659
Why are you doing this?

193
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:04,100
I don't want to trouble you anymore
with my personal issues.

194
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,269
I hope you will keep your job

Please accept it.

198
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,379
I've never thought of "News Live"
without you.

199
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:19,779
And I will continue
to think that way.

200
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,149
So cut this nonsense
and take this with you.

Hey.

00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:04,200
Why aren't you asleep? It's late.

209
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:07,330
I wanted to hear your voice
before going to bed.

210
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:14,139
Actually, there's something
I need to confess.

211
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,909
What is it?

212
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:19,409
It's nothing good.

I submitted
my letter of resignation today.

214
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,720
Why all of a sudden?

215
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:31,590
My workplace has been in a pickle
because of the current situation.

216
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:34,690
The higher-ups wanted to replace me.

217

If I were to remain there,

218
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:38,399
Director Choi would also have
to take responsibility.

219

I'm sorry I couldn't
discuss it with you beforehand.

220
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,799
I hope you still like me even though
I'm no longer a news anchor.

221
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:49,539
You liked to address me that way.

222
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:52,980
I'm a bit sad about that.

223
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:59,620
But I'll call you by your first name
from now on.

224
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:05,820
That sounds too awkward.

225
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,090
I know.

226
00:13:10,929 --> 00:13:11,929
Then...

227
00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:16,269
I'll just call you Anchor Lee
for the time being.

228
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,639
Sounds good.

229
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:26,909
Are you okay?

230
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,879
Yes, I am.

231
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,720
How about you?

232
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,490
I'm all right.

233
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,190
Okay.

234
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:48,200
So, you don't have to go to work
starting tomorrow?

235
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,370
They need to look
for my replacement,

236
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,340
and I need to teach them
a few things.

237
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:56,340
I'll still be going there
for some time.

238
00:13:58,639 --> 00:13:59,809
You must be exhausted.

239
00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:03,210
You should go to bed.

240
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,820
Okay. You should too.

241
00:14:10,289 --> 00:14:12,590
Let's talk again tomorrow.

242
00:14:15,629 --> 00:14:16,759
Goodnight.

243
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:19,860
Goodnight.

244
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:25,230
You startled me.

245
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:28,429
What are you doing in the dark?

246
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,570
Ha Kyung.

247
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:36,669
Yes, what is it?

248
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:41,950
I need to go to the States.

249
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,519
I'll do the movie.
Talk to Ms. Park for me.

250
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:48,190
It's pretty far.

251
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:50,049
And surviving there won't be easy.

252
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,289
Do you still want to do it?

253
00:15:56,129 --> 00:15:58,960
I think it's the right path for now.

254
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:03,370
I should go.

255
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:19,320
Guess who I am.

256
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,990
I can see your shadow.

257
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,759
You're right. How smart.

258
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,759
Aren't you hungry? Let's go and eat.

259
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:29,029
Sundaetguk?

260
00:16:29,429 --> 00:16:30,690
Was that a lame offer?

261
00:16:31,129 --> 00:16:33,029
- Or back-bone stew?
- I'm going to the States.

262
00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:35,570
Are you going on a trip?
Good for you.

263
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,470
When are you going?
How long is the trip?

264
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,200
Sit down.

265
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:46,080
It's not a trip.

266
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,980
If I go, it might take years
before I come back.

267
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,450
What do you mean?

268
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:51,980
My sister is going to film
a movie in the States.

269
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:54,850
A while ago, she had an offer.

270
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:58,620
To be honest, things are really bad
for my sister's profession,

271
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,519
so I can't stop her.

272
00:17:01,289 --> 00:17:03,460
Then, how long will you stay there?

273
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,799
I can't give you a definite answer,

274
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:08,799
but it will take longer than a year.

275
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,200
It could take longer than that.

276
00:17:17,779 --> 00:17:19,210
I know we just started dating.

277
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:20,609
I'm sorry that I have to leave.

278
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,049
To be honest,
I can't ask you to wait for me.

279
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,789
I'll accept it
if you want to break up.

280
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,490
Do you want to break up with me?

281
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:38,859
Is that what you want?

282
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,299
No.

283
00:17:43,569 --> 00:17:45,799
- Then, it's all good.
- What's good?

284
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:47,569
I don't want to break up with you.

285
00:17:47,569 --> 00:17:49,069
And I don't want us to be apart.

286
00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:51,640
- So I'll find a way.
- A way?

287
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,009
I'll go to the States with you.
As a correspondent.

288
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:56,950
Can you get that position
if you just want it?

289
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,150
Not really.

290
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:59,480
But a while ago,
they were recruiting...

291
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,779
correspondents to be dispatched
in the States.

292
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:03,849
Look at that. Perhaps,
we're meant to be together.

293
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:05,160
It's the perfect timing.

294
00:18:05,789 --> 00:18:07,759
Then, will you get the job
if you apply?

295
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:10,430
I've never failed at getting a job
after applying for it.

296
00:18:12,029 --> 00:18:13,029
What if you don't get it?

297
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,130
I'll get it. Don't worry.

298
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:21,240
My gosh. I don't think
it's that simple.

299
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,509
Right. Does Jeong Hoon
know about this?

300
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,309
That Ha Jin is going to the States?

301
00:18:33,349 --> 00:18:37,720
Hi. Ha Kyung. What brings you here?

302
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:42,430
I'm not sure if you've heard.

303
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:46,930
My sister is leaving soon.

304
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:49,900
To the States.

305
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,240
What?

306
00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:13,819
(Anchor Lee)

307
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:46,559
You're here.

308
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,559
How's the packing going?

309
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,500
Ha Kyung told me.

310
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,700
Why didn't you tell me?

311
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,170
You thought I wouldn't let you go
if you told me?

312
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,380
- I'm very good at waiting.
- Thank you for everything.

313
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:14,990
Thanks to you, I was very happy.

314
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:22,390
Those moments with you
were the brightest of my life.

315
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:28,029
And that will never change.

316
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,710
You won't be able to erase me...

317
00:20:38,009 --> 00:20:39,809
in your memory.

318
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:45,950
But let our memory
belong in our past.

319
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,619
I promised that...

320
00:20:52,789 --> 00:20:55,230
I would always be there for you
to cheer you on.

321
00:20:59,099 --> 00:21:00,799
But having me by your side...

322
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:05,400
will make things harder now, right?

323
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,640
Yes.

324
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:20,549
By being together,

325
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:24,420
we will only be hurting each other.

326
00:21:30,859 --> 00:21:32,160
This is the right thing to do.

327
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,269
If that's what you want,

328
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,910
let's do that.

329
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:56,920
I'm going to give it my all.

330
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,759
I want you...

331
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:05,759
to give it your all too,
so you don't think about me.

332
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,710
I will remember
every moment of you.

333
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,450
Take care.

334
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:41,059
I won't cry today.

335
00:22:45,269 --> 00:22:48,000
I don't want you...

336
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:52,240
to remember me with a crying face.

337
00:23:13,029 --> 00:23:14,559
(2 years later)

338
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,569
Gosh, what a day.

339
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,009
Goodness.

340
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,710
- There she is.
- Look. She's here.

341
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,079
- There she is.
- Hey.

342
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,549
Ma'am, it's your first day back
after getting your charge acquitted.

343
00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:33,549
How does it feel?

344
00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:35,150
You were suspected
to have abused your husband.

345
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:37,220
Things must've been rough
for you. Say something about it.

346
00:23:38,089 --> 00:23:41,460
My innocence was finally proved
in court,

347
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,460
so I'm relieved.

348
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:45,460
Congratulations on getting
your assault charge acquitted.

349
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,599
I heard you hired
over eight lawyers...

350
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:52,640
from the biggest law firm in Korea.

351
00:23:53,339 --> 00:23:56,269
You must have formed a dream team.

352
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,440
Mr. Lee Jeong Hoon.

353
00:23:59,609 --> 00:24:01,009
Thank you for your compliment.

354
00:24:01,009 --> 00:24:03,279
By the way,
will you form the same team...

355
00:24:03,579 --> 00:24:05,650
when you get indicted
for a murder charge?

356
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,319
Murder?

357
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:14,559
On the 23rd of last month,
the day of your 2nd trial,

358
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,529
you hired an illegal detective
agency to introduce...

359
00:24:17,529 --> 00:24:20,130
someone who would do
anything for money.

360
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,829
I don't know where and what kind
of rumors you've heard...

361
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:26,799
On the night of the 24th, you met
a man the agency introduced to you.

362
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,710
You secretly rendezvoused
with him at work.

363
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:31,009
And you talked to him
over eight times afterward.

364
00:24:31,309 --> 00:24:34,779
Meanwhile, your husband,
Sim Jae Chul, went missing...

365
00:24:34,779 --> 00:24:38,750
along with the video evidence he was
going to hand over to the judge.

366
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,319
I do not remember doing that.

367
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:45,119
It hasn't even been two weeks.
There's no way you already forgot.

368
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:46,490
You can't accuse me...

369
00:24:47,289 --> 00:24:49,990
as a murderer
after I was just found innocent.

370
00:24:52,529 --> 00:24:54,559
Do you really think
you can deal with this?

371
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,470
It's a recording of a whistle-blower
and the call history.

372
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:02,769
Do you really think
you can deal with this?

373
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,279
There they are.

374
00:25:06,779 --> 00:25:09,250
You can ask them
for the original file.

375
00:25:12,349 --> 00:25:13,450
Ms. Kang.

376
00:25:13,819 --> 00:25:17,049
You're arrested for suspicion of
your husband, Sim Jae Chul's murder.

377
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,119
- Arrest her.
- Yes, sir.

378
00:25:19,859 --> 00:25:22,460
I think...
I think there is a misunderstanding.

379
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,829
- No, I didn't.
- Let's go.

380
00:25:24,829 --> 00:25:26,960
Hey, let me go. Take these off.

381
00:25:27,099 --> 00:25:28,099
- Let's go.
- Who do you think you are?

382
00:25:28,099 --> 00:25:29,930
- Wait!
- Let me go!

383
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,799
- What are you doing?
- What's going on?

384
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:33,740
- Arrested for murder?
- Tell us the details!

385
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,309
- Say something!
- Why did you kill him?

386
00:25:36,309 --> 00:25:38,880
- Do you admit to your crime?
- Tell us more!

387
00:25:39,009 --> 00:25:41,240
- Say something before you go!
- Do you admit?

388
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:50,190
Jeong Hoon.

389
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:53,119
You've done something huge again.

390
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,990
It's not the first time
I got my hands on a big scoop.

391
00:25:57,259 --> 00:25:58,400
What a show-off.

392
00:25:58,529 --> 00:26:00,299
- What did you say?
- You heard that?

393
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,329
I keep saying how I feel out loud.

394
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:04,630
Take this.

395
00:26:04,769 --> 00:26:06,799
That's a voice recording
of the informant...

396
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,710
who called the prosecution
regarding what Ms. Kang did.

397
00:26:09,309 --> 00:26:11,009
Edit in whatever we need
for the news.

398
00:26:11,009 --> 00:26:13,680
Thank you.
How long will the article take?

399
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,450
- About an hour.
- Okay, then.

400
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:16,980
I'll let Mr. Kim know.

401
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:17,980
Hurry up and go.

402
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:20,650
You'll get scolded by Mr. Kim
if you lurk around here.

403
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:22,849
Gosh. I'm leaving.

404
00:26:24,089 --> 00:26:26,859
(City Desk Reporter Lee Jeong Hoon)

405
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:31,559
Hey, Anchor Cha.

406
00:26:31,859 --> 00:26:33,259
Hello. Goodbye.

407
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:34,900
Keep it up. Yes, sir.

408
00:26:40,769 --> 00:26:41,839
Hello.

409
00:26:42,369 --> 00:26:44,140
- Hello.
- Hello.

410

("Cha Seon Woo's News Live")

411
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:05,829
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

412
00:27:20,009 --> 00:27:23,250
Hello, viewers.
I'm Cha Seon Woo of "News Live".

413
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:26,650
Director Kang Do Young of
Seongjae Group was...

414
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:29,619
arrested by the prosecution
for murder this afternoon.

415
00:27:29,619 --> 00:27:31,190
Reported by Jo Il Kwon.

416
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:34,759
Director Kang Do Young of
Seongjae Group was...

417
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:37,759
recently found innocent for
habitual assault of her husband.

418
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:40,599
Lee Jeong Hoon! Can you hear me?

419
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,569
Hey! It's you, Lee Jeong Hoon.

420
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:53,309
Don't you have any friends?

421
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:56,380
Why do you always call me
when you get drunk?

422
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:59,220
I do have one. A girlfriend.

423
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,119
But she went far away
because of you.

424
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:06,089
I want to pat
my dear Ha Kyung's head.

425
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,130
I only get to
see her on video calls.

426
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:13,359
This time, I really thought
I'd be a correspondent.

427
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:18,000
Are you all right?
Don't you miss Ha Jin?

428
00:28:18,869 --> 00:28:21,170
She's filming another movie there.

429
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,039
What if I never get to see Ha Kyung?

430
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,480
Gosh.

431
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:38,519
Jeong Hoon, let's go eat.

432
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,589
I don't have an appetite.

433
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:41,829
What do you want?

434
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:43,059
What?

435
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:49,230
This is good for you. Eat up.

436
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,140
Why are you suddenly doing this?
You're making me anxious.

437
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,809
Hey, am I not allowed to
buy you a meal?

438
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,740
I think
I've gone through this before.

439
00:28:59,609 --> 00:29:01,009
Do you have a favor to ask?

440
00:29:01,009 --> 00:29:03,150
What favor? It's not like that.

441
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:05,480
Eat up.
It won't be as good when it's cold.

442
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:13,319
This is good.
This place definitely cooks well.

443
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:18,559
- Let me ask you for a favor.
- I didn't eat anything yet.

444
00:29:23,269 --> 00:29:24,930
It's too big to call it a favor.

445
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,740
I think I'll call it begging.

446
00:29:28,569 --> 00:29:29,940
What is it?

447
00:29:30,109 --> 00:29:32,109
Can you take charge
of "News Live" again?

448
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,609
- What?
- You spent enough time away.

449
00:29:35,609 --> 00:29:37,210
Aren't you dying to return too?

450
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:38,980
No, not at all.

451
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,019
I love my life now.

452
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,589
I like going out on the field,

453
00:29:43,589 --> 00:29:45,789
and I like having free time
at nights.

454
00:29:45,789 --> 00:29:48,789
Like, my foot. You don't even have
anything to do after work.

455
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:50,059
How did you know?

456
00:29:50,329 --> 00:29:54,599
Hey, the new president has
a very favorable attitude about you.

457
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,029
He's on our side now,
so there's no need to turn it down.

458
00:29:57,029 --> 00:29:59,470
Return to "News Live".
That's where you belong.

459
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,710
People haven't
forgotten about me yet.

460
00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:05,509
Once I'm shown on TV again,

461
00:30:06,309 --> 00:30:08,079
things will get chaotic very soon.

462
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:09,950
Yes, that could be the case.

463
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:12,480
But people are more concerned
about the news you bring...

464
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,650
than your love life.

465
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:17,920
And there are a lot of people
who want you to deliver the news.

466
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,490
And above all, I need you.

467
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,259
If "News Live" continues like this,

468
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:26,299
it might get taken down.

469
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:29,230
I plead you. Won't you do it?

470
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:33,299
Jeong Hoon. Hey, Jeong Hoon.
Come on, Jeong Hoon. Please.

471
00:30:33,569 --> 00:30:35,740
Please, do it. Just once.

472
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:39,309
Yes, Jeong Hoon.
Are you coming tonight?

473
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,809
Yes, I'm on my way.

474
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:44,910
Instead of eating out,
let's cook at home tonight.

475
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:48,380
I became a pretty decent cook now.

476
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,589
You said that last time.
You can't fool me again.

477
00:30:51,589 --> 00:30:54,589
I'm serious.
I'll make spicy noodles for you.

478
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:57,960
I made a reservation
at a great place, so let's eat out.

479
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,230
Make me the noodles next time.

480
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,529
Okay, then.
I'll make it for you next time.

481
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:03,730
See you soon.
