1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,169
Hello.

2
00:00:03,509 --> 00:00:05,839
I'm the guy who's dating Yeong.

3
00:00:10,419 --> 00:00:11,550
Seo Yeon and I...

4
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:13,250
Right.

5
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:17,219
I'm the guy who's dating Yeong.

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,690
I...

7
00:00:23,329 --> 00:00:25,399
love her a lot.

8
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:46,320
You remembered, didn't you?

9
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,460
Then...

10
00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:54,460
you can't do this to Seo Yeon.

(Yeo Ha Kyung)

12
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,340
One second.

13
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,340
- Yes, Anchor Lee.
- Tell Ha Jin to leave right away.

14
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,379
She's doing a fan signing event.
She'll be done soon.

15
00:01:11,379 --> 00:01:13,010
I have no time to explain.

16
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:15,109
You have to stop the event
and get her out of there now.

17
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,859
(Yeo Ha Jin's Fan Signing Event)

18
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,500
- What?
- Ha Jin!

19
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,900
- Ha Jin!
- Ha Jin!

20
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,329
- Ha Jin!
- Ha Jin!

21
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:37,299
- Ha Jin!
- Ha Jin, what's wrong?

22
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,840
- Wake up, Ha Jin. Hey.
- Ha Jin!

23
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,810
Can someone call 911?

24
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,959
(Find Me in Your Memory)

25
00:01:58,189 --> 00:01:59,890
(Episode 25)

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,060
Ha Kyung.

27
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,730
You're here.

28
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,930
What happened?

29
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:10,800
Nothing's particularly wrong
with her.

30
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,740
She must have been overwhelmed
with a lot of work lately.

31
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:21,080
Did you see anyone suspicious
during the fan signing event?

32
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:25,580
There was a huge crowd,
and no one stood out.

33
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,689
Today, a lifer ran away
from the National Forensic Hospital.

34
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:33,090
He ran away in that direction,
so I got worried and called you.

35
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,930
This isn't a dangerous situation
for her, is it?

36
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,099
Don't worry.
He'll be caught very soon.

37
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,300
I see.

38
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,110
You won't have any trouble
with your everyday life...

39
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,939
if you continue to do
your rehabilitation exercise.

40
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:39,759
Ha Na.

41
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,830
I can do this by myself.

42
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:46,530
Right. I'm sorry.

43
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,439
I can do this by myself, so go.

44
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:05,449
I'm sorry.

45
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,910
But sadly,

46
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,910
you won't be able
to do ballet again.

47
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,550
Hey, Jeong Hoon.

48
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:13,889
I'm at Ha Na's hospital.

49
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,120
Yes. I think so.

50
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,759
Ha Jin, where are you going
at this hour?

51
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,959
Yeong was here,

52
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,439
but I avoided seeing her again.

53
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:33,670
She must be heartbroken
because of me.

54
00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:36,839
It's late,
so let's call her again tomorrow.

55
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,139
I mean, it wasn't her fault.

56
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,050
Do you think she'll be back?

57
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,149
Of course.

58
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,449
Don't worry about that
and go to sleep.

59
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,110
Hello.

60
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:15,509
You're Yeo Ha Jin, aren't you?

61
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,079
Who are you?

62
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:21,019
Seo Yeon and I...

63
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,750
Right.

64
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,589
I'm the guy who's dating Yeong.

65
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:35,670
I've heard a lot about you
from Seo Yeon.

66
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,670
She said you're her best friend,

67
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:40,910
and that you're
the most precious person to her.

68
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,740
Yeong said that?

69
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:47,509
Yes, so much so that I get jealous.

70
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,449
Seo Yeon is the most precious to me.

71
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:56,120
That's why
I always wanted to meet you.

72
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,220
Right, and I have
a favor to ask of you.

73
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:01,889
A favor?

74
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:05,829
Seo Yeon and I got into a fight,

75
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:07,870
and I wanted to make up with her,

76
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:10,470
so I prepared a surprise for her.

77
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:15,670
But I still don't know the passcode
to her practice room.

78
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,579
I thought you might know,
so I wanted to ask you.

79
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,870
Ha Jin, you're up.

80
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,699
Are you feeling ill?
Are you all right?

81
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,269
I have to go somewhere.
Can you drive me?

82
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:50,269
Right now?

83
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,610
You can't go anywhere
in this condition.

84
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:54,980
Ha Jin.

85
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:56,709
Ha Jin!

86
00:07:57,149 --> 00:07:58,779
Why are you doing this?

87
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:00,149
Why haven't you told me?

88
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,889
Why did you lie to me?
Why did you let me forget? Why?

89
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:05,790
Ha Jin...

90
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,089
How could I forget Yeong?

91
00:08:11,899 --> 00:08:13,870
Don't you remember how Yeong died?

92
00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:17,899
Don't you know who caused her death
and why she died? How can I...

93
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,629
I should visit her.

94
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:44,860
Where was he last spotted?

95
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,669
He was spotted three hours ago
at J Shopping Mall.

96
00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:49,100
That was the last of him.

97
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,529
No one has spotted him ever since.

98
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,639
The police put out an APB.

99
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,809
Where have you been amidst all this?

100
00:08:54,809 --> 00:08:57,110
- Come join the meeting right now.
- Okay.

101
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:01,009
The main news team didn't have
enough time,

102
00:09:01,009 --> 00:09:04,080
so they're only going to brief
the viewers in the beginning.

103
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:07,590
I think our program will have
to give an in-depth briefing.

104
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,690
That means this will be
breaking news.

105
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:10,690
Right.

106
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:13,220
Gosh, which news
am I supposed to omit?

107
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:17,129
How about receiving
real-time reports from our viewers?

108
00:09:17,129 --> 00:09:18,860
Are you serious?

109
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:23,070
Yes. Moon Seong Ho was arrested
for murder.

110
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,370
We need to catch him
before he commits another murder.

111
00:09:28,269 --> 00:09:30,309
That is true.

112
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:32,240
Since the police
have put out an APB,

113
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,250
let's ask them
to share their information.

114
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,210
And let's ask for real-time reports.

115
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:38,279
Do you think we have enough time?

116
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:40,320
We can make time.

117
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,720
But what if they catch him
before our news begins?

118
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,389
I mean, that's good news.

119
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:45,860
It won't be that easy.

120
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,730
He risked his life
to escape from prison.

121
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:51,230
He's going to hold out
until he gets what he wants.

122
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:54,070
I'll report this to the higher-ups.

123
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:56,769
First, contact the police...

124
00:09:56,769 --> 00:09:59,139
and look up information about him.

125
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:01,840
Okay. I'll call the police.

126
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,340
I'll look for a forensic artist.

127
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:07,379
Wouldn't it be helpful to show
photos of him...

128
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:09,909
with long hair or glasses?

129
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,549
Smart move.

130
00:10:11,549 --> 00:10:15,149
If you have any other ideas,
share it with us.

131
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,389
Let's get busy.

132
00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:17,419
Yes, ma'am.

133
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,610
(Ha Jin)

134
00:11:02,269 --> 00:11:03,470
I'll wait here.

135
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,220
(Jung Seo Yeon)

136
00:11:38,169 --> 00:11:39,269
I'm sorry.

137
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,879
It took me so long, right?

138
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,919
I'm truly sorry for being so late.

139
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:58,090
I really am.

140
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:22,909
Father.

141
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,080
What happened?

142
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,149
The police called.
Did you get into an accident?

143
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:32,889
It's only a mild concussion.
You don't need to worry.

144
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:35,960
Did Jeong Hoon call you
by any chance?

145
00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:37,730
Why would he?

146
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:42,029
Seo Yeon's stalker
escaped from prison.

147
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:43,570
What?

148
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:46,700
There's only one reason why
he'd escape.

149
00:12:47,539 --> 00:12:49,070
He probably wants
to avenge Seo Yeon.

150
00:12:49,809 --> 00:12:53,210
He's probably after Jeong Hoon
or Yeo Ha Jin.

151
00:12:54,409 --> 00:12:56,750
I didn't tell the police
about Jeong Hoon,

152
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:01,220
so keep an eye on him.

153
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:06,559
The stalker had harmed himself
in order to escape.

154
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,330
I should've caught onto it.

155
00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:11,059
Let me get this right.

156
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:15,070
Seo Yeon's murderer escaped,

157
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:19,169
and you're involved in all this?

158
00:13:19,169 --> 00:13:20,909
That's not what's important
right now.

159
00:13:20,909 --> 00:13:23,840
How far are you going to take this?

160
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,080
Are you sane?

161
00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:29,879
Do you even know how much danger
you had put yourself in?

162
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:32,220
What were you planning to do
after meeting with the murderer?

163
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,389
What's going on in your head?

164
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,549
Don't you dare talk

something happens
to Jeong Hoon or Ha Jin,

I will never forgive you.

168
00:14:02,549 --> 00:14:04,850
Ha Jin, I'm coming in.

169
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:09,990

Ha Jin.

171
00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:20,629
I'm going to open the door.

172
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,580
Ha Jin, don't be like this.

173
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:38,120
Are you going to repeat
what you did in the past?

174
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:41,120
No sleep, no food. Are you going
to not take care of yourself?

175
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:46,059
It's about time you stopped.
It's been eight years already.

176
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:48,389
You should focus on yourself now.

They'll keep sending more,
so make sure you get them.

There's the number of the detective
who was in charge.

Of course.
And a very competent one, at that.

I'll write up a list of questions
and give them to you.

Come on. I can do that much.

Hello, sir. This is Lee Jeong Hoon.

195
00:15:50,789 --> 00:15:54,159
Hello. You're calling
because of Moon Seong Ho, right?

196
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:58,230
Yes. How did he escape?

197
00:15:58,629 --> 00:16:01,000
I believe he was already planning
an escape...

198
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,330
when he had harmed himself.

199
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:06,240
I should've known.

200
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,070

on our program.

that he caused himself?"

"What should we watch out for
if we run into him?"

as possible.

Did you throw away my belongings?

212
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,180
What belongings?

213
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:25,519
My old diary and the photos
Seo Yeon and I took.

214

Why do you ask?

216
00:17:34,589 --> 00:17:36,160
I guess you still have them.

Hi, Ha Jin.

226
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:08,750
I got worried
when I couldn't reach you.

227
00:19:09,019 --> 00:19:10,720
Where are you?
Did you get discharged?

You said you got injured
and stopped doing ballet, right?

Didn't you ask me once...

243
00:20:14,049 --> 00:20:15,589
if I knew Jung Seo Yeon?

244
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,619
By Jung Seo Yeon, are we...

00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,589
talking about the same person
we both know?

that I was Seo Yeon's friend, right?

I wasn't sure
if telling you the truth...

252
00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:45,450
was the right thing to do.

253
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,420
I shouldn't have asked you out.

254
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:53,759
I should have stopped pursuing you
when you pushed me away.

255
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:56,190
I am so sorry.

256
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:58,599
I think I caused you a lot of pain
all this time.

No, it's not your fault.

258
00:21:00,529 --> 00:21:02,700
No, you don't know anything...

259
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:04,740
and what I have done.

260
00:21:06,569 --> 00:21:09,609
I just realized
why it was hard to figure you out.

261
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:13,839
It sounded like you were
always telling me the truth,

262
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:16,480
but it didn't feel completely true.

263
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:20,049
It felt like
you were telling me a lot,

264
00:21:20,049 --> 00:21:22,619
but you weren't telling me anything
at the same time.

265
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,420
It was all because of Seo Yeon.

266
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:28,759
I finally learned
everything about you now.

267
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:33,099
But I don't know what to do.

268
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:37,400
I did expect that you would regain
your memory one day.

269
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,599
My heart was always heavy...

270
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:43,210
when I thought about the pain you'd
feel after getting your memory back.

271
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:46,009
I'm sure you must be
very confused right now.

272
00:21:46,109 --> 00:21:48,309
But nothing will change, Ha Jin.

273
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,849
It's all in the past.

274
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:53,380
I really can't think right now.

275
00:21:55,349 --> 00:21:57,150
I don't know what to do.

276
00:22:01,289 --> 00:22:02,289

let me know right away. Okay?

- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

286
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:27,720
Jeong Hoon gave me these photos.

287
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,049
All of these photos?

288

Yes.

289
00:22:30,619 --> 00:22:32,359
My gosh,
this is what I hate that guy.

290
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:34,019
He's too perfect.

291
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,960
How did he get all of those photos?

292
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,259
When he's done with his lines,
put these photos on the screen.

Yes, sir.

294
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:43,099
Hey, Jeong Hoon. How did
you get all of those photos?

295
00:22:43,099 --> 00:22:45,000
I got the tip through
my personal connection.

296
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,400
I see. You're still a journalist
with connections.

The screenshot of the footage
is the most recent photo.

298
00:22:50,509 --> 00:22:53,079
When I checked, it was clearer
than the one from the CCTV.

299
00:22:53,309 --> 00:22:54,779
Use that as the main photo.

300
00:22:54,779 --> 00:22:57,009
Okay. Run the title.

at the National Forensic Hospital
escaped from a hospital...

310
00:23:15,829 --> 00:23:18,269
- while he was being treated.
- Get his photo ready.

311
00:23:18,269 --> 00:23:21,670
As soon as the police received
the report, they put out an APB.

312
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:24,609
They're using all of their resources
to locate Moon Seong Ho.

313
00:23:24,609 --> 00:23:27,309
However, they still haven't
located the prisoner.

314
00:23:27,309 --> 00:23:29,309
In an attempt to help
the nationwide search...

315
00:23:29,309 --> 00:23:31,309
and the police
to locate the prisoner,

316
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:33,279
we will be taking calls
from the viewers.

317
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:34,920
Wait. Are they short-staffed?

about the prisoner.

320

- This is the 40-year-old prisoner,
- Get the video ready.

321

- Play the video.
- Moon Seong Ho.

he was just leaving the hospital.

at the man on the screen.

murdered a woman eight years ago...

and was locked up
at the National Forensic Hospital.

326
00:24:01,549 --> 00:24:03,880
- Yes. I see.
- His height is 180cm.

327
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,480
- And he has a slim build.
- This is "News Live".

328
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,319
- And he has gray hair.
- Yes. Go on.

329
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:09,789
- Close up on his wrist injury.
- As for a distinctive feature,

330
00:24:09,789 --> 00:24:12,089
he has an old scar
on the left side of his neck.

331
00:24:12,089 --> 00:24:16,259
And he also has a recent injury
on this left wrist.

332
00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:19,829
It's been confirmed that
his mental state is very unstable.

333
00:24:19,829 --> 00:24:21,359
In order to catch
the prisoner swiftly,

334
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:24,230
getting cooperation from the public
is the most important.

335
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:27,039
Please take the initiative
to call us with any reports.

336
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,009
- Hello? Yes.
- Hello.

337
00:24:30,009 --> 00:24:31,579
- This is "News Live".
- Did you get it?

338
00:24:31,579 --> 00:24:32,880
What's happening?

339
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,710
A lot of people are calling
the police and our TV station.

340
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,880
Answer them and give the police
any information we get.

341
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,880
Okay.

342
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:41,789
Hello? Yes. This is HBN News.

343
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:45,660
Ma'am, you have to answer that.
You need to answer it.

344
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,490
Hello, this is "News Live".

345
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:51,130
A murderer who brutally
murdered a woman...

346
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:53,230
escaped today.

347
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:56,099
He managed to escape
from our legal system.

348
00:24:56,099 --> 00:24:59,740
And the man who inserted himself
among the people was smiling.

349
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:05,039
Will you watch him point his knife
at another innocent victim?

350
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,640
- Here.
- It's time for us...

351
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,380
- It's 2 dollars and 20 cents.
- to make it aware...

352
00:25:08,579 --> 00:25:09,680
that Moon Seong Ho...

353
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:12,079
is nothing
but a shameless prisoner...

354
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:14,920
who won't be able to do anything.

355
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:19,220
I'd like to ask for your cooperation
and attention to the manhunt.

356
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,859
Excuse me.
I'll put them in a plastic bag.

357
00:25:21,859 --> 00:25:24,130
This is all for today.

358
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,200
- Have a goodnight.
- Wait.

359
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,200
Excuse me!

360
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,509
We got a lot of reports,

361
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:46,450
but we didn't get anything
to confirm his whereabouts.

362
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:48,589
Nonetheless, a lot of people are
aware of his escape now.

363
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:50,420
We'll be able to catch him soon.

364
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,420
Thank you.

365
00:25:52,619 --> 00:25:54,960
You can thank me
after you catch him.

366
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,930
Call me if there's progress.

367
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,329
Okay, sure.

368
00:26:10,609 --> 00:26:12,509
You did very well with today's news.

369
00:26:12,509 --> 00:26:15,279
The more I think about it,
the more frustrating it seems.

370
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,819
We could have gotten him
if they were a few minutes faster.

371
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:22,349
We need to lock him up
before he harms innocent people.

372
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:25,759
Why is our world filled
with crazy and bad people?

373
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:27,890
Goodness. It's horrible.

374
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:29,690
Thanks.

375
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,230
Thank you.

376
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:33,460
Please pour me one too.

377
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,309
I guess something is up.

378
00:26:45,809 --> 00:26:47,109
A lot has happened.

379
00:26:47,609 --> 00:26:49,150
Too many things have happened.
That's the problem.

380
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:51,210
Did you have a fight with Ha Jin?

381
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:52,519
No. It's not that.

382
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:54,880
Yes, that's it.

383
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,049
Actually,

384
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,359
there's a favor...

385
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:02,029
I need to ask you
and confess something to you.

386
00:27:02,029 --> 00:27:04,190
A confession? What confession?

387
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,430
The girl I used to date before...

388
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:09,000
died because of Moon Seong Ho.

389
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:10,599
What?

390
00:27:10,869 --> 00:27:12,200
That's why...

391
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:15,769
I can't tell you that today's news
was completely professional.

392
00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:16,769
I'm sorry.

393
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,809
But until Moon Seong Ho
gets arrested,

394
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:24,480
I want to continue receiving calls.
Please let me do that.

395
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,849
My gosh.

396
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,319
How...

397
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,230
Yes, Tae Eun.

398
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,029
Did you watch the news?

399
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:46,069
Are you worried
because Moon Seong Ho escaped?

400
00:27:47,369 --> 00:27:48,809
I'm sorry, Jeong Hoon.

401
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,009
Why are you sorry?

402
00:27:51,009 --> 00:27:52,710
Moon Seong Ho escaped...

403
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,079
because of my dad.

404
00:27:57,349 --> 00:27:59,480
My dad went to see him
as an outpatient.

405
00:28:00,579 --> 00:28:02,319
And he held my dad hostage.

406
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:04,049
Is he hurt badly?

407
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,089
No, he's okay.

408
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:07,660
That's a relief.

409
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:11,430
I didn't know
your dad was involved in this.

410
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:12,730
Will you be okay?

411
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:16,000
According to my dad, he'll probably
go to you or Ha Jin.

412
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,769
Actually, he already did.

413
00:28:18,769 --> 00:28:21,369
Who? Ha Jin?

414
00:28:21,809 --> 00:28:22,809
Yes.

415
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,680
That jerk showed up
in front of Ha Jin.

416
00:28:27,609 --> 00:28:30,049
Please don't tell me she did.

417
00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:31,049
She did.

418
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:33,619
Her memories came back.

419
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:38,019
She's in a lot of pain
and confusion.

420
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,990
Does she know
about you and Seo Yeon too?

421
00:28:43,529 --> 00:28:44,559
Yes.

422
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:51,529
I want to run over to see her
and stay by her side,

423
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:56,039
but I'd be asking for too much
if I do that right now.

424
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:58,440
I'd be way too selfish.

425
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,410
It must be tormenting for her
to see me right now,

426
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:07,279
so I'm just waiting.

427
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:12,460
I thought time is
what she needs the most right now.

428
00:29:22,299 --> 00:29:23,829
I knew this would happen in the end.

429
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,200
Who have I been blaming for this?

430
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:58,069
We can't do this.

431
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:00,470
Why not?

432
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:04,670
We'll regret it.

433
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,309
I won't regret anything.

434
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:13,450
You will.

435
00:30:14,549 --> 00:30:16,349
You might regret this
more than I would.

436
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,950
I finally learned
everything about you now.

437
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:54,390
But I don't know what to do.

438
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:58,089
I can't even bear to stand here
and look at you right now.

439
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,869
(Ha Jin)

440
00:31:11,869 --> 00:31:12,980
Yes, Ha Jin.
