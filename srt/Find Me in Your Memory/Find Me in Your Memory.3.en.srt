1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:05,480
We have a special guest
in our studio today.

2
00:00:05,809 --> 00:00:07,650
It's Actress Yeo Ha Jin.

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,080
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello. Nice to meet you.

4
00:00:11,349 --> 00:00:12,750
I've seen you a lot on TV.

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,189
But this time, you were in a movie.

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,620
Isn't the title of your movie
"My First Love"?

7
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,129
Yes, that's right. I'm the first
love of the main character.

8
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:22,329
You have a lot of followers.

9
00:00:22,329 --> 00:00:23,800
8.6 million.

10
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:26,530
You're
1 of the top 10 celebrities...

11
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,170
with the most followers.

12
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,640
Yes, but I think I'll get
even more followers...

13
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,899
after the movie premieres.

14
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,039
It's my goal to be 1 of the top 5...

15
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:36,539
- within the year.
- That's so unnecessary, as always.

16
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:38,780
I have a question now.

17
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,710
This is a personal question for you.

18
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,820
I think I should ask
for your permission first.

19
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:47,520
If you don't want that, we can
proceed with prepared questions.

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,520
My gosh, just follow the sheet.

21
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,920
This isn't your personal channel.

22
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,820
No, it's okay. You can ask me
whatever you want.

23
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:53,890
Thank you.

24
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:58,000
Before the interview, I checked out
your social media account.

25
00:00:58,429 --> 00:01:01,630
From what I observed
from your social media account,

26
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:03,369
you are not consistent...

27
00:01:03,369 --> 00:01:05,370
and seem to be a fickle person.

28
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,939
Pardon?

29
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:10,540
- There he goes again. Darn it.
- I'll give you a few examples.

30
00:01:11,109 --> 00:01:13,109
You uploaded countless numbers
of posts...

31
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:14,980
praising a certain product
and its company,

32
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:18,120
then you changed what you said...

33
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,620
and expressed your dissatisfaction
many times.

34
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:24,920
Then you expressed your support
for a certain political party,

35
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,890
then withdrew your support
in just three months.

36
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,799
Is there a particular reason?

37
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:32,760
Yes, there is.

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,170
I see.

39
00:01:34,629 --> 00:01:36,799
May I ask what it is?

40
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,640
Well...

41
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,739
I don't exactly remember now,

42
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:45,439
but I definitely had a reason.

43
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,480
But you can't seem to remember
that definite reason,

44
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,879
although it's definite.

45
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:51,950
I don't want to...

46
00:01:53,349 --> 00:01:56,189
be that complicated
when it comes to my feelings.

47
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,189
Regardless of making complicated
reasons or calculations,

48
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,459
I just want to live...

49
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,629
simply counting up to about 5 or 6.

50
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,099
I don't like complicated things.

51
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:16,340
I just want to live
simply counting up to about 5 or 6,

52
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:20,009
so that I can finish calculating
only by using my two thumbs.

53
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,750
Come on.

54
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:27,050
It's my favorite saying,
so you have to remember that.

55
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:29,050
I'll never forget it. Don't worry.

56
00:02:47,169 --> 00:02:49,340
Nothing ever goes as I wish.

57
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,180
I can't stop...

58
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,039
or end it.

59
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:56,879
It's as if
I am stuck in this memory.

60
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,789
Why isn't he saying anything?

61
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,159
Anchor Lee? Anchor Lee?

62
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,460
Anchor Lee.

63
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,189
What's with him?

64
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:12,030
Hey, what are you doing?

65
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,430
Anchor Lee! Anchor Lee?

66
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,599
Anchor Lee!

67
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:18,770
There are a lot of those.

68
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,039
- Us too.
- Is that all right?

69
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,110
It's the same.

70
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,139
Gosh, I'm so sick of this.

71
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,240
Hey, isn't that your program?

72
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:28,949
Is there a problem with the screen?

73
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:30,750
Why isn't he moving?

74
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,550
What is this?

75
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,750
Is this an accident?

76
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,030
Mr. Lee?

77
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:52,300
Hey, this is bad.
Do you have any videos?

78
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,840
Hey, the preview.

79
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,439
- The movie's preview.
- Yes, the preview.

80
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,740
Yes, play that.
Play that now. Hurry up!

81
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:01,650
My gosh.

82
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,180
Hey.

83
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,860
What's this? What's going on?

84
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,399
Hey! Anchor Lee!

85
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:27,870
Anchor Lee!

86
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,310
Jeong Hoon, please!

87
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,509
Hey!

88
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,089
I'm fine. Sit back down.

89
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:47,529
Hold on. How many more minutes
until we're back?

90
00:04:47,529 --> 00:04:50,459
You punk. What's wrong with you?

91
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:52,699
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

92
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:55,670
I'll apologize properly
after the news.

93
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,870
How much time is left?

94
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,970
You little...

95
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,069
1 minute and 10 seconds. Why?
What are you planning to do?

96
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:05,810
I just need some water.

97
00:05:06,209 --> 00:05:09,410
Could someone bring me some water?

98
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,980
It'd be best if it's cold.

99
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,019
All right.

100
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,550
- That little scumbag!
- Sit down, sit down.

101
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:17,459
Sit down.

102
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:19,759
I have water.

103
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,759
No, thank you.

104
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,430
I don't even know
if that's actually water.

105
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,430
It's plain water. Really.

106
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:30,870
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

107
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,579
Are you okay?

108
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:39,839
Do you know how strangely you acted?

109
00:05:42,579 --> 00:05:44,819
You must like Henry David Thoreau.

110
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:49,120
"Henry Thoreau"? Who is that?

111
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,490
He was an American philosopher
and essayist.

112
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,300
He wrote "Walden".

113
00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:03,699
He talked about counting up
to 5 or 6 instead of a million...

114
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:07,139
so that you could finish calculating
only by using your two thumbs.

115
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,370
That's what you just said.

116
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:15,649
Did I?

117
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:20,180
That's what I said, didn't I?

118
00:06:22,189 --> 00:06:24,019
I guess those were
Henry David Thoreau's words.

119
00:06:24,019 --> 00:06:25,220
I didn't know.

120
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:27,889
I wonder where I read that.

121
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,459
I think I saw it
on someone's social media.

122
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,300
Am I wrong?

123
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,240
I see.

124
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:43,639
We'll be rolling in five seconds!

125
00:06:44,709 --> 00:06:48,110
3, 2, 1.

126
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:50,779
Go! Darn it.

127
00:06:50,779 --> 00:06:54,089
I'd like to apologize
for what happened earlier.

128
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,660
We showed them a clip
from your movie...

129
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,660
before explaining the plot.

130
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,959
Since we're running out of time,

131
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:05,029
this will be my last question.

132
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,269
Isn't your movie premiering
next week?

133
00:07:07,329 --> 00:07:09,500
Yes, it'll be next Wednesday.

134
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:11,269
Those of you who are watching this,

135
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:13,910
please don't forget
to watch the movie.

136
00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:15,939
I'll look forward to it.

137
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:19,209
Sadly, our time is up for today.

138
00:07:19,209 --> 00:07:22,209
Already? I'm so disappointed.

139
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:24,079
Thank you so much
for inviting me over.

140
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:25,480
Thank you for coming.

141
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,019
If you get to watch the movie,
make sure to post a photo online.

142
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:33,120
Sure, I'll do that. Thank you.

143
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,860
This was Actress Yeo Ha Jin.

144
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:41,970
It's related to inflicting injuries,
assaulting, and blackmailing...

145
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:45,439
Goodness! You did so well!

146
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:47,709
It's all over now.

147
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,810
No, I think it has just begun.

148
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,509
Why? Are the people not happy
with her?

149
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,709
I thought she did well.

150
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:59,180
This was Anchor Lee's fault.

151
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,550
He froze in the middle of the news.

152
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:02,550
Right.

153
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,420
I wonder why, though.

154
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:08,029
So why is everyone blaming you?

155
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:10,060
- What are they saying?
- They said...

156
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,529
you stormed out midway
because you were offended.

157
00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:13,529
What?

158
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Look.

159
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,170
(Yeo Ha Jin Storms out
During the Live Broadcast)

160
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:21,139
This GIF is all over the place,
and they're saying you're so rude.

161
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:24,209
Why are they blaming it on her?

162
00:08:24,209 --> 00:08:26,779
Because everyone likes Anchor Lee.

163
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:28,949
So they're targeting her.

164
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,549
Let's go. I can't bear
to look at his face any longer.

165
00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:36,549
He kept ignoring you
during the interview. I hate him.

166
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:39,059
She's right. You must be tired.
Let's go.

167
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:40,360
You can stand up for yourself...

168
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,190
during the magazine interview
tomorrow.

169
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,000
Wait. He's almost done
with the news.

170
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,929
I should say bye.

171
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:50,740
Actually, should we have
a get-together tonight?

172
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,039
Whatever.

173
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,340
No one will feel like doing that.

174
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:58,179
And although everyone's blaming you,
a mistake is a mistake.

175
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,909
He'll probably be reproached
for what happened once he's done.

176
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,250
Really?

177
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,779
Let's go.

178
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,320
Hurry up.

179
00:09:10,289 --> 00:09:13,759
The speed cameras
and the witnesses could help.

180
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:17,090
Yes, we'll be able
to identify the assailant easily.

181
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:28,809
Come in.

182
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:34,580
What took you so long?

183
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:38,080
Didn't I tell you to come here
as soon as possible?

184
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:42,250
I just finished the news.
I didn't even get to change.

185
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,490
You got here quickly.

186
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:46,990
Are you being sarcastic?

187
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:48,960
No, sir.

188
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:54,870
How could you be so chatty
when you've made a mistake?

189
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:58,100
You should be thankful
that he saved your life.

190
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,269
Had he not changed the screen,
everyone would've seen you...

191
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:03,840
spacing out live on air.
Do you know that?

192
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:06,179
I'm sorry.

193
00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:09,309
My goodness.

194
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:11,250
Let's at least hear your excuse.

195
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:13,049
Why did you do that?

196
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,120
Well...

197
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:17,960
I had forgotten the next question.

198
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,019
I suddenly couldn't remember it.

199
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:25,159
That's exactly why I told you
to go with the script.

200
00:10:25,299 --> 00:10:26,960
Since I'm always cherishing you,

201
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,500
you must think the news
is your playground.

202
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,470
You better wake up!

203
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,240
Chul Woong, that's not it.

204
00:10:33,669 --> 00:10:36,970
I'm the one that cherishes him,
not you.

205
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:38,779
And although you saved
his life today,

206
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:41,250
I have the right to reproach him,
not you.

207
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,879
If you say that, I'd feel...

208
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,980
I'm sorry.

209
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:51,190
Nevertheless, you went
through so much.

210
00:10:51,789 --> 00:10:54,860
I need to chew him out
a bit longer, so you can leave.

211
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,659
Go on, now.

212
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:04,700
I hope you chew him out well.
I'll be going now.

213
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:06,740
Don't stay here for too long.

214
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:17,820
Jeong Hoon.

215
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,559
Sit down.

216
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,029
Why are you acting this way?
You're making me nervous.

217
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:36,669
Be honest with me.

218
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,169
How sick are you?

219
00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:42,440
Is it that bad?

220
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:45,240
Are you dying?

221
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,809
That was random.
Do you want me to die?

222
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:51,350
Don't smile.

223
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:53,419
Are you terminally ill?

224
00:11:54,049 --> 00:11:57,350
No. I'm sorry for disappointing you,
but I'm awfully healthy.

225
00:12:00,289 --> 00:12:02,029
Then is this because of that thing?

226
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,600
What was it again?

227
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,100
Hyperthymesia?

228
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,000
Having a good memory is an illness?

229
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,139
I didn't know such a thing existed.

230
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:18,039
Isn't having a photographic memory
a good thing?

231
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,580
It would've been nice if I had that.

232
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,980
But it's not
that I can remember things well.

233
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:25,120
I just can't forget anything.

234
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:27,820
When I was young,

235
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,190
I thought the people around me
were so strange.

236
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:32,990
They'd forget
what they had said or done...

237
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,690
unlike me, who remembered
every little thing.

238
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:38,659
But it turned out...

239
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,470
that I was the strange one.

240
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:45,769
So you can remember everything
and can't forget at all?

241
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,509
You see,

242
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,070
it's a headache.

243
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,139
My past memories keep popping up.

244
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,080
They can be trivial ones as well.

245
00:12:55,379 --> 00:12:58,019
And I relive the feelings
I've felt...

246
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,980
during those times.

247
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,620
I still can't wrap my head
around this,

248
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,019
but you're saying
such an illness does exist.

249
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:08,889
There are about 20 of us
around the globe.

250
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,659
I'm the only Korean patient so far.

251
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:16,029
There's a thesis written about me.

252
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,139
But they didn't reveal my name,

253
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:22,139
so only my family and a few others
who are close to us know...

254
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,840
that I'm suffering
from this illness.

255
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,580
During your past two years here,
I didn't mind it at all.

256
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:30,409
There was no reason to.

257
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,049
You didn't make any mistakes,
and you're the reason why...

258
00:13:33,049 --> 00:13:35,190
"News Live" has become
so successful.

259
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,990
So what happened today?

260
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:38,690
Did something change?

261
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:41,330
Did your condition worsen?
Do I need to be concerned?

262
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,429
Is that it?

263
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,000
Something absurd,
that had an absurd probability...

264
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,370
of happening, happened today.

265
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,570
It won't happen again.

266
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:53,600
Are you sure?

267
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,669
Are you positive? Can I believe you?

268
00:13:57,539 --> 00:13:58,809
I know the cause of it.

269
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,809
I'm going to avoid such situations
from now on, so don't worry.

270
00:14:04,049 --> 00:14:05,350
All right, then.

271
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:09,190
But if this occurs once again,
I won't believe you.

272
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:11,360
I know how merciless you are.

273
00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:12,960
Don't worry about it.

274
00:14:14,529 --> 00:14:15,830
Go on, then.

275
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:33,740
Tae Eun, you were wrong.

276
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,210
I saw the news.

277
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:37,409
But wasn't that handled pretty well
considering the situation?

278
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:38,720
Pretty well, my foot.

279
00:14:39,049 --> 00:14:41,490
Chul Woong was ready to choke me
if he had a chance.

280
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:43,190
And the director told me
if I mess up again,

281
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,759
she's going to can me.

282
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:46,490
And more importantly,

283
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:49,389
I have to write a five-page report
explaining and apologizing for it.

284
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,230
I have to fill up
all those five pages.

285
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,730
Five pages?

286
00:14:57,769 --> 00:14:58,769
Hey.

287
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,409
But seeing how you messed up
during the live broadcast,

288
00:15:01,409 --> 00:15:03,240
that means things were
getting pretty bad.

289
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,480
You really should be careful now.

290
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,409
It's worse than I thought.

291
00:15:08,009 --> 00:15:09,480
Alcohol was one thing,

292
00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:12,149
but that wasn't the real cause.

293
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,820
The real cause?

294
00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:19,990
What Yeo Ha Jin said earlier...

295
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:23,789
Regardless of making complicated
reasons or calculations,

296
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:26,899
I just want to live...

297
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,139
simply counting up to about 5 or 6.

298
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:36,070
I don't like complicated things.

299
00:15:36,309 --> 00:15:39,240
I just want to live
simply counting up to about 5 or 6,

300
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,850
so that I can finish calculating
only by using my two thumbs.

301
00:15:44,149 --> 00:15:46,820
I think I've heard of that
from somewhere.

302
00:15:47,789 --> 00:15:50,149
Henry David Thoreau wrote that
in one of his books.

303
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:51,220
Don't you know?

304
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,860
I see.

305
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,159
I thought you knew everything.

306
00:15:55,929 --> 00:15:57,659
I didn't know a second ago,

307
00:15:58,029 --> 00:15:59,100
but now, I do.

308
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:02,029
Come on. It's my favorite saying,

309
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:03,799
so you have to remember that.

310
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,700
I'll never forget it. Don't worry.

311
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,539
You're strangely annoying.

312
00:16:11,009 --> 00:16:13,279
What is this? This is annoying.

313
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:18,320
Let's go now. It's getting late.

314
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:20,980
Already?

315
00:16:21,549 --> 00:16:22,950
Let's stay a little longer.

316
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:24,460
The weather is great too.

317
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,720
I'll be late for practice, then.

318
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,759
Don't you have a meeting
in the evening?

319
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,600
Just a little longer.

320
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,429
Then, we'll stay
for 10 more minutes.

321
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:37,870
Be reasonable.
10 minutes are too short.

322
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,639
But I'll make you remember...

323
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:41,909
these 10 minutes
as if they lasted 1 hour.

324
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:44,610
How?

325
00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:50,179
Just like this.

326
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:57,759
What a great idea.

327
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:02,759
I'll remember this forever.

328
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,460
I love you.

329
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:00,549
Living simply
while counting up to 5 or 6 things.

330
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:05,519
Seo Yeon used to say that
all the time.

331
00:18:08,289 --> 00:18:09,829
When I heard that
on top of feeling a bit tipsy,

332
00:18:09,829 --> 00:18:11,660
I couldn't control myself.

333
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:17,869
But isn't that from a book
or something?

334
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,869
Perhaps, Ha Jin also read
the same booK.

335
00:18:19,869 --> 00:18:20,869
No.

336
00:18:21,569 --> 00:18:23,509
I asked her, but she had no idea.

337
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,240
She doesn't look like the type
who would read books regularly.

338
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:30,009
She said she read it
on social media.

339
00:18:30,579 --> 00:18:31,579
Okay.

340
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,319
That couldn't have happened
at the worst time.

341
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:38,220
Anyway, there are two causes
of today's incident.

342
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,819
Alcohol and Yeo Ha Jin.

343
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,759
No, to be precise,

344
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:44,059
that woman, Yeo Ha Jin,
is the sole cause.

345
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:47,000
I ended up drinking because of her.

346
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:49,470
Well,

347
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:52,140
but you won't be seeing
her around now, right?

348
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,240
We will never cross paths again.

349
00:18:55,539 --> 00:18:58,440
We would only cross paths
if we have another interview.

350
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,779
But I will stop that at all costs.

351
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:03,750
My gosh.

352
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:06,220
This tie was the beginning.

353
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:09,319
I never want to run
into her ever again.

354
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:11,420
What do you mean?
What about the tie?

355
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,559
The director is calling me.

356
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:22,029
Beg and tell her you can't write
a five-page letter of apology.

357
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:24,839
Hello?

358
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:27,599
Right now?

359
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,009
It's 1 a.m. now.
Why all of a sudden?

360
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,980
I just came in.

361
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:42,789
How many times are you
going to call me?

362
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:44,859
Are you already drunk?

363
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,759
Why are you drinking so much
by yourself...

364
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:51,859
We meet again.

365
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,000
You're here.

366
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:56,599
Join us now.

367
00:19:58,539 --> 00:20:00,640
- Come on.
- Sit over here.

368
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,440
You made us wait for so long.

369
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,710
Why the long face? Did you think...

370
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,880
you had to spend your time
with this old woman?

371
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,210
Aren't you glad to see Ha Jin here?

372
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,150
Do I look happy?

373
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,720
You must be quite drunk.

374
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:18,559
You must have been a bit thrown off
to see me here.

375
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,220
Yes. I was thrown off.

376
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:23,960
I had no idea that
I would be seeing you here.

377
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,200
I guess he is really surprised.

378
00:20:27,029 --> 00:20:29,470
Why are you so twisted?

379
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:30,970
Ha Jin is getting
all the criticisms...

380
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,900
because you messed up
during the broadcast.

381
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,569
My gosh, you should be
apologizing to her right now.

382
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,470
You're getting criticized
because of me?

383
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,480
Yes.

384
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:39,980
You didn't know.

385
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,039
People are saying that...

386
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,849
there was an incident
because I got mad...

387
00:20:42,849 --> 00:20:44,250
and left the studio.

388
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,150
I'm being royally
criticized right now.

389
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:49,190
Well, this isn't the first time.

390
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,589
It will die down after a few days.

391
00:20:50,589 --> 00:20:51,819
Don't worry.

392
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,420
My goodness, Ha Jin.

393
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:57,460
You're so positive and optimistic.

394
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,859
Building strong mental health...

395
00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:01,400
is the most important
to work in this industry.

396
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,500
I can see that your mental health
is the strongest.

397
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,069
On top of that, you can drink.

398
00:21:05,069 --> 00:21:07,299
It's been a while since I met
anyone who could drink...

399
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:10,009
as much as me and still look
that composed.

400
00:21:10,009 --> 00:21:12,009
My tolerance for alcohol
is pretty high.

401
00:21:12,609 --> 00:21:14,309
We've got some great liquor with us.

402
00:21:14,309 --> 00:21:16,980
It's not polite to just sit here
and not drink.

403
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,819
- Right?
- Thank you.

404
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:24,150
My gosh, you really can drink.

405
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:27,190
No. I'm fine.

406
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:29,460
Let's just count him out.

407
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:32,099
Cheers.

408
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:35,329
You can't even drink a glass?

409
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:38,039
I can't drink,

410
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,640
and I hate alcohol.

411
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:42,970
I see. That explains
your reaction earlier.

412
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:46,109
Then, what do you like, Anchor Lee?

413
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:48,410
Nothing, really.

414
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:51,549
Come on.
There must be something you like.

415
00:21:51,549 --> 00:21:53,950
Don't you have a hobby?

416
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:56,019
No, I don't have a hobby.

417
00:21:56,019 --> 00:21:59,019
My gosh, that annoying punk.

418
00:22:00,289 --> 00:22:03,359
My gosh. Excuse me.
I need to get this.

419
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,430
Hello?

420
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:11,099
I'm in the middle
of an important meeting.

421
00:22:11,869 --> 00:22:14,970
Come on, I have a job.
I'm bound to drink sometimes.

422
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:17,170
What did you say?

423
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,660
Why did you come all the way here?

424
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,529
I told you I'd be home soon.

425
00:22:38,529 --> 00:22:40,799
You said you were going
to chew him out.

426
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,529
I guess you're chewing him out
at a very fancy bar.

427
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:46,640
Hey, as if. He can't drink a sip
of alcohol. Don't be absurd.

428
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,369
I'm meeting with Ha Jin.
She was on our program,

429
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:50,640
but she's getting criticized for it.

430
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,509
I was handling the situation.

431
00:22:52,509 --> 00:22:54,309
And then, I was going to come home.

432
00:22:54,309 --> 00:22:56,250
- Really?
- Yes.

433
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:59,150
Then, I ought to join you.

434
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:01,180
I'm the person that handled
the mess very elegantly.

435
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,920
I'm the man in charge
of "Lee Jeong Hoon's News Live".

436
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,920
This worked out well.
I wanted to drink tonight.

437
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,559
My gosh. Come on.

438
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:11,430
Don't be like that, honey.

439
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,160
Let's go home and drink.

440
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,500
How about we open up
that bottle of wine...

441
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,730
we bought a while ago?

442
00:23:17,869 --> 00:23:20,470
What? You didn't want to open it
because it was expensive.

443
00:23:20,539 --> 00:23:23,339
You saved me today
with your quick-thinking.

444
00:23:25,309 --> 00:23:26,980
Today is the perfect day for it!

445
00:23:29,049 --> 00:23:31,880
How are you going
to survive without me?

446
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:33,549
Go get your bag now.

447
00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:36,490
Sure. I'll be out soon. Okay?

448
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,569
The director's husband
was calling, right?

449
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,769
She told me he was her first love.

450
00:23:52,769 --> 00:23:55,269
She said she met him at a church
when she was in high school.

451
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:59,440
It's hard to tie the knot
with your first love.

452
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,049
I think it's so romantic
that they got married.

453
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,180
When was your first love?

454
00:24:08,019 --> 00:24:10,849
I don't know.
I can't really remember.

455
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:13,059
No way.

456
00:24:13,059 --> 00:24:15,029
You could forget
your second or third love.

457
00:24:15,029 --> 00:24:16,559
But you can't really
forget your first.

458
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:20,029
I still remember my first love
so vividly.

459
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:22,369
It was in middle school.

460
00:24:22,369 --> 00:24:24,299
We went to the same ballet studio.

461
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:26,640
He was the only guy
in the ballet studio.

462
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,940
You learned ballet? For how long?

463
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:35,150
I haven't read any articles
or interviews that you did ballet.

464
00:24:37,049 --> 00:24:39,250
I never brought it up. That's why.

465
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,589
I quit because of injury.

466
00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:45,859
But I probably would've quit
even if I wasn't injured.

467
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,390
I wasn't very talented.

468
00:24:48,859 --> 00:24:51,089
Anyway, do you like ballet?

469
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,259
What?

470
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:58,740
Then is it weird that I did ballet?

471
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,769
Does it not suit me?

472
00:25:00,869 --> 00:25:03,170
No, I just...

473
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:04,670
You just what?

474
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,339
I just thought of someone.

475
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,480
Who? Your first love?

476
00:25:10,349 --> 00:25:12,380
Do I remind you
of your first love too?

477
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,420
No, not at all.

478
00:25:13,849 --> 00:25:15,119
Not at all.

479
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,920
You just said
you don't remember your first love.

480
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:25,559
I have to leave first.
Something came up at home.

481
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:26,559
You two can hang out a bit longer.

482
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:27,960
No, let's all go home.

483
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,000
No, please.

484
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:32,799
Make sure you apologize sincerely
to Ha Jin.

485
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,569
I already paid for everything...

486
00:25:34,569 --> 00:25:36,140
and ordered another bottle of this,

487
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,410
so just relax. Relax and have fun.

488
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:40,339
I'd love for you to stay.

489
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:42,279
I'll treat you next time.
Let's meet up soon.

490
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:44,779
Sure. It was nice to meet you.
Please excuse me.

491
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:46,279
Bye.

492
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,460
Ms. Yeo.

493
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:00,529
I'm sorry
I caused you trouble unwillingly.

494
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:03,000
No, I'm all right, really.

495
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,940
Really? I'm glad. Then should we go?

496
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,009
Now?

497
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:12,279
I apologized,
and you said you're fine.

498
00:26:12,809 --> 00:26:14,380
Then aren't we done here?

499
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:17,109
There's no reason
to sit around anymore.

500
00:26:17,549 --> 00:26:18,549
I mean...

501
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:23,920
This is on the house.

502
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:28,460
Could I have each of your autographs
before you leave?

503
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:30,789
Sure, thank you.

504
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:35,529
There's our reason to sit around.

505
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:37,230
Let's stay just a little longer.

506
00:26:37,369 --> 00:26:39,069
She just gave it to us.
We can't let it go to waste,

507
00:26:39,069 --> 00:26:40,940
and it's bad manners
to leave the food.

508
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,339
Wait.

509
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:54,779
Wait.

510
00:26:55,549 --> 00:26:56,920
Is that alcohol again?

511
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:59,890
I have to work early tomorrow.

512
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:02,559
Is it your hobby
to hide alcohol everywhere?

513
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:05,730
I'm sorry.
I forgot to put away the water cup.

514
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:08,259
Please excuse me now.

515
00:27:08,529 --> 00:27:11,769
I'm not sure how ridiculous
things will get if I stay with you.

516
00:27:13,869 --> 00:27:14,869
Wait...

517
00:27:21,609 --> 00:27:22,710
Wait.

518
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:26,650
You can't leave like this.

519
00:27:26,849 --> 00:27:28,849
Are you getting in or what?

520
00:27:29,019 --> 00:27:30,049
I am.

521
00:27:30,049 --> 00:27:32,559
No, he's not. I'm sorry. Goodbye.

522
00:27:38,329 --> 00:27:39,529
What are you doing?

523
00:27:39,529 --> 00:27:41,869
No, what do you think you're doing?

524
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:44,069
Ms. Yeo, are you interested in me?

525
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:46,400
What kind of nonsense is...

526
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,099
If not, why are you doing this?

527
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:52,140
We met for the first time today
and worked together just once.

528
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,910
We're barely acquainted.
Why would we sit together...

529
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,380
and talk this late at night?

530
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,950
Why did you stop me from leaving
only to have this discussion?

531
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,519
I mean,

532
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,589
it'll be great for us to be friends.

533
00:28:04,589 --> 00:28:06,220
I don't want us to be friends.

534
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:09,160
- Why not?
- I don't like you.

535
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,900
I hate someone
who's reckless, thoughtless,

536
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:15,069
and inconsiderate, just like you.

537
00:28:15,069 --> 00:28:16,369
What about you?

538
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,299
Don't you think
you're a bit rude to my face?

539
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,009
Rude? I was rude?

540
00:28:23,539 --> 00:28:25,710
You don't know
what you did wrong, do you?

541
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:28,339
Did you say
you want to be friends with me?

542
00:28:28,549 --> 00:28:31,180
It's absurd to have
a grown man and a woman...

543
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,549
become friends or whatever,

544
00:28:32,549 --> 00:28:36,150
but anyway, if you wanted to
eat with me or drink with me,

545
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:39,819
you should've asked me first
if you wanted to get acquainted.

546
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:43,660
You shouldn't have used my boss
to get me to come here.

547
00:28:43,829 --> 00:28:47,130
No, it wasn't like that.
This is a misunderstanding...

548
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:48,130
Ha Jin!

549
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:52,470
What are you doing here?
You didn't even pick up your phone.

550
00:28:52,769 --> 00:28:53,940
Please excuse me.

551
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:55,210
Sure.

552
00:29:08,049 --> 00:29:11,220
What are you doing out in the open?
What if people see you?

553
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:15,630
What did you two do?
Did something happen?

554
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,130
Hey, did something happen?

555
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:20,099
He reprimanded me.

556
00:29:20,099 --> 00:29:22,230
Reprimanded you?
Why would he do that?

557
00:29:22,369 --> 00:29:25,400
Wait, forget that.
Who does he think he is to do that?

558
00:29:49,859 --> 00:29:50,960
What is it?

559
00:29:51,259 --> 00:29:53,460
Hey, were you asleep?

560
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,500
You know very well that I sleep now.
If you called me this early,

561
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,240
it means you must have a huge scoop.

562
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,609
You better have one.
That's the only way you'll live.

563
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:05,109
Something huge did break out.

564
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:06,740
What is it?

565
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:10,250
Your newest love scandal.

566
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:12,250
("Yeo Ha Jin's New Man,
Anchor Lee Jeong Hoon of News Live")

567
00:30:12,849 --> 00:30:13,849
What?

568
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:19,160
I'm sure you know
I'm not in the mood to joke around.

569
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,190
I'm not joking.

570
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:23,690
You're the most searched word now
and the comments are exploding.

571
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:25,059
You should check.

572
00:30:25,859 --> 00:30:28,359
I know how angry you'll be
if I made up a lie like this.

573
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:30,500
Why would I call you this early?

574
00:30:31,869 --> 00:30:32,940
Did you see it?

575
00:30:33,099 --> 00:30:35,269
Wait, is Yeo Ha Jin the woman?

576
00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:38,009
I keep getting calls
at the news center from the morning.

577
00:30:38,009 --> 00:30:39,779
They wanted to talk to you,

578
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:41,809
so I said I can't give out
your personal number.

579
00:30:41,809 --> 00:30:44,480
Then they want me to
at least check the facts,

580
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:47,079
but I had no idea what I should say.

581
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:49,750
The entertainment department
keeps asking me questions too.

582
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,319
There's nothing to check.

583
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:53,690
Of course, this is wrong
and has zero grounds.

584
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:55,759
These pictures were taken yesterday.

585
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,630
We were having a drink
with Ms. Choi,

586
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:59,859
then they took this picture
when we had a short chat outside.

587
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:03,369
Why am I telling you this right now?

588
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:05,740
Who was the first to report on this?

589
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:07,400
Find out who it is.

590
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:10,109
How dare they release this article
without checking the facts?

591
00:31:10,109 --> 00:31:11,539
Wait, so what is it?

592
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:15,509
Are you saying
you aren't dating Ms. Yeo?

593
00:31:15,509 --> 00:31:16,750
Dating? My foot.

594
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:19,349
This is a false report
made on zero grounds.

595
00:31:19,349 --> 00:31:20,720
Are you sure you aren't dating her?

596
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,349
I'm not. How many times
do I have to tell you?

597
00:31:22,349 --> 00:31:24,789
Then why did Ms. Yeo do this?

598
00:31:25,589 --> 00:31:27,059
What did she do?

599
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:29,359
Yeo Ha Jin!

600
00:31:33,859 --> 00:31:34,900
Yeo Ha Jin.

601
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,039
Where did she go?

602
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,539
You're here.

603
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,640
"You're here"?

604
00:31:47,309 --> 00:31:50,609
You look completely fine
as if nothing had happened.

605
00:31:50,609 --> 00:31:52,079
Is it because of the love scandal?

606
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:53,150
I know that too.

607
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:57,289
That's not all.

608
00:31:57,549 --> 00:31:59,420
When did you talk to the reporter?

609
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:02,160
What did you say
for them to write this article?

610
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,529
What did the article say?

611
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:07,200
("Yeo Ha Jin Admits Her Relationship
With Lee Jeong Hoon")

612
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:09,930
That looks fine.

613
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:11,529
That's what I said.

614
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:14,400
I said Anchor Lee and I are
getting to know each other.

615
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:15,710
What?
