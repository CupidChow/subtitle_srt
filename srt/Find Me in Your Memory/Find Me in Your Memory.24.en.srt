1
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:04,580
(Episode 24)

2
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:32,340
What is he doing?

3
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:33,810
Hey, hurry up and come!

4
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,179
Hey, this is bad.
Hurry up and head over there.

5
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:40,609
Code red in Unit A.
Get over there quickly.

6
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:54,189
Hurry up and open the door.

7
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:55,990
What is this?

8
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:57,259
That's a lot of bleeding!

9
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:58,530
- Hold him down!
- Stay still!

10
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,170
Bring something
to stop the bleeding. Hurry!

11
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:02,229
Hurry! Get ready to transfer him!

12
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:14,409
I miss you.

13
00:01:15,579 --> 00:01:17,219
Then let's meet right now.

14
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,250
Okay, sounds good.

15
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:25,719
Ha Kyung is going to be furious
if I go out this late.

16
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:35,569
Ha Jin.

17
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,739
Ha Jin, are you asleep?

18
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:49,010
You're asleep, aren't you?

19
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:52,819
I had something to tell you.

20
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:54,790
I'll tell you tomorrow.

21
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:58,519
Good night.

22
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:20,310
I'm inside.

23
00:02:20,449 --> 00:02:22,750
You can come in
after the movie begins.

24
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:31,719
Why are you here so early?

25
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,330
I got too nervous
to leave you here alone.

26
00:02:42,969 --> 00:02:44,500
Don't mind them.

27
00:02:51,409 --> 00:02:52,409
Here.

28
00:03:05,789 --> 00:03:07,729
(Flat tire)

29
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:10,699
I haven't watched
a late-night movie for a while.

30
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,460
Me too.

31
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:16,169
This is my first time
after seeing my movie alone.

32
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,740
It's also my first time
after I saw your movie.

33
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,039
The last movie
we watched is the same too.

34
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:36,349
Since it's a shame to go home
so early, let's have some popcorn.

35
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:39,289
You want more popcorn?

36
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,030
I just don't want to go home.

37
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,090
Okay.

38
00:03:43,629 --> 00:03:45,560
What? Why is she here?

39
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,830
I thought she was asleep.

40
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,169
That's Ha Kyung.

41
00:03:48,969 --> 00:03:50,740
Didn't you tell her that
you were going to the movies?

42
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:53,539
I thought she might get mad,
so I snuck out.

43
00:03:54,009 --> 00:03:55,569
But you're here with me.

44
00:03:55,909 --> 00:03:57,610
She'll get pretty angry.

45
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:02,810
Yeo Ha Kyung.

46
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,520
- Hello.
- Hello.

47
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,319
Why are you here?

48
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:14,030
We came to watch a movie.
I didn't have any popcorn.

49
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,889
But still. At this hour?
Without telling me?

50
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,899
What if people take pictures of you?

51
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,129
Didn't you come
knowing that I was here?

52
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:24,639
No, I came to watch a movie.

53
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,639
With who?

54
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,910
What do you mean? I came by myself.

55
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,040
- That's my jacket.
- No, I got this.

56
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,139
- You have makeup on.
- No.

57
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:33,680
My... My movie is about...

58
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,350
Guess who?

59
00:04:39,149 --> 00:04:40,149
Jo Il Kwon?

60
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:43,889
Hello.

61
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,959
What's going on between you two?

62
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,329
Well...

63
00:04:47,629 --> 00:04:49,430
I was passing by,

64
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:51,759
and I was glad to see her.

65
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,230
You were glad to see her
as you were passing by,

66
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,600
and you two are close enough
to do something like that?

67
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,170
Well, I...

68
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:00,100
So it's...

69
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,910
We're dating.

70
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:04,879
I'm dating Ha Kyung.

71
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:27,300
Goodness, you denied it so much.

72
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:29,370
Things happened.

73
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:32,439
- I'm so proud of you, Ha Kyung.
- Stop it.

74
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:35,040
Great job.

75
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:37,740
Try to work things out.
Mr. Jo is a great guy.

76
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:39,339
He is.

77
00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:42,149
When did you become such a big girl?

78
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:44,180
I'm so proud of you, kiddo.

79
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,649
Anyway, what's that?

80
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:48,089
That looks great.

81
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:51,660
What is?
Your face is gleaming today.

82
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,730
So? Do you want me to
pound this on your face?

83
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:55,790
Pound me.

84
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,100
Look up.

85
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,459
Like this.

86
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,769
Perfect.
You'll definitely kiss him tonight.

87
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:07,170
What was that?

88
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:11,279
- I already...
- You already what?

89
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,910
Gosh! Are you insane?

90
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,350
When?

91
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:24,060
Why do you two look so awkward?

92
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,790
It's not like
you met for the first time.

93
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:29,129
There must be a misunderstanding.

94
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:30,860
I'm not that close to him.

95
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,800
We just work together.

96
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,500
Gosh, no way.

97
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,269
When you told us
about Mr. Jo's place,

98
00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:38,339
you said you were like
family with him.

99
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:40,339
You're right.
I heard you say that too.

100
00:06:40,339 --> 00:06:42,139
We're like family?

101
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,910
I didn't know
you thought of me like that.

102
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,579
Right.

103
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:48,649
This is so uncanny.

104
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:51,519
Who knew we'd end up as two couples?

105
00:06:52,149 --> 00:06:54,350
It's best to eat something
when things get awkward.

106
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:55,990
Eat up.

107
00:06:57,189 --> 00:06:58,189
Ha Kyung.

108
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:59,860
Open your mouth.

109
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,529
I'll feed myself.

110
00:07:05,529 --> 00:07:08,399
Come on.
Wait, it's falling. It's falling.

111
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,370
- It's good.
- Is it?

112
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:16,139
- Thank you.
- Sure.

113
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,949
What? Do I have
something on my face?

114
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:26,379
Do you really have no idea,
or are you asking me to test you?

115
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:32,019
Well...

116
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:25,410
Don't they look so good together?

117
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,810
I knew they'd look great,

118
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,410
but they look
even cuter than I thought.

119
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:32,480
Are you that happy?

120
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,750
Ha Kyung was never able to do
everything that she wanted...

121
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,620
because she had to take care of me.

122
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:44,960
I felt bad, thinking that I was
the only one who was happy.

123
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,370
But that worry is long gone now.

124
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:02,009
"Breaking news."

125
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:05,279
"A man was charged for murder..."

126
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:11,559
Hello.

127
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:12,690
- Hello.
- Hello.

128
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:13,990
Hello.

129
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,159
Nice to meet you.

130
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:16,360
I came here because...

131
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,399
I wanted to talk
about today's interview briefly.

132
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,070
What is it?
Why did you suddenly smile?

133
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:25,039
I was just reminded of that time...

134
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:27,240
when I had first met
Anchor Lee in this room.

135
00:09:28,169 --> 00:09:31,980
Back then, I was worried sick
that he'd criticize you so much.

136
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,309
But now...

137
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:35,950
"But now"?

138
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:42,519
- I guess you could say that.
- Silence.

139
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:43,850
Silence. I need to film soon.

140
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,820
I'm glad you're not nervous.

141
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:49,360
This is just a test, so relax, okay?

142
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,830
Okay.

143
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,259
Let me see how much time you have.

144
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,299
Okay.

145
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:54,570
Focus.

146
00:10:04,909 --> 00:10:06,940
The meeting ended later
than I had expected,

147
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,679
so I don't think I can be there.

148
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,379
I really wanted to watch you.
I'm disappointed.

149
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:15,090
(Crying...)

150
00:10:20,789 --> 00:10:24,259
Hello, everyone.
This is the 9 p.m. news.

151
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:26,399
All the major companies
have started...

152
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,669
the open recruitment
for the first half.

153
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:32,570
In the past, they used to have
two open recruitments a year.

154
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,470
But now, they will be recruiting
all around the year.

155
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,710
This has flustered those
who have been job hunting.

156
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:40,879
Cut! Ha Jin, you've improved
so much.

157
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:44,519
Really? Can I try it again?

158
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,679
I think I sped up a bit at the end.

159
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,720
I didn't notice that, but okay.

160
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,389
- Let me know when you're ready.
- Okay.

161
00:10:51,389 --> 00:10:54,789
Could you take one from the front?

162
00:10:54,789 --> 00:10:56,230
Okay, move the camera.

163
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,129
We'll move the camera.

164
00:11:00,129 --> 00:11:01,269
I'm ready.

165
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:04,100
Ready. Action!

166
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:08,169
Hello, everyone.
This is the 9 p.m. news.

167
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:09,909
All the major companies
have started...

168
00:11:09,909 --> 00:11:12,080
the open recruitment
for the first half.

169
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:15,909
In the past, they used to have
two open recruitments a year.

170
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:17,919
But now, they will be recruiting
all around the year.

171
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:19,950
This has flustered those
who have been job hunting.

172
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,950
With this new recruitment system,

173
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:25,759
it'll be difficult to predict
the right time for job hunting.

174
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:28,659
Consequently, it'll be
more difficult to find jobs.

175
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:32,659
There has been an increase
in "blind recruitment".

176
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:35,029
The purpose of this recruitment
was to solely focus...

177
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:36,370
on one's competence.

178
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,740
This is because many companies...

179
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:42,710
prefer new recruits
who can start work immediately.

180
00:11:43,309 --> 00:11:45,480
We have asked 320 companies
about their recruitment system...

181
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,679
for the upcoming first half
of the year.

182
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:49,549
22 percent of them,
which is 10 percent more...

183
00:11:49,549 --> 00:11:52,379
than last year, said
they'd carry out open recruitments.

184
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:53,850
Reporter Kim Mi Na has the details.

185
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:00,830
What?

186
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:25,320
("Yeo Ha Jin and Lee Jeong Hoon
Spotted at a Movie Theater")

187
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:33,259
If I can't convince you...

188
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,940
I'll have to find another way.

189
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:54,850
During the past three years,
you've countlessly stolen...

190
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:58,049
expensive belongings of Ms. Yeo's.

191
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:00,450
But since you're a first offender...

192
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:04,919
and the victim decided
to go easy on you...

193
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:06,720
after hearing your story,

194
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,659
we've decided to suspend
your indictment and end this case.

195
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:20,370
Ha Kyung.

196
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,110
Don't thank me.

197
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,639
I was always against this.

198
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,879
Then was it Ha Jin's idea?

199
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:28,909
Live an honest life from now on.

200
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:31,649
Think of your mother, okay?

201
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,850
Thank you.

202
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,720
And I'm truly sorry.

203
00:13:37,789 --> 00:13:38,789
See you tomorrow.

204
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,330
- What?
- Don't you have a debt to pay?

205
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,830
You need to make money.

206
00:13:45,529 --> 00:13:46,559
Don't be late.

207
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:49,769
I'm sorry.

208
00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:52,100
Thank you!

209
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:01,210
She met him. He'll be coming
to work starting tomorrow.

210
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,250
Will you really be all right?

211
00:14:04,179 --> 00:14:06,779
I gave this a lot of thought.

212
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,750
But I'll regret it
if I don't do this.

213
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:14,230
Okay. I know that
he apologized countless times,

214
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,460
but I don't think
he should work with you.

215
00:14:17,059 --> 00:14:19,330
I'm going to make him do
office work.

216
00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:22,000
Thank you for allowing this.

217
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,269
You're so considerate and kind.

218
00:14:24,269 --> 00:14:25,899
You'll be blessed.

219
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:28,110
People have said that
I look nicer now.

220
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,639
I no longer look like a villainess.

221
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:32,639
It's true. Now, you just need
to become the national anchor.

222
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,409
Let's do well and hit the jackpot.

223
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,120
What is it?

224
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:44,620
Anchor Lee Jeong Hoon's
doctor called.

225
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,590
He wanted your number.

226
00:14:47,889 --> 00:14:49,629
His doctor?

227
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:50,629
Yes.

228
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,129
(Seoseong University,
Professor Yoo Sung Hyuk)

229
00:15:09,549 --> 00:15:11,149
Hello, sit down.

230
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:13,149
Hello.

231
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:18,690
You must've been puzzled
that I wanted to see you.

232
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:23,559
It's fine.
I've read your thesis before.

233
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:26,730
That must mean you know
about Jeong Hoon's illness.

234
00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:28,799
I do.

235
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:32,740
Why did you want to see me?

236
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,409
Is he okay?

237
00:15:34,409 --> 00:15:36,139
Yes, he is.

238
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:39,409
I just thought it'd be nice
to meet you once.

239
00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:43,049
I'm relieved. I was worried.

240
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,019
As his doctor,

241
00:15:48,019 --> 00:15:52,590
I know every little thing about him.

242
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,389
But he never told me anything
about you.

243
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,100
I only recently found out...

244
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,929
that you two
were in a serious relationship.

245
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:06,039
We've only recently become serious.

246
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:10,210
So it wasn't a serious relationship
from the beginning.

247
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:13,480
Is it true that you were dating
when those scandals came out?

248
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:17,450
If you're worried
about your privacy being exposed,

249
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,019
there's no need to be.

250
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,820
- Okay.
- How much do you know...

251
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:25,820
about his illness?

252
00:16:26,059 --> 00:16:28,960
I just know that
he's suffering from hyperthymesia.

253
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,929
I read up on it online.

254
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:35,669
Then I won't need
to explain what it is.

255
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,139
What about him?

256
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,309
What do you mean?

257
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,279
For example,

258
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:50,580
did you know that his ex had died?

259
00:16:53,549 --> 00:16:54,549
Sorry?

260
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,549
I guess you didn't know.

261
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:01,490
She was murdered by her stalker.

262
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:02,960
She met a gruesome death.

263
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,900
Since you said you two
were in a serious relationship,

264
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,940
I thought he had already told you.

265
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,970
But I guess not.

266
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,039
I don't want you...

267
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:23,279
to take this the wrong way.

268
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:26,279
I'm just saying this...

269
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:30,150
out of worry as his doctor.

270
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:33,859
If that's not enough,
think of this situation...

271
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,890
as a father who's worried
about his son.

272
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,630
Okay.

273
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,470
I'm fine. Please, speak comfortably.

274
00:17:43,069 --> 00:17:48,069
That woman was special to him.

275
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,509
She was his first love.

276
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,609
After Seo Yeon passed away,
he was in so much pain.

277
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,319
"Seo Yeon"?

278
00:17:59,019 --> 00:18:01,049
Yes. Her name was Jung Seo Yeon.

279
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:08,059
I'm happy that he was able
to meet someone new...

280
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,730
after losing her.

281
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,099
But I can't help
but feel worried as well.

282
00:18:17,099 --> 00:18:21,369
He will always have her
in his heart.

283
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,180
Will you be okay with that?

284
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:32,549
I'm okay with everything...

285
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:37,049
as long as he's happy.

286
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:39,859
I'm okay.

287
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,990
Thank you for your concern.

288
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:51,539
I told you I didn't remember
my first love.

289
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,440
That was a lie.

290
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,640
I still haven't gotten over her.

291
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,410
I still love her.

292
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:05,849
Do you know...

293
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,390
someone named Jung Seo Yeon?

294
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:15,329
I had a friend
who got into a similar accident.

295
00:19:16,529 --> 00:19:19,359
That's why I was concerned
and sensitive about you.

296
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,710
I'm okay with everything...

297
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:34,680
as long as he's happy.

298
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:53,299
Hey, Professor Kim.

299
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,529
I have a favor to ask you.

300
00:19:57,869 --> 00:20:00,400
I want to meet with Moon Seong Ho.

301
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:03,369
What?

302
00:20:05,309 --> 00:20:06,509
Which hospital?

303
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:18,920
I'm going to change
your gauze and bandage.

304
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,829
(Ward A to C, Reception,
Treatment Room, Waiting Area)

305
00:20:30,369 --> 00:20:32,269
- I'm here to see...
- You're here.

306
00:20:32,269 --> 00:20:35,140
Hey. So Moon Seong Ho
tried to kill himself?

307
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,470
What on earth is this about?
How is he now?

308
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,440
Luckily, the doctor reattached
the blood vessel.

309
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,450
So it's not life-threatening.

310
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:45,180
But he's psychologically unstable.

311
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:49,450
I don't think he can have
any visitors for the time being.

312
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,220
But can you help me out here?

313
00:20:51,789 --> 00:20:54,630
As you know, he tries
to kill himself all the time.

314
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:58,029
But this is the first time he
actually injured himself this badly.

315
00:20:58,029 --> 00:20:59,799
It could be really dangerous
for you.

316
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:01,970
I can control him.

317
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,569
I'll make sure
you don't get burned for this.

318
00:21:03,569 --> 00:21:06,039
Just allow me to see him
for 30 minutes.

319
00:21:06,339 --> 00:21:07,640
My gosh.

320
00:21:15,809 --> 00:21:16,950
Nice to meet you.

321
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:19,950
My name is Yoo Sung Hyuk.

322
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:25,390
I invited myself in here
because I thought...

323
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:27,690
it'd be nice for us to talk.
I hope you don't mind.

324
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,359
What's outside the window?

325
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,569
It looks like
you're staring at the sky.

326
00:21:37,569 --> 00:21:39,400
Did Seo Yeon say something to you?

327
00:21:44,809 --> 00:21:46,039
Do you know her?

328
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,049
Of course.

329
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:54,380
I used to be
Anchor Lee Jeong Hoon's...

330
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,890
doctor for a long time.

331
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,660
You're that jerk's doctor?

332
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,160
I wanted to talk to you...

333
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:08,170
because I wanted to find out
something about Anchor Lee.

334
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,170
What do you say?

335
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:14,000
Are you interested
in talking to me now?

336
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:34,519
I'm sure you know the woman...

337
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:37,289
Anchor Lee is dating now.

338
00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:40,130
She's an actress named Yeo Ha Jin.

339
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:44,200
I heard she used to
be Seo Yeon's friend.

340
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,509
So I can sort of understand...

341
00:22:51,339 --> 00:22:55,950
how Lee Jeong Hoon, Jung Seo Yeon,
and Yeo Ha Jin are connected.

342
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:58,549
But I'm curious...

343
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:02,220
about how you fit into all of this.
That intrigues me.

344
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:06,690
- Aren't you Jeong Hoon's doctor?
- Yes.

345
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:08,730
Why are you asking me that?

346
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:12,460
Your patient is Lee Jeong Hoon,
not me.

347
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:14,829
I want to know the truth.

348
00:23:15,329 --> 00:23:18,240
Sometimes,
patients lie to their doctors...

349
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,640
because they want other people
to say that they are normal,

350
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,640
but you see,
I'm not that easy to fool.

351
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:38,819
So...

352
00:23:40,059 --> 00:23:41,730
you want me...

353
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,559
to tell you the truth?

354
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:52,400
Can you help me up?

355
00:24:01,549 --> 00:24:03,109
Where are the scissors?

356
00:24:03,779 --> 00:24:05,920
I definitely had a pair
when I went in...

357
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,619
to check on the prisoner
serving a life sentence.

358
00:24:08,049 --> 00:24:09,650
Moon Seong Ho, what are you doing?

359
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:10,990
Put that down now!

360
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:13,420
You should be careful
with your guns.

361
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,730
Do you want to see him die?

362
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:16,890
I doubt that.

363
00:24:17,029 --> 00:24:18,089
Put the gun down and step back.

364
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:19,630
Hey, Moon Seong Ho.

365
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:22,500
- Don't get worked up. You and I...
- Easy, easy.

366
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:25,039
Keep your mouth shut
unless you want to die.

367
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:28,210
Don't tell me this was
all part of your plan.

368
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:29,940
Well, not really.

369
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:32,509
But thanks to you,
things have gotten very easier.

370
00:24:32,509 --> 00:24:33,609
Hey, guys.

371
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:35,549
I'm not scared of dying.

372
00:24:35,609 --> 00:24:36,910
But you are.

373
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,950
If this guy dies,
you'll be in big trouble.

374
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:42,019
Don't do this. Just tell them...

375
00:24:42,019 --> 00:24:43,650
- your demand.
- I told you to be quiet.

376
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:44,720
What do you want?

377
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:46,519
Let go of the hostage first.

378
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,289
This hurts.

379
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:52,859
- Hey.
- Don't come near me.

380
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:54,559
- Stay there.
- Put down the scissors.

381
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:55,900
- Don't come near me.
- Put that down!

382
00:24:56,569 --> 00:24:58,299
I told you to stay there.

383
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,569
- Sir!
- Get him.

384
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,380
Come back here!

385
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,119
- Darn it.
- The staircase on the other side.

386
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,220
Are you all right?

387
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,460
- Officer Jo, check the back.
- Yes, sir.

388
00:25:39,009 --> 00:25:41,240
It's all done. Rest up for now.
I'll call you once it's ready.

389
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,980
- Okay. Thank you.
- Sure.

390
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:58,329
But I can't help
but feel worried as well.

391
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:03,529
He will always have her
in his heart.

392
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,940
Will you be okay with that?

393
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:27,690
Ha Jin, is it before your event?

394
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:30,460
It was time, so I figured
your event already started.

395
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,829
I'll start in about five minutes.

396
00:26:33,099 --> 00:26:35,400
I wanted to hear your voice
even for a few seconds.

397
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:39,039
Then, do you want
to meet up afterward?

398
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,569
I miss you too.

399
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:43,240
Sure. Sounds great.

400
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,640
Okay. I'll go to your house later.

401
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,539
Why don't you rest up
after your event?

402
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:52,450
By the way, I have a question.

403
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:56,119
Are you happy now?

404
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,089
You know my answer.

405
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,430
But I still want to hear it
from you.

406
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:07,960
I am in utter happiness.

407
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:12,500
I'm glad to hear that.

408
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:15,210
What about you, Ha Jin?

409
00:27:16,269 --> 00:27:17,839
I told you my answer.

410
00:27:18,809 --> 00:27:22,180
I said every single moment
I spend with you is precious to me.

411
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:24,250
I am happy every single day now.

412
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,880
I'm glad to hear that.

413
00:27:30,049 --> 00:27:32,160
I need to go in now.

414
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:35,430
Okay. Good luck
with the signing event.

415
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:36,660
See you later.

416
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:37,660
Okay.

417
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:45,670
Ha Jin, it's time. Let's go in.

418
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:47,539
Okay. I'm coming.

419
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:50,069
- Ha Jin!
- Ha Jin!

420
00:27:50,069 --> 00:27:51,210
- Ha Jin!
- Ha Jin!

421
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:53,039
- Ha Jin.
- Ha Jin! You're so pretty!

422
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,480
- I'm a huge fan.
- You're so pretty!

423
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,049
- You're the best!
- Ha Jin!

424
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:58,920
(Yeo Ha Jin's Fan Signing Event)

425
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:02,519
- Ha Jin!
- Ha Jin, over here!

426
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:05,519
- Ha Jin!
- You're so pretty!

427
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,829
- Ha Jin, I love you!
- Ha Jin!

428
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:11,529
- Ha Jin.
- Ha Jin! Over here!

429
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:16,000
I've been dying to hold
a fan signing event.

430
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,670
When I got the offer,
I practically ran here.

431
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:21,539
Since you're here,
please check out the store here.

432
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:24,440
That way, I'll get to renew
my contract and hold another event.

433
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,940
- Okay!
- Yes!

434
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:28,240
- I love you!
- You're so pretty!

435
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,680
- Ha Jin!
- Ha Jin!

436
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:40,460
What is it? What's with this uproar?

437
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,990
There's a news flash.

438
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:43,390
A news flash? What is it?

439
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:45,430
Someone just ran away
from the National Forensic Hospital,

440
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:47,230
but the escapee is a murderer,

441
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:49,700
so the police contacted us for help
in publicizing his capture.

442
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,740
He planned his escape
and injured himself beforehand.

443
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:54,240
I'll get going.

444
00:29:00,309 --> 00:29:01,809
("A Prisoner Escapes
from National Forensic Hospital")

445
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:04,809
(The police are looking for
Moon Sung Ho, who ran away...)

446
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,259
Ha Jin?

447
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:16,690
Surprise.

448
00:29:22,269 --> 00:29:23,900
- You.
- Are you surprised?

449
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:27,269
Ms. Yeo is
more popular than I thought.

450
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:31,369
I'm thinking of getting
her autograph now that I'm here.

451
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:32,509
What do you think?

452
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:37,109
To be honest,
Ms. Yeo and I met before.

453
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:39,650
You jerk.
You need to get out of there.

454
00:29:39,849 --> 00:29:41,549
Gosh, I knew you'd be like that.

455
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:44,819
I'm the only one
who's concerned about Seo Yeon.

456
00:29:45,819 --> 00:29:49,630
Are you feeling desperate
to think of Yeo Ha Jin?

457
00:29:50,259 --> 00:29:52,759
Do your best to come
if you can be here.

458
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:56,500
But back then and now,

459
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,900
you'll never be able to stop me.

460
00:30:07,109 --> 00:30:08,109
Darn it.

461
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,849
(Ha Jin)

462
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:52,190
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

463
00:31:11,009 --> 00:31:12,509
What's your name?

464
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,150
Don't you remember me?

465
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:26,289
You really don't remember anything,
do you?

466
00:31:26,819 --> 00:31:30,130
That's really odd.
How can you forget that?

467
00:31:32,299 --> 00:31:33,529
Thanks for your help back then.

468
00:31:36,029 --> 00:31:37,099
Hello.

469
00:31:38,269 --> 00:31:40,470
I'm the guy who's dating Yeong.

470
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,339
Seo Yeon and I...

471
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:51,710
I'm the guy who's dating Yeong.

472
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,390
I...

473
00:31:58,049 --> 00:31:59,859
love her a lot.

474
00:32:15,569 --> 00:32:16,640
Ha Na.

475
00:32:37,059 --> 00:32:39,400
(Find Me in Your Memory)

476
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:41,059
What's with you?

477
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:44,000
Why did you lie?
Why did you let me just forget her?

478
00:32:44,269 --> 00:32:46,000
I love you a lot, Ha Jin.

479
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,569
Please let me be alone for a moment.

480
00:32:48,569 --> 00:32:51,809
It's about time you stopped.
It has been eight years already.

481
00:32:51,809 --> 00:32:53,480
I'm sorry I came too late.

482
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,279
But nothing will change.

483
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:56,410
Everything is in the past.

484
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:58,720
Let's go back to the time
when we didn't know each other.

485
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,849
- Are you with Ha Jin?
- Is something going on?

486
00:33:00,849 --> 00:33:03,119
She suddenly disappeared,
and she left her phone at home.

487
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:05,759
You promised
