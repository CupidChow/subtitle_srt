1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,710
- Anchor Lee!
- Tell us something!

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:04,509
- Say something!
- Anchor Lee!

3
00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:05,879
Hey, Lee Jeong Hoon!

4
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:25,329
I picked up a huge scoop.

5
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:27,699
Don't you want to know what it is?

6
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,609
Man, he really gets on my nerves.

7
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,280
Let's see how long you can
keep your head up high.

8
00:00:45,619 --> 00:00:46,719
What's the big scoop?

9
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:48,750
- Tell us.
- What's the huge scoop?

10
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,259
- May we talk for a moment?
- Tell us.

11
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:51,259
Wait!

12
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,429
Jeong Hoon, we need to talk.

13
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:02,799
Come here.

14
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:10,439
Did you know about this book too?

15
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,980
No, not at all.
I haven't seen it until now.

16
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:16,379
I knew it. You wouldn't give consent
to publish something like this.

17
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:18,019
The author is
apparently your doctor.

18
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:20,620
How can he write this book
without saying a word to you?

19
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:23,189
Is this Yoo Sung Hyuk
really your doctor?

20
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:24,519
Yes, he is.

21
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:26,560
This is too awful.

22
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,689
Mr. Kim came in with this,

23
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:30,629
so I gave it a read.

24
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:33,500
All he did was
replace your name with an initial.

25
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,769
But the person's age, occupation,
and the current situation...

26
00:01:35,769 --> 00:01:37,939
all point to you.

27
00:01:38,769 --> 00:01:41,569
Did you see everyone
who swarmed in at the lobby?

28
00:01:42,109 --> 00:01:44,209
- Yes.
- They're already publishing...

29
00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:48,010
millions of articles
speculating you as this man.

30
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:51,980
This book is liable
if you didn't know about this.

31
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,189
You need to meet your doctor...

32
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:56,090
and check on the situation.

33
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,689
- Okay.
- Right.

34
00:01:58,689 --> 00:02:00,590
How's your stab? Is it all right?

35
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:02,959
Yes, I'm fine.

36
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,900
I forgot to ask
in the midst of this chaos.

37
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,870
What?

38
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,009
Hey, can you tell me?

39
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:16,110
I'm sure you know
since you're close to him.

40
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,110
- Is it really him?
- What's with you?

41
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,250
Does he suffer from hyperthymesia?

42
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,949
What's with you? I don't know.

43
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:24,020
You really don't?

44
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,919
Yes, I don't. I really don't.

45
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,789
Man, in that case,
I'll ask him when he gets here.

46
00:02:28,789 --> 00:02:30,620
Why? There's no need to ask him.

47
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,259
Just because. I'm curious.

48
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,689
Why are you getting angry?

49
00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:36,360
Don't ask him anything.

50
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,300
Hey, listen to this kid.

51
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,500
He just got out of the hospital
after an operation.

52
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,830
Don't ask him such a question.

53
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,300
Hey, you're still doing that.

54
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,770
- Jeong Hoon.
- Hey.

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Hello.

56
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,009
Hey, you're here.

57
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:52,939
Hey, you know...

58
00:02:53,909 --> 00:02:55,349
How are you feeling?

59
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:57,819
Oh, yes. I'm fine.

60
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,090
Okay. I'm glad.

61
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:06,020
Are you sure you're okay?

62
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,289
I saw Park Soo Chang in the lobby.

63
00:03:08,289 --> 00:03:10,629
- When did he get out?
- It has been a few days.

64
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,199
He must have hired a good lawyer.
He got out on probation.

65
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:15,930
What has he been up to?
Have you heard anything?

66
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:17,939
I haven't really heard anything.

67
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:20,439
But he can't work
in this field anyway.

68
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:21,710
No one will hire him.

69
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:24,210
His days as a reporter is over,
so I'm sure he'll do something else.

70
00:03:25,909 --> 00:03:27,009
All right.

71
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,650
Let me know if you hear anything.

72
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:29,949
Okay, I will.

73
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,259
- Ha Kyung.
- Yes?

74
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:38,819
Do we have any food ingredients?

75
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,330
You know, like ham and eggs.

76
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,060
- To do what?
- To make a lunch box...

77
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,560
for me and Anchor Lee.

78
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,400
Why do you want your perfectly
good relationship to fall in peril?

79
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,639
Hey, we won't fall in peril
for making a lunch box.

80
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,599
Back then,
it was my first time trying.

81
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:55,969
Don't you think he'll be touched
when I make a lunch box for him?

82
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:58,740
Yes, I think he'll show
a big reaction in another way.

83
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,449
Gosh, what if he gets
too touched and cries?

84
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,120
I don't have enough time
to make that again.

85
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,379
Okay, try your best.
It's not for me anyway.

86
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,189
Even if I don't try hard,
it should be pretty delicious.

87
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:12,020
Wait, why are there
so many articles on Anchor Lee?

88
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,159
About what?

89
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:14,189
("Is Anchor Lee Suffering
From Hyperthymesia?")

90
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:17,329
Apparently, there's a book
about him.

91
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,360
A book?

92
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,899
It's called
"The Man Who Cannot Forget".

93
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,319
Excuse me.

94
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:38,680
How may I help you?

95
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,290
I've disclosed information
about my patient...

96
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:43,620
whom I had been treating
for a long time.

97
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:45,990
I've violated the medical law.

98
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:49,829
So you're a doctor,

99
00:04:49,829 --> 00:04:52,230
and you're turning yourself in...

100
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:54,370
for disclosing
your patient's personal information?

101
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:56,129
That's correct.

102
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:00,470
I met his new lover...

103
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:03,540
and told her about his illness.

104
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:08,550
He will always have her
in his heart.

105
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,420
Will you be okay with that?

106
00:05:13,949 --> 00:05:15,519
Will their love endure...

107
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,759
this complicated
and frightening illness?

108
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:22,860
Will he truly be able
to break free...

109
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,730
from his past and love someone else?

110
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,939
Although I'm skeptical,

111
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:34,339
I do wish them the best...

112
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,170
and close this book.

113
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,850
Do you have time?

114
00:05:55,129 --> 00:05:58,160
How are you feeling?
Shouldn't you still be resting?

115
00:05:58,199 --> 00:05:59,600
If you were that worried,

116
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,329
you should've visited me
at the hospital.

117
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,170
You must've been in a rush,

118
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,439
seeing how
you just left the fruit basket.

119
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:07,000
I saw Ha Jin there, so I didn't want
to ruin it for you guys.

120
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,839
Did you guys talk it out?

121
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:13,339
Yes. I think so.

122
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:15,110
I'm glad.

123
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:18,620
You should be happy
that everything has worked out.

124
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,019
I'm sorry.

125
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,490
I'm talking about my father's book.

126
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,790
I tried to dissuade him
and even threatened him.

127
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:28,829
I tried my best.

128
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:30,430
You knew?

129
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,430
I should've told you in advance...

130
00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:36,699
and thought of a solution together.

131
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,540
I'm sorry.

132
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:44,339
To be honest, I'm quite flustered...

133
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,439
and upset as well.

134
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,350
But you shouldn't be sorry
about this.

135
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,750
It's just an illness I have.

136
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:55,019
I was never planning
to keep it a secret forever.

137
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,920
But now that everyone
has found out, I'm a bit scared...

138
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,490
about how they'll react.

139
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,689
That's why we should
take care of this.

140
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:06,259
Don't hold yourself back for us.

141
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:08,930
What do you mean?

142
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,740
I went to the police station.

143
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:12,939
I turned myself in and told them...

144
00:07:12,939 --> 00:07:15,410
that I had disclosed
your information.

145
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,639
Why would you do that?

146
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:19,480
My father wanted to see
how you were doing...

147
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,310
and asked me to send your results
every time you had your checkup.

148
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:24,750
I had no idea he was planning this.

149
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:28,519
Disclosing a patient's information
is a violation.

150
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,689
We'll be penalized.

151
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,889
And that book won't get sold.

152
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,029
You want me to sue you?

153
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:37,529
If you don't, I'll charge my father.

154
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:38,560
Tae Eun.

155
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,870
I'm sure he knew
you'd be soft like this.

156
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,339
That's why he did the unthinkable.

157
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,939
And that's why I want
to fix this even more.

158
00:07:48,939 --> 00:07:52,740
If something happens to you
because of this,

159
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,649
I won't be able to stand it.

160
00:07:56,649 --> 00:07:57,879
So please do that.

161
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,750
I'll be going now.

162
00:08:20,269 --> 00:08:21,410
Do you want some coffee?

163
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:23,769
Okay.

164
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:29,750
What they said about Anchor Lee
is true, right?

165
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:34,220
Did you already know
about his illness?

166
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,120
Ha Kyung.

167
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:39,960
How could a doctor disclose
his patient's information?

168
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,259
It's about Anchor Lee.
He had no right to do that.

169
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,230
I hope people won't think badly
about him.

170
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:49,399
I'm worried...

171
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,000
they'll be judgmental
when they know nothing about him.

172
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:55,639
He did nothing wrong.

173
00:08:57,379 --> 00:09:01,379
Don't worry too much.
You know how people forget easily.

174
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,110
They'll lose interest soon.

175
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,379
I really hope so.

176
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,120
I don't want him to hurt anymore.

177
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,230
Guess where I am.

178
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,090
Did you wait for a long time?

179
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:50,389
No. You did well today.

180
00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:53,730
Did you miss me?

181
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,840
Of course. I missed you so much.

182
00:09:58,570 --> 00:09:59,669
How about you?

183
00:09:59,669 --> 00:10:02,610
Me too. That's why I hurried over.

184
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,610
How do you feel?

185
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,779
Does the wound hurt?
Do you have a fever?

186
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,649
I'm doing fine, and it doesn't hurt.

187
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:11,950
You don't seem to be having a fever.

188
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,019
Are you sure you're okay?

189
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,919
I'm positive.

190
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:19,490
Okay. You've passed.
We can go on a picnic.

191
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,460
A picnic?

192
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:24,159
Going on a picnic is the best way
to get some fresh air.

193
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:30,029
We just need to walk a bit more.
We're almost there.

194
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:33,399
I've never gone on a picnic
at this hour before.

195
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,539
The time doesn't matter.

196
00:10:35,539 --> 00:10:37,379
What matters
is whom you're going with.

197
00:10:39,309 --> 00:10:41,580
I packed a lunchbox and a mat.

198
00:10:43,049 --> 00:10:46,019
Don't tell me you made that.

199
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:48,049
Of course, I did.

200
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,820
Why? Are you afraid
you'd feel extremely touched?

201
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:57,129
I'm touched and scared.

202
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:59,299
It's going to be delicious.

203
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,899
You're doing it again.
It's dangerous.

204
00:11:02,669 --> 00:11:04,039
Walk properly.

205
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:08,440
It's not dangerous
if you're holding onto me.

206
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,809
I know you'll be holding onto me
in the future as well.

207
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,590
There. Sit down.

208
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:32,429
Can I finally see what you've made?

209
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,730
Oh, right. I almost forgot.

210
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,740
Since it's late,
I just made some simple stuff.

211
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,009
I gave it my all,
so you better finish it.

212
00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:44,139
Ta-da.

213
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,879
I see.

214
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:48,879
That's it?

215
00:11:49,549 --> 00:11:50,779
It looks nice.

216
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:54,690
There are various shapes,
and they look unique.

217
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:57,559
Is this a dolphin?

218
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,759
Bingo.

219
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:03,460
This must be your feelings
toward me.

220
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,129
You're right. It's a heart.

221
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:07,669
A heart. And...

222
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,470
Is this a rabbit?

223
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,200
Isn't it obvious?

224
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,299
You're right.

225
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:14,309
I was really passionate
about making the rabbits.

226
00:12:14,409 --> 00:12:17,840
You may have been too passionate
and cut off an ear.

227
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,309
You're right.

228
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:25,049
Isn't it good?

229
00:12:27,049 --> 00:12:28,120
It is.

230
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,090
Did you read the book?

231
00:12:34,789 --> 00:12:37,529
Did you plan all of this
to cheer me up?

232
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,370
Yes.

233
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:44,200
Why didn't you tell me
that you met with Professor Yoo?

234
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,139
You must've been very surprised.

235
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,539
The things he said
didn't matter one bit to me.

236
00:12:51,809 --> 00:12:54,279
You said you were happy.

237
00:12:55,409 --> 00:12:56,779
That's good enough for me.

238
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:58,419
What about now?

239
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,850
Are you still happy?

240
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:05,090
Yes, I am.

241
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,559
That's good enough for me too.

242
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:11,730
I'm glad.

243
00:13:13,929 --> 00:13:16,169
I'm not sure if this will help,

244
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,299
but people forget things
more easily than you think.

245
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:23,769
So I hope you won't be
in too much pain.

246
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:26,679
Okay.

247
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,480
Isn't it uncomfortable to sit here?

248
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,049
It may not be good for your wound.

249
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:35,990
Hold on.

250
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,690
Lie down.

251
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:40,519
Lie down?

252
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:52,700
Going on a picnic at 1 a.m.
isn't that bad, right?

253
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,039
Didn't I do a fantastic job
planning this date?

254
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,690
This is part of our date too.

255
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:17,289
The last part of our date.

256
00:14:18,929 --> 00:14:19,929
It's nice.

257
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:23,669
I especially like the last part.

258
00:14:59,539 --> 00:15:01,370
I heard from Anchor Lee.

259
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,840
He told me that you're trying...

260
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,740
your best to fix the situation
regarding the book.

261
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:08,580
I'm worried that
you might get hurt from this too.

262
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,250
You don't have to worry about me.

263
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,450
I'm okay.

264
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:14,950
But please take good care
of Jeong Hoon.

265
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,950
This must be hard for him to bear.

266
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,120
This is the same as getting
betrayed by a trusted friend.

267
00:15:21,429 --> 00:15:22,590
I will.

268
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:26,000
And I want to apologize
to you as well.

269
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:28,899
Whatever my father told you,

270
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:31,100
don't let that get to you.

271
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,299
Why do you keep apologizing?

272
00:15:33,539 --> 00:15:35,169
It's not even your fault.

273
00:15:38,509 --> 00:15:42,179
Actually, I asked you to see me
because I had something to tell you.

274
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,279
What is it?

275
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,450
Do you remember
what you told me the other day?

276
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,690
You said you didn't want
to make the same mistake again.

277
00:15:53,059 --> 00:15:55,129
That's been on my mind.

278
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,000
What happened in the past...

279
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:02,100
was neither your mistake
nor responsibility.

280
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,600
It was my decision.

281
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,639
So you don't need to be sorry
about what happened.

282
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,879
I am always grateful to you.

283
00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:16,809
I was grateful back then
and still am.

284
00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:22,250
I wanted to tell you this.

285
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,259
Thank you for saying that.

286
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:32,360
(Professor Yoo Sung Hyuk)

287
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:43,070
Yes.

288
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:49,549
- What is this about?
- Are you Professor Yoo Sung Hyuk?

289
00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:51,320
We're the police.

290
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,480
You have been sued
for a violation of disclosing...

291
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,620
a patient's medical record
and breaking the medical law.

292
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,720
Come with us.

293
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,079
(Medical License)

294
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,980
Do you know where I was just now?

295
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:24,450
It was you who pressed
charges against me.

296
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:26,079
Did they take your statement?

297
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,349
This is on a whole new level
of embarrassing your own father.

298
00:17:30,289 --> 00:17:33,059
How dare you talk to the university
and worsen the situation?

299
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:35,990
I thought you would only stop
if I took extreme measures.

300
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,329
Jeong Hoon didn't do anything.

301
00:17:37,329 --> 00:17:39,299
Who are you to go around
and throw dirt on my name?

302
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,869
Why are you so anxious
to bring down your own father?

303
00:17:42,869 --> 00:17:45,069
I didn't bring you down.

304
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:47,069
You did it to yourself.

305
00:17:47,539 --> 00:17:49,210
You brought this upon yourself.

306
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:50,740
Are you out of your mind?

307
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,940
More than anything,

308
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,779
you were wrong.

309
00:17:53,779 --> 00:17:55,279
How was I wrong?

310
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:58,819
It looks like Jeong Hoon found
a way to live in the present...

311
00:17:58,819 --> 00:18:01,690
while keeping his past with him.

312
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,549
It was you...

313
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:06,490
who couldn't accept that
and stayed in the past.

314
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:08,990
What on earth are you talking about?

315
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:12,599
Do you even know
what you're jabbering about now?

316
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,269
If you're done, please leave.

317
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,269
I need to wrap things up here.

318
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,380
("Lee Jeong Hoon,
Is He Really a Gentle Tyrant?")

319
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:35,150
This must be the revenge
Park Soo Chang prepared for me.

320
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:37,450
I knew that he was a jerk.

321
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,259
I had no idea he was a scumbag.

322
00:18:39,789 --> 00:18:42,329
I'm sure he'll talk about the book.
Is this okay?

323
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,599
Perhaps, we should stop him.

324
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:46,099
I could make it worse...

325
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:47,599
if I make my move rashly.

326
00:18:49,069 --> 00:18:51,029
Let's watch his show today.

327
00:18:51,369 --> 00:18:52,539
Hello.

328
00:18:52,769 --> 00:18:54,509
I was fired from my job a while ago.

329
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:57,039
I'm Reporter Park Soo Chang
of "Real Entertainment".

330
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,480
It turns out that a lot of people
were waiting for my show.

331
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,880
Thank you so much.

332
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:05,880
The question I got
the most from you guys was...

333
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,990
if the main character of "The Man
Who Cannot Forget", H,

334
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:12,220
was truly Anchor Lee.
That was the question.

335
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:15,359
Talking about what everyone
already knows won't be fun.

336
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:19,130
I like putting "first"
or "exclusive" on my articles.

337
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:22,799
I prepared to share something new.

338
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:25,670
Here's what I prepared.

339
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,039
(The 29th Yearbook)

340
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:31,069
This is it.

341
00:19:31,309 --> 00:19:33,809
This is the yearbook
of Yeo Ha Jin's high school.

342
00:19:33,809 --> 00:19:36,849
All right. Take a look.

343
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:39,720
Right here. Do you see her name?

344
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:41,650
"Yeo Ha Jin".

345
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:44,559
Let's take a look
at the group photo.

346
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,460
She always took photos
with this girl.

347
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,089
She must be her best friend,

348
00:19:49,089 --> 00:19:51,130
but when I looked at her name,

349
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,930
it sounded quite familiar.

350
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,829
I thought about
where I heard her name from.

351
00:19:56,869 --> 00:19:58,470
And I remembered a name.

352
00:19:58,869 --> 00:19:59,869
It was...

353
00:20:00,369 --> 00:20:03,509
Sadly, she died
in a tragic incident.

354
00:20:04,109 --> 00:20:07,009
It was Anchor Lee's first love. Yes.

355
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,779
She used to be
Yeo Ha Jin's best friend.

356
00:20:11,579 --> 00:20:13,950
Everyone, how does this make sense?

357
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:16,190
The woman he loved died.

358
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:19,420
But he fell in love
with the woman's best friend again.

359
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,890
Do you think it's possible?
I don't think I can do it.

360
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:24,190
Why don't I read your opinions?

361
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:27,059
"I didn't peg him
to be a piece of trash."

362
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,329
Everyone has
a similar opinion with me.

363
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:32,039
Ethically, this can't be. You know.

364
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:35,170
That's why I was very shocked after
reading about their relationship.

365
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:38,509
Seo Yeon and Ha Jin
were really close.

366
00:20:38,509 --> 00:20:41,380
Yeo Ha Jin recently played a role
in a morning soap opera...

367
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,279
I heard they've been friends
ever since they were kids.

368
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:45,420
Doesn't that mean
she already knew about him...

369
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,880
when her friend dated him?

370
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:50,019
No way.
Then, when her friend was alive,

371
00:20:50,089 --> 00:20:51,460
did they have a fling or something?

372
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,089
Just the thought creeps me out.

373
00:20:53,089 --> 00:20:56,230
My gosh. I'm more disappointed
in Lee Jeong Hoon.

374
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:57,890
I didn't think he was such a jerk.

375
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,430
Is this too much?

376
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:05,099
They might think this doesn't
suit my role as a teacher.

377
00:21:05,099 --> 00:21:06,339
Come on. It's not a shoot.

378
00:21:06,339 --> 00:21:08,369
It's just a meeting with a director.
Why not?

379
00:21:08,369 --> 00:21:09,470
You look pretty.

380
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,670
- I do?
- Yes.

381
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,180
I should put on a different pair.

382
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:14,710
If you ask me one more time,
I'll kill you.

383
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,150
Gosh.

384
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:19,380
Goodness.

385
00:21:19,819 --> 00:21:21,390
Ms. Park, did something happen?

386
00:21:21,619 --> 00:21:23,890
The production company
just called me...

387
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:26,119
to cancel the meeting.

388
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:28,559
How could they be so rude?

389
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:30,759
I'm sure something urgent came up.

390
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:32,200
Did they reschedule?

391
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,660
They didn't even say that.

392
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,500
That's why I'm angrier.

393
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,700
Out of the blue, they just said
it'd be best if we didn't meet.

394
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:40,740
Hold on.

395
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,509
What is it? You're worrying me.

396
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,549
Has he lost his mind?

397
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:51,450
- What is it?
- It was Anchor Lee's first love.

398
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:53,579
She used to be
Yeo Ha Jin's best friend.

399
00:21:54,549 --> 00:21:55,549
Everyone.

400
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,359
Why did you watch that?

401
00:21:58,359 --> 00:21:59,759
I said you would only get mad.

402
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:02,529
Why is Reporter Park
going such length to torture us?

403
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,130
We were the victims.

404
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:05,859
That scumbag doesn't need a reason.

405
00:22:05,859 --> 00:22:07,400
He's just a scumbag.

406
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,099
Did you talk to Anchor Lee about it?

407
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,740
We talked on the phone earlier.

408
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,710
But he only asked me
where I was and hung up.

409
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,680
Things must be hectic for him too.

410
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,779
He already has a lot on his plate
with the publication.

411
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:26,380
How come we never have
an uneventful day?

412
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:28,890
I agree.

413
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:36,490
Hold on.

414
00:22:36,829 --> 00:22:37,960
- Don't open it, Ha Jin.
- Wait.

415
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,430
- It's Ha Jin.
- It's Yeo Ha Jin.

416
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:43,200
Is it true you were a close friend
of Anchor Lee's first love?

417
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,269
Were you really friends
with the woman...

418
00:22:45,269 --> 00:22:46,400
from "The Man Who Cannot Forget"?

419
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,269
What did Anchor Lee say
about today's news?

420
00:22:48,269 --> 00:22:49,910
- Say something.
- Say a word.

421
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,210
- Answer our questions.
- Ms. Yeo!

422
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:54,539
- That's Anchor Lee!
- What?

423
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,609
- That's Anchor Lee.
- That's Anchor Lee.

424
00:22:56,609 --> 00:22:58,009
- It's Lee Jeong Hoon.
- It's Jeong Hoon.

425
00:22:58,009 --> 00:22:59,319
- He's coming here.
- Say something.

426
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:00,880
- Say something.
- Jeong Hoon.

427
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,549
- Answer our questions.
- Is everything true?

428
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:03,750
- Say something.
- Is it true?

429
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,660
- Please say something.
- Jeong Hoon.

430
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,390
- Come here.
- Say something.

431
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,960
- Can you answer our questions?
- Is it true?

432
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,930
- Anything for today's news?
- Is it all true?

433
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:13,400
- Please say something.
- What was your relationship?

434
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,000
- Don't avoid us. Answer it!
- Come on, answer our questions.

435
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,730
- Hold on.
- Anchor Lee!

436
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,500
- Anchor Lee!
- Say something.

437
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,869
Please tell us what's going on.

438
00:23:20,869 --> 00:23:22,140
Guys!

439
00:23:24,109 --> 00:23:25,440
Why don't we talk?

440
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,109
You must've been caught off guard.

441
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:33,079
Is your wound okay?
Are you overworking yourself?

442
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:35,150
I'm okay now. I'm good as new.

443
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,819
But how did you know?

444
00:23:37,819 --> 00:23:39,690
There were reporters
in front of my house too.

445
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,430
I'm glad I got here in time.

446
00:23:42,859 --> 00:23:43,859
My gosh.

447
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:46,930
This makes me realize that
there are so many reporters...

448
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:48,369
covering entertainment in Korea.

449
00:23:48,369 --> 00:23:49,799
I'm a reporter too.

450
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,769
Right.

451
00:23:52,569 --> 00:23:53,839
Why don't you sit down and wait?

452
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:55,869
I'll come down
after I change my outfit quickly.

453
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:57,039
Okay.

454
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,410
I'll get rid of these reporters
and stop by the office.

455
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:34,410
Tell Anchor Lee to stay home
until I come back.

456
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:37,950
(Ha Kyung)

457
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,519
All right, thanks.

458
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,890
(All right, thanks.)

459
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:50,930
Your feet are cold, aren't they?

460
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,730
Wear these.

461
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:55,400
- What are these?
- Slippers.

462
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:58,640
Are... Are these
the only ones you have?

463
00:24:58,769 --> 00:25:01,170
You're a guest,
so I'm giving you my favorites.

464
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:02,240
They're new.

465
00:25:02,869 --> 00:25:04,910
I want something
a little more simple.

466
00:25:05,809 --> 00:25:07,309
Those are the simplest ones.

467
00:25:07,809 --> 00:25:09,279
Thank you, I guess.

468
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,549
Did you eat dinner?

469
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,119
No, I was really busy.

470
00:25:15,349 --> 00:25:18,490
That's great. My dinner plans
got canceled, so I haven't eaten.

471
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:19,660
Do you want to make something?

472
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,829
"Make something"?
Are you going to cook?

473
00:25:21,829 --> 00:25:24,730
It takes me a while to cook,
but I'm a good cook when I try.

474
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:28,470
I know you're good when you put
your heart and soul into it.

475
00:25:29,369 --> 00:25:31,700
But I'm way too hungry
to wait a long time,

476
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,140
so let's eat something simple.

477
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,339
What a relief.

478
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,640
Something simple sounds good.
Do you need help?

479
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:41,609
Can you get stuff from that cabinet?

480
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,079
What are all these?

481
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,089
This is the cabinet for
everything that's delicious.

482
00:25:50,089 --> 00:25:52,019
I can only eat these
when Ha Kyung gives them to me.

483
00:25:53,259 --> 00:25:55,589
Your manager is very strict.

484
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:57,960
Okay.

485
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,029
I'm not taking anything out
with my hands.

486
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,259
What do you want?

487
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,529
Bread!

488
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:05,700
Bread.

489
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:10,009
And chocolate jam.

490
00:26:10,009 --> 00:26:11,309
Chocolate jam.

491
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:14,410
And popcorn.
And cookies too, right below.

492
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:20,119
Are you sure you can eat everything?

493
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:22,589
The only thing Ha Kyung and I
have in common is our stomach.

494
00:26:22,589 --> 00:26:23,849
This is a piece of cake.

495
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:34,700
Anchor Lee, open your mouth.

496
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,730
My mouth?

497
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:41,970
Isn't this delicious?

498
00:26:42,509 --> 00:26:44,210
It tastes exactly like
how I imagined it would be.

499
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:47,079
Anchor Lee, open your mouth.

500
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:48,180
Again?

501
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,609
I think I'm all done.

502
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:54,579
No way.
You have to keep having a bite...

503
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:55,849
to be my accomplice.

504
00:26:55,849 --> 00:26:57,490
Are you really going to
finish everything?

505
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:59,190
I forgot to bring
something very important.

506
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:16,470
This is yours, this is mine.

507
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:17,940
Mine, thanks.

508
00:27:18,009 --> 00:27:19,109
Let's make a toast.

509
00:27:19,809 --> 00:27:21,180
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

510
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:40,160
Take it off.

511
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:44,200
You said it was your first...

512
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,799
Let's keep doing things
the way we did today.

513
00:27:50,509 --> 00:27:52,380
Things will be
pretty rough for a while.

514
00:27:54,809 --> 00:27:57,450
It might take
much longer than we thought,

515
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:01,049
and it might be
much harder than we expected.

516
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:05,259
But like today,

517
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,319
let's bear through.

518
00:28:10,089 --> 00:28:11,190
I'll do that.

519
00:28:13,259 --> 00:28:14,500
I'll be even better.

520
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:17,829
Just like today.

521
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:20,569
Anchor Lee,

522
00:28:21,569 --> 00:28:23,410
you can just do everything
as you did today.

523
00:28:25,509 --> 00:28:26,579
I'll do that.
