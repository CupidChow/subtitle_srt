1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,509
That's all for tonight.

2
00:00:03,509 --> 00:00:04,910
Have a great night.

00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:12,949
- Great work.
- Great work.

00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,289
- Great work.
- Great work.

("Lee Jeong Hoon's News Live")

7
00:00:20,059 --> 00:00:21,489
Great job.

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,160
You look the coolest
when you read the news.

9
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:25,429
Thank you.

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,530
I'll get changed quickly.

11
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:28,530
Okay.

12
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:31,870
Goodness,
it's so nice to see you, Ha Jin.

13
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,810
- Hello.
- Gosh.

14
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:36,409
You two always look great together.

15
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:39,679
Right, this is great. Jeong Hoon and
I are going out to eat something.

16
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:40,979
You should come with us.

17
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,079
We're going out to eat something?

18
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:45,549
- Why?
- What do you mean, "Why?"

19
00:00:45,549 --> 00:00:48,350
We're celebrating your return.

20
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,719
It's my treat.

21
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,320
Okay, let's go!

22
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,229
- Ha Jin, let's go.
- Okay.

23
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:57,229
Let's go.

24
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,109
There it is.

25
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:15,609
Ha Jin, I found my phone.

26
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:16,849
Call me when you're done.

27
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,420
Okay. But I'm at a wine bar
with Anchor Lee.

28
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,650
A wine bar?

29
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,989
Okay. I'll wait nearby.

30
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:18,639
You jerk!

31
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,610
It's me! Jo Il Kwon! Jo Il Kwon!

32
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,250
It's me, Report Jo!

33
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:26,819
Reporter Jo?

34
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,020
Has it been you all along?

35
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,460
No, it's not like that.
This is my house!

36
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:39,229
My house! This is my house.

37
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:40,770
This is my house.

38
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,300
This is your house?

39
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,669
Yes. Jeong Hoon asked me to use it.
That's why I was away.

40
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,240
Can you put that down?

41
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:53,110
Were you the one
who sent those photos?

42
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,750
What photos?

43
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:00,180
I'm sorry I hit you.

44
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:04,319
I thought you were the stalker.
What were you doing?

45
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,889
I had to organize some stuff
in a hurry.

46
00:03:06,889 --> 00:03:08,629
What did you have to organize
so suddenly?

47
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,330
Stuff related to my girlfriend.

48
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,900
She was cheating on me.

49
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,000
"Cheating"?

50
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,050
She's a wench!

51
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,180
Don't you love the vibe here?

52
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,189
Yes, it's nice.

53
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:37,360
Since you can't drink alcohol,
just sip on your water.

54
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,389
Ha Jin, can you drink
another glass of wine?

55
00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:41,430
I'd love to.

56
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:43,900
You said you were going to treat me
to something delicious.

57
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,759
Were you talking
about this wine bar?

58
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,370
Their cheese is delicious. Try it.

59
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,099
Or do you want me to treat you
to something tastier?

60
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:52,800
Is something wrong?

61
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:54,469
No. Why?

62
00:03:54,469 --> 00:03:56,840
You're not acting
like your usual self.

63
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,979
Let's just say...

64
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:03,919
I've finally become grateful
for the things around me.

65
00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:07,189
You'll know once you become my age.

66
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:08,949
Excuse me.

67
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,090
Hello?

68
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,069
Let's get up.

69
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:23,569
- What?
- Hurry.

70
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:28,410
What? Are you going to the toilet?
It's over there.

71
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:29,970
No, I'm not.

72
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:32,310
It's over there.

73
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,879
Now that I'm back, cheers!

74
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:38,879
Cheers.

75
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,730
What a ridiculous woman.

76
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,800
And she slapped you?

77
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:53,300
I knew she was an odd one
ever since you said...

78
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,329
she couldn't finish
a single sushi set.

79
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,670
Calm down and drink that.

80
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,839
So what will you do?
Did you take your revenge?

81
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:00,410
No, I couldn't do anything.

82
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,769
She chose him over me.
I was speechless.

83
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:06,240
She wants a man
whom she can count on.

84
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,480
Gosh, and what?
She can count on that guy?

85
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,120
He's an MMA fighter.

86
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,649
I see.

87
00:05:13,949 --> 00:05:15,089
Ha Kyung.

88
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:18,259
Do I not look dependable?

89
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:19,389
Do I look weak?

90
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:20,389
Yes.

91
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:24,060
I see.

92
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:28,300
So what? Are you going
to sit there and do nothing?

93
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,029
Then should I take my revenge?

94
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:31,139
Of course.

95
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:33,740
Strong men seem to be
her ideal type.

96
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,740
Fighting isn't about strength.
It's about skills.

97
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,779
What do you say?
Do you want my help?

98
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,779
Your help?

99
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,480
Do you not trust me?

100
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,779
No, it's not like that.

101
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:47,889
Sure, you can help me.

102
00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:51,089
You're so trustworthy. You sure are.

103
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,829
Skills like this one?
This is amazing.

104
00:05:53,829 --> 00:05:55,930
You twisted my arm earlier as well.

105
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,629
Come on, wait a minute.

106
00:05:58,629 --> 00:06:00,500
This was the arm you twisted.

107
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,329
Wait. It hurts.

108
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:03,939
We'll begin starting next week.

109
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,439
What?

110
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,310
I don't care.

111
00:06:11,379 --> 00:06:14,180
You keep saying okay
and wanting to hang up.

112
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,550
But what are you okay about?

113
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:22,089
I just miss you...

114
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:23,889
so terribly.

115
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:27,060
So hurry up and come here.

116
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,759
He's very cute toward his wife.

117
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,699
I don't know.

118
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,329
If you don't come here,
I won't go home tonight.

119
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:36,970
Jeong Hoon, call her over.

120
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:38,870
She'll probably listen to you.

121
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,509
You guys are always so close.

122
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:45,240
Am I an outcast or what?

123
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,240
It's me.

124
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:49,980
Oh, you're almost here?
Please hurry.

125
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,589
Are you close with his wife?

126
00:06:59,089 --> 00:07:00,759
You know her as well.

127
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,829
I do?

128
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,300
Is she a celebrity?

129
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,740
- Director Choi.
- Hello.

130
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,069
What kind of humiliation is this?

131
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:20,410
Please wake up, Team Manager Kim!

132
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:25,550
It's my beautiful wife!

133
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,550
"Wife"?

134
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,829
I'm truly sorry about this.

135
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,759
Let me apologize on his behalf.

136
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:38,100
That's fine.

137
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:40,459
Get up.

138
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:42,399
Get up right now.

139
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,769
Why would you volunteer
as a third wheel...

140
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:51,310
and cause a scene?

141
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,540
- I was...
- Gosh.

142
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:55,680
just welcoming him back.

143
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,050
Goodness.

144
00:07:57,779 --> 00:08:01,490
And I just missed you terribly.

145
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,220
That's enough.

146
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,689
Get in the taxi. Go.

147
00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:06,990
I'm truly sorry.

148
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,529
Hurry!

149
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:10,959
Get in. Gosh.

150
00:08:11,899 --> 00:08:14,800
Ha Jin, I'm so sorry. Bye.

151
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,670
- Wait...
- Get in there.

152
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,370
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

153
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:22,370
Please forget about tonight.
See you tomorrow.

154
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:23,740
Go home safely.

155
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:30,410
So the young man...

156
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,679
she met at a church was him.

157
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,789
Yes.

158
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:37,620
What didn't you tell me
that they were a couple?

159
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:41,230
It wasn't intentional.
I didn't have the chance to...

160
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,059
My car is parked
at the broadcasting station.

161
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:45,799
It'd be better for you
to take a cab, right?

162
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:47,700
It's okay. It's not that far.

163
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,000
Let's take a walk.

164
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,169
I've never been here before.

165
00:08:55,309 --> 00:08:57,879
It's a totally different scenery.

166
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:00,710
It's empty and quiet.

167
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:04,419
When is the read-through?

168
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:08,490
I'm not sure, but I'm guessing
around the end of this month.

169
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,120
But I'm worried...

170
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,590
because my news tutor seems
to have forgotten about me.

171
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,059
I think I'll become a laughingstock.

172
00:09:17,429 --> 00:09:20,059
When are you free?
I'll help you.

173
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:23,000
Really? I'm free starting today...

174
00:09:29,409 --> 00:09:30,539
Be careful.

175
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:34,149
I completely forgot...

176
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:38,049
that I should always be on alert
when I'm around you.

177
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,289
You're making me nervous again.

178
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,360
Why?

179
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:50,360
I'm worried you'll say goodbye again
like last time.

180
00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:55,799
That time, you were nice to me
at first and then said...

181
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:57,399
you didn't want to see me again.

182
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:02,769
But I'm not going
to listen to you anymore.

183
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:06,080
You see, I want you to be happy.

184
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:08,980
That's why I'm not going
to say goodbye.

185
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:24,960
All right.

186
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,690
(Director Ji Hyun Geun)

187
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,659
Hello, sir. It's Ha Kyung.

188
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:03,769
Why are you picking up her phone?

189
00:11:03,769 --> 00:11:05,799
She's filming at the moment.

190
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,870
Okay. I'll call back later.

191
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,169
Wait.

192
00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:14,679
The filming just started,

193
00:11:14,809 --> 00:11:16,549
so it'll take some time.

194
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:19,149
Can you tell me what this is about?

195
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:21,950
I'm in front of your house
because I have a gift for her.

196
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,360
You're in front of our house?

197
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,919
Tell me when she'll be done,
and I'll stop by then.

198
00:11:27,889 --> 00:11:30,759
I'm sorry, but she'll be filming
all night today.

199
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:34,600
If you don't want to leave it there,
you can drop it off at the office.

200
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,899
There's no need for that.

201
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,340
Just tell her to call me
once she's done.

202
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,039
It's okay if she's late.
I'll be waiting.

203
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:41,440
All right.

204
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:45,809
Don't hold your breath, you scumbag.

205
00:11:46,309 --> 00:11:48,950
What's his deal?
Why is he in front of the house?

206
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:51,580
How dare she tell me what to do?

207
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:04,600
Did I get a call?
You were talking to someone.

208
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,929
Yes, Director Ji called.

209
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,330
Why did he call?

210
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:09,470
It's nothing.

211
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:12,440
I told him that you were
busy filming, so don't worry.

212
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,370
Okay.

213
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:17,909
Let's spam his number.

214
00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:20,039
He'll call my number if it's urgent.

215
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:23,509
It could've been him.

216
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:28,419
He could've sneaked in and left
those photos and the letter.

217
00:12:32,289 --> 00:12:35,559
I'm bound to run
into both him and Chul again.

218
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:37,559
I don't know how I can face them.

219
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:39,600
You don't have to face them. Don't.

220
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,129
Don't even answer their calls
for the time being.

221
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,529
I blocked his number.

222
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:49,440
Yes, Ms. Park.

223
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,840
How's the place you're staying at?

224
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,549
How about the security?
We can trust it, right?

225
00:12:55,179 --> 00:12:57,179
Yes. I'm so relieved to hear that.

226
00:12:57,179 --> 00:12:59,350
Yes. Okay.

227
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,519
Okay.

228
00:13:01,289 --> 00:13:02,289
Ms. Park.

229
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,320
Hey, Chul.

230
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,990
I checked the schedule.
I'm with Se Min next month too.

231
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,460
Does it mean I can't work
with Ha Jin anymore?

232
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:12,659
My gosh, it's not that.
It's just for the time being.

233
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:14,059
Did I do something wrong?

234
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:17,100
It's not like I was bad at my job
or did anything wrong.

235
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,799
Why am I getting kicked out?

236
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:21,610
My gosh,
you're not getting kicked out.

237
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,940
Chul, don't get so worked up.

238
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,440
Ha Kyung told you
to kick me out, right?

239
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:31,379
Are you suspecting me?

240
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,820
That I'm Ha Jin's stalker?

241
00:13:34,149 --> 00:13:35,990
- You...
- How could you?

242
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,519
It's not me. Okay?

243
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,990
It's not me!

244
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,120
Darn it.

245
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,610
Darn it!

246
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:10,409
Park Soo Chang?

247
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:13,649
Get out.

248
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,820
Get out.

249
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,509
You sent Soo Chang's memory card
to get it fixed. Is it done yet?

250
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,840
Not yet. After deleting the photos,

251
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,279
he saved other files
in the same memory card.

252
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:42,179
I was told it would take some time.

253
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:43,610
Let me check on that now.

254
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,750
Okay. I'm on my way to work.

255
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,120
How much of it did they recover?

256
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,889
I brought everything
they recovered so far.

257
00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:52,789
They recovered about 80 percent.

258
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,899
What?
These are all photos of Ha Jin.

259
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:07,100
My gosh, he took
her photos like a stalker.

260
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,340
Call the newspaper agency
he works in.

261
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,480
Ask them if he's in the office
and call me.

262
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,710
Okay, I will.

263
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,960
(Information:
10th floor, Censorship Board)

264
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:07,660
Why are you attacking me
out of nowhere?

265
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:11,900
You know what? I've treated you
with respect since you're my senior.

266
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,240
Do you think I'm a joke?

267
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:15,640
Is tailing me your way
of showing your respect?

268
00:17:16,509 --> 00:17:18,210
What are you talking about?

269
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:20,509
You're the one
who's attacking me at my work.

270
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,150
Check that first.

271
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:26,920
What is it?

272
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:34,559
You secretly tailed her,

273
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,089
broke into her house,

274
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:37,730
and sent me a threatening letter.

275
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,359
That was you, wasn't it?

276
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:44,329
My gosh. What are you talking about?

277
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:46,569
I just took them,
so I can publish articles.

278
00:17:46,569 --> 00:17:49,039
You know
I'm in the entertainment section.

279
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,170
I'm not here to listen
to your excuses.

280
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,539
I came here to warn you.

281
00:17:52,009 --> 00:17:55,079
Starting now, I'll do everything
I can to stop you.

282
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:58,519
I can put you in jail
or bury you in our society.

283
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:00,279
But before that,
I'll do what's easiest.

284
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,890
I'm going to get you fired.

285
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:06,589
My gosh, what on earth
is he saying? Jeong Hoon.

286
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,859
It's not me. I didn't stalk Ha Jin.
Besides...

287
00:18:09,859 --> 00:18:12,200
You know what?
I'm really sorry I tailed you.

288
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,029
Let's be honest here.

289
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,599
You don't have to get
so worked up over this.

290
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:20,200
Some people say that
you two aren't really dating.

291
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:25,910
You call yourself a reporter,
but you can't tell it's a rumor?

292
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:30,150
That's why I don't want you
to do anything.

293
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,950
Burying an incompetent reporter
like you is nothing to me.

294
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,589
Jeong Hoon. Hold on.

295
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:43,930
My gosh. This is driving me crazy.

296
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,000
Okay, Jeong Hoon.

297
00:18:47,329 --> 00:18:49,869
I just got money from that stalker.

298
00:18:50,269 --> 00:18:51,670
And I took Ha Jin's photos
and sold them to him for money.

299
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:52,940
I'm telling the truth.

300
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,569
What are you talking about?

301
00:18:54,569 --> 00:18:58,339
I just did whatever
that jerk asked me to do.

302
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:01,180
Right, this. I...

303
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:05,880
These are the messages
from that jerk.

304
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:10,319
(Black Sugar)

305
00:19:14,589 --> 00:19:15,990
(Returned home at 5 p.m.
after a movie schedule.)

306
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,529
Well,

307
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,900
this is an encrypted messenger
that can't be traced.

308
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,599
And I got paid
with virtual currency too.

309
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,569
You can't track him with this.

310
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:29,269
Do you expect me to believe this?

311
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:30,609
I'm telling the truth.

312
00:19:30,609 --> 00:19:32,910
This is the truth, Jeong Hoon.

313
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,920
Okay. I've never met
the guy in person.

314
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,880
But one time, I observed him
from afar. I didn't see his face.

315
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,349
He messaged me
and told me to pull out.

316
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,589
But I didn't leave.
I stayed there and kept watch.

317
00:19:45,589 --> 00:19:48,990
He was on a motorcycle.
It was a black motorcycle.

318
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:52,960
He must've wanted to hide something
because he covered his plate number.

319
00:19:59,769 --> 00:20:01,869
What a surprise.
Why do you want to go out?

320
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:03,210
We've been cooped up inside.

321
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:05,380
We ought to get
some sunlight and all.

322
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,480
You're right.

323
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,450
I looked it up online.

324
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:10,109
There's an amazing cake shop
around the corner.

325
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:11,349
It's really good.

326
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:12,950
Don't make me run after the cake.

327
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:15,250
Well, you get a pass today.

328
00:20:17,089 --> 00:20:19,619
We're outside now. Put on your mask.

329
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,390
Can I have two pieces of cake?

330
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,960
I get 2 pieces, and you get 1.

331
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,190
I knew it.

332
00:20:28,069 --> 00:20:30,069
Here's our coffee.

333
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,970
That's so pretty!
I have to take photos.

334
00:20:33,769 --> 00:20:35,369
Don't upload them
on your social media.

335
00:20:35,369 --> 00:20:37,539
Of course, I won't.

336
00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:38,579
Look. What do you think?

337
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,240
So beautiful. Can I eat now?

338
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,750
- Attack!
- Attack!

339
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,690
My gosh, this is great.

340
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,990
It's been so long since
we had time to enjoy ourselves.

341
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:54,119
Look what we have to put up with
because of that crazy stalker.

342
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:55,460
Right.

343
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:58,359
We can't stay at that place forever.
I'm worried.

344
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:00,799
Ms. Park is looking for a house
with airtight security.

345
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,970
- Hang in there a bit longer.
- Okay.

346
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,940
Oh, right. I found out who owns
the place we're staying at.

347
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,539
In 1, 2...

348
00:21:07,539 --> 00:21:08,539
Whose house is it?

349
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,769
You know him too.

350
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:13,309
Hey, isn't that Yeo Ha Jin?

351
00:21:13,309 --> 00:21:15,049
- What?
- Yeo Ha Jin.

352
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:16,809
She's so pretty in person!

353
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:18,920
Should I pretend to take your photo
and take her photo instead?

354
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,250
One...

355
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,990
In 1, 2.

356
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:26,019
- Let me see.
- Hey.

357
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:28,490
- It's her.
- I'll upload it on my social media.

358
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:30,089
- Hey, what should I say?
- Awesome.

359
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:32,630
Who said fans could never see
their stars in person?

360
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:34,059
I crushed that myth today!

361
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:36,099
My star, Ha Jin, is so beautiful!

362
00:21:36,269 --> 00:21:38,740
Hashtag, Yeo Ha Jin in person,
Hashtag, the best cafe,

363
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:41,069
Hashtag, Cafe Baba,
Hashtag, Yeo Ha Jin.

364
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,829
Ha Jin, where are you now?

365
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,789
He was on a motorcycle.
It was a black motorcycle.

366
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,789
He must've wanted
to hide something...

367
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:33,990
because he covered his plate number.

368
00:22:37,329 --> 00:22:38,630
I'm hungry.

369
00:22:42,329 --> 00:22:43,500
Anchor Lee!

370
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:12,430
Ha Jin!

371
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,089
Yeong!

372
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,460
Ha Jin.

373
00:23:42,829 --> 00:23:44,799
Stay with me. Are you okay?

374
00:23:50,569 --> 00:23:51,769
Ha Kyung, are you okay?

375
00:23:51,869 --> 00:23:52,940
I'm fine.

376
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:58,279
Oh no.

377
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,809
We better get her to the hospital.

378
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,880
Wait here. I'll get the car.

379
00:24:03,009 --> 00:24:04,180
Oh no.

380
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,349
- Does it hurt a lot?
- Yes.

381
00:24:08,849 --> 00:24:10,819
I didn't have to get hospitalized.

382
00:24:10,819 --> 00:24:12,789
I just hurt my shoulder a little,
that's all.

383
00:24:12,789 --> 00:24:16,059
The doctor said we should see
how you're doing in a day.

384
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:19,099
It won't be too late to go home
after he says you're totally fine.

385
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:22,230
Are you all right?
You must've been surprised.

386
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,400
Don't worry about me.
You need to get well soon.

387
00:24:33,579 --> 00:24:35,210
We received a report.

388
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:37,309
Are you Ms. Yeo Ha Kyung?

389
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:38,519
Yes.

390
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,349
Let me ask you a few questions.

391
00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:45,819
We'll get the security footage of
the scene and start investigating.

392
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,759
Yes, please look into it.

393
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:51,160
Yes. And by any chance,

394
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,059
is there anyone
who could have done this?

395
00:24:56,269 --> 00:24:59,369
No, I'm not sure.

396
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:01,470
Okay. I'll give you a call.

397
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:02,470
Yes.

398
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,980
Are you cold? Do you want water?

399
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,190
Are you hungry?

400
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:16,450
Do you want me to
order some tteokbokki?

401
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:17,890
Just go.

402
00:25:20,289 --> 00:25:22,190
Anchor Lee is here. You need to go.

403
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:23,460
I'm not leaving.

404
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,660
No, I'm telling you to go.

405
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,900
You can't sleep here,

406
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,630
and I can't go to sleep
if I have you here.

407
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:31,170
Should I go home with you?

408
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:33,970
Anchor Lee,
may I ask you for a favor?

409
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:36,569
I don't feel comfortable
leaving her alone in that house.

410
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:38,009
Could you stay with her?

411
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:43,150
Sure, I will.

412
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,519
Are you sure
you'll be okay by yourself?

413
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:46,920
Of course.

414
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,519
I'll call you
when my test results are in.

415
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:50,119
You can come then.
Let's do that. Okay?

416
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:51,819
Go now so that I can rest.

417
00:25:51,819 --> 00:25:54,089
Come on, I'm going to rest. Go.

418
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:23,619
I'm okay now. You should go.

419
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,660
I promised I'll be with you.

420
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:30,759
And you don't look okay right now.

421
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,759
You're right.

422
00:26:36,069 --> 00:26:37,569
I'm not all right.

423
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,109
That motorcycle driver is
my stalker, isn't he?

424
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:47,579
You knew, didn't you?

425
00:26:48,549 --> 00:26:50,549
That's why you ran over.

426
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,849
I really don't know
what will happen now.

427
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,619
If you're troubled, just say so.

428
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:01,960
Don't be troubled all alone.

429
00:27:04,259 --> 00:27:05,630
I'm here to help.

430
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:33,319
Ha Jin.

431
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:37,690
Ha Jin, is something wrong?

432
00:28:43,259 --> 00:28:44,859
I'll come in for a moment.

433
00:28:53,269 --> 00:28:54,299
Ha Jin.

434
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:55,940
Ha Jin.

435
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:59,380
Wake up, Ha Jin. Are you okay?

436
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,349
Anchor Lee.

437
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:12,089
What's wrong?

438
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:14,259
Did you have a nightmare?

439
00:29:17,059 --> 00:29:19,230
The dream was really familiar.

440
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:26,069
It felt really odd
as if I had experienced it.

441
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:32,079
Wait here.
I'll bring something warm.

442
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:38,549
Don't go.

443
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:51,059
I'm not going anywhere.

444
00:29:52,099 --> 00:29:54,029
It'll take only a minute.
Is that okay?

445
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,490
Hello?

446
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:23,589
It's me.

447
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,599
You know me, don't you?

448
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,329
How did you find...

449
00:30:33,099 --> 00:30:35,170
Are you with her right now?

450
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,769
Yeo Ha Jin.

451
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:41,410
What?

452
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,880
Make sure you protect her...

453
00:30:48,549 --> 00:30:50,150
if you don't want to lose her.

454
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:20,779
(Find Me in Your Memory)

455
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:21,950
Who is he?

456
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,619
He already knew where we'll be?

457
00:31:23,619 --> 00:31:26,160
If I mention your stalker
on the news,

458
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,089
it'll provoke him even more.

459
00:31:28,089 --> 00:31:29,460
How's Moon Seong Ho?

460
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,089
Well, it's kind of weird.

461
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:33,230
You don't have to know
every single thing...

462
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:34,700
that happens to Jeong Hoon.

463
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,369
Is it because of Yeo Ha Jin?

464
00:31:36,369 --> 00:31:39,940
Really? You really like
that woman, Yeo Ha Jin?

465
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,069
Are you leaving?

466
00:31:41,069 --> 00:31:42,910
I told you that I'm not leaving.

467
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:45,380
It's great to see you smile.

468
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,809
Don't you feel bad for Seo Yeon?

469
00:31:46,809 --> 00:31:48,140
Are you with Ha Jin?

470
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,750
Anchor Lee, Ha Jin is...
