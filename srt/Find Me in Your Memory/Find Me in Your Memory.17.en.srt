00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:03,540
(Episode 17)

2
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:18,219
- Hello?
- It's me.

3
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,329
You know me, don't you?

4
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,600
How did you find...

5
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:28,370
Where are you right now?

6
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,039
Where else would I be?

7
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,310
I'm locked up.

8
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:39,039
Do you know how much I had to spend
to make one phone call?

9
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,579
Why are you suddenly calling me?

10
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:44,179
Are you with her right now?

11
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:46,450
Yeo Ha Jin.

12
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,520
What?

13
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,530
Make sure you protect her...

14
00:00:54,729 --> 00:00:56,090
if you don't want to lose her.

15
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:07,569
That idiot...
He's quite the character.

16
00:01:11,409 --> 00:01:12,939
What are you talking about?

17
00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:14,950
What do you mean,
"he's quite the character"?

18
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,620
How much do you know?

19
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,879
You have too many questions.

20
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:22,689
You can come and see me
if you're that curious.

21
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:25,359
You didn't stay long
the last time you came.

22
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:28,129
Stop talking nonsense
and tell me right now.

23
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:29,659
Who is he?

24
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:31,299
Hey, hang up already.

25
00:01:32,629 --> 00:01:34,469
I have to go now.

26
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:36,170
See you soon.

27
00:01:39,469 --> 00:01:40,469
Thank you.

28
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:41,939
Hello?

29
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:43,480
Hello?

30
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,819
(Find Me in Your Memory)

31
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,889
Anchor Lee.

32
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,090
Hey.

33
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:32,419
Why are you out here?
I was going to be there soon.

34
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,629
It's way past a minute.

35
00:02:35,259 --> 00:02:36,960
Who were you on the phone with?

36
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,199
It was for work.

37
00:02:40,669 --> 00:02:42,669
I'm making some honey tea.
Is that all right?

38
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:44,240
Yes.

39
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:47,009
Grab a seat. This time,
it'll really take a minute.

40
00:02:57,449 --> 00:02:58,449
Here.

41
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:01,990
Thank you.

42
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:11,259
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:14,629
I talked big
and said you don't have to worry,

44
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:15,830
but this is all I can do.

45
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:18,069
You don't have to be sorry.

46
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,370
This is what I needed the most
at this moment.

47
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,409
It's perfect.

48
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,939
Warm and sweet.

49
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:29,650
Drink up and lie down again.

50
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,520
You won't be able to fall asleep
if you wake up completely.

51
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,219
Are you leaving?

52
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,689
I'll stay here,

53
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,229
then I'll drop you off at
Ha Kyung's hospital room tomorrow.

54
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,599
I told you that I won't go anywhere.

55
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:15,229
Who was that jerk?

56
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,329
So he knew exactly where we'd be?

57
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,439
What's wrong with you?

58
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:04,139
Reporter Jo?

59
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,709
I'm sorry.

60
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:25,329
Why are you still awake?
Are you having trouble sleeping?

61
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:27,629
Yes.

62
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:33,970
If it's because of me,
I'll close the door.

63
00:05:37,709 --> 00:05:40,649
No, don't.
I think I'll be even more scared.

64
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,079
Could you just...

65
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,889
chat with me for a bit?

66
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,120
I think that'll help me go to bed.

67
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:55,790
Sure.

68
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,569
What should we talk about?

69
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:09,610
It would be nice to chat
about simple things...

70
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,339
such as your interests and hobbies.

71
00:06:14,209 --> 00:06:16,009
But you have neither.

72
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:24,819
Did you always want to become
a news anchor?

73
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:27,829
When I was little,

74
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:32,660
I wanted to become a writer
like my mother.

75
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:38,399
But I had no talent
and had to give up.

76
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:43,139
After I matured,
I wanted to become a reporter.

77
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,810
Your dream came true.

78
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,279
Did you become a reporter...

79
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,879
to make a righteous society?

80
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,720
No, I didn't have
such a grand dream.

81
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,319
I was upset.

82
00:06:58,089 --> 00:07:00,759
People would go back
on their words...

83
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:02,129
and lie.

84
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:06,100
I was upset that they didn't
even feel guilty.

85
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,339
Don't get me wrong. I didn't become
a reporter to vent on them.

86
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,310
I just wanted the public
to know the truth.

87
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:20,379
I bet you can easily see...

88
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:25,050
how selfish and full of lies
people can be.

89
00:07:26,149 --> 00:07:27,649
That must be painful.

90
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,589
What do you like?

91
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,790
Me?

92
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:39,259
I already told you that
I enjoyed taking pictures.

93
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:44,000
I like working out and shopping.

94
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:48,709
I also like listening to music
and watching movies.

95
00:07:49,339 --> 00:07:53,009
I enjoy reading as well,
but I like eating the most.

96
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:56,410
Why are you laughing?

97
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:59,480
I think I asked you
the wrong question.

98
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,920
There might be no end to this.

99
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:06,459
You could be right.
I do like many things.

100
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,930
I like seeing you smile.

101
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:22,370
I know I shouldn't feel this way
in this given situation.

102
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:25,180
But I like this moment.

103
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:29,449
I like that it's just you and me.

104
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:49,000
I thought you were injured,
but you look just fine.

105
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,970
By the way, why did you
open the door so suddenly?

106
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:55,240
I was going to kill you
if you were the stalker.

107
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,480
What brings you here?

108
00:08:58,610 --> 00:08:59,679
I just wanted to visit you.

109
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:01,750
I thought you'd be bored.

110
00:09:02,179 --> 00:09:04,279
I was hospitalized once
when I was young.

111
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:06,950
I was bored to death.
That's why I came.

112
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:09,190
Your presence alone
won't be entertaining.

113
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:11,559
That's exactly why
I've prepared some stuff.

114
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,090
What is all this?

115
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:17,860
Ta-da.

116
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,659
Are we going to play games
while having snacks?

117
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,500
Come on. Just wait there.

118
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,669
Watching movies is the best way
to kill time.

119
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,379
You pretty much have the VVIP seat.

120
00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:35,080
Sit down.

121
00:09:45,659 --> 00:09:48,860
This one looks interesting.
It'll help relieve stress.

122
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,090
What movie is it?

123
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:57,399
I'm not sure. I don't think
this is suitable for a patient.

124
00:09:57,769 --> 00:10:00,909
Let's watch a comedy
so that we can laugh...

125
00:10:00,909 --> 00:10:03,870
No, this looks really fun.
Let me raise the volume.

126
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,240
Don't tell me you can't watch
scary movies.

127
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,909
I love horror movies.

128
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:12,450
I enjoy getting scared.

129
00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:39,679
Gosh, my hair's a mess.

130
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,019
Hey.

131
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,659
Where are you going?
You should play with me.

132
00:10:58,299 --> 00:10:59,799
What is it?

133
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,299
What are you doing down there?

134
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,899
I was picking up the remote control.
Why did you throw it?

135
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:08,639
You startled me.

136
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:10,309
You startled me even more.

137
00:11:10,409 --> 00:11:11,740
Your hair's a mess.

138
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,009
My hair tie got loose.

139
00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:17,850
I think this is the first time
I saw you with your hair down.

140
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,350
You're right. I always had it up.

141
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:23,789
Don't stare at me.
It's uncomfortable.

142
00:11:23,789 --> 00:11:27,090
I mean, you look like a ghost.

143
00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:29,389
But you also look like
you live in the wild.

144
00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:32,700
Anyway, you look better
with your hair up.

145
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,929
You should always tie it.

146
00:11:33,929 --> 00:11:37,799
I want to tie it as well,
but my shoulder hurts too much.

147
00:11:39,769 --> 00:11:41,269
Then give that to me.

148
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:42,470
Why?

149
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,669
I'll tie it for you.

150
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:45,240
Forget it.

151
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,409
Why would you tie my hair?

152
00:11:47,409 --> 00:11:48,850
Forget it.

153
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,149
You look too frightening.
I'm good at this.

154
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,950
I used to tie
my younger sister's hair.

155
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:09,870
Done.

156
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:15,169
You look so much better.

157
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,840
Don't go.

158
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:27,720
How did you...

159
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:31,090
end up here?

160
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,850
Did you sleep well last night?

161
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,590
I didn't even know I fell asleep.

162
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:06,789
You didn't snore, so don't worry.

163
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,889
Did you not have nightmares?

164
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:11,559
No.

165
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:14,970
I think the honey water
did the trick. I slept like a baby.

166
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,700
I'm glad.

167
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:21,509
Are you sure you slept well?

168
00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:23,570
I hope you didn't stay up all night
because of me.

169
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,340
I didn't. I slept well.

170
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:29,779
I'm glad.

171
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:41,029
- Hello?
- Are you up?

172
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,159
Yes.

173
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:44,330
I'm on my way there.
Did you sleep well?

174
00:13:54,669 --> 00:13:55,740
It's freezing.

175
00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:07,720
What? Come on.

176
00:14:08,419 --> 00:14:09,549
Hey.

177
00:14:10,289 --> 00:14:11,320
Hey.

178
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,500
Why is he sleeping here?
He's so weird.

179
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,830
Gosh, it's freezing.

180
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,399
It's so cold.

181
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:31,879
Yes. I slept well. I did.

182
00:14:32,909 --> 00:14:35,179
Yes. Yes.

183
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,879
- Do you need anything?
- What's wrong with you?

184
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:38,350
No, I don't.

185
00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:39,850
- So where are you?
- I'm almost there.

186
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,620
You're almost here?

187
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,190
I missed my sister.

188
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,220
Yes. Me too.

189
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:48,759
Hurry. I missed you too. Gosh.

190
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:55,970
Where are my shoes?

191
00:14:57,769 --> 00:14:58,769
Oh, my gosh.

192
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:05,009
Ha Kyung, I'm here.

193
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:06,779
You're here.

194
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:08,350
Hi.

195
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:09,779
Mr. Jo?

196
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,779
What brings you here at this hour?

197
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,149
I came to see how she is.
I just got here.

198
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:16,450
He just got here.

199
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:19,019
I see.

200
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:23,690
Ms. Yeo Ha Kyung.

201
00:15:23,929 --> 00:15:25,600
The doctor is ready
to tell you the test result.

202
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,799
Okay.

203
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,830
Let me come with you. I'll join her.

204
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:29,830
Okay.

205
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,080
You're not busy today, right?

206
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,710
What? No.

207
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:42,879
Then, can you drive them
to your place later? Do this for me.

208
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:44,850
Me? What about you?

209
00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:46,450
I have an important meeting.

210
00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:48,149
Okay.

211
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:55,090
Are you with her right now?

212
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,100
Yeo Ha Jin.

213
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:02,700
Make sure you protect her...

214
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,870
if you don't want to lose her.

215
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,039
(Warden Kim Byung Yoon)

216
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,610
Hello, this is Lee Jeong Hoon.

217
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:21,289
I know I'm asking a lot,
but I have a favor to ask you.

218
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:25,720
My gosh, we're home.

219
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,429
Thank you for driving us here.

220
00:16:28,429 --> 00:16:30,059
Do you want some tea?

221
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:31,600
What's wrong with them?

222
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,000
They are all shriveled up.

223
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,730
Right. This was your place.

224
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:36,730
Yes.

225
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,740
We're treating
the owner like a guest.

226
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,500
I thought they were fake.

227
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,909
They are real plants.

228
00:16:41,909 --> 00:16:44,139
You have to make sure
they get enough sunlight.

229
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,309
Thank you for helping us out.

230
00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:49,049
- No problem.
- Oh, right.

231
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:51,750
Let's postpone our training
for about a week.

232
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,279
Will that be enough time for you?

233
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,419
I think you should rest up
for a whole month.

234
00:16:55,419 --> 00:16:57,120
A week will be enough.

235
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:00,090
You should still be careful.
You might not have fully recovered.

236
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:01,159
Okay.

237
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:02,429
But what training?

238
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:08,099
I promised to be
a physical trainer for Mr. Jo.

239
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,000
Why all of a sudden?

240
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,000
That sort of happened.

241
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:15,910
What is this?

242
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,710
There's something going on
between you two. What is it?

243
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:21,410
- What is?
- What do you mean?

244
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,349
There's nothing weird about this.

245
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,950
By the way, where did
Anchor Lee go so urgently?

246
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:32,990
My gosh, I don't know.
He doesn't tell me these things.

247
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,960
Is that so?

248
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:49,569
You're here.

249
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:51,180
You should've hurried.

250
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,940
I've been waiting for you
since morning.

251
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,509
Talk now.

252
00:17:56,549 --> 00:17:59,119
- About what?
- Everything you know.

253
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,349
How much do you know?

254
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,119
Who is that jerk?

255
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:07,259
Oh, you mean Yeo Ha Jin's stalker?

256
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:10,160
I don't know.

257
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,029
We just exchanged a few letters.
That's all.

258
00:18:14,299 --> 00:18:15,769
- Letters?
- Yes.

259
00:18:16,069 --> 00:18:18,140
He sent me the letters first,

260
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,269
so I just answered
some questions he asked me.

261
00:18:20,269 --> 00:18:21,710
And I asked him some questions too.

262
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:22,740
Right.

263
00:18:23,009 --> 00:18:24,309
And I got some photos as well.

264
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,480
So...

265
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,450
what did you talk about?

266
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:33,920
Answer me right now.

267
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:39,420
What kind of reaction is this?

268
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:42,289
By the way,
are you serious about her?

269
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:47,099
Do you really like
that woman, Yeo Ha Jin?

270
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:48,329
Do you?

271
00:18:49,369 --> 00:18:52,000
My gosh, you're one crazy guy.

272
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,970
You're completely out of your mind.

273
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:54,970
Mr. Lee.

274
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,269
Wake up.

275
00:18:57,539 --> 00:19:00,740
You're the one who should
be locked up here, not me.

276
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,480
Come inside. Let's switch places.

277
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,549
Just answer my question.

278
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,420
You answer mine.

279
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:11,759
Don't you feel bad for Seo Yeon?

280
00:19:14,589 --> 00:19:15,890
Why can't you answer me?

281
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,730
Don't you feel bad for Seo Yeon?

282
00:19:21,529 --> 00:19:24,130
We could have been happy together
if you didn't get involved.

283
00:19:25,069 --> 00:19:27,200
But you killed Seo Yeon.

284
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,539
And now, what do you think...

285
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:32,910
you're doing with her friend?

286
00:19:38,019 --> 00:19:39,750
If she sees you like this,

287
00:19:41,589 --> 00:19:43,819
I wonder how Seo Yeon must feel.

288
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,859
Poor Seo Yeon.

289
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:54,869
Darn it.

290
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,640
Ha Jin. Ha Kyung.

291
00:20:07,779 --> 00:20:09,349
My gosh, what is this about?

292
00:20:09,349 --> 00:20:11,849
It must have hurt so much.

293
00:20:11,849 --> 00:20:13,519
Are you sure it's okay
to get discharged already?

294
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,720
You should get all the treatment
you can at the hospital.

295
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,819
There's nothing to treat here.

296
00:20:18,819 --> 00:20:20,160
I'm all better now.

297
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:24,730
After hearing the news,

298
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:26,200
my hands were shaking.

299
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,730
I don't even know how I drove here.

300
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:30,769
Ms. Park, let's sit down.

301
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,970
At this rate,
you might faint before we do.

302
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:36,339
Sit down and calm down.

303
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:42,250
Ha Jin. Ha Kyung.

304
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:45,750
Let's officially request the police
to investigate the stalker.

305
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:48,349
It's not the time to worry
about your image right now.

306
00:20:48,349 --> 00:20:50,650
Who knows
what that jerk would try next?

307
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,490
I agree with you.

308
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:54,930
On my way here,
I talked to our lawyer.

309
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:56,829
The lawyer says it's better...

310
00:20:56,829 --> 00:21:00,200
to report the break-in incident
at home and this attack together.

311
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,470
Then, what about the letters
Anchor Lee received?

312
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:05,900
Those letters will be hard to be
considered as criminal conduct.

313
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,269
It might just end up
piquing people's curiosity,

314
00:21:08,269 --> 00:21:10,009
so the lawyer advises
not to share that.

315
00:21:10,009 --> 00:21:11,609
And I agree.

316
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:15,150
And I feel bad
in case this affects Anchor Lee.

317
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,279
Not disclosing the letters
might be better.

318
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:21,819
Yes. Let's report this
as soon as possible...

319
00:21:21,819 --> 00:21:23,190
and catch that stalker first.

320
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,059
Once I catch that stalker,

321
00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:27,920
I'll break his wrists, so he never
does something like this again.

322
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,230
Ms. Park, leave that to me.

323
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,230
Yes.

324
00:21:31,329 --> 00:21:33,630
So Ha Jin, don't worry about this.

325
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:35,769
Just take care of yourself
and trust us.

326
00:21:35,769 --> 00:21:37,069
Okay?

327
00:21:37,069 --> 00:21:38,170
I will.

328
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:47,980
Do you really like
that woman, Yeo Ha Jin?

329
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:51,079
Don't you feel bad for Seo Yeon?

330
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,390
But you killed Seo Yeon.

331
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,750
And now, what do you think...

332
00:21:59,089 --> 00:22:01,059
you're doing with her friend?

333
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:42,329
Yes. Hello?

334
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:45,940
It's me. Is it a bad time to talk?

335
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:48,269
I just wanted to let you know...

336
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,539
that Ms. Park
suggested officially...

337
00:22:50,539 --> 00:22:52,009
requesting the police
to investigate.

338
00:22:52,009 --> 00:22:53,539
To report my stalker.

339
00:22:54,309 --> 00:22:55,480
I see. Yes.

340
00:22:56,549 --> 00:22:59,380
Given the turn of events now,
I think it's better too.

341
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:02,589
The media will probably
publish a lot of articles on this.

342
00:23:03,619 --> 00:23:04,859
Probably, right?

343
00:23:04,859 --> 00:23:06,519
Be extra careful for the time being.

344
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:09,559
Ask the police to protect you.

345
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,599
And have bodyguards accompany you.

346
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:13,500
Okay.

347
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:18,740
I'm sorry that
I'm not much of a help to you.

348
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,269
You are such a big help. I mean it.

349
00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:22,970
Stop saying stuff like that.

350
00:23:23,809 --> 00:23:26,180
I'm not the only one in danger.
You're also in danger.

351
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,980
Be careful, okay?

352
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:34,519
By the way, you don't sound good.

353
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,019
Are you sick?

354
00:23:36,619 --> 00:23:38,019
No. I'm fine.

355
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,190
Rest up. I'll call you again.

356
00:24:13,059 --> 00:24:14,059
(I'm always watching you.)

357
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,230
(You're mine, Ha Jin.)

358
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,329
(I want to make you happy.)

359
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:22,329
We will try our best to investigate
as quickly as we can.

360
00:24:22,329 --> 00:24:24,369
Please catch the stalker.

361
00:24:24,369 --> 00:24:25,700
We'll try.

362
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,839
Given the evidence,

363
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:29,569
it seems he's been
inside the house several times.

364
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:32,009
Are there any suspects
you can think of?

365
00:24:32,009 --> 00:24:35,579
Someone who knows the house well
and Yeo Ha Jin's schedule.

366
00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:37,349
Usually, for cases like this,

367
00:24:37,349 --> 00:24:39,950
there's a high possibility that
an acquaintance is the culprit.

368
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:44,690
There is someone
I've been suspecting.

369
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:46,390
("Yeo Ha Jin to Take a Severe Action
Against Her Stalker")

370
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:49,029
My goodness. I can't believe this.

371
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,259
Yes? Hey, come in.

372
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:57,769
You're here.
Come here and take a seat.

373
00:24:58,029 --> 00:24:59,099
Sit.

374
00:25:01,539 --> 00:25:04,880
How's Ha Jin doing?
She must've been shocked.

375
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,140
Yes.

376
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,609
He better be caught soon.
She'll be way too anxious.

377
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:13,420
Hey, so I gave this a thought.

378
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:17,789
What do you think about
doing a report on this incident?

379
00:25:19,259 --> 00:25:20,490
Around Ha Jin's case?

380
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:22,259
As you know,

381
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:25,130
everyone agrees that
stalking is a crime.

382
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:26,730
But it's tough
to get a stalker arrested,

383
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:29,299
and even if they do get caught,
their sentencing isn't much.

384
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:31,000
So let's take this chance...

385
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,140
to change the idea people have
about stalking and stalkers.

386
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:37,940
I think that could
help out Ha Jin a little too.

387
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,380
I know what you mean
by making that suggestion,

388
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:44,250
and that you're making that offer
because you're concerned about her.

389
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,319
But...

390
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:49,250
if I mention her stalker
on the news,

391
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:51,819
it'll provoke him even more.

392
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,089
What's more important now is
to keep Ha Jin safe...

393
00:25:55,259 --> 00:25:58,730
instead of worrying about
the stalker's punishment.

394
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,829
You have a point too.
I understand what you mean.

395
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:08,039
Anyway, if you need anything,
let me know whenever.

396
00:26:08,369 --> 00:26:09,740
Yes, thank you.

397
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,680
Okay. You can go now.

398
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:25,220
It looks like something is
definitely going on between them.
