1
00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:03,109
(Episode 10)

2
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,060
It looks like he's the guy
who took those pictures.

3
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,070
Right?

4
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:02,530
What should we do?

5
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,200
Did you report it to the police?

6
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,069
Yes, they'll be here soon.

7
00:01:06,069 --> 00:01:07,439
Don't worry.

8
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:10,680
Wasn't it too dangerous
to let Anchor Lee go alone?

9
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,540
Should I go after him?

10
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,280
Will you be all right?

11
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,650
Yes, I'm sure it'll be better
than being alone.

12
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,549
Don't go anywhere,
lock the doors, and stay inside.

13
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:20,920
Okay, I'll do that.

14
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,049
Be careful.

15
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:23,049
Okay.

16
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:41,810
Who are you?

17
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:44,340
- Who do you think you are?
- Wait!

18
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:49,480
Mr. Lee, it's me.
Reporter Park Soo Chang.

19
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:51,849
I'm with Naeil Media.

20
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,590
You've seen me before, right?
I'm close to Il Kwon too.

21
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,859
What? It's you, Reporter Park.

22
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:02,859
Yes.

23
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:04,599
Give me your camera.

24
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,930
Oh, yes. I was about to erase these.

25
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:10,199
It's not that I have
any feelings against you.

26
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:13,199
I had to take Ms. Yeo's pictures,
so I ended up... Darn it.

27
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,439
I can erase those myself.

28
00:02:15,909 --> 00:02:17,979
- I have my personal pictures...
- Calm down.

29
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:24,319
Send me the bill.

30
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,979
I'll reimburse you.

31
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,590
And don't ever
let me catch you again.

32
00:02:28,789 --> 00:02:30,789
If you do,
I don't know what I'll do to you.

33
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,219
Okay. Please excuse me.

34
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,189
I'm sorry about that. Sorry.

35
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,090
See you later.

36
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:41,599
He always followed her around,
and now he's at her house.

37
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,169
What about Ha Jin?

38
00:03:40,689 --> 00:03:42,629
What happened? Did you catch him?

39
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:45,729
Well, it was
Reporter Park Soo Chang.

40
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:46,930
You know him, right?

41
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,169
The one who released
the exclusive on your love scandals.

42
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:52,099
What about Anchor Lee?
Is he all right?

43
00:03:54,469 --> 00:03:55,639
Yes, Anchor Lee.

44
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,240
Yes, Chul just told me.

45
00:03:59,509 --> 00:04:00,849
Where are you?

46
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:04,120
I'm still in front of your house.

47
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:06,819
Hello?

48
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,560
Why haven't you left?

49
00:04:17,129 --> 00:04:18,300
I was about to.

50
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,600
I was worried about you.

51
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:23,230
What were you going to do
by running after him like that?

52
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:26,899
If he really was someone evil,
could you have dealt with him?

53
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:28,970
Am I not that trustworthy?

54
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,439
That's not the case.

55
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,980
It's dangerous, that's why.

56
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,009
Don't do that from now on.

57
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:38,120
I'm more scared of seeing you
get hurt than a stalker.

58
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,149
Go inside.

59
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:43,189
You need to go in for me to go home.

60
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,360
Okay.

61
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,360
And...

62
00:04:49,029 --> 00:04:51,529
forget about
what I told you just now.

63
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:55,500
I made it sound serious,
but it's not that big of a deal.

64
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,269
It's not like I'm awfully ill...

65
00:04:57,269 --> 00:04:59,300
or have trouble
in my day-to-day life.

66
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:03,209
You're right. It's not a big deal.

67
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,680
I can say that as the one
who went through this,

68
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:11,319
but you make it sound so easy
just because it's not your problem.

69
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:14,850
Of course, you should
forget about things of the past.

70
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,920
Memories are...

71
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:22,129
supposed to lose color and fade away
as time goes by.

72
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:27,199
So don't feel tormented
or try hard to remember the past.

73
00:05:28,029 --> 00:05:29,699
What's important is
the here and now.

74
00:05:32,269 --> 00:05:33,500
Thank you...

75
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:36,139
for many things.

76
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:43,750
And don't let what happened
to your friend get to you.

77
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,850
I don't know what happened,

78
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,120
but it's not your fault.

79
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,959
That stalker is the one who's bad.

80
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,459
Then I'll go back in.

81
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:57,160
Go home safely.

82
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,259
And text me when you get home.

83
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:01,269
Okay.

84
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:23,790
I'm home.

85
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,990
You're here.

86
00:06:57,259 --> 00:06:58,259
Yes.

87
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,860
Let me print it out right away.

88
00:07:02,029 --> 00:07:04,430
Soo Chang just called me...

89
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,300
and asked me
to put in a good word for him.

90
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:09,069
I heard you took
his entire memory card.

91
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:12,639
- Are you two close?
- No, not at all.

92
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,639
Why?

93
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:15,610
He's a bit of a delinquent.

94
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:18,610
He says it's exciting and thrilling
to infringe on celebrities' privacy.

95
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:21,310
He hides in women's waiting room,
in restrooms,

96
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:24,620
and he was sued many times
for breaking and entering.

97
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,279
It's just that
everyone dropped the suit.

98
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,290
And he threatened them
with the pictures he took.

99
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,430
Here.

100
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:38,300
It was really tough
for me to get these.

101
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:42,670
Anyway, do you suspect
that those two could be...

102
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,069
the one who sent those pictures?

103
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,610
(Personal Information: Moon Chul)

104
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,410
(3 minutes on foot)

105
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:51,680
Managers often live nearby.

106
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,379
It gets too hard to drive around.

107
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:57,110
Jeong Hoon, aren't you
a little too sensitive?

108
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,519
The pictures came just once...

109
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,149
and nothing happened
ever since that time.

110
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,319
Nothing happened so far.

111
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,120
But what if something breaks out?

112
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:08,660
Then it'll be too late already.

113
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,730
Let me know
if you need me to do anything else.

114
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:17,300
(Moon Chul, Park Soo Chang)

115
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,509
Ms. Park! What's all this?

116
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:28,250
I just brought some side dishes.

117
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,949
We could've come by.

118
00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:31,420
You didn't have to come
all the way here.

119
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,419
I'll take it.

120
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:34,490
Why did you bring so much stuff?

121
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,690
Stop starving yourself
to keep your body in shape.

122
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,720
You need to eat well,
then work it out.

123
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,389
Those are just the appetizers.

124
00:08:41,389 --> 00:08:43,129
My real business is something else.

125
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,600
I came to give you this.

126
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:48,500
A script?

127
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:49,830
("Hello, Everyone" by Hwang So Seon)

128
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,600
Is this Writer Hwang's?

129
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,070
Writer Hwang So Seon?

130
00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:00,879
No way. You're right.

131
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:02,809
I want to do this. I will.
I really want to.

132
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,820
You don't even know
what your role is.

133
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,179
That doesn't matter.
It's Writer Hwang.

134
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:08,850
I want to do this no matter what.

135
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,250
Tell her right now.

136
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,320
What if someone else takes it?

137
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,929
I told them you'd do it
as soon as I received the script.

138
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:19,100
No way. No way! I'm so exhilarated!

139
00:09:19,929 --> 00:09:22,200
It was my wish to work with her.

140
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,200
What's her role?
She's the lead actress, right?

141
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,139
Of course, she is.

142
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,570
I got goosebumps when I read it.

143
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:31,379
Your character is a news anchor.

144
00:09:31,379 --> 00:09:32,409
"News anchor"?

145
00:09:32,409 --> 00:09:34,610
"Hello, Viewers."

146
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,750
Doesn't it seem like fate?

147
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,779
Even Writer Hwang thought so.

148
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,789
She said you were perfect
for this role.

149
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,490
- Really?
- Yes.

150
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,659
It suits you.

151
00:09:45,659 --> 00:09:48,190
She doesn't worry
about the tone of your voice...

152
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,429
since Anchor Lee can teach you.

153
00:09:49,429 --> 00:09:50,629
The writing and directing teams...

154
00:09:50,629 --> 00:09:52,529
would like to receive advice
from him.

155
00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:53,700
Is that okay?

156
00:09:54,669 --> 00:09:55,870
From Anchor Lee?

157
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,769
She'd like to meet him right away.

158
00:09:57,769 --> 00:10:00,809
Can you ask him when he's free?

159
00:10:00,909 --> 00:10:02,769
Does Anchor Lee need to be there?

160
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:06,039
Yes. It'll be Writer Hwang,
the director, Ha Jin, and him.

161
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,049
What if he can't attend?

162
00:10:10,179 --> 00:10:11,950
You know how busy he is.

163
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:14,090
He should still do it.

164
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,690
After all, his girlfriend will be
taking the lead role...

165
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:16,850
for the first time.

166
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,889
The drama is also
from the same broadcasting station,

167
00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:20,360
and Ha Jin's in it.

168
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,330
Wouldn't it be strange
to ask another news anchor...

169
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,000
other than him for help?

170
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,330
Well, I guess.

171
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:31,570
Don't tell me you got in a fight.

172
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,139
Try to get along. This is
an important period of your life.

173
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:37,740
Don't ruin
your hard-earned reputation.

174
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,440
Okay?

175
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:42,279
Hey, do you have ramyeon?

176
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:49,720
Okay.

177
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:01,000
What's wrong? Is the script boring?

178
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,870
It's very...

179
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:11,779
"Very"?

180
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,879
Interesting.

181
00:11:13,009 --> 00:11:14,149
"Interesting"?

182
00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:16,779
It's the most interesting script
I've ever read.

183
00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:18,820
I must do this. If not,
I'll regret it forever.

184
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,580
Okay, let's do it.

185
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,250
But what about Anchor Lee?

186
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,389
Do you think he'll help you
with your tone, give advice,

187
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:26,759
and play a cameo role?

188
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,860
No.

189
00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:30,429
"I don't like to do those things."

190
00:11:30,429 --> 00:11:31,429
I bet he'll say this.

191
00:11:31,429 --> 00:11:33,129
I thought there was romance
between you two.

192
00:11:33,129 --> 00:11:35,029
There is but...

193
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,039
They wouldn't remove me
from the drama...

194
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:39,769
just because he refused
to give advice, right?

195
00:11:39,769 --> 00:11:42,710
That's ridiculous.
Being a cast is serious business.

196
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:45,710
But do try to ask him.

197
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:48,610
It'll be better if the director
and the writer like you.

198
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:49,779
Right.

199
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:51,679
Yes, I bet he'll do it.

200
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,580
He's been nice to me lately.

201
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,720
- Really?
- Yes, he'll say yes.

202
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:57,490
He probably will.

203
00:11:58,889 --> 00:12:01,230
Right? What do you think?

204
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,059
What do you think?

205
00:12:04,929 --> 00:12:06,230
We're here.

206
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:09,600
Oh, my.

207
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:13,399
You've both aged quite a bit.

208
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:18,340
Still, let me hug you.

209
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:21,379
Do we need to do this
every time I come here?

210
00:12:22,049 --> 00:12:24,320
What do you think? It's obvious.

211
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,120
Happy birthday.

212
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,799
Why are you so thin? Are you sick?

213
00:12:40,929 --> 00:12:42,970
Do I look slimmer?

214
00:12:43,299 --> 00:12:46,740
That's great. I'm working out
a lot these days.

215
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,940
Move aside, now.

216
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:51,409
- Let me give you a hug.
- Hello, ma'am.

217
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:55,350
Sorry to keep you waiting.

218
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,620
Let's eat.

219
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,149
- Thank you for the meal.
- Sure.

220
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:04,759
I heard you're seeing someone.

221
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,389
Bring her home.
The sooner, the better.

222
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,230
It's about time you got married.

223
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,600
It's still too early for that.

224
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,870
How long are you going
to live like that?

225
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:18,940
That's enough, honey.
Let's eat first.

226
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,870
They'll have indigestion.

227
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:22,539
Eat up.

228
00:13:22,539 --> 00:13:23,639
- Okay.
- Okay.

229
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:25,179
All right. Eat up.

230
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,440
Enjoy your meal.

231
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,950
("Hello, Everyone" by Hwang So Seon)

232
00:13:44,029 --> 00:13:47,230
Thank you for the meal, ma'am.
Your cooking skills have improved.

233
00:13:47,429 --> 00:13:50,330
You really love
soy sauce marinated crab, don't you?

234
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,440
How could you finish
three bowls of that?

235
00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:55,570
Is your stomach okay?

236
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,009
I need to take this.

237
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,250
Hello?

238
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:10,090
Where are you? Are you okay?

239
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,019
I'm fine.

240
00:14:13,289 --> 00:14:15,629
Do you have any favors
you want to ask of me?

241
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,330
No, I don't. Why?

242
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,639
Think carefully.
I'm willing to do anything.

243
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,309
Do you want to ask me for a favor?

244
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,110
Yes.

245
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:31,809
What is it?

246
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:33,980
I can't tell you just yet.

247
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,080
You must do it for me.

248
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,450
You can't say no.

249
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:40,620
So think carefully.

250
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:43,820
Who knows?
You may need my help in the future.

251
00:14:44,289 --> 00:14:45,590
I'll call you again later.

252
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,419
Okay.

253
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,110
Gosh, that was short.

254
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,240
I wouldn't have minded
had you talked longer.

255
00:15:04,909 --> 00:15:07,080
Tell me.

256
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,710
How did you two meet?

257
00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:10,409
How long has it been?

258
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,679
How is she?

259
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:14,990
I saw her on TV often.
How is she in real life?

260
00:15:16,789 --> 00:15:18,720
Slow down.

261
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:22,090
Don't avoid my question.

262
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,990
Do tell me, will you?

263
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:25,899
It's not true.

264
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:28,470
What do you mean?

265
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,470
The articles are incorrect.

266
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:33,600
It's complicated.

267
00:15:34,669 --> 00:15:37,110
Ha Jin's movie is being shown
in theaters right now,

268
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,110
so we decided to wait
until they took it down.

269
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:41,750
That's all.

270
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:43,809
We're not dating.

271
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,779
I see.

272
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:50,389
I guess this is just
one of those fake dating rumors...

273
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:53,220
that you see on TV often.

274
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,860
You even fooled me.

275
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,669
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

276
00:16:05,669 --> 00:16:06,970
You're here early.

277
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,570
- Good morning.
- Hello.

278
00:16:09,409 --> 00:16:10,409
All right.

279
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:15,549
- Here.
- What is all this?

280
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:18,120
I usually skip breakfast.

281
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,889
You need to have breakfast
if you want to be healthy.

282
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,190
Here.

283
00:16:27,259 --> 00:16:28,490
I have a favor to ask.

284
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,090
I didn't bite it yet.

285
00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:31,500
It's not much.

286
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:33,100
Could you be the narrator...

287
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,799
for the founding
anniversary special documentary?

288
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,899
- Me?
- You and Ha Jin.

289
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:40,269
Why her?

290
00:16:40,269 --> 00:16:42,740
Why do you think? You're a couple.

291
00:16:42,909 --> 00:16:44,509
It's a documentary
about wolves' instincts...

292
00:16:44,509 --> 00:16:46,080
and their majestic love.

293
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,809
It'd be great
if an actual couple narrated.

294
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:50,679
I thought you two wouldn't last
that long,

295
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:52,350
but you're still standing strong.

296
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:55,450
You know we're faking it.
Stop trying to get us together.

297
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:57,289
My gosh.

298
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,289
Can you just do it?

299
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,830
The company invested
hundreds of thousands of dollars.

300
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:06,359
Let's make it interesting
and add some commercials to it.

301
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:09,400
There's no harm in getting
higher ratings.

302
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,769
We should give you a new nickname.

303
00:17:11,769 --> 00:17:13,539
Ratings Fairy.

304
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,309
You...

305
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:20,609
No, we need to do well.

306
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,279
After what you said to Chairman Oh,

307
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:23,980
Hwarang took back
all their commercials.

308
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:26,579
I'm not saying you were wrong.

309
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,089
That's just the current situation.

310
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:31,319
Just sound them out a bit...

311
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:34,160
and humor them a little.
Simple, right?

312
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:37,660
You do know how much respect
I have for you, right?

313
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,970
Yes, and I'm honored.

314
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:43,869
So shut it and have some.

315
00:17:43,869 --> 00:17:45,269
Just do me this favor, will you?

316
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,339
Okay, I'll do it.
I think it'll be fun.

317
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:54,240
You don't need to make a decision
right now. You can say no too.

318
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,650
No, it's okay. Remember what I said?

319
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:59,180
I'm willing to do you any favors.

320
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:02,519
So please do me a favor as well.

321
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:06,490
I won't misunderstand you.
I don't have any ulterior motives.

322
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,890
I just truly want to do this drama.

323
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,460
After becoming an actress,

324
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,059
I auditioned for Writer Hwang
every single time.

325
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:15,930
I never got in.

326
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:19,869
This only happens
once in a blue moon.

327
00:18:20,539 --> 00:18:23,410
Fine, but I won't be a part of it.

328
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:26,180
Okay. I'll tell them so.

329
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,210
They can ask for my advice
through email.

330
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:31,380
And I'll only help you
with reading the news.

331
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,349
That's enough.
I won't take much of your time.

332
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:37,720
All right. Let me know
once the meeting is scheduled.

333
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:40,089
Thank you!

334
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,259
Hold on.

335
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:49,470
That didn't mean anything.

336
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,170
I hugged you because I was happy.

337
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:52,970
Okay.

338
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,440
Hello. Good day.

339
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:19,359
- Where is it?
- Here.

340
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:21,299
Right here.

341
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:23,670
It's the same envelope.

342
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:26,170
The envelope is the same color
without the sender's address.

343
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,849
(Don't get the wrong idea.
Ha Jin loves me.)

344
00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:52,130
Seo Yeon.

345
00:19:52,529 --> 00:19:54,299
It's snowing a lot now.

346
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:56,470
Aren't you glad that you listened
to me and took an umbrella?

347
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:57,829
Right.

348
00:19:59,069 --> 00:20:01,309
It's snowing a lot today.

349
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,470
Hello?

350
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,170
Don't you know me?

351
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,410
We met several times with Seo Yeon.

352
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,210
Who is this?

353
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:12,650
Who is this? Why are you
answering Seo Yeon's phone?

354
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,359
Don't get the wrong idea.

355
00:20:23,259 --> 00:20:25,599
Seo Yeon loves me.

356
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,930
Not you, Jeong Hoon.

357
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,500
Seo Yeon.

358
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:40,779
I don't think
Jeong Hoon believes me.

359
00:20:41,849 --> 00:20:43,380
- Hello?
- Right.

360
00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:46,180
Seo Yeon, you should talk to him.

361
00:20:48,049 --> 00:20:49,049
Hey.

362
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:50,349
Hold on.

363
00:20:50,619 --> 00:20:51,759
Hello?

364
00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:53,619
Don't hang up the phone.

365
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:54,690
Seo Yeon.

366
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:56,230
Seo Yeon.

367
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:58,259
- Jeong...
- Tell him.

368
00:20:58,529 --> 00:21:01,470
Tell him that you love me, not him.
Isn't that right?

369
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:03,730
- Tell him.
- Seo Yeon, are you all right?

370
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:06,240
Please...

371
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,910
spare me.

372
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,269
Hello? Seo Yeon.

373
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:15,180
What are you talking about,
Seo Yeon? Why would I kill you?

374
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,549
Don't you know
that I love you so much?

375
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:21,319
We can be happy together now.

376
00:21:21,789 --> 00:21:24,519
You love me, don't you?

377
00:21:24,859 --> 00:21:26,460
Right?

378
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,059
Jeong Hoon!

379
00:21:28,589 --> 00:21:30,890
Seo Yeon. Are you okay?

380
00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:33,329
- It's all right.
- Seo Yeon, where are you?

381
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:36,200
Answer me, Seo Yeon.

382
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:37,329
Hey.

383
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,940
I brought a gift for you.

384
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,200
- Seo Yeon.
- Okay?

385
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,869
- Are you okay, Seo Yeon? Seo Yeon!
- I made this while studying.

386
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,480
Seo Yeon!

387
00:21:52,819 --> 00:21:54,789
- No!
- Seo Yeon.

388
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,150
Are you okay, Seo Yeon? Seo Yeon!

389
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:00,089
Jeong Hoon, save me.

390
00:22:00,089 --> 00:22:02,259
- Save me, Jeong Hoon!
- Where are you?

391
00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:03,259
Jeong Hoon!

392
00:22:03,259 --> 00:22:04,259
- Seo Yeon.
- Seo Yeon!

393
00:22:04,259 --> 00:22:06,359
Please get yourself together,
Seo Yeon!

394
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:07,630
- Don't do that!
- You scumbag.

395
00:22:08,329 --> 00:22:09,970
If you lay a finger on her,

396
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:11,700
I'm going to kill you! Got that?

397
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,569
- Jeong Hoon.
- This is all your fault.

398
00:22:15,569 --> 00:22:17,839
Seo Yeon changed all because of you.

399
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:21,210
It's all your fault,

400
00:22:21,579 --> 00:22:23,650
Lee Jeong Hoon!

401
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:25,779
(Seo Yeon)

402
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,670
Where is she?

403
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,069
There you go. That's it.

404
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:52,880
It's all right. You'll be okay.

405
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,180
You're okay.

406
00:22:56,279 --> 00:22:58,650
One more step.
Let's take one more step.

407
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,250
Don't move. Stay still.

408
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,559
Please stay still, Seo Yeon!

409
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:08,460
That's it. Good girl.

410
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,529
Good.

411
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:20,700
Seo Yeon, this will be over soon.

412
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,069
Don't worry.

413
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,440
Seo Yeon.

414
00:23:27,309 --> 00:23:29,650
There he is. He's here.

415
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:31,750
He's here. He came.

416
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,890
(Seo Yeon)

417
00:23:42,259 --> 00:23:43,660
Wait for me there.

418
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:40,809
Seo Yeon.

419
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:45,750
Seo Yeon.

420
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,880
Seo Yeon.

421
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,490
Seo Yeon. Are you okay?

422
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,160
Stay with me, Seo Yeon!

423
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:53,259
Seo Yeon.

424
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:57,190
Seo Yeon, stay with me.

425
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:01,059
Stay with me.

426
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:04,700
Hold on.

427
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,000
I'm going to call the ambulance now.

428
00:26:08,539 --> 00:26:09,839
Seo Yeon, stay with me.

429
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:12,309
Seo Yeon.

430
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,279
No. Don't. No, stay with me.

431
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,250
Seo Yeon, stay with me.
Please stay with me!

432
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:20,980
I'm sorry.

433
00:26:21,819 --> 00:26:22,819
Seo Yeon.

434
00:26:26,619 --> 00:26:27,619
Seo Yeon.

435
00:26:28,259 --> 00:26:30,430
No. Please don't. No, Seo Yeon.

436
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:32,000
Seo Yeon.

437
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:34,759
Seo Yeon, open your eyes.
Seo Yeon! Open your eyes.

438
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,029
Open your eyes, Seo Yeon!

439
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:43,339
Lee Jeong Hoon!

440
00:27:34,259 --> 00:27:36,029
You came sooner than I expected.

441
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:39,859
You jerk.

442
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:41,329
You jerk.

443
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:43,329
Why did it have to be Seo Yeon?

444
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:45,539
Why did it have to be Seo Yeon? Why?

445
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:48,269
Why? Why?

446
00:27:48,269 --> 00:27:50,369
Why her?

447
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:52,109
Why?

448
00:27:52,109 --> 00:27:54,009
Why did it have to be Seo Yeon?

449
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:23,440
Why would you ask me that?

450
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:26,079
What do you mean
why it had to be Seo Yeon?

451
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,910
It was you...

452
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,049
who broke us up, Lee Jeong Hoon.

453
00:28:31,849 --> 00:28:33,250
- What?
- You.

454
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:35,549
It's all right, though.

455
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:38,519
No one can come between us now.

456
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:40,390
We will be...

457
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,230
together eternally.

458
00:28:55,539 --> 00:28:56,940
Put that down!

459
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,779
Let go! Let me go!

460
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:04,710
Lee Jeong Hoon!

461
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:09,089
Let go! Let me go!

462
00:29:12,289 --> 00:29:14,660
Lee Jeong Hoon! Lee Jeong...

463
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,369
Where are you going?

464
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,599
(Quarantine Treatment Room 1:
Moon Seong Ho)

465
00:31:11,309 --> 00:31:13,480
(Find Me in Your Memory)

466
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:15,910
- I caused a bit of an accident.
- Like what?

467
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:17,579
Ha Jin found out.

468
00:31:17,579 --> 00:31:19,720
If it's okay with you,
may I checked the footage?

469
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,750
The security footage?

470
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:23,289
Does he always run late?
Your manager, I mean.

471
00:31:23,289 --> 00:31:24,819
I always told you...

472
00:31:24,819 --> 00:31:26,589
that you'll also play the lead role
of my next movie, Ha Jin.

473
00:31:26,589 --> 00:31:28,089
I can't do this movie.

474
00:31:28,089 --> 00:31:29,289
I'm sorry, Director Ji.

475
00:31:29,289 --> 00:31:31,490
No, I'm telling you to read it now.

476
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:33,000
To be honest, I'm nervous...

477
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,269
that things will
get out of our hands.

478
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:36,500
Don't do anything you'll regret.

479
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,630
We can't do this.

480
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:39,640
- Why not?
- Because we'll regret it.

481
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:41,269
Don't blame me for this.

482
00:31:41,269 --> 00:31:43,910
It's all because of you.
