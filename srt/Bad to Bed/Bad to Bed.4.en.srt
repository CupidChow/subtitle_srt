1
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,533
Okay, let’s imagine this.

2
00:00:15,533 --> 00:00:17,967
What would you do if you are

3
00:00:17,967 --> 00:00:22,067
a six years old kid facing a unexpected rain.

4
00:00:28,767 --> 00:00:34,433
I would put my yellow raincoat and boots on.

5
00:00:35,967 --> 00:00:38,100
Holding my umbrella.

6
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,933
Doing some puddle jumps.

7
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:57,200
Well. I said “unexpected” rain.

8
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:03,167
But you’ve got your gears on.

9
00:01:03,167 --> 00:01:04,767
And even prepared an umbrella.

10
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,367
That’s because…

11
00:01:13,267 --> 00:01:16,533
He has prepared for the accident.

12
00:01:16,533 --> 00:01:20,767
He wants to take care of himself.

13
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,100
Why would he think this way?

14
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,500
He is only a child.

15
00:01:31,167 --> 00:01:32,800
Where’s your mother?

16
00:01:42,367 --> 00:01:43,933
She…

17
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,100
You didn’t answer my message the whole weekend.

18
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,333
You didn’t pick up the phone calls.

19
00:03:05,067 --> 00:03:06,400
I’m sorry.

20
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,267
What happened to you?

21
00:03:11,533 --> 00:03:12,833
Nothing.

22
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,633
If it’s really nothing,

23
00:03:15,633 --> 00:03:18,433
should I know why you didn’t come?

24
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:21,567
I’m sorry.

25
00:03:24,633 --> 00:03:26,867
I waited for you for a long time that day.

26
00:03:31,967 --> 00:03:33,467
I’m sorry.

27
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,967
Stop saying that.

28
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:40,533
That’s not what I need to hear now.

29
00:03:40,533 --> 00:03:42,767
I just want to know what happened.

30
00:03:46,767 --> 00:03:48,267
I’m worried about you.

31
00:03:48,267 --> 00:03:50,800
We should start meeting each other.

32
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,733
No appointment, no waiting.

33
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,100
And no disappointment.

34
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,000
Why’d you say that?

35
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,133
Because you want an answer.

36
00:04:06,133 --> 00:04:07,700
I’m giving you one right now.

37
00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:13,667
Raccoon Chao.

38
00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:15,933
All of a sudden, I just don’t want to answer the phones.

39
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,400
All of a sudden, I wanted to cry.

40
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,633
I don’t even have the strength to get up.

41
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:27,400
I am this kind of asshole.

42
00:04:28,133 --> 00:04:30,100
I don’t deserve you to treat me well.

43
00:04:32,567 --> 00:04:34,567
Please don’t ghost me.

44
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,367
Please don’t push me. - Please don’t ghost me.

45
00:04:37,367 --> 00:04:38,300
Please don’t push me like this.

46
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,333
I’m scared.

47
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,900
Just go away. - Give me a break.

48
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,400
OK? -What did I do?

49
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,200
Please don’t push me.

50
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,200
Just tell me what happened.

51
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,433
Please don’t push me.

52
00:04:50,433 --> 00:04:52,833
What are you doing right now? - Please don’t push me.

53
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:53,667
What are you doing？

54
00:04:53,667 --> 00:04:55,167
Just don’t push me.

55
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:57,367
Stop doing this to me.

56
00:04:57,367 --> 00:04:59,100
Stop doing this to me.

57
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,367
Here.

58
00:05:38,367 --> 00:05:39,467
Thanks.

59
00:05:49,733 --> 00:05:51,600
Look.

60
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,500
Isn’t it ugly?

61
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,833
So stupid, right?

62
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,167
Why do you…

63
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,867
wrap yourself like this?

64
00:06:02,967 --> 00:06:06,933
I feel so wrong when the episode comes.

65
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:09,367
I feel so wrong when the episode comes.

66
00:06:09,367 --> 00:06:10,900
I feel so wrong when the episode comes.

67
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:14,167
Then I won’t get hurt when I slam myself

68
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:16,033
onto the wall.

69
00:06:17,567 --> 00:06:19,167
Smart guy, right.

70
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:25,433
You’re very smart.

71
00:06:25,433 --> 00:06:27,067
You’re taking care of yourself very well.

72
00:06:28,033 --> 00:06:32,167
At first, I thought I just having insomnia.

73
00:06:32,167 --> 00:06:34,067
I didn’t know why I became like this.

74
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,567
It’s okay.

75
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,200
You are in a struggle.

76
00:06:41,133 --> 00:06:43,033
I do take my medicine.

77
00:06:43,733 --> 00:06:48,667
You know I can take care of myself.

78
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:50,100
No worries.

79
00:06:51,933 --> 00:06:53,267
Look.

80
00:06:54,433 --> 00:06:56,833
Fine, go take a rest.

81
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,800
You don’t have to go back?

82
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,567
I can…

83
00:07:03,567 --> 00:07:05,633
I can stay.

84
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,033
Can I?

85
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,000
But I want to be alone.

86
00:07:17,233 --> 00:07:19,033
I can stay in the living room.

87
00:07:19,033 --> 00:07:20,133
Is that okay?

88
00:07:22,667 --> 00:07:24,733
You still don’t believe me?

89
00:07:29,167 --> 00:07:31,233
Just today.

90
00:07:31,233 --> 00:07:32,467
Okay?

91
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:37,267
I haven’t seen you for days.

92
00:07:37,267 --> 00:07:39,167
I wanna be with you.

93
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,867
If you are tired you can go to the guest room.

94
00:07:44,867 --> 00:07:46,267
Alright?

95
00:09:31,433 --> 00:09:32,667
Sleeping now?

96
00:09:33,733 --> 00:09:35,000
It’s still early.

97
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,267
It’s just one o’clock.

98
00:09:37,633 --> 00:09:39,167
Why are you here?

99
00:09:39,167 --> 00:09:41,233
I have your keys.

100
00:09:41,233 --> 00:09:42,800
What? Don’t want me to come?

101
00:09:44,867 --> 00:09:46,700
Stop it.

102
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,900
Kangaroo is in the living room.

103
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,367
Don’t make him confused.

104
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,433
You so bad.

105
00:09:52,433 --> 00:09:53,933
Taking a date home.

106
00:09:53,933 --> 00:09:56,933
Meanwhile, you are messing with me.

107
00:09:57,967 --> 00:10:00,867
Shut up. I’m not messing with you.

108
00:10:01,733 --> 00:10:03,767
I don’t want him to misunderstand.

109
00:10:03,767 --> 00:10:05,400
Misunderstand what?

110
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,367
About my importance?

111
00:10:08,367 --> 00:10:10,267
Or about me having your keys?

112
00:10:11,367 --> 00:10:13,100
Give it back.

113
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,533
Who told me that

114
00:10:14,533 --> 00:10:16,000
he’s afraid of dying at home alone

115
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,333
so that he gave me the keys.

116
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,467
You got a new sweetheart now.

117
00:10:18,467 --> 00:10:20,033
So you want to get rid of me?

118
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,967
Are you insane? It hurts.

119
00:10:30,967 --> 00:10:32,767
Smash the wall doesn’t hurt?

120
00:10:32,767 --> 00:10:34,267
Moran.

121
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,333
Turn over.

122
00:10:36,933 --> 00:10:37,667
Come on.

123
00:10:37,667 --> 00:10:38,733
Count on three. - No.

124
00:10:38,733 --> 00:10:39,233
Count on three.

125
00:10:39,233 --> 00:10:40,967
123 456

126
00:10:40,967 --> 00:10:42,300
Come over and let me bind you up.

127
00:10:57,567 --> 00:10:59,367
Go out with me.

128
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,667
No.

129
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:02,933
If you don’t do that,

130
00:11:02,933 --> 00:11:06,133
I’ll tell him I have your keys.

131
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,767
You are such a dick.

132
00:11:09,767 --> 00:11:12,100
A very huge one.

133
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,033
To where?

134
00:11:16,033 --> 00:11:18,133
Just follow me.

135
00:11:18,867 --> 00:11:22,133
But Kangaroo is in the living room.

136
00:11:22,133 --> 00:11:23,733
How do we make it?

137
00:11:52,733 --> 00:11:54,067
Raccoon Chao.

138
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,367
How much does he know?

139
00:12:21,633 --> 00:12:23,567
It’s none of your business.

140
00:12:23,567 --> 00:12:26,500
You won’t keep a relationship well if it’s full of lies.

141
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,767
How about your boyfriend not knowing

142
00:12:30,767 --> 00:12:32,333
You’re here today.

143
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,733
Did he blow you off?

144
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:43,667
Where did he go?

145
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:46,667
He didn’t blow me off.

146
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:48,667
He said he wanted to prepare his essay.

147
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:50,233
He wasn’t in the mood of going out.

148
00:12:51,033 --> 00:12:53,900
You could just go to his house.

149
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,800
He didn’t want me there

150
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,200
because he would be thinking

151
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,267
if I would be boring.

152
00:12:59,267 --> 00:12:59,967
It may turn out to be

153
00:12:59,967 --> 00:13:02,800
nothing is finished and no one’s happy.

154
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,267
So, here I am.

155
00:13:05,467 --> 00:13:07,667
What the fuck?

156
00:13:10,567 --> 00:13:12,300
Where should we go to play?

157
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,633
Let’s do things he would never do with me.

158
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,633
Another.

159
00:13:46,633 --> 00:13:48,300
I want this.

160
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,300
This.

161
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:55,967
Again.

162
00:14:15,933 --> 00:14:17,233
What happened?

163
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,033
Wait…

164
00:15:24,033 --> 00:15:25,733
Not ready, wait.

165
00:15:25,733 --> 00:15:27,267
Wait!

166
00:15:27,267 --> 00:15:30,367
I’m not sure about happiness.

167
00:15:30,367 --> 00:15:32,067
Does it taste sweet and sour?

168
00:15:32,067 --> 00:15:34,333
I’ve got you in my phone.

169
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,833
You’ve got me in your phone.

170
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,267
I feel joy and happy.

171
00:15:37,267 --> 00:15:39,300
Slide back the notification.

172
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,267
Who’s that?

173
00:15:40,267 --> 00:15:41,767
Why does he care about your whereabouts?

174
00:15:41,767 --> 00:15:43,067
I’m gonna tell you about my episodes.

175
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,300
I’m the honest one.

176
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,667
Where have you been last night?

177
00:15:45,667 --> 00:15:46,600
I have no idea.

178
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,567
Are you hearing yourself?

179
00:15:47,567 --> 00:15:49,067
I don’t know.

180
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,533
Don’t push me.

181
00:16:04,133 --> 00:16:06,267
I want more drinks.

182
00:16:06,267 --> 00:16:07,967
More drinks.

183
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,967
There are only karaoke bars are open.

184
00:16:10,967 --> 00:16:12,600
Do you want to sing?

185
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,267
Nah. I don’t feel like to sing.

186
00:16:16,033 --> 00:16:21,600
How about some movies at my place?

187
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,100
Sure. What will we see?

188
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:29,667
A drama adapt from a movie named One Day.

189
00:16:29,667 --> 00:16:31,167
Have you seen that?

190
00:16:32,167 --> 00:16:34,933
It’s on my top three list.

191
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,633
The Mandarin title is…

192
00:16:37,633 --> 00:16:42,000
Jen Ai…(Love to)

193
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,200
Jen Ai…(Love to)

194
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,900
Eat bananas.

195
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,567
Or you try the right answer. - No.

196
00:16:50,567 --> 00:16:51,600
You go.

197
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,833
Jen Ai…

198
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:54,033
Jen Ai…

199
00:16:54,033 --> 00:16:55,600
Eat dicks?

200
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,433
What’s wrong with you?

201
00:16:59,433 --> 00:17:01,200
Jen Ai Mei Yi Tian.

202
00:17:02,667 --> 00:17:03,333
What?

203
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:04,800
Nope.

204
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,967
That one is a sci-fi drama

205
00:17:06,967 --> 00:17:08,667
about jumping between times.

206
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,500
It’s Jen Ai…

207
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:18,500
Jen Ai…

208
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,700
Tiau zhi Tsu.

209
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,333
Shit. You made it.

210
00:17:26,367 --> 00:17:28,200
What’s the reason do you like it?

211
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,867
I adore Anne Hathaway’s beauty.

212
00:17:31,867 --> 00:17:34,700
And the guy is

213
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:38,300
so blue to be a prince charming

214
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,200
to me.

215
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:45,633
Can I say you are shallow?

216
00:17:45,633 --> 00:17:49,033
Fine. I’ll tell you another reason.

217
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:58,833
It’s hard to love someone for a long time.

218
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,300
True.

219
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,567
Fall in love in the first sight,

220
00:18:02,567 --> 00:18:05,667
and love him as a friend.

221
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,133
It’s really hard.
