1
00:00:57,433 --> 00:00:59,433
Where did you go? It's still early.

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,500
I went to buy some breakfast.

3
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,100
I thought you were asleep.

4
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,367
I didn't want to wake you up.

5
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:06,433
Random style.

6
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:07,667
You gotta eat it all.

7
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:37,400
I'll get you a toothbrush.

8
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,600
Lie down with me.

9
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,167
I don't wanna get up.

10
00:01:42,167 --> 00:01:43,767
I'm so hungry.

11
00:01:43,767 --> 00:01:46,200
Come on. Go clean yourself.

12
00:01:53,633 --> 00:01:56,167
Is this for me?

13
00:01:57,167 --> 00:02:00,667
Are we in the relationship right now?

14
00:02:03,933 --> 00:02:05,967
How come you have so many toothbrushes?

15
00:02:06,633 --> 00:02:09,032
Seems like you offer sleepovers

16
00:02:09,032 --> 00:02:10,532
to quite a lot of people.

17
00:02:11,767 --> 00:02:13,100
Look!

18
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,000
I just like to stash things.

19
00:02:19,167 --> 00:02:21,233
You're lying.

20
00:02:21,233 --> 00:02:22,467
What?

21
00:02:22,467 --> 00:02:23,967
I'm not lying?

22
00:02:24,667 --> 00:02:26,600
You're not a raccoon.

23
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,667
you are a squirrel.

24
00:02:28,667 --> 00:02:31,700
Squirrels like to stash things.

25
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,867
They hide tons of food

26
00:02:33,867 --> 00:02:35,867
they can't even consume.

27
00:02:35,867 --> 00:02:38,700
Hoarding disorder is called

28
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,067
squirrel syndrome on the Internet.

29
00:02:43,033 --> 00:02:43,900
Well.

30
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,233
You just got a brand new knowledge.

31
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:52,367
Fine. Your raccoon package is arrived.

32
00:02:52,367 --> 00:02:53,833
Go brush your teeth.

33
00:02:58,167 --> 00:02:59,300
Cute.

34
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,333
Oh.

35
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,333
I have only one shooting work

36
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:06,567
to do today.

37
00:03:07,967 --> 00:03:09,467
I can keep you company.

38
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,767
So sweet.

39
00:03:13,567 --> 00:03:16,100
Do you want me to be the photographer?

40
00:03:17,133 --> 00:03:18,900
No joke.

41
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:21,167
It's for work.

42
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,433
I take pictures for the merchandise

43
00:03:23,433 --> 00:03:25,767
in my mineral stone shop.

44
00:03:25,767 --> 00:03:27,367
Easy-peasy.

45
00:03:28,633 --> 00:03:31,733
Am I look like a mineral stone?

46
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,567
In the end of the day, I'm still an influencer!

47
00:03:37,067 --> 00:03:39,833
Don't be so proud.

48
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:42,933
That sounds embarrassing.

49
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,833
I'm just telling the truth.

50
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,267
Fine, you're cute.

51
00:03:49,267 --> 00:03:50,567
Thanks.

52
00:03:51,267 --> 00:03:52,167
Right, turn this side.

53
00:03:52,167 --> 00:03:52,767
Here.

54
00:03:52,767 --> 00:03:56,233
Left first and then?this is right.

55
00:03:56,233 --> 00:03:58,800
I'm confused, I can't do it.

56
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,467
I'm almost a blind person.

57
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,667
They are all look like the same.

58
00:04:04,633 --> 00:04:06,800
You haven't tried the harder one.

59
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,867
Someone gave me a puzzle without any pattern on it.

60
00:04:10,633 --> 00:04:11,833
That's epic.

61
00:04:13,933 --> 00:04:15,233
So it's a standing pose?

62
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:20,632
Standing?

63
00:04:20,632 --> 00:04:22,167
The weather is so great outside.

64
00:04:22,167 --> 00:04:23,567
Do you wanna go out?

65
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,867
Sure, where to go?

66
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,333
Let's finish this first.

67
00:04:33,467 --> 00:04:34,667
Or we just keep it this way?

68
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,400
Get up.

69
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,400
No, it's awkward.

70
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,367
As a tall person, you should not be afraid of heights.

71
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,800
Come on.

72
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,200
I will be embarrassed.

73
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,133
This is your last chance.

74
00:04:47,133 --> 00:04:48,833
Come on.

75
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:49,967
Fine.

76
00:04:49,967 --> 00:04:51,267
Wait, I'm not ready.

77
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,700
Stop.

78
00:04:57,667 --> 00:04:59,067
Raccoon Chao!

79
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,000
Well, tell me how it tastes.

80
00:05:13,667 --> 00:05:14,700
I can't do this.

81
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,367
Just give it a try.

82
00:05:18,533 --> 00:05:20,767
I think the cake is

83
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:23,167
sweet and sour.

84
00:05:23,167 --> 00:05:26,067
Something like falling in love.

85
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:26,933
Lame.

86
00:05:26,933 --> 00:05:29,400
Your expression is out of fashion.

87
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,233
Fine, it's your turn.

88
00:05:30,233 --> 00:05:33,733
As an influencer, let me show you how to do it.

89
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:34,767
I'm all ears.

90
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,333
Hey, I have a special thing to show you today.

91
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:42,000
It's a desert for dating couples.

92
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,333
Let me try it first.

93
00:05:47,567 --> 00:05:52,633
It's sweet and sour.

94
00:05:52,633 --> 00:05:55,600
Just like I'm falling in love.

95
00:05:56,233 --> 00:05:58,467
Jesus. You copycat!

96
00:05:58,467 --> 00:06:00,267
My version is pretty nice.

97
00:06:00,267 --> 00:06:00,833
Bullshit!

98
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,800
The introduction is flawless.

99
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,667
Your sentences were just like mine.

100
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:06,033
Mine was a full presentation.

101
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,667
Sweet-and-sour?

102
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,300
OK.

103
00:06:14,567 --> 00:06:16,100
    1. 2 3

104
00:06:19,733 --> 00:06:20,433
What?

105
00:06:20,433 --> 00:06:21,633
What?

106
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,733
Let me check.

107
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,700
    - I like that. - No, delete it.

108
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,133
It's not gonna happen.

109
00:06:30,133 --> 00:06:31,133
You can't delete it.

110
00:06:31,133 --> 00:06:32,867
Keep it in your album.

111
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,733
Just keep it.

112
00:06:37,167 --> 00:06:38,333
One more.

113
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,633
Jump into my arms.

114
00:06:52,633 --> 00:06:53,967
Give me a hug so you can eat it.

115
00:06:53,967 --> 00:06:54,933
    - Come on. - He is hesitating.

116
00:06:54,933 --> 00:06:57,267
Give me a hug so you can eat it.

117
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,433
Your new post was set as a public one.

118
00:07:20,433 --> 00:07:21,633
Just delete it.

119
00:07:21,633 --> 00:07:23,533
I did it on purpose.

120
00:07:24,733 --> 00:07:26,133
Are you sure?

121
00:07:26,633 --> 00:07:29,933
Keep flipping the post.

122
00:07:29,933 --> 00:07:31,433
There are more pictures in it.

123
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,867
Is it me?

124
00:07:34,867 --> 00:07:35,733
Yeah.

125
00:07:35,733 --> 00:07:37,500
Your first day staying at my place.

126
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,800
I took the photo on the next morning.

127
00:07:39,733 --> 00:07:42,633
Why did you do that?

128
00:07:42,633 --> 00:07:45,200
I just want to keep you in my album.

129
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,267
You're going to blame me, right?

130
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,533
See.

131
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:56,367
What should I do?

132
00:07:56,367 --> 00:07:58,267
That's okay.

133
00:07:58,267 --> 00:07:59,767
People murmuring.

134
00:08:00,433 --> 00:08:02,100
You sure?

135
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,367
Yeah?

136
00:08:03,367 --> 00:08:04,533
I'll explain it.

137
00:08:06,567 --> 00:08:08,167
Read it to me.

138
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:11,500
That guy is a total bitch.

139
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,433
Raccoon is the best.

140
00:08:13,433 --> 00:08:16,167
How dare him?

141
00:08:16,167 --> 00:08:17,667
It's not like that.

142
00:08:17,667 --> 00:08:20,567
I should be the best.

143
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:22,600
How dare you can get me?

144
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,567
I don't need anyone to know that.

145
00:08:25,567 --> 00:08:28,700
You should be happy that I'm popular.

146
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:31,167
You are?

147
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:32,500
Are you?

148
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,733
I want to delete the message.

149
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:36,167
How can I do it?

150
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:37,732
Just delete the message.

151
00:08:37,732 --> 00:08:39,266
No, I don't want to.

152
00:08:39,267 --> 00:08:40,366
Who is the popular one?

153
00:08:40,366 --> 00:08:41,966
I am, I am the popular one.

154
00:08:41,967 --> 00:08:43,033
I want to delete it.

155
00:08:43,033 --> 00:08:44,167
Do it.

156
00:08:44,167 --> 00:08:44,900
Nope.

157
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,967
I want to teach him a lesson.

158
00:08:45,967 --> 00:08:47,800
Just delete it.

159
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,867
Delete it.

160
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,567
I'm hurt.

161
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:22,467
Stop.

162
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:28,400
Kangaroo.

163
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,967
Define happiness to me.

164
00:09:32,433 --> 00:09:33,733
Is it a test?

165
00:09:35,967 --> 00:09:39,000
Did I give you happiness today?

166
00:09:43,767 --> 00:09:46,833
I'm not sure about the taste of happiness.

167
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,700
Maybe it's sweet maybe it's sour.

168
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:54,300
But you got me in your phone.

169
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,033
And I got you in my phone.

170
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,400
I think we got happiness.

171
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:06,067
Wow, you are a poet now.

172
00:10:06,067 --> 00:10:07,467
You can easily compose poetry.

173
00:10:07,467 --> 00:10:09,233
You don't even think twice.

174
00:10:10,367 --> 00:10:11,667
Stop it.

175
00:10:13,067 --> 00:10:14,300
Cheers.

176
00:10:18,933 --> 00:10:20,167
Too slow.

177
00:10:20,733 --> 00:10:21,733
Let's play a game.

178
00:10:21,733 --> 00:10:22,400
Sure.

179
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,900
    1. 2 3

180
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:33,500
Are you cheating?

181
00:10:46,133 --> 00:10:47,533
    1. 2 3

182
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,933
10 seconds is too long.

183
00:10:50,933 --> 00:10:52,367
Your face is super stiff.

184
00:10:52,367 --> 00:10:53,933
Stop moving. Almost there.

185
00:10:53,933 --> 00:10:54,967
Be careful.

186
00:11:00,867 --> 00:11:02,167
Slide it back.

187
00:11:04,367 --> 00:11:06,100
What are you talking about ?

188
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,367
Slide back the notification.

189
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,433
That's nothing.

190
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,833
You can open the message or I just leave right now.

191
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:30,067
Makoto: Will you come home tonight?

192
00:11:30,067 --> 00:11:31,300
Who is he?

193
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,000
Why does he care about your whereabouts?

194
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:42,267
We are just roommates.

195
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,367
We broke up for a while.

196
00:11:51,367 --> 00:11:52,500
We live together because of the lease.

197
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,167
There's nothing else.

198
00:11:56,467 --> 00:11:59,833
I think you are a cheater and you got caught.

199
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,900
You just gave me a cliché shit plot.

200
00:12:06,567 --> 00:12:08,400
You gotta believe me.

201
00:12:09,033 --> 00:12:10,833
I did.

202
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,533
But I don't now.

203
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,367
You don't believe me as well.

204
00:12:21,167 --> 00:12:23,200
You never tell me what happened.

205
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,467
You disappeared.

206
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,567
I had told you my condition.

207
00:12:29,433 --> 00:12:31,100
I am the honest one.

208
00:12:32,933 --> 00:12:34,633
Are you sure?

209
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,700
Where have you been last night?

210
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,900
Tell me.

211
00:12:44,867 --> 00:12:46,267
I don't remember.

212
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,767
You don't remember where'd you go?

213
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,133
I just don't remember.

214
00:12:50,133 --> 00:12:51,200
Are you hearing yourself?

215
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,833
I really don't know.

216
00:12:56,633 --> 00:12:58,167
Don't push me.

217
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:32,567
I'm terrible right?

218
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,633
No one would love me, right?

219
00:13:37,767 --> 00:13:40,567
Stop judging yourself because of the people who didn't cherish you.

220
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,867
I will be with you forever.

221
00:13:45,267 --> 00:13:48,400
As long as you need me, I will be there.

222
00:13:48,933 --> 00:13:50,400
But?

223
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,533
You are also a person I want to avoid.

224
00:13:53,367 --> 00:13:54,933
You are dishonest.

225
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,433
It's nothing to do with my ability to love.

226
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:02,300
It's not contrary.

227
00:14:02,767 --> 00:14:05,267
We all want to keep some secrets.

228
00:14:05,267 --> 00:14:07,833
That doesn't mean we are bad people.

229
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:10,667
I just can't deal with this all over again.

230
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,200
I'm like a shattered, colorless puzzle piece on the floor.

231
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:21,800
Even if you pick it up,

232
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,933
you still have no clue to make me complete.

233
00:14:25,267 --> 00:14:29,633
Do you know how hard it is?

234
00:14:29,633 --> 00:14:31,500
I'm always here.

235
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:35,233
Finishing a puzzle it's not a big deal.

236
00:14:35,233 --> 00:14:36,900
Take it easy. It will be done.

237
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,400
What if you just lose one of it?

238
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,867
Who told you a puzzle

239
00:14:45,867 --> 00:14:48,667
must be intact?

240
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:51,067
missing some pieces

241
00:14:51,067 --> 00:14:52,433
is somehow special.

242
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,500
I don't wanna be special.

243
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,433
There's some clothes that people forget to retrieve.

244
00:16:46,433 --> 00:16:48,000
My imagination is based on them.

245
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,900
And I will play as different rules.

246
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:50,733
Action

247
00:16:50,733 --> 00:16:51,967
I ran into an idiot.

248
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,267
He seized the equipment.

249
00:16:53,267 --> 00:16:54,867
But all he did was using his phone.

250
00:16:54,867 --> 00:16:57,133
I just can't stop my wrath.

251
00:16:57,133 --> 00:16:59,500
If being brave is something I can't do.

252
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,567
At least I can act like I could.

253
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,133
Why me?

254
00:17:04,133 --> 00:17:09,099
Why do I have to endure this every time?

255
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:12,066
Do I look like a person

256
00:17:12,067 --> 00:17:14,133
who is willing to take that?

257
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,633
I'm curious about?

258
00:17:26,633 --> 00:17:28,833
Why do you want to catch everyone?

259
00:17:35,267 --> 00:17:36,700
I think?

260
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,233
I can do it.

261
00:17:42,233 --> 00:17:44,167
And I have to.

262
00:17:46,033 --> 00:17:48,467
Why does it must be you?

263
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,900
Is there anyone forcing you?

264
00:18:00,867 --> 00:18:02,567
Because

265
00:18:06,467 --> 00:18:10,367
I want to be treated

266
00:18:10,367 --> 00:18:12,433
like that too, unconditionally.

267
00:18:17,633 --> 00:18:22,067
I wanna be loved.

268
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:29,233
I wanna be cared.

269
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,233
So I fight so hard to earn it.

270
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,133
So hard?

271
00:18:44,067 --> 00:18:49,200
To catch those people

272
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,067
who I really care about.

273
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,200
Let's try to image that

274
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,300
what will happen if you don't catch them?

275
00:19:03,933 --> 00:19:07,033
Will they stop loving you?

276
00:19:11,433 --> 00:19:13,933
In a baseball game, not every ball

277
00:19:13,933 --> 00:19:15,433
can be caught by the catcher.

278
00:19:16,233 --> 00:19:18,200
Not to mention your dilemma

279
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,300
is much more difficult than catching a ball.

280
00:19:21,533 --> 00:19:24,367
You should be relaxed.

281
00:19:25,733 --> 00:19:28,200
Give yourself a chance to fumble.

282
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,733
See what will happen then.

283
00:19:37,167 --> 00:19:38,567
Can I make it?
