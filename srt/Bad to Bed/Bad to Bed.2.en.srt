1
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,933
I want to curse the event planner.

2
00:01:51,733 --> 00:01:54,500
Drinking outside in summer night?

3
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,533
I’m sweating like a pig.

4
00:01:57,767 --> 00:01:59,700
Only once a month.

5
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,367
Just bear with it.

6
00:02:02,367 --> 00:02:06,133
You might met someone and get laid.

7
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,067
So the main point was never the drinks.

8
00:02:10,067 --> 00:02:11,767
Get laid, huh?

9
00:02:11,767 --> 00:02:14,000
Just like what you did to me last time.

10
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,633
Well, from what I see,

11
00:02:16,633 --> 00:02:18,233
you don’t get the chance tonight.

12
00:02:20,233 --> 00:02:22,233
You won’t take me home tonight?

13
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,300
I just got recognized by a guy.

14
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,767
He ran to me for taking a picture.

15
00:02:29,767 --> 00:02:31,867
And he said I’m more handsome in flesh.

16
00:02:32,967 --> 00:02:33,800
Where’s he?

17
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,533
I’m gonna destroy the photo.

18
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,700
What?

19
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,067
Your phone, come on.

20
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,467
I want to take a picture, too.

21
00:02:43,467 --> 00:02:44,533
Okay.

22
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,233
Password?

23
00:02:52,067 --> 00:02:54,233
Why? Post a story for someone?

24
00:02:54,233 --> 00:02:56,333
Why? I can’t do that?

25
00:02:57,167 --> 00:03:00,867
It’s just… I should tell Tina first.

26
00:03:00,867 --> 00:03:02,000
She always stresses on that

27
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,767
my account is an merchandise.

28
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,500
So I can’t use it as a personal platform.

29
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,733
That’s why I have to think twice.

30
00:03:09,433 --> 00:03:13,033
You influencers are so complicated.

31
00:03:13,033 --> 00:03:14,867
It’s just a picture.

32
00:03:14,867 --> 00:03:16,433
Nothing special.

33
00:03:16,433 --> 00:03:18,200
Not special to you.

34
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,700
People can add a lot of context

35
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,167
just in a simple picture of two guys.

36
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,033
I don’t wanna be bothered because of that.

37
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,033
Fine.

38
00:03:29,033 --> 00:03:30,400
Even though I’m not a influencer,

39
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,567
I can still understand that.

40
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,467
But it’s social media we are talking about.

41
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:39,900
Interaction is everything.

42
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,600
Whether you like it or not,

43
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,433
People will pour out their emotions

44
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:46,867
with ego and in a selfish way.

45
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,367
Sometime good words

46
00:03:50,367 --> 00:03:51,867
make me stressful, too.

47
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,633
Pretty face, take a picture?

48
00:03:56,367 --> 00:03:57,400
Yeah.

49
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:58,833
I just wanna save a picture of you

50
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:01,533
in my phone, okay?

51
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:02,533
Okay.

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,067
Here.

53
00:04:05,067 --> 00:04:06,767
1 2 3

54
00:04:09,533 --> 00:04:11,233
No, again.

55
00:04:11,233 --> 00:04:11,867
Not cool.

56
00:04:11,867 --> 00:04:12,567
I think it’s fine.

57
00:04:12,567 --> 00:04:14,367
No, again.

58
00:04:14,367 --> 00:04:15,400
1 2 3

59
00:04:17,767 --> 00:04:20,767
Yeah, this is nice.

60
00:04:20,767 --> 00:04:21,967
Pretty nice.

61
00:05:10,167 --> 00:05:12,100
You live in such a huge place.

62
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,900
Where are your parents?

63
00:05:15,067 --> 00:05:17,400
My mom passed away.

64
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,667
And my dad got married again.

65
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:21,333
So, here I am.

66
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:22,633
Sorry.

67
00:05:24,767 --> 00:05:26,333
What for?

68
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:27,967
You did nothing.

69
00:05:27,967 --> 00:05:31,333
It just happened to me.

70
00:05:43,433 --> 00:05:44,900
Wanna play a game?

71
00:05:45,533 --> 00:05:47,400
There’s a traffic light in the front.

72
00:05:48,467 --> 00:05:49,867
The fastest one who get there wins.

73
00:05:49,867 --> 00:05:51,400
And the loser must pay for the drinks.

74
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,133
It’s only a few seconds left!

75
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:54,267
Drinks!

76
00:05:54,267 --> 00:05:56,200
Hey!

77
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,133
You pay for the drinks!

78
00:06:30,733 --> 00:06:31,967
Pause the video.

79
00:06:37,633 --> 00:06:39,700
I’m like the main character.

80
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,967
I hate the way people perceive gay.

81
00:06:41,967 --> 00:06:43,633
Like what he said.

82
00:06:43,633 --> 00:06:47,800
Surrender. Invasion.

83
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,933
You hate the way people perceive gay,

84
00:06:51,933 --> 00:06:54,900
or you’re just afraid of me chaining you up?

85
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,533
I hate both.

86
00:07:00,533 --> 00:07:02,433
You know what I hate?

87
00:07:02,433 --> 00:07:03,367
No, I don’t.

88
00:07:03,367 --> 00:07:06,933
I hate you for making me press pause again.

89
00:07:08,233 --> 00:07:11,033
I just don’t want to interrupt during playing.

90
00:07:11,033 --> 00:07:13,100
Can we continue?

91
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,267
Fine.

92
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:16,633
Are you sure?

93
00:07:16,633 --> 00:07:17,400
Yeah.

94
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,033
No pausing again.

95
00:07:19,033 --> 00:07:20,233
Hurry up!

96
00:07:20,233 --> 00:07:21,300
Play.

97
00:07:31,767 --> 00:07:34,300
I have a weird experience to share.

98
00:07:34,933 --> 00:07:36,700
What is it?

99
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,933
Someone took me home one night.

100
00:07:39,933 --> 00:07:43,967
I woke up the next day, and there were dogs barking around.

101
00:07:43,967 --> 00:07:46,667
I thought I was dreaming.

102
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:50,133
But it turned out to be a stranger

103
00:07:50,133 --> 00:07:52,733
who was leading two dogs.

104
00:07:54,033 --> 00:07:55,533
Awkward.

105
00:07:55,967 --> 00:07:57,433
Who was that?

106
00:07:58,433 --> 00:08:00,933
The one took you home?

107
00:08:00,933 --> 00:08:02,367
Hell no.

108
00:08:02,367 --> 00:08:03,467
The stranger was the roommate of his.

109
00:08:03,467 --> 00:08:05,367
They had a relationship in the past.

110
00:08:05,367 --> 00:08:06,800
The roommate walked his dogs,

111
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,067
and return them to him

112
00:08:09,067 --> 00:08:11,133
in his own room.

113
00:08:12,133 --> 00:08:13,967
You stayed your clothe on?

114
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,433
You think?

115
00:08:16,433 --> 00:08:18,500
Of course not.

116
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,700
I always stay naked after sex.

117
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,267
I got super terrified

118
00:08:25,933 --> 00:08:27,700
by that roommate.

119
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,867
Thank god, there was a quilt.

120
00:08:29,867 --> 00:08:31,700
Great story.

121
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,600
I can almost visualize that.

122
00:08:34,033 --> 00:08:36,900
But it’s weird that

123
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,467
two people still live together

124
00:08:39,467 --> 00:08:41,600
after their break-up.

125
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,100
Maybe they have some difficulties.

126
00:08:48,267 --> 00:08:51,533
I don’t believe in difficulties.

127
00:08:51,533 --> 00:08:55,433
They just can’t be apart,

128
00:08:55,433 --> 00:08:57,600
He was lying to you.

129
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,633
They were in an open relationship.

130
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,400
The roommate thing was a deception.

131
00:09:06,933 --> 00:09:09,000
Negative thinking.

132
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,267
It’s called experiencing,

133
00:09:13,267 --> 00:09:15,567
not negative thinking.

134
00:09:18,967 --> 00:09:22,333
Have you met someone who has a roommate,

135
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,600
but turned out he’s the boyfriend?

136
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,800
I’ll trade you a story,

137
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,833
which is also about dogs.

138
00:09:31,467 --> 00:09:32,500
Yay.

139
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,033
I was drinking alone last night.

140
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,167
Hey, you alone?

141
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:57,433
Seems like you are, too.

142
00:09:57,433 --> 00:09:58,767
Dog, too.

143
00:09:58,767 --> 00:10:00,367
I’m a dog!

144
00:10:02,133 --> 00:10:06,433
Is this a nickname thing or what?

145
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,667
I mean I’m a humandog.

146
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:13,333
What do you get from playing as a dog?

147
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,267
I can act helpless in front of my master.

148
00:10:15,267 --> 00:10:17,300
You can do that to your boyfriend, too.

149
00:10:18,067 --> 00:10:19,400
It’s different.

150
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,567
With my master, I can feel myself

151
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,800
being controlled and commanded.

152
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,100
Fulfill my master’s needs

153
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,067
makes me happy.

154
00:10:28,933 --> 00:10:32,633
What would he ask you to do?

155
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:37,200
I have to bark like a dog,

156
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,300
walk like a dog.

157
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,200
I obey everything he says to have sex.

158
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,367
Just be a happy puppy.

159
00:10:44,133 --> 00:10:47,300
So you are happy because

160
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,333
you are treated like a dog?

161
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,967
I won’t use the word “treat.”

162
00:10:50,967 --> 00:10:54,000
‘Cause I AM a dog.

163
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,133
You know what?

164
00:10:55,133 --> 00:10:57,967
It’s wonderful to have a master in a dog’s life.

165
00:10:57,967 --> 00:11:00,167
So what you feel is just wonderful.

166
00:11:01,433 --> 00:11:06,200
Not because your lust is satisfied

167
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,533
by the special torture?

168
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:08,833
You just listen to your master.

169
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,700
You will be loved

170
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,433
if you just follow his guide.

171
00:11:12,433 --> 00:11:13,900
Once he got some guests in the house,

172
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,233
they were allowed to pet me on my head.

173
00:11:16,233 --> 00:11:19,067
I felt so wonderful back then.

174
00:11:34,067 --> 00:11:37,600
I got really confused.

175
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,200
What is the feeling of “wonferful”?

176
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,100
They are just a couple.

177
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,867
Only one plays as a master, another as a dog.

178
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,200
Maybe this kind of relationship

179
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,267
delivers loyalty easier than usual couples.

180
00:12:06,067 --> 00:12:09,367
How often do you meet the master?

181
00:12:09,367 --> 00:12:11,000
The last one has a boyfriend.

182
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,367
Maybe once a month.

183
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,267
I don’t get it.

184
00:12:16,267 --> 00:12:19,533
You got your dog, and you can still have a boyfriend?

185
00:12:20,433 --> 00:12:21,933
So you cannot date

186
00:12:21,933 --> 00:12:23,333
when you have a pet around?

187
00:12:28,867 --> 00:12:30,733
But, the master

188
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,300
and the humandog must have s…

189
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,167
Have sex.

190
00:12:35,167 --> 00:12:38,100
The boyfriend knew that I exist.

191
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,667
There was no lying among us.

192
00:12:40,667 --> 00:12:42,067
Isn’t that enough?

193
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,333
He was just like a puppy.

194
00:12:52,233 --> 00:12:53,900
He kept looking at me.

195
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,433
He’s really like a puppy.

196
00:12:56,433 --> 00:12:57,967
So cute.

197
00:12:59,633 --> 00:13:01,533
I wonder,

198
00:13:01,533 --> 00:13:05,433
maybe the dogs barked at you

199
00:13:05,433 --> 00:13:08,367
just because their master was

200
00:13:08,367 --> 00:13:12,100
stolen by you?

201
00:13:14,533 --> 00:13:20,367
So I am a humandog right now?

202
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,400
Go fetch!

203
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,667
Go fetch yourself.

204
00:13:31,667 --> 00:13:32,733
Hey, puppy.

205
00:13:32,733 --> 00:13:34,433
Go, go fetch!

206
00:13:34,433 --> 00:13:35,467
No!

207
00:14:12,867 --> 00:14:16,267
Come home in the morning again.

208
00:14:16,267 --> 00:14:18,500
None of your business.

209
00:14:22,567 --> 00:14:23,800
If you will do that again,

210
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,967
just tell me earlier or I will be worried.

211
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,467
What are you doing?

212
00:15:44,467 --> 00:15:46,100
As you can see.

213
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,000
I can’t tell what it is!

214
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,100
From now on,

215
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,400
I’m your pet.

216
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,200
The dog with compliance.

217
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,133
I will be with you forever.

218
00:15:54,133 --> 00:15:56,400
What are you thinking? Master?

219
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,167
How dare him drive you home?

220
00:15:58,167 --> 00:16:00,000
It should be me to do that.

221
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,167
What do you want from me?

222
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,567
Is he your ex?

223
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:07,800
Itchy!

224
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:10,433
Did you hear something?

225
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:33,367
What are you doing?

226
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,400
I’m downloading GagaOOLala.

227
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,800
The No.1 LGBTQ+ on-line platform

228
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,300
which contains tons of gay romance contents.

229
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,333
There are so many categories to check.

230
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,633
I remember it’s an APP

231
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:50,267
only on cell phones and tablets.

232
00:16:50,267 --> 00:16:51,800
It can be downloaded on TV now.

233
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,333
That’s what I am doing.

234
00:16:54,233 --> 00:16:56,000
So much like be in a theater.

235
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,800
Thank you.

236
00:17:01,633 --> 00:17:03,100
What should we watch now?

237
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,433
How about

238
00:17:06,433 --> 00:17:09,733
“Mattachine Family”?

239
00:17:11,967 --> 00:17:15,200
Thomas and Oscar are a couple.

240
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,267
They love each other so bad.

241
00:17:18,267 --> 00:17:20,433
However, after their son who was adopted.

242
00:17:20,433 --> 00:17:23,133
go back to his biological mother,

243
00:17:23,133 --> 00:17:26,400
they start to have diverse

244
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,467
opinions about building a family.

245
00:17:29,467 --> 00:17:32,333
Thomas starts to think about his marriage,

246
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:36,400
and the meaning of raising a child.

247
00:17:37,267 --> 00:17:38,600
Well?

248
00:17:41,733 --> 00:17:44,567
It sounds so moody.

249
00:17:44,567 --> 00:17:46,600
Really? I think it’s okay.

250
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,567
Give it a try?

251
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,133
Okay, sure.
