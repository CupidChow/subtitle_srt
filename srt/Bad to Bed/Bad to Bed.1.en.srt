1
00:01:23,267 --> 00:01:24,267
Raccoon Chao.

2
00:01:24,267 --> 00:01:26,667
Tell me you didn’t forget the project at 7 today.

3
00:01:26,667 --> 00:01:28,733
Consider your breakfast is prepared.

4
00:01:28,733 --> 00:01:31,533
And bring the white shoes the client had approved.

5
00:01:34,033 --> 00:01:37,667
I’m awake. God, it’s fuking early.

6
00:01:37,667 --> 00:01:39,800
I barely slept.

7
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,300
I’m so tired.

8
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,433
Tina.

9
00:01:47,433 --> 00:01:49,833
I wanna have a word with you about work.

10
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,567
I’ll meet you at the office.

11
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,533
You can meet me at the bar tonight.

12
00:02:03,533 --> 00:02:05,433
I have a full agenda this afternoon.

13
00:03:59,033 --> 00:04:01,367
Congratulations, Tina!

14
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:03,433
You finally found a man who wants to go to hell with you

15
00:04:03,433 --> 00:04:05,533
Cheers!

16
00:04:12,567 --> 00:04:15,067
This is not enough.

17
00:04:15,067 --> 00:04:17,000
Bobby, give me a Lamborghini, please.

18
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,267
A gift for Tina.

19
00:04:18,267 --> 00:04:19,667
On my tab.

20
00:04:39,533 --> 00:04:42,167
1 2 3 Go

21
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,633
No way. It’s too strong.

22
00:04:46,633 --> 00:04:48,333
You drink the shit, Raccoon.

23
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,900
You suppose to be a strong businesswoman,

24
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,367
now you want me to cover you?

25
00:04:51,367 --> 00:04:52,633
Fine.

26
00:04:56,167 --> 00:04:58,600
What the… Too strong, man.

27
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,367
See?

28
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,100
Hey, the laughing one.

29
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,967
Yeah, you. Turn back.

30
00:05:05,967 --> 00:05:07,500
Help me drink it.

31
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,733
Drink it for me. Come on.

32
00:05:08,733 --> 00:05:10,667
I can’t do Lamborghini. I’ll be blacked out.

33
00:05:10,667 --> 00:05:12,033
Black out?

34
00:05:12,033 --> 00:05:13,600
You can crash at my place tonight.

35
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,633
It’s a deal.

36
00:05:14,633 --> 00:05:15,567
Come on.

37
00:05:15,567 --> 00:05:16,567
No.

38
00:05:17,767 --> 00:05:19,467
Bobby, we need another straw.

39
00:05:19,467 --> 00:05:21,367
So they can suck each other.

40
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,733
It is too much.

41
00:06:04,133 --> 00:06:05,667
Alright, stop now.

42
00:06:05,667 --> 00:06:07,400
Drink this, it will help.

43
00:06:12,067 --> 00:06:13,100
Excuse me.

44
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,067
Are you Raccoon?

45
00:06:14,067 --> 00:06:14,633
Yes?

46
00:06:14,633 --> 00:06:16,033
can I take a photo with you?

47
00:06:16,033 --> 00:06:16,833
Sure.

48
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,133
Here’s my phone.

49
00:06:18,767 --> 00:06:19,367
Okay.

50
00:06:19,367 --> 00:06:20,333
Let’s do this on three.

51
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:23,400
Okay, 1, 2, 3.

52
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,867
Check it out.

53
00:06:25,867 --> 00:06:27,433
It’s a little bit fuzzy. One more, please.

54
00:06:27,433 --> 00:06:30,767
Okay, 1, 2, 3.

55
00:06:30,767 --> 00:06:31,700
Great.

56
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,200
Thanks.

57
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:33,833
Bye-bye.

58
00:06:36,033 --> 00:06:37,367
Tina.

59
00:06:37,367 --> 00:06:38,667
Did you see that?

60
00:06:38,667 --> 00:06:40,333
I was totally a selfie stick.

61
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,967
Who is the star here?

62
00:06:42,733 --> 00:06:45,100
Sorry, I was intoxicated.

63
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,167
I’ll kick that kind of shit away next time,

64
00:06:46,167 --> 00:06:48,567
okay, Raccoon?

65
00:06:48,567 --> 00:06:49,800
Save it.

66
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,267
I just can’t believe it.

67
00:06:51,267 --> 00:06:52,833
Ridiculous.

68
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,100
Oh, you want to say something to me, right?

69
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,633
What’s that?

70
00:06:57,633 --> 00:07:01,000
I want to take a break.

71
00:07:02,033 --> 00:07:03,133
Come on.

72
00:07:03,133 --> 00:07:05,567
It’s not like I make you work 24/7.

73
00:07:05,567 --> 00:07:08,467
You always take breaks between cases.

74
00:07:08,467 --> 00:07:12,533
Yeah. But I’m not okay these days.

75
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:15,600
I just wanna hit the pause button for a while.

76
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,267
What happened?

77
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,500
Never mind. No big deal.

78
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,500
You need the money to get married.

79
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,300
If I stop working,

80
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,267
you’ll be doomed.

81
00:07:27,267 --> 00:07:29,600
I don’t wanna ruin your marriage.

82
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:33,067
Shit. Are you kidding me?

83
00:07:34,133 --> 00:07:35,767
Why are you so important

84
00:07:35,767 --> 00:07:37,767
that I can’t get married without you?

85
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,167
You never ask me why I wanna get married.

86
00:07:41,167 --> 00:07:43,167
You’re lucky to have an unlucky guy.

87
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,933
Shut up.

88
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:47,500
I’m pregnant, okay?

89
00:07:50,867 --> 00:07:52,967
I think I can still drink, the baby is not formed yet.

90
00:07:52,967 --> 00:07:54,767
But I can’t come here with you anymore.

91
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,267
Hey, you know something?

92
00:08:23,267 --> 00:08:26,500
I think you just got me wasted.

93
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,033
Is that all you got?

94
00:08:30,067 --> 00:08:32,433
What?

95
00:08:32,433 --> 00:08:35,700
You think I’m seducing you?

96
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,900
I’m fine with it.

97
00:08:41,133 --> 00:08:42,467
Excellent.

98
00:08:50,867 --> 00:08:53,267
Wait. Wrong position.

99
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:55,367
I should be on top.

100
00:08:55,367 --> 00:08:57,900
No, I should be on top first.

101
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,033
I’m giving you a warm up.

102
00:09:16,467 --> 00:09:18,233
Hey, do not do the “Top things.”

103
00:09:19,367 --> 00:09:21,833
Take it easy, relax.

104
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,200
What’s this?

105
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,133
Secret potion.

106
00:09:35,133 --> 00:09:38,500
So I can do whatever I wanna do.

107
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,267
Idiot.

108
00:09:41,267 --> 00:09:42,267
Tell me about it.

109
00:09:42,267 --> 00:09:44,367
It’s lavender ball pen.

110
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:46,333
I use it before I sleep.

111
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:47,767
It’s soothing.

112
00:09:49,233 --> 00:09:50,500
Smell so good.

113
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,700
My body is soothing.

114
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,733
But I can’t feel it with my heart.

115
00:09:56,733 --> 00:09:59,133
Why?

116
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,500
My manager is going to be married.

117
00:10:06,633 --> 00:10:10,000
You feel bad ‘cause she is getting married?

118
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,000
Women,

119
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,500
they step into a new territory because of marriages.

120
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,867
That territory never welcomes me.

121
00:10:20,867 --> 00:10:23,733
And more, she has a baby now.

122
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,700
So you lost a drinking buddy.

123
00:10:29,867 --> 00:10:31,800
Don’t you have someone else?

124
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,967
Well,

125
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:38,133
I graded my friends with different levels.

126
00:10:38,133 --> 00:10:41,633
Like a concentric circle.

127
00:10:41,633 --> 00:10:44,633
Round by round.

128
00:10:44,633 --> 00:10:47,900
Tina is always the center point.

129
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,633
She’s the one I can share my emotions with.

130
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,933
Other people are just not Tina.

131
00:10:55,567 --> 00:11:02,300
We can have dinner, go to bars, or go to the movies.

132
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,567
But we don’t really talk.

133
00:11:04,567 --> 00:11:07,633
One thing is I’m not sure there’s anyone wants to talk.

134
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:09,833
Another thing is,

135
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:12,467
I’m not really a fan of sharing.

136
00:11:12,467 --> 00:11:14,633
That’s not me.

137
00:11:17,167 --> 00:11:20,167
My real name is Shu-Kwang Dai.

138
00:11:22,267 --> 00:11:25,133
No one uses his real name, right?

139
00:11:26,033 --> 00:11:29,667
I give you this major information.

140
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:32,200
I wanna see what position you would put me

141
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:37,467
in the concentric circle

142
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:49,300
I want to be closer to you.

143
00:11:50,433 --> 00:11:52,567
Until I’m close enough to the core.

144
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,367
Are you tired? Wanna sleep?

145
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:02,700
Do you know the story of Hypnos and Endymion?

146
00:12:05,567 --> 00:12:07,833
In Greek mythology,

147
00:12:09,167 --> 00:12:12,633
There’s a Goddess of Night, Nyx.

148
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:16,633
She gave birth to twins.

149
00:12:16,633 --> 00:12:22,000
God of Sleep, Hypnos.

150
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,067
And God of Deah, Thanatos.

151
00:12:26,667 --> 00:12:28,933
Hypnos

152
00:12:28,933 --> 00:12:31,267
lived in a cave

153
00:12:31,267 --> 00:12:34,533
which the sunshine could never cast.

154
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:40,133
Poppies were planted in front of his palace.

155
00:12:40,133 --> 00:12:43,933
Soporific plants were also everywhere.

156
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,467
Even though Hypnos

157
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:50,500
had a dullness look.

158
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,100
He was still a powerful god.

159
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,733
He was humble and kind.

160
00:12:57,733 --> 00:12:59,700
The wings he had

161
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,567
helped him fly over

162
00:13:02,567 --> 00:13:05,633
the mountain peak and ocean every night.

163
00:13:05,633 --> 00:13:09,233
Every lives acquired sleep

164
00:13:09,233 --> 00:13:12,600
because of the wind that vibrated through his wings.

165
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,633
There was a gentle power in it.

166
00:13:15,633 --> 00:13:19,633
All the fatigue and toilsome creatures had

167
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:22,000
would always be healed

168
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,133
by touching the breeze.

169
00:13:25,133 --> 00:13:28,067
So that sleep was a way to

170
00:13:28,067 --> 00:13:32,167
reduce pain and pressure,

171
00:13:32,167 --> 00:13:36,167
and helped creatures to face a brand new day.

172
00:13:36,167 --> 00:13:39,200
One day, Hypnos

173
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,733
fell in love with a handsome shepherd.

174
00:13:42,733 --> 00:13:44,267
The name was Endymion.

175
00:13:44,267 --> 00:13:46,533
Endymion was loved by Hypnos too deep.

176
00:13:46,533 --> 00:13:48,367
In order to gaze

177
00:13:48,367 --> 00:13:51,600
the shepherd all the time.

178
00:13:52,433 --> 00:13:56,333
Hypnos gave Endymion a skill

179
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:59,533
to sleep with open eyes.

180
00:13:59,533 --> 00:14:01,567
Even if he was not awake,

181
00:14:01,567 --> 00:14:06,100
the limpid eyes could be still

182
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,467
appreciated by Hypnos.

183
00:14:19,433 --> 00:14:24,967
I don’t know

184
00:14:24,967 --> 00:14:29,367
if Hypnos likes me or not.

185
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,433
Every time I close my eyes,

186
00:14:34,433 --> 00:14:37,967
I hallucinate.

187
00:14:37,967 --> 00:14:40,133
I can see layers on layers.

188
00:14:42,933 --> 00:14:47,667
I can feel my body drops.

189
00:14:47,667 --> 00:14:51,233
I have to open my eyes to stop it.

190
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,267
I’m afraid of

191
00:14:57,267 --> 00:14:59,200
those feelings.

192
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,867
My body also has a lock.

193
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,067
And I can not unlock it.

194
00:15:14,667 --> 00:15:18,033
I’m so tired.

195
00:15:18,033 --> 00:15:19,800
Really tired.

196
00:15:29,767 --> 00:15:32,600
Good day, Mr. Chao,

197
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,633
I would like to know

198
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:37,333
how long has the condition gone on?

199
00:15:39,133 --> 00:15:41,167
It’s been a while.

200
00:15:41,167 --> 00:15:45,067
I ate sleeping pills my aunt gave me.

201
00:15:45,067 --> 00:15:48,767
I think I should find some help.

202
00:15:48,767 --> 00:15:50,900
That’s why I’m here.

203
00:15:51,933 --> 00:15:53,567
Thank you for having the idea.

204
00:15:53,567 --> 00:15:55,233
You’re doing the right thing.

205
00:15:55,233 --> 00:15:56,567
I’ll prescribe some

206
00:15:56,567 --> 00:15:58,700
medicine care for you

207
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,533
due to your condition.

208
00:16:00,533 --> 00:16:01,767
The medicine

209
00:16:01,767 --> 00:16:03,200
you will take

210
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,833
helps you relax.

211
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:06,767
Gradually,

212
00:16:06,767 --> 00:16:09,667
you can fall sleep easily.

213
00:16:09,667 --> 00:16:12,533
But notice this.

214
00:16:12,533 --> 00:16:16,400
You have to practice on thing.

215
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,100
Make a connection

216
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,533
between you and your bed.

217
00:16:20,533 --> 00:16:22,433
Tell yourself that

218
00:16:22,433 --> 00:16:26,367
the bed is made for sleep.

219
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,867
Don’t do anything but sleep.

220
00:16:27,867 --> 00:16:30,500
Especially using a smart phone.

221
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,333
You need to understand that

222
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,800
the lights from a cell phone

223
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,567
still got the ability to

224
00:16:35,567 --> 00:16:36,967
effect your body.

225
00:16:36,967 --> 00:16:39,233
It makes serotonin

226
00:16:39,233 --> 00:16:41,000
turns into melatonin with difficulty.

227
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,733
Once you lack of melatonin,

228
00:16:42,733 --> 00:16:45,000
you can not sleep as a normal person.

229
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,300
But I’m a influencer.

230
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:54,133
I can’t stop using my phone until last minute.

231
00:16:54,133 --> 00:16:55,633
It’s difficult for me to do that.

232
00:16:55,633 --> 00:16:57,167
Yes, it is.

233
00:16:57,167 --> 00:17:00,600
But you still have to try.

234
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,767
Just think about it,

235
00:17:01,767 --> 00:17:05,667
Health is always more important than work.

236
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:10,767
Doc, is there any food

237
00:17:10,767 --> 00:17:13,900
I can eat for a better sleep quality?

238
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,867
You can ingest protein.

239
00:17:16,867 --> 00:17:19,900
Or something like banana

240
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,000
and sesame.

241
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,900
This kind of food

242
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,433
is full of tryptophan and sesamin.

243
00:17:25,433 --> 00:17:28,500
These are important for your body

244
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,733
to create serotonin

245
00:17:29,733 --> 00:17:32,200
and melatonin.

246
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,467
Once these two factors reach to

247
00:17:34,467 --> 00:17:35,633
a certain level,

248
00:17:35,633 --> 00:17:38,333
you will have a better sleep experience.

249
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,067
Of course, some people

250
00:17:40,067 --> 00:17:42,700
like the sense of ritual.

251
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,900
It’s okay to

252
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,933
use lavender essential oil,

253
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:49,900
or listen to the white noise music.

254
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,600
Those are helpful.

255
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,100
But first of all,

256
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,833
you need to take the medicine regularly.

257
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,733
Yeah, I understand.

258
00:18:00,733 --> 00:18:02,133
You can wait outside for a moment.

259
00:18:02,133 --> 00:18:03,467
Then you can go to the pharmacy.

260
00:18:03,467 --> 00:18:05,933
Thank you, doctor.

261
00:18:09,967 --> 00:18:10,867
Mr. Chao.

262
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,633
Remember to take care of yourself.

263
00:18:17,967 --> 00:18:19,633
Thanks.

264
00:18:48,933 --> 00:18:52,233
You didn’t sleep or what?

265
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,433
I woke up to get hydrated.

266
00:21:05,967 --> 00:21:08,267
I hate the way people perceive gay.

267
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,400
Like what I said.

268
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,467
Surrender. Invasion.

269
00:21:11,467 --> 00:21:14,167
You hate the way people perceive gay,

270
00:21:14,167 --> 00:21:16,300
or you’re just afraid of me chaining you up?

271
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,433
You got your dog, and you also got yourself a new date?

272
00:21:19,433 --> 00:21:20,933
So you cannot date

273
00:21:20,933 --> 00:21:22,467
when you have a pet around?

274
00:21:22,467 --> 00:21:24,767
I don’t believe in difficulties.

275
00:21:24,767 --> 00:21:26,700
They just can’t be apart,

276
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,133
so they still live together.

277
00:21:28,133 --> 00:21:29,867
He was lying to you.

278
00:21:29,867 --> 00:21:31,967
Have you met someone who has a roommate,

279
00:21:31,967 --> 00:21:33,933
but turned out he’s the boyfriend?

280
00:21:41,367 --> 00:21:43,767
B complex capsule?

281
00:21:43,767 --> 00:21:44,700
You need this.

282
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,900
Go take care of your liver.

283
00:21:47,433 --> 00:21:48,767
Are you an Aquarius?

284
00:21:50,467 --> 00:21:51,933
What kind of stereo types is it?

285
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,067
Aquarius digs health care.

286
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:00,500
They eat supplement food all the time.

287
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,467
Well, I’m not.

288
00:22:02,467 --> 00:22:04,100
But I have another thing to eat.

289
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,533
What is it?

290
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:07,167
Sleepy Banana?

291
00:22:07,167 --> 00:22:08,633
For people to sleep better?

292
00:22:09,533 --> 00:22:12,267
Taiwanese really love amplification.

293
00:22:12,267 --> 00:22:16,033
Sleepy Banana makes a stronger banana.

294
00:22:16,733 --> 00:22:21,167
The banana you wanna eat is in the pants, I think.

295
00:22:22,067 --> 00:22:23,433
I like them both.

296
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:35,600
So, banana in the pants?

297
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:40,800
Why not?
