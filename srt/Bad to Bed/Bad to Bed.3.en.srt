1
00:00:55,567 --> 00:00:57,400
What are you doing?

2
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,800
As you can see.

3
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,633
I can’t tell what it is!

4
00:01:02,867 --> 00:01:03,967
Give me your hand.

5
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,100
How do you know my size?

6
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,000
It’s easy to measure

7
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,433
when someone sleeps like a pig.

8
00:01:21,133 --> 00:01:22,367
Oh.

9
00:01:25,733 --> 00:01:28,267
It’s your turn to own me.

10
00:01:28,267 --> 00:01:29,667
Wait, it’s too soon.

11
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:41,800
It’s all starts today.

12
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,533
I’ll be with you and take care of you

13
00:01:43,533 --> 00:01:45,133
forever and always.

14
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,933
Should I be crying?

15
00:01:50,933 --> 00:01:53,500
But I keep thinking of your cuteness.

16
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,933
You make me laugh.

17
00:01:55,967 --> 00:01:58,567
Let’s take a selfie, babe.

18
00:01:58,567 --> 00:01:59,733
Yeah.

19
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,400
Here.

20
00:02:09,467 --> 00:02:11,000
You wanna show someone?

21
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,233
From now on, I’m your dog.

22
00:02:32,233 --> 00:02:34,000
The kind with compliance.

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I will be with you forever.

24
00:02:37,233 --> 00:02:39,500
What are you thinking? Master?

25
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,933
Trying to find a way to play with my puppy.

26
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:47,500
I wanna hug you, master.

27
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,033
I wanna get up on bed.

28
00:02:49,033 --> 00:02:50,400
And I…

29
00:02:53,633 --> 00:02:55,467
Dogs can not get up on bed.

30
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:57,500
Besides, you’re a dog,

31
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,100
you can not speak in human.

32
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,133
So not cool. 

33
00:03:02,133 --> 00:03:04,133
The neighbors will be complaining.

34
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:05,333
Naughty dog.

35
00:03:09,167 --> 00:03:10,233
Hand.

36
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,633
Here, eat your cookies.

37
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:22,600
No.

38
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,100
Eat when I give you permission.

39
00:03:30,267 --> 00:03:31,333
Okay.

40
00:03:37,067 --> 00:03:38,300
Taste good?

41
00:03:41,033 --> 00:03:42,167
Here.

42
00:03:52,967 --> 00:03:55,867
I can barely see you recently.

43
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,933
I’m here, aren’t I?

44
00:04:05,067 --> 00:04:09,333
Twice a week.

45
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,533
And we only got two hours.

46
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:15,667
That’s all I can do.

47
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,733
Would you stop living with your ex?

48
00:04:25,133 --> 00:04:28,933
We live in different rooms. Nothing happened.

49
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,467
Why did he escort you home

50
00:04:33,467 --> 00:04:35,533
last time?

51
00:04:35,533 --> 00:04:37,267
He had his insistence.

52
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,033
How dare him drive you home?

53
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:46,033
It should be me doing that.

54
00:04:49,267 --> 00:04:50,933
What do you want from me?

55
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,167
Is he the ex?

56
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,400
Is he the ex?

57
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,300
Is he the ex?

58
00:05:04,133 --> 00:05:06,400
You don’t believe everything I said.

59
00:05:07,167 --> 00:05:09,800
Maybe we are done.

60
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,200
Got it?

61
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,900
Raccoon, get up.

62
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,100
It’s time for the meal.

63
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,400
Okay.

64
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,067
You alright?

65
00:05:54,067 --> 00:05:55,500
What’s wrong?

66
00:05:56,033 --> 00:05:57,800
I had a bad dream.

67
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,100
It’s just a dream, let’s go.

68
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,133
Okay.

69
00:06:18,167 --> 00:06:19,667
You look better after a clean-up.

70
00:06:20,967 --> 00:06:22,933
Don’t be a veggie.

71
00:06:22,933 --> 00:06:25,800
What? I need dietary fiber.

72
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,867
I brough you an enzyme beverage.

73
00:06:27,867 --> 00:06:29,500
It’s over there.

74
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,867
Drink with water.

75
00:06:30,867 --> 00:06:33,000
The dietary fiber is enough for you today.

76
00:06:34,433 --> 00:06:35,767
You order me to eat

77
00:06:35,767 --> 00:06:37,033
a lot of things.

78
00:06:37,033 --> 00:06:39,900
You really wanna be my master?

79
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,333
I just care about you in my way.

80
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,100
It’s not an order.

81
00:07:03,767 --> 00:07:05,100
Done!

82
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,267
Bottom’s up.

83
00:07:10,933 --> 00:07:12,300
How’s that?

84
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,533
Great.

85
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,967
Hey.

86
00:07:21,967 --> 00:07:24,967
How does it feel when you cook for someone?

87
00:07:26,967 --> 00:07:29,833
It makes you tired.

88
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,300
It takes effort.

89
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,500
But what you will get is joy.

90
00:07:35,767 --> 00:07:38,467
Is that so -called happiness?

91
00:07:38,467 --> 00:07:39,800
I think so.

92
00:07:40,867 --> 00:07:43,800
So when you eat my food,

93
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,467
can you obtain happiness?

94
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:49,500
Let me grade that.

95
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,100
The food…

96
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,667
barely passed.

97
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:56,867
I’ll give you 60.

98
00:07:56,867 --> 00:07:59,267
So lame!  -But I’m happy with that.

99
00:07:59,267 --> 00:08:01,233
Can I get 100? 

100
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:06,933
I remember when I was a kid,

101
00:08:06,933 --> 00:08:09,933
I was fed up with my mom’s cooking.

102
00:08:09,933 --> 00:08:11,967
I even put leftovers

103
00:08:11,967 --> 00:08:14,667
into plastic bags and keep them in my closet.

104
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,400
So I can throw them away when I go to school.

105
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:21,900
Now I can never eat my mom‘s food anymore.

106
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,067
Kinda miss it.

107
00:08:25,733 --> 00:08:27,967
Your behavior was so weird.

108
00:08:27,967 --> 00:08:29,800
If you can’t take it, just don’t eat it.

109
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,567
I’ll be punished if I don’t finish the meal.

110
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,067
Was it better to pretend that you did?

111
00:08:36,067 --> 00:08:38,100
I pretended to do a lot of things. 

112
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,767
I pretended to go to school

113
00:08:39,767 --> 00:08:42,000
when I was a primary school student.

114
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,567
Primary school student?

115
00:08:43,567 --> 00:08:45,833
Rebellion!

116
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:48,200
I hid myself in a school bathroom.

117
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,000
Or I hid in a secret locker room

118
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,067
between two buildings.

119
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:55,567
I was naughty, right?

120
00:08:55,567 --> 00:08:56,767
Gee.

121
00:08:56,767 --> 00:08:58,767
You’ll be punished if you get caught.

122
00:08:58,767 --> 00:08:59,733
Bad kid!

123
00:08:59,733 --> 00:09:01,533
It came to me that,

124
00:09:01,533 --> 00:09:05,533
One time, I skipped school, and I went home to sleep.

125
00:09:05,533 --> 00:09:08,100
My mom woke me up and questioned me

126
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,967
why I didn’t go to school.

127
00:09:12,167 --> 00:09:15,233
I thought I slept long enough,

128
00:09:15,233 --> 00:09:16,867
so I told her fearlessly like

129
00:09:16,867 --> 00:09:19,433
“It’s Saturday, Why do I need to go to school?”

130
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:22,433
Then I got beaten badly.

131
00:09:23,233 --> 00:09:25,600
She even shaved my hair the next day.

132
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,900
I was bald like a monk.

133
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,567
Bald?

134
00:09:30,633 --> 00:09:32,367
Your mom was really kick-ass.

135
00:09:32,367 --> 00:09:34,100
Is she still like that?

136
00:09:36,167 --> 00:09:38,033
She’s not with us anymore.

137
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,500
Here.

138
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,133
Let’s eat.

139
00:09:53,767 --> 00:09:55,067
Come on.

140
00:09:55,067 --> 00:09:56,267
You’re so nice.

141
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,600
Good.

142
00:10:02,933 --> 00:10:03,967
Raccoon, come here.

143
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:05,800
Here.

144
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,967
Come on.

145
00:10:12,067 --> 00:10:13,833
Raccoon.

146
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,233
What?

147
00:10:20,633 --> 00:10:22,167
Raccoon.

148
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,133
Raccoon, I…

149
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,733
I want to be with you forever.

150
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,433
“From now on.” 

151
00:10:37,433 --> 00:10:39,600
“I will be with you forever.”

152
00:10:41,067 --> 00:10:42,867
Did you hear something?

153
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,567
Nope.

154
00:10:51,633 --> 00:10:53,200
Oh, okay.

155
00:10:57,667 --> 00:10:58,833
Wait.

156
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,667
Let me take off my clothes.

157
00:11:12,227 --> 00:11:13,693
What’s wrong?

158
00:11:21,482 --> 00:11:23,222
Raccoon.

159
00:11:40,248 --> 00:11:41,670
“It's all starts today.”

160
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:44,394
"I'll be with you, and take care of you."

161
00:11:44,394 --> 00:11:45,616
“It's all starts today.” 

162
00:11:45,616 --> 00:11:49,045
"I'll be with you, and take care of you."

163
00:11:56,369 --> 00:12:03,752
 
Shu-Kwang Dai："Mr. Raccoon , I  have arrived."

164
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:15,833
"It’s your turn to own me."

165
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,233
"It’s too soon."

166
00:12:18,867 --> 00:12:21,333
" Own me."

167
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:22,967
"Just too soon."

168
00:12:54,049 --> 00:12:56,049
Shu-Kwang Dai："Mr. Raccoon , I  have arrived." 

169
00:12:56,049 --> 00:13:01,763
Shu-Kwang Dai："Where are you?" 

170
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:50,000
Human kind is dangerous, have you not learn your lesson?

171
00:13:59,127 --> 00:14:03,007
Shu-Kwang Dai："What happen?" 

172
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:07,802
Makoto  Inukai："When will you come back home?" 

173
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,467
I don’t care about apologies.

174
00:15:21,467 --> 00:15:23,000
I just wanna know what’s wrong with you.

175
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:24,933
What happened?

176
00:15:24,933 --> 00:15:26,500
Don’t push me!

177
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,267
Stop!

178
00:15:28,267 --> 00:15:30,800
I feel so wrong when the episode comes.

179
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,233
I cover my head with towels.

180
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:34,233
Sometime I put my helmet on.

181
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:37,000
Then I won’t get hurt when I slam my self onto the wall.

182
00:15:40,133 --> 00:15:41,467
If you don’t go out with me,

183
00:15:41,467 --> 00:15:42,567
I’ll try my best to tell him

184
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:44,067
I got your keys.

185
00:15:44,067 --> 00:15:45,867
How far does he know about that?

186
00:15:45,867 --> 00:15:47,133
It’s not your business.

187
00:15:47,133 --> 00:15:49,667
You won’t keep a relationship well if it’s full of lies.

188
00:16:00,633 --> 00:16:01,733
Stop moving.

189
00:16:01,733 --> 00:16:03,800
The sticker needs to be straight.

190
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,200
Or I will be anxious.

191
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:10,533
What’s this? Smells so good.

192
00:16:10,533 --> 00:16:12,433
Sticker with lavender oil.

193
00:16:12,433 --> 00:16:14,167
Like the thing you gave me last time.

194
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:15,767
They help you sleep well.

195
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:17,100
Done.

196
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,633
But my back is sore now.

197
00:16:23,633 --> 00:16:25,433
Why would I need this?

198
00:16:25,433 --> 00:16:27,900
Double functions. Not only for soreness,

199
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,467
but also for a better sleep.

200
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,000
Oh,

201
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,700
If I was a master,

202
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,333
what kind of pet will you be?

203
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:43,767
I wanna be…

204
00:16:43,767 --> 00:16:45,067
How about a kangaroo?

205
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,300
No one keeps a kangaroo in his house.

206
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,500
I don’t want that. Try another one.

207
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,400
Do you know there’s a kangaroo

208
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,467
in Australia with six packs?

209
00:16:55,467 --> 00:16:57,200
Kangaroo is pretty good.

210
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,000
Sounds so stupid.

211
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,667
A muscular kangaroo?

212
00:17:02,067 --> 00:17:03,767
It’s weird that

213
00:17:03,767 --> 00:17:06,400
everything you said to me, I bought it.

214
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,267
But everything I told you, you just doubted.

215
00:17:09,267 --> 00:17:11,733
Did I say something peculiar?

216
00:17:11,733 --> 00:17:14,233
My stories are real.

217
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:15,367
Oh.

218
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,033
Your dreams are so real.

219
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,467
Check this out.

220
00:17:21,467 --> 00:17:23,400
Gosh.

221
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,567
It’s gross.

222
00:17:25,567 --> 00:17:27,300
I don’t want to be a kangaroo.

223
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,133
Puppy is fine.

224
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,867
I am muscular, too.

225
00:17:33,867 --> 00:17:35,467
Like it or not?

226
00:17:35,467 --> 00:17:37,267
Stop showing off.

227
00:17:37,267 --> 00:17:40,033
Did you take something for

228
00:17:40,033 --> 00:17:42,000
increasing sexual drive?
219

229
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,967
I take it everyday.

230
00:17:44,967 --> 00:17:47,133
For daily basis

231
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:50,100
I take it in the morning.

232
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:54,067
When it comes to special occasions, I drink Power-up Potion.

233
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:59,300
You just drank the potion, right?

234
00:17:59,933 --> 00:18:01,933
No, you’re wrong.

235
00:18:01,933 --> 00:18:04,800
I’m going to drink now.

236
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,733
You are not allowed to drink it.

237
00:18:06,733 --> 00:18:08,333
Why?

238
00:18:09,233 --> 00:18:13,633
Let’s have a cross-species sex.

239
00:18:14,467 --> 00:18:16,967
You are not allowed to drink it ‘cause I want to drink it.

240
00:18:16,967 --> 00:18:19,467
I don’t want to be a puppy no more.

241
00:18:19,467 --> 00:18:21,000
I wanna be a h…

242
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,167
Husband!

243
00:18:23,167 --> 00:18:24,067
Horse.

244
00:18:24,067 --> 00:18:24,900
Or a hippo.

245
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,700
Everyone just can’t tell.

246
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,567
I wanna drink it!

247
00:18:32,667 --> 00:18:33,633
Let me drink it.

248
00:18:33,633 --> 00:18:34,667
No, I wanna drink it!
