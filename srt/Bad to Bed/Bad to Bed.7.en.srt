1
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,500
I’m back. Are you okay?

2
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,667
I had my meal at the aunt’s.

3
00:00:25,933 --> 00:00:28,133
Good night, mom.

4
00:01:07,433 --> 00:01:11,100
Do you know where your ex move to?

5
00:01:11,967 --> 00:01:13,267
I didn’t ask.

6
00:01:13,267 --> 00:01:16,133
He told me he has moved in his friend’s house.

7
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:19,800
You don’t want to know more?

8
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,100
You want me to know that?

9
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,267
Or you are the one who wants to know?

10
00:01:32,867 --> 00:01:35,200
You can move in with me.

11
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,133
Stay as long as you want.

12
00:01:38,733 --> 00:01:40,600
I live alone now.

13
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:42,867
There’s no one live with me.

14
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,667
I just keep thinking 

15
00:01:51,667 --> 00:01:55,300
it’s like I give everything to someone 

16
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,267
every time when I reach out my hand.

17
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,400
Is this our first time holding hands?

18
00:02:01,067 --> 00:02:03,100
I do remember we did this

19
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,700
when we were drinking outside the other day.

20
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,866
But I didn’t notice that

21
00:02:08,866 --> 00:02:10,632
you wanna give out everything.

22
00:02:11,733 --> 00:02:16,900
I felt I owe you.

23
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,433
I’m not talking about cheating.

24
00:02:18,433 --> 00:02:20,033
That’s not it.

25
00:02:24,767 --> 00:02:27,067
I won’t keep secrets anymore.

26
00:02:27,067 --> 00:02:28,600
I promise.

27
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:36,333
I prefer hugs.

28
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:37,933
So I can feel your heartbeats

29
00:02:37,933 --> 00:02:40,667
with my whole body.

30
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,000
And I can tell 

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,933
if you’re telling the truth.

32
00:02:45,233 --> 00:02:46,900
I can also tell 

33
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,233
those things

34
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:50,800
you haven’t tell me.

35
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,233
I will tell you everything.

36
00:02:54,233 --> 00:02:55,833
I will be honest.

37
00:03:02,133 --> 00:03:05,433
Can you feel my fear?

38
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:11,233
Promise me you won’t leave me again.

39
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:12,600
Promise me.

40
00:03:16,467 --> 00:03:20,633
Can you tell what I’m thinking now?

41
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:46,633
Babe, you don’t have to walk me home today.

42
00:03:46,633 --> 00:03:48,367
I can go home by myself.

43
00:03:51,267 --> 00:03:55,200
I said I can go home by myself.

44
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,133
I’m trying to hear another thing.

45
00:03:58,367 --> 00:04:00,900
I don’t want to say it twice.

46
00:04:11,467 --> 00:04:12,533
Babe.

47
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,933
You did say something.

48
00:04:16,933 --> 00:04:18,233
I didn’t hear it wrong.

49
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,333
Yeah.

50
00:04:22,367 --> 00:04:24,200
What?

51
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,600
Feel good?

52
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:29,000
Don’t walk backwards, it’s dangerous.

53
00:04:29,767 --> 00:04:32,133
Are you worried about me?

54
00:04:32,133 --> 00:04:34,933
Worried about me dying on the street?

55
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,567
I didn’t think that far.

56
00:04:37,567 --> 00:04:39,233
I just don’t want you to trip.

57
00:04:39,233 --> 00:04:40,500
Watch out.

58
00:04:41,533 --> 00:04:43,633
Danger is not scary.

59
00:04:43,633 --> 00:04:45,733
I see it as stimulation.

60
00:04:45,733 --> 00:04:48,033
I love to sit on the front row

61
00:04:48,033 --> 00:04:49,967
When I ride a roller coaster.

62
00:04:49,967 --> 00:04:51,500
Straight down to the ground.

63
00:04:52,433 --> 00:04:53,933
Just like I fall out from a building.

64
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,100
Crazy.

65
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,600
But I love it.

66
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,300
It’s cool to get close to death.

67
00:05:04,533 --> 00:05:06,300
I can’t do that.

68
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,767
Centrifugal force

69
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,967
or G force

70
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,800
Just makes my bladder 

71
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,300
itchy like hell.

72
00:05:15,967 --> 00:05:18,433
I’m also afraid of dying.

73
00:05:18,433 --> 00:05:21,167
The safe device might be broken.

74
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:23,800
At some time I would be throw out.

75
00:05:24,467 --> 00:05:27,133
I don’t think death is scary.

76
00:05:27,133 --> 00:05:29,367
Living is much more like a torture.

77
00:05:29,367 --> 00:05:30,700
Stop it.

78
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,000
I told you you will trip.

79
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,400
Everything OK?

80
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,333
I did it on purpose.

81
00:05:47,167 --> 00:05:48,767
Can you hear something?

82
00:05:51,133 --> 00:05:53,833
Your heartbeats are so strong

83
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:57,767
that I’m afraid you are going to die.

84
00:05:57,767 --> 00:05:59,333
Can you hear that?

85
00:06:01,267 --> 00:06:03,467
I can heard two sounds.

86
00:06:03,467 --> 00:06:07,200
My heartbeats and yours.

87
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,567
About the Sleeping God story you told me…

88
00:08:47,567 --> 00:08:49,667
I think about it over and over.

89
00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:51,433
It’s actually a scary story.

90
00:08:51,433 --> 00:08:52,667
What?

91
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:55,700
The God makes people sleep

92
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,367
is a nice move.

93
00:08:57,367 --> 00:08:59,667
Nah…

94
00:08:59,667 --> 00:09:02,933
He makes the shepherd to sleep with open eyes

95
00:09:02,933 --> 00:09:04,733
is actually a selfish gesture.

96
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,567
Did he ask the shepherd for the consent?

97
00:09:08,567 --> 00:09:11,167
He just makes him that way out of blue.

98
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:14,400
How can you get a nice sleep with eyes open?

99
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,800
You are not a fish though.

100
00:09:16,667 --> 00:09:18,300
Did you ever think

101
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,567
He makes everyone asleep.

102
00:09:21,567 --> 00:09:24,233
Everyone is happy in the dream.

103
00:09:24,233 --> 00:09:26,033
How about himself?

104
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:28,267
Don’t you think he is lonely?

105
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:29,333
That’s why he 

106
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,100
makes the shepherd to sleep

107
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,900
with his eyes open.

108
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,100
At least he got someone to be with him.

109
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,633
Let me ask you this.

110
00:09:40,633 --> 00:09:42,900
Do you want to sleep with your eyes open?

111
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:51,067
If I stop taking medicine

112
00:09:51,067 --> 00:09:53,567
I would get the ability.

113
00:09:53,567 --> 00:09:56,433
every time when I close my eyes

114
00:09:56,433 --> 00:10:00,533
some illogical patterns start to appear.

115
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,967
They could be so close.

116
00:10:02,967 --> 00:10:05,000
Not only like I am dreaming

117
00:10:05,733 --> 00:10:10,300
but like I’m walking through the reality.

118
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:13,033
The feelings

119
00:10:13,033 --> 00:10:14,900
can be described like

120
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:19,600
seeing a flash light takes action.

121
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,933
Persistence of vision comes right away.

122
00:10:22,933 --> 00:10:25,267
Layers after layers.

123
00:10:25,267 --> 00:10:27,333
Kind of spooky.

124
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:28,933
Kind of sick.

125
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,800
You’re still taking your medicine, right?

126
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,033
Of course.

127
00:10:40,367 --> 00:10:41,633
What?

128
00:10:43,033 --> 00:10:44,700
Let me give you something.

129
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,333
Well, okay.

130
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,100
Today is my birthday?

131
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,000
Don’t have to wait until your birthday to get a gift

132
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:52,967
Here.

133
00:10:52,967 --> 00:10:54,700
This is mine.

134
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,200
It’s gorgeous.

135
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,500
You bought these?

136
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,733
What? No.

137
00:10:58,733 --> 00:11:00,400
I made them myself.

138
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,933
I want you to have it.

139
00:11:05,567 --> 00:11:07,500
It suits my original one.

140
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,033
True.

141
00:11:08,033 --> 00:11:09,333
I love it.

142
00:11:10,967 --> 00:11:12,333
I poured a lot of blessing

143
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:14,000
when I make it.

144
00:11:15,067 --> 00:11:16,400
Really?

145
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,067
Let me feel it.

146
00:11:19,033 --> 00:11:22,933
I want you to sleep very well.

147
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:25,767
You can feel comfortable on your bed.

148
00:11:25,767 --> 00:11:27,733
You can make a lot of happy dreams.

149
00:11:29,467 --> 00:11:33,200
So the blessing is for my eyes open

150
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,767
or eyes closed?

151
00:11:37,267 --> 00:11:38,600
Of course your eyes open.

152
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,867
You bull shit.

153
00:11:45,467 --> 00:11:46,667
I wanna see yours.

154
00:11:46,667 --> 00:11:48,700
Mine is silver. I think yours is nice,too.

155
00:11:51,433 --> 00:11:56,700
I think you are the Sleeping God.

156
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,600
Why?

157
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,033
Because of your face, your profile.

158
00:12:03,033 --> 00:12:04,967
You just look like a God from Greek mythology.

159
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:11,067
Look at your muscle.

160
00:12:11,067 --> 00:12:13,033
Just look,

161
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:14,267
don’t touch.

162
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,233
but I don’t like it
.

163
00:12:18,233 --> 00:12:20,267
What now?

164
00:12:20,267 --> 00:12:22,267
If you are the sleeping God.

165
00:12:22,267 --> 00:12:25,567
Then I am the shepherd.

166
00:12:25,567 --> 00:12:27,667
According to what you said…

167
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,567
I don’t like the character.

168
00:12:32,133 --> 00:12:35,933
So the whole thing is you trying to say

169
00:12:35,933 --> 00:12:37,900
I’m a person

170
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,433
did a lot of things to torture you.

171
00:12:40,433 --> 00:12:42,000
And I’m the reason you can’t sleep.

172
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,567
Am I right? Just say it!

173
00:12:43,567 --> 00:12:47,233
No, of course not!

174
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:49,533
I’m just…

175
00:12:49,533 --> 00:12:51,400
I’m afraid of…

176
00:12:53,533 --> 00:12:56,067
I’m afraid of not knowing you enough.

177
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:58,233
That’s the reason I can’t sleep.

178
00:12:58,667 --> 00:13:00,433
What else do you wanna know?

179
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,167
I want to know your family.

180
00:13:06,167 --> 00:13:08,367
You wanna meet my parents?

181
00:13:10,733 --> 00:13:12,767
Yeah, if that’s possible.

182
00:13:12,767 --> 00:13:15,000
if that’s inappropriate.

183
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,033
I’m OK with seeing them from a distance.

184
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,167
Mine are all gone.

185
00:13:24,167 --> 00:13:25,967
Sometimes 

186
00:13:25,967 --> 00:13:28,967
I miss the days they were alive.

187
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,233
You don’t have to feel bad.

188
00:13:32,233 --> 00:13:34,533
Let me tell you my astrolabe.

189
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:36,033
Astrolabe?

190
00:13:36,033 --> 00:13:37,000
Yeah.

191
00:13:44,733 --> 00:13:46,867
Tell you what…

192
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:51,067
I love to see the explanation online.

193
00:13:51,067 --> 00:13:53,600
Uranus in four houses.

194
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,867
“Your family of origin is special.”

195
00:13:56,867 --> 00:14:01,467
“Move from place to place.”

196
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:03,833
“Parents are living apart,

197
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,967
or even divorced.”

198
00:14:05,967 --> 00:14:10,767
“Those factors make you special.”

199
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,267
“You don’t fit in your family.”

200
00:14:12,267 --> 00:14:15,000
“You might be seen as the weird one.”

201
00:14:17,233 --> 00:14:19,567
I’m not a role model to you.

202
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,133
Nope.

203
00:14:21,133 --> 00:14:24,667
Special and weird.

204
00:14:24,667 --> 00:14:26,333
Cool for me.

205
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:27,667
Why?

206
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:29,400
Because

207
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:34,100
I’m a magnet attracted by weirdos.

208
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,933
Weirdos like you.

209
00:14:38,133 --> 00:14:39,300
What the…

210
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,700
Not attracted by my face and personality?

211
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:45,933
Fine. Those too.

212
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,500
Do you have a new sibling 

213
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,167
after your dad get married again?

214
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:02,700
They have a girl

215
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:07,300
who is super younger than me.

216
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:11,133
She is maybe 10.

217
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,467
Does she look like you?

218
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,933
She looks like her mom more.

219
00:15:22,033 --> 00:15:24,800
So who do you look like?

220
00:15:45,767 --> 00:15:47,100
What?

221
00:15:52,033 --> 00:15:53,533
Give me a hug.

222
00:17:48,633 --> 00:17:49,500
Excuse me.

223
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,500
I’m late.

224
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,533
That’s fine.

225
00:17:51,533 --> 00:17:53,467
You still came.

226
00:17:53,467 --> 00:17:54,767
Let’s take a picture.

227
00:17:54,767 --> 00:17:55,867
Sure.

228
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:03,400
Wait.

229
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,567
Ok

230
00:18:07,233 --> 00:18:08,900
Fuck.

231
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,433
Is it clean?

232
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,933
how have you been?

233
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,600
Well.

234
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,733
I listened to your advice.

235
00:18:23,733 --> 00:18:26,500
I pretended to care nothing.

236
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,933
And I really feel better.

237
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:33,400
You feel better or you are better?

238
00:18:34,433 --> 00:18:35,733
what do you think?

239
00:18:38,067 --> 00:18:41,400
You happy?

240
00:18:43,267 --> 00:18:48,267
Happier than I was alone.

241
00:18:50,933 --> 00:18:52,433
this one is good.

242
00:18:56,567 --> 00:18:58,167
how about this one?

243
00:18:58,167 --> 00:18:59,233
This one.

244
00:18:59,233 --> 00:19:01,067
It’s vintage style.
245

245
00:19:01,067 --> 00:19:04,700
This one is abandoned for years.

246
00:19:05,667 --> 00:19:07,667
This one reminds me of my mom.

247
00:19:07,667 --> 00:19:10,033
The style or the personality?

248
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,867
Like my mom

249
00:19:13,867 --> 00:19:15,600
is an bad bitch.

250
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,867
Really?

251
00:19:16,867 --> 00:19:19,300
I think it’s cool and chik.

252
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,167
Not really a bad bitch.

253
00:19:21,167 --> 00:19:23,467
Go check for yourself.

254
00:19:23,467 --> 00:19:24,467
Huh.

255
00:19:24,467 --> 00:19:25,767
Let me feel it.

256
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,067
You’re right.

257
00:19:31,067 --> 00:19:31,967
Yup.

258
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:35,033
I once had a fight with my mom.

259
00:19:35,033 --> 00:19:36,833
I called her a bad bitch, too.

260
00:19:37,167 --> 00:19:40,200
She almost killed me with an iron pipe.
261

261
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,767
So scary.

262
00:19:41,767 --> 00:19:43,033
I told you so.

263
00:19:43,033 --> 00:19:46,400
This one is a bad bitch.

264
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,900
You wear it.

265
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,900
Ok.

266
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:51,867
Here I go.

267
00:19:51,867 --> 00:19:55,033
1 2 3 Action

268
00:19:55,033 --> 00:19:57,700
What did you say? Raccoon Chao?

269
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,700
Just say it again!

270
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,433
You wanna get hurt? You wanna die?

271
00:20:02,433 --> 00:20:04,667
Show some respect and say you’re sorry.

272
00:20:04,667 --> 00:20:08,067
1 2 3

273
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:13,367
Shit. You look like her.

274
00:20:13,367 --> 00:20:16,500
-I’ve got goosebumps.
-Right?

275
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,400
You must got hit a lot like I did.

276
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,667
True.

277
00:20:19,667 --> 00:20:20,933
Let’s play another one.

278
00:20:20,933 --> 00:20:22,033
Sure.

279
00:20:22,867 --> 00:20:24,400
Be ready.

280
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,433
1 2 3 Action

281
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,167
The story is over.

282
00:20:38,167 --> 00:20:39,800
You should go to bed.

283
00:20:40,267 --> 00:20:45,667
Do you want a magic to sleep with your eyes open?

284
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:25,133
Humans are dangerous. Haven’t you learned your lesson?

285
00:22:25,133 --> 00:22:26,367
It must be square

286
00:22:26,367 --> 00:22:28,667
and intact.

287
00:22:28,667 --> 00:22:31,167
It’s special because of the

288
00:22:31,167 --> 00:22:32,300
missing pieces.

289
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,067
I’m not alone.

290
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,867
Get out.

291
00:22:37,167 --> 00:22:38,233
Don’t be stupid.

292
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:39,700
What to worry?

293
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,733
I’m not a treasure box

294
00:22:41,733 --> 00:22:43,400
I won’t be sinking into the ocean.

295
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,600
Good boy, you’re fine.

296
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,000
You met me back then.

297
00:22:51,933 --> 00:22:53,233
Do you remember?

298
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,267
The story is over.

299
00:23:09,267 --> 00:23:11,167
You should go to bed.

300
00:23:11,167 --> 00:23:15,600
Do you want a magic to sleep with your eyes open?

301
00:23:16,433 --> 00:23:19,167
Let mommy draw on your eyelids.

302
00:23:19,167 --> 00:23:20,933
Draw two eyes.

303
00:23:25,433 --> 00:23:27,833
Here, give me a hug.
