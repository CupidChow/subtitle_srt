1
00:00:07,367 --> 00:00:09,667
What did you just say about the name of this?

2
00:00:10,833 --> 00:00:14,367
It’s called Evrodette.

3
00:00:14,367 --> 00:00:17,533
The name belongs to the goddess who represents

4
00:00:17,533 --> 00:00:21,100
the beauty and desire of love in Ancient Greek mythology.

5
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,933
Is she the goddess who came out of a huge shell in the sea?

6
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,300
How do you know?

7
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,233
Do you read Greek mythology?

8
00:00:30,233 --> 00:00:31,367
Nope.

9
00:00:31,367 --> 00:00:35,233
But I just saw her come out of the sea

10
00:00:35,233 --> 00:00:36,933
and cast a spell on me

11
00:00:36,933 --> 00:00:38,367
to fall in love with you.

12
00:01:28,533 --> 00:01:29,533
CUT!

13
00:01:29,533 --> 00:01:30,733
Thanks.

14
00:01:30,733 --> 00:01:31,533
Play it back.

15
00:01:32,267 --> 00:01:34,067
Was that okay?

16
00:01:34,067 --> 00:01:36,667
Excellent. You did a great job.

17
00:01:36,667 --> 00:01:38,000
I’ve been telling Tina before

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,767
that you should be an actor.

19
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:41,667
My intuition is right, right?

20
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:43,933
Thank you, but I still need to work hard.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,200
Nice. That take was a killer.

22
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:46,767
Let’s wrap it up.

23
00:01:46,767 --> 00:01:47,500
All done.

24
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,700
Thank you, director.

25
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,133
Thanks to all of you.

26
00:01:54,633 --> 00:01:55,967
Raccoon.

27
00:01:55,967 --> 00:01:57,833
Actually, I have something to ask you.

28
00:01:57,833 --> 00:01:59,333
About my boyfriend.

29
00:01:59,967 --> 00:02:01,867
I ‘m not good at emotional counseling.

30
00:02:01,867 --> 00:02:03,033
You may have to ask someone else.

31
00:02:03,033 --> 00:02:04,967
It ‘s not about feelings.

32
00:02:04,967 --> 00:02:06,133
Then what?

33
00:02:06,133 --> 00:02:07,900
Well…

34
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:11,333
My boyfriend has long-term

35
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:14,167
anxiety and insomnia.

36
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:15,667
After seeing the doctor and taking the medicine,

37
00:02:15,667 --> 00:02:18,233
his condition improved significantly.

38
00:02:18,233 --> 00:02:20,167
But I don ‘t know what’s wrong with him recently.

39
00:02:20,167 --> 00:02:21,867
He does’ ‘t take medicine anymore.

40
00:02:21,867 --> 00:02:24,633
Maybe he was afraid of drug addiction,

41
00:02:24,633 --> 00:02:26,200
which led to his current state.

42
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,367
It’s getting worse.

43
00:02:28,367 --> 00:02:30,700
I don’t know what to do.

44
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,700
That sounds like my story.

45
00:02:34,567 --> 00:02:36,933
I saw you posting about your illness,

46
00:02:36,933 --> 00:02:39,033
so I wanted to ask about your experience.

47
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:41,533
My personal opinion is that

48
00:02:41,533 --> 00:02:43,067
since you have seen a doctor,

49
00:02:43,067 --> 00:02:44,767
you should trust the doctor.

50
00:02:44,767 --> 00:02:48,700
If you have the idea of stopping the drug, you should also discuss it with your doctor first.

51
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,867
The doctor advised me to slowly reduce the dose of medicine.

52
00:02:51,867 --> 00:02:54,667
Adjust when the body can adapt.

53
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,300
But these things are all case-by-case

54
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,467
and vary from person to person.

55
00:02:59,467 --> 00:03:01,467
Can you talk to him?

56
00:03:01,467 --> 00:03:04,933
Yes, but what I can do is to listen to him

57
00:03:04,933 --> 00:03:08,433
and encourage him to see a doctor.

58
00:03:09,133 --> 00:03:11,167
I can only be his spiritual support.

59
00:03:11,167 --> 00:03:13,633
After all, these are medical professional things,

60
00:03:13,633 --> 00:03:15,300
so you should deal with them carefully.

61
00:03:16,133 --> 00:03:17,333
He is your fan.

62
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:18,300
You must be more effective

63
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,333
than I told him in person.

64
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,533
Don’t mention it.

65
00:03:21,533 --> 00:03:23,833
Since I choose to make this matter public,

66
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:25,567
I want to help others.

67
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,833
Thank you so much.

68
00:03:28,767 --> 00:03:30,600
Hello everyone, I’m Jay.

69
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,500
I came to interview someone in his house today.

70
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,567
Let’s welcome the star today.

71
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:35,500
He’s also the host of the house, Raccoon!

72
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,433
Hi guys, I’m Raccoon.

73
00:03:37,433 --> 00:03:38,300
My channel usually introduces

74
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,633
sexy hot men’s photo book.

75
00:03:39,633 --> 00:03:41,767
Or anything related to sexuality.

76
00:03:41,767 --> 00:03:43,067
But today is a special day.

77
00:03:43,067 --> 00:03:45,300
Raccoon brings us a semi-biography.

78
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,267
The name is Treasure Box in the see.

79
00:03:47,267 --> 00:03:50,233
A story about your mom?

80
00:03:50,233 --> 00:03:53,233
Actually, the treasure box, well,

81
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,867
represents my mom.

82
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:57,267
It’s somehow a sad story.

83
00:03:57,267 --> 00:04:01,267
Even I didn’t dare to discuss this matter before.

84
00:04:01,267 --> 00:04:03,500
I may even cry when I mention my mother.

85
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,667
Is that so? But I wonder if

86
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:07,300
the treasure chest in the sea refers to mom

87
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,100
as a metaphor.

88
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,467
Yes it is.

89
00:04:10,467 --> 00:04:12,767
But to me, also,

90
00:04:12,767 --> 00:04:16,000
it’s a pretty practical thing.

91
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,300
When I was 10 years old, my mother was

92
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,200
sentenced to terminal cancer by the doctor.

93
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,600
We’ve done everything we should do,

94
00:04:36,533 --> 00:04:39,767
Today is my birthday and the day

95
00:04:39,767 --> 00:04:42,733
my mother left this world.

96
00:04:42,733 --> 00:04:44,900
I used to hate my birthday.

97
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,467
I also hate Mother ‘s Day.

98
00:04:46,467 --> 00:04:49,000
Because these days remind me

99
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,533
that my mother is gone.

100
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:52,000
But from now on.

101
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,033
I will make today the most romantic day

102
00:04:53,033 --> 00:04:56,033
for me and my mother.

103
00:04:56,633 --> 00:05:00,100
Life is actually a number,

104
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,900
and she did not leave until

105
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,533
the end of her life.

106
00:05:04,533 --> 00:05:07,367
Isn’t it a kind of love for me?

107
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:10,833
How can I complain about this day?

108
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:13,033
I should cherish it more.

109
00:05:13,033 --> 00:05:14,533
Happy birthday to me.

110
00:05:15,933 --> 00:05:16,933
Raccoon Chao.

111
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:19,300
Fuck. You just gave me a shock.

112
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,600
What are you so focusing on?

113
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,067
Posting.

114
00:05:22,433 --> 00:05:23,667
What’s this?

115
00:05:23,667 --> 00:05:26,000
Well, open it.

116
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:28,833
Are you insane, Kangaroo?

117
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:31,100
You put the lit candle in the paper bag?

118
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,567
Happy Birthday to you.

119
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,533
Happy Birthday to you.

120
00:05:35,533 --> 00:05:36,833
A surprise for you.

121
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:38,200
A shock for me.

122
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,533
You are such a troublemaker.

123
00:05:39,533 --> 00:05:41,600
It’s dangerous!

124
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,033
Feel it with your heart.

125
00:05:43,033 --> 00:05:46,067
You know it’s not easy to put it in after lighting the fire.

126
00:05:46,067 --> 00:05:47,867
Silly babe.

127
00:05:47,867 --> 00:05:48,933
Make wishes.

128
00:05:48,933 --> 00:05:50,767
Fine.

129
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,033
The first one…

130
00:05:52,033 --> 00:05:53,567
I hope Kangaroo won’t set a fire now.

131
00:05:53,567 --> 00:05:55,833
I don wanna pay for the tragedy.

132
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,367
Don’t waste a wish!

133
00:05:59,033 --> 00:06:00,367
The second one…

134
00:06:00,367 --> 00:06:03,967
I hope Kangaroo won’t set a fire in my house.

135
00:06:03,967 --> 00:06:06,533
Shit. Again?

136
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:09,633
Third one.

137
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,467
Happy Birthday, Raccoon.

138
00:06:17,533 --> 00:06:19,467
Babe, do you remember

139
00:06:19,467 --> 00:06:22,400
this is the place where we had our first daytime date?

140
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,200
Sure.

141
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,733
This is the place where you secretly

142
00:06:24,733 --> 00:06:26,633
kissed me when we took a selfie.

143
00:06:26,633 --> 00:06:28,400
Secretly?

144
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,267
You don’t take the initiative yourself. I ‘ll take the initiative, okay?

145
00:06:31,267 --> 00:06:34,000
But I ‘m very proactive in bed.

146
00:06:36,067 --> 00:06:38,267
My goodness.

147
00:06:38,267 --> 00:06:40,633
You won’t be ashamed to say these words now.

148
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:42,167
Bad influence from you.

149
00:06:43,933 --> 00:06:46,067
Just let the cake go.

150
00:06:46,067 --> 00:06:47,167
What?

151
00:06:47,167 --> 00:06:49,800
I picked it with my love.

152
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,800
We should eat bananas, not this cake.

153
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,100
You are so dirty.

154
00:06:55,533 --> 00:06:58,767
Don’t waste it, have one bite.

155
00:06:58,767 --> 00:07:01,900
Then we can go home to enjoy the bananas.

156
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,867
Eat. Just eat.

157
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,467
Careful.

158
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,533
Have you chosen the movie?

159
00:07:22,533 --> 00:07:24,067
So hard to choose.

160
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,233
Or let’s watch One Day again, okay?

161
00:07:27,233 --> 00:07:29,533
Again?

162
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:32,767
Why not?

163
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,533
That is good but…

164
00:07:35,533 --> 00:07:38,500
I can memorize the plot.

165
00:07:39,933 --> 00:07:42,600
But the new film doesn ‘t look interesting.

166
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:48,500
Something sexy?

167
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,467
Such as?

168
00:07:50,467 --> 00:07:53,000
Dark Universe.

169
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,567
There are so many porn videos on the APP

170
00:07:55,567 --> 00:07:58,867
that are suitable for watching before sex.

171
00:07:58,867 --> 00:08:01,200
Want to mess around before drinking?

172
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,400
Too soon.

173
00:08:03,033 --> 00:08:06,400
Fine,

174
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,833
I get it.

175
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:12,267
How about Weekend?

176
00:08:12,267 --> 00:08:13,667
Gosh.

177
00:08:15,467 --> 00:08:18,267
One of the best movies on my list

178
00:08:18,267 --> 00:08:19,600
is becoming a handy choice.

179
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,167
I won’t stop reviewing them.

180
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:24,500
Why don’t you review my lips?

181
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,367
That’s all?

182
00:08:30,867 --> 00:08:32,100
That’s all.

183
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,900
PG-13.

184
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,767
As to the x-rate…

185
00:08:35,767 --> 00:08:36,933
Maybe later.

186
00:08:38,067 --> 00:08:39,200
I want it now.

187
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,400
No!

188
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,700
I want to see a movie.

189
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,867
Whatever.

190
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,167
I told you to check Dark Universe.

191
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,900
Available on TV?

192
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,933
Of course.

193
00:08:49,367 --> 00:08:50,633
Go left.

194
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,100
Good.

195
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:56,267
Yeah.

196
00:08:56,267 --> 00:08:58,200
More!

197
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,700
No one tickles while watching a movie.

198
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,800
Where?

199
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,067
I’m good.

200
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:27,467
Baby.

201
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:29,633
Have you booked the tickets for

202
00:09:29,633 --> 00:09:30,700
the aquarium we are going to visit?

203
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,600
Yeah. It’s done.

204
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,200
Things should be done in advance.

205
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:37,867
You are a wise man.

206
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:44,700
Are those aquariums all similar?

207
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,400
Maybe aquariums are boring.

208
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,067
Listen.

209
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:50,067
Toshima sunshine aquarium

210
00:09:50,067 --> 00:09:53,567
takes sky oasis as the design concept.

211
00:09:53,567 --> 00:09:57,133
Look at the penguins swimming on top of us,

212
00:09:57,133 --> 00:10:00,367
just like penguins swimming in the sky.

213
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:02,667
And Kamogawa aquarium.

214
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:04,833
You can see the sea directly from there.

215
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:05,800
I got more.

216
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,833
Tsuruoka aquarium.

217
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:10,367
There are more than 50 kinds of jellyfish in that aquarium.

218
00:10:10,367 --> 00:10:12,067
They are all distinctive.

219
00:10:13,267 --> 00:10:14,633
Sounds cool.

220
00:10:14,633 --> 00:10:16,567
I know. Right?

221
00:10:16,567 --> 00:10:18,267
I didn’t notice that our first trip will be an aquarium tour.

222
00:10:18,267 --> 00:10:21,300
Yeah! Aquarium tour!

223
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,067
We are so different from regular visitors.

224
00:10:23,067 --> 00:10:26,667
Don’t talk like there are only aquariums.

225
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,600
Those freaking roller coaster

226
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,533
are still on the list.

227
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,533
I almost forgot about them.

228
00:10:37,467 --> 00:10:41,967
We can ride on the safer facilities.

229
00:10:41,967 --> 00:10:43,033
Only the safer ones.

230
00:10:44,667 --> 00:10:45,900
What?

231
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,200
You chicken out?

232
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,767
An aircraft can crash.

233
00:10:50,767 --> 00:10:53,167
Roller coasters are the same.

234
00:10:53,167 --> 00:10:54,800
It might stuck in the air.

235
00:10:55,633 --> 00:10:59,067
I’m tall, but I’m also afraid of heights.

236
00:10:59,067 --> 00:11:01,433
You are afraid of dying

237
00:11:01,433 --> 00:11:03,967
or being alone?

238
00:11:05,067 --> 00:11:09,700
Maybe the latter.

239
00:11:10,733 --> 00:11:12,267
Silly.

240
00:11:12,267 --> 00:11:14,433
I will be with you.

241
00:11:14,433 --> 00:11:18,100
On the plane,

242
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,167
you just hold my hand.

243
00:11:20,733 --> 00:11:22,733
On the roller coaster,

244
00:11:22,733 --> 00:11:24,933
you shout out my name.

245
00:11:24,933 --> 00:11:30,000
Anything bad happens,

246
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,100
I’m always there for you.

247
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,467
Really?

248
00:11:34,867 --> 00:11:38,333
Raccoon Chao.

249
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,767
Miss Lin.

250
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,100
How are you?

251
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,933
Don’t worry about me anymore.

252
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,433
I have grown up safely.

253
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:55,300
I ‘m not alone now.

254
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:02,733
It’s just a pity that you are not with me

255
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,300
all the way.

256
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,167
I will always remember you.

257
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,800
I remember the image of you riding a bicycle.

258
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:21,967
I remember the smell of the pencil you bought for me.

259
00:13:23,733 --> 00:13:28,333
I remember the moment we chatted in the kitchen.

260
00:13:36,633 --> 00:13:38,133
Good night.

261
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,367
Happy Birthday to me.

262
00:14:24,933 --> 00:14:28,033
You are so slow, Raccoon!

263
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,033
I didn ‘t expect that I had to help you

264
00:14:30,033 --> 00:14:31,567
prepare your luggage.

265
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:37,100
Done.

266
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:40,833
I just paid you for that.

267
00:14:42,167 --> 00:14:43,867
Lame move!

268
00:14:46,233 --> 00:14:50,400
Well. Let me ask you something.

269
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,133
Hold on.

270
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:55,000
I have a feeling that you are asking

271
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,933
about the Sleeping God.

272
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:02,300
Why are you so smart? I just want to ask you this.

273
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,633
I know enough about you.

274
00:15:04,633 --> 00:15:06,100
I know what you want to ask.

275
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,000
What do you want to ask this time?

276
00:15:09,733 --> 00:15:11,933
Why did your mother worship Western culture so much

277
00:15:11,933 --> 00:15:15,833
and use Greek mythology as a bedtime story for you?

278
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,767
What?

279
00:15:17,767 --> 00:15:19,367
What?

280
00:15:19,367 --> 00:15:21,100
I lived in NanFangAo.

281
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,533
A country area.

282
00:15:22,533 --> 00:15:25,100
So, I only deserved local mythology?

283
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:28,433
That’s not what I meant.

284
00:15:28,433 --> 00:15:30,333
I’m curious.

285
00:15:31,267 --> 00:15:34,800
My mother was a school teacher before she

286
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,400
moved back to deal with the illness.

287
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,633
She taught Western literature.

288
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:41,133
She liked to share Greek myths

289
00:15:41,133 --> 00:15:43,800
with students in class.

290
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,433
When she got home, she told me

291
00:15:47,433 --> 00:15:51,167
the Greek myth that she told the students.

292
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:54,467
But Greek mythology is very complex

293
00:15:54,467 --> 00:15:57,900
and full of strange relationships.

294
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,467
Just like lives.

295
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:04,433
My mom loved imperfection.

296
00:16:04,433 --> 00:16:06,900
She did not like the high-moral gods.

297
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,533
She thinks that Gods are like mortals,

298
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:12,833
has all kinds of emotions and will encounter difficulties.

299
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,033
When my mother told me this story,

300
00:16:17,033 --> 00:16:18,600
she was teaching me what the world

301
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,633
really is.

302
00:16:21,133 --> 00:16:22,767
She prepared me to

303
00:16:22,767 --> 00:16:24,967
face the real world.

304
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,233
Your ability to tell stories should be

305
00:16:28,233 --> 00:16:30,633
inherited from your mother.

306
00:16:30,633 --> 00:16:33,167
Otherwise, you can’t write down a story

307
00:16:33,167 --> 00:16:37,933
like Treasure Box in the sea.

308
00:16:37,933 --> 00:16:40,167
My babe is a lovely observer.

309
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:41,667
Kiss kiss.

310
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,667
That’s enough.

311
00:16:43,667 --> 00:16:45,533
Enough.

312
00:16:45,533 --> 00:16:46,733
How about you save your energy

313
00:16:46,733 --> 00:16:49,200
to pack your own luggage?

314
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,100
After kissing you, I ‘m exhausted.

315
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,833
-Raccoon!
-I’m going to sleep. Good night.

316
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,767
Get up, Raccoon!

317
00:16:55,767 --> 00:16:56,467
It’s the medicine talking.

318
00:16:56,467 --> 00:16:57,700
I’m tired. Night.

319
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,333
Medicine talking?

320
00:17:01,033 --> 00:17:02,433
Let me squeeze your nipple.

321
00:17:03,067 --> 00:17:05,666
I’m going to sleep now.

322
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:06,699
Here.

323
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,667
Stop it.

324
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,467
Somebody help!

325
00:17:19,467 --> 00:17:20,567
Turn around.

326
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,733
Let me squeeze your nipple.

327
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,467
I’m home. You okay, mom?

328
00:18:44,467 --> 00:18:45,833
Darling.

329
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:49,000
The fried shrimp cake you love is on the table.

330
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,433
And other things you like.

331
00:18:51,433 --> 00:18:54,600
You can microwave them.

332
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,767
I ate my dinner at the aunt’s.

333
00:18:57,767 --> 00:18:59,667
Did you eat everything at her house?

334
00:18:59,667 --> 00:19:01,467
Did you behave?

335
00:19:01,467 --> 00:19:04,600
She is a strict person who might hit me.

336
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,833
I behaved myself.

337
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,233
Don’t be picky about food

338
00:19:08,233 --> 00:19:12,067
so you can grow tall and strong. Okay?

339
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:12,933
Okay.

340
00:19:12,933 --> 00:19:15,133
Mom, I’m going to take a shower first

341
00:19:15,133 --> 00:19:17,400
and then write my homework.

342
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,500
Good night.

343
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,533
Mom, good night.
