1
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,600
Have you ever heard the story of mermaids?

2
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,233
Mermaids become humans and go ashore.

3
00:00:19,233 --> 00:00:21,967
They can also go return to the sea.

4
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,767
I think your mom just go back to the sea.

5
00:00:26,767 --> 00:00:28,667
She might be a mermaid.

6
00:00:29,733 --> 00:00:32,633
Let’s wrap up all the memories about mom.

7
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:34,267
we put them into the treasure box.

8
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:35,900
Then we buried it into the sea.

9
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,400
Ok?

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,400
Someday when you want the memories back.

11
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,967
I will help you to find the treasure box.

12
00:00:47,533 --> 00:00:49,167
Good boy.

13
00:00:49,167 --> 00:00:53,567
It’s all right.

14
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,600
It was your birthday.

15
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,800
That’s why you hate her so much, right?

16
00:01:47,933 --> 00:01:50,867
You know why she left you, right?

17
00:01:53,267 --> 00:01:54,867
You can figure it out.

18
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,867
Illness is torturing.

19
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:03,733
You can understand now.

20
00:02:07,067 --> 00:02:09,867
After she considered a lot,

21
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:13,200
she made a really really

22
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,233
hurtful decision for you.

23
00:02:18,267 --> 00:02:20,867
It doesn’t mean she didn’t love you,

24
00:02:22,733 --> 00:02:26,333
or you didn’t deserve her love.

25
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:32,933
I don’t remember she loved me.

26
00:02:34,633 --> 00:02:36,833
You do remember, the image

27
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:39,167
she stepped on the paddle of the bicycle

28
00:02:39,167 --> 00:02:41,933
and you also remember

29
00:02:41,933 --> 00:02:44,500
the sound of her slippers grinding the ground

30
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,133
while she took you home.

31
00:02:49,033 --> 00:02:51,767
You do remember the smell of

32
00:02:52,433 --> 00:02:54,600
the pencil box stashed in the closet.

33
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:59,467
You do remember the image of

34
00:02:59,467 --> 00:03:01,067
she had a chat with you in the kitchen

35
00:03:01,067 --> 00:03:02,867
and the shiny stone

36
00:03:02,867 --> 00:03:04,567
on her jacket is dazzling.

37
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,600
If you don’t remember them all,

38
00:03:08,567 --> 00:03:13,200
They might not be thought of ever again.

39
00:03:19,467 --> 00:03:21,767
Recently there’s a cool AI function

40
00:03:21,767 --> 00:03:24,267
to make still photos

41
00:03:26,867 --> 00:03:29,900
into realistic motion clips.

42
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,300
Your memories can be reappeared.

43
00:03:33,267 --> 00:03:37,267
The deceased can come back to life in a digital world.

44
00:03:39,867 --> 00:03:41,600
I heard about a news.

45
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,233
A father misses his daughter

46
00:03:44,233 --> 00:03:46,333
who died of a disease.

47
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,700
So he trains the AI with only

48
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,300
three sentences from her voice message.

49
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,667
The AI finally works as a talking model.

50
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,567
The AI talks just like his daughter.

51
00:04:04,967 --> 00:04:06,700
He replaces the voice with the default

52
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,667
cell phone assistant.

53
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,300
So he can talk to his daughter

54
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,633
by using the phone.

55
00:04:13,633 --> 00:04:15,367
The daughter’s life has been prolonged.

56
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:19,966
Just like a resurrection.

57
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:22,567
Do you like the magic?

58
00:04:24,433 --> 00:04:26,267
Sure.

59
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:29,533
But I don’t have a picture of us.

60
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,867
I don’t remember her voice either.

61
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:37,633
I don’t even have any basic ingredients.

62
00:04:41,233 --> 00:04:45,267
People don’t die for real.

63
00:04:45,267 --> 00:04:48,500
You actually is an extension of her life.

64
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:51,167
Right?

65
00:04:54,533 --> 00:04:58,867
I wanna see her again so bad.

66
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:03,800
So many things I wanna say to her.

67
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,000
But she had been gone for so long.

68
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,400
No matter how we make efforts,

69
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,000
it just doesn’t help.

70
00:05:16,867 --> 00:05:18,467
Raccoon Chao.

71
00:05:23,467 --> 00:05:29,733
(Raccoon)

72
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,800
Raccoon.

73
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,733
Raccoon, where are you?

74
00:05:44,733 --> 00:05:46,967
I’m not Raccoon.

75
00:05:50,467 --> 00:05:51,267
Then who are you?

76
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:52,700
I’m dolphin.

77
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,500
I call you for Raccoon.

78
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,467
He’s okay.

79
00:05:57,467 --> 00:06:00,700
He’s in his hometown, Nan-Fang’Ao.

80
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,067
I think you should come over.

81
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,933
I’m not the one

82
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:07,867
who he really needs now.

83
00:06:09,133 --> 00:06:11,367
I’m sorry, you are?

84
00:06:11,367 --> 00:06:12,867
Dolphin.

85
00:06:12,867 --> 00:06:15,700
I’m his old friend.

86
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,567
I’m really sorry.

87
00:06:17,567 --> 00:06:19,600
It’s been a while that we lose contact.

88
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,400
I thought he might be better lately.

89
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,800
However his condition is getting worse.

90
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:28,167
Can you tell me

91
00:06:28,167 --> 00:06:30,300
everything about Raccoon?

92
00:06:32,533 --> 00:06:35,033
Why would he become like this?

93
00:06:36,233 --> 00:06:39,533
That’s no big deal.

94
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:43,200
All he needs is a trustworthy friend.

95
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,867
don’t have to worry.

96
00:06:44,867 --> 00:06:46,567
I’ll take care of him,

97
00:06:46,567 --> 00:06:48,333
while you come to Nan-Fang’Ao.

98
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,900
Ok, please wait for me.

99
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,533
I’ll come to you.

100
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:05,733
Raccoon Chao.

101
00:07:25,167 --> 00:07:27,300
Please don’t be disappeared again.

102
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,667
Today is my birthday.

103
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:43,500
Will you wish me good and happy?

104
00:07:52,433 --> 00:07:54,733
I’ll make three wishes.

105
00:07:56,533 --> 00:07:58,467
The first one…

106
00:07:58,467 --> 00:08:01,600
I want Kangaroo to stop crying for me.

107
00:08:04,033 --> 00:08:06,000
The second one…

108
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,167
I want to retrieve

109
00:08:09,167 --> 00:08:11,800
memories about my mom.

110
00:08:13,933 --> 00:08:15,567
And the third one…

111
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:24,900
Can you feel it? My wish?

112
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,400
Raccoon…

113
00:08:59,367 --> 00:09:02,800
Every time I talk to you about your mother,

114
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,267
you refuse to share.

115
00:09:07,433 --> 00:09:09,900
Will you change your mind

116
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,867
and talk to me about that?

117
00:09:16,367 --> 00:09:20,267
Every time you mention my mother,

118
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,200
I will hear the sound of the waves.

119
00:09:32,933 --> 00:09:34,433
Do you know why?

120
00:09:40,433 --> 00:09:43,067
Because the last time I saw my mother

121
00:09:43,067 --> 00:09:44,667
was at the seaside.

122
00:09:45,567 --> 00:09:47,767
People dragged her out of the sea.

123
00:09:48,433 --> 00:09:50,567
I was too terrified to

124
00:09:50,567 --> 00:09:53,500
see her face for the very last time.

125
00:09:55,033 --> 00:09:56,933
I couldn’t handle that.

126
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,967
My mom had a cancer.

127
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:04,200
We did everything we could.

128
00:10:06,533 --> 00:10:08,867
But the conditions were still bad.

129
00:10:12,167 --> 00:10:14,600
I went home from school

130
00:10:23,267 --> 00:10:25,300
at the night before my mother left.

131
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,167
I found her preparing

132
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:32,833
preparing the food

133
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:35,300
that I loved most.

134
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,233
Fried shrimp cake and fish soup.

135
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,433
She asked me to microwave them.

136
00:10:47,133 --> 00:10:50,300
But I had my dinner at my aunt’s.

137
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,133
So I just left them there.

138
00:10:54,733 --> 00:10:57,833
I went back to my room

139
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,667
after a few talks.

140
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,267
Until the next morning.

141
00:11:04,233 --> 00:11:05,967
My dad called me and

142
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,667
tell me my mom was missing.

143
00:11:10,667 --> 00:11:12,467
He wanted me to stay at home.

144
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,800
Maybe my mom would come back any minute.

145
00:11:24,867 --> 00:11:27,500
But I finally got the information

146
00:11:34,267 --> 00:11:35,800
that my mom killed herself.

147
00:11:38,167 --> 00:11:39,433
You know what?

148
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,633
Actually, I was really upset at that time.

149
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,867
Why did she leave without even

150
00:11:49,867 --> 00:11:52,033
saying the last word to me?

151
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,333
I was really upset.

152
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,533
Why did she leave me alone?

153
00:12:11,133 --> 00:12:14,400
I think it was on my

154
00:12:19,567 --> 00:12:21,433
ten-year-old birthday

155
00:12:21,433 --> 00:12:23,500
that she committed suicide.

156
00:12:25,367 --> 00:12:33,200
Dolphin started to be with me

157
00:12:33,733 --> 00:12:35,867
from that time on.

158
00:12:35,867 --> 00:12:37,633
He tried so hard to make me better.

159
00:12:56,933 --> 00:12:58,533
Well…

160
00:13:00,033 --> 00:13:02,400
I think I’m really lucky.

161
00:13:04,233 --> 00:13:07,700
When I don’t know how to tell others about my past,

162
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:11,167
there are always new friends around.

163
00:13:22,367 --> 00:13:25,167
But none of them are real.

164
00:13:25,167 --> 00:13:26,500
Raccoon…

165
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,367
I’m the only one real.

166
00:13:34,267 --> 00:13:36,267
I didn’t fabricate them.

167
00:13:40,667 --> 00:13:43,467
they are part of me, aren’t they?

168
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,800
In your dream,

169
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,500
everything can be real.

170
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,567
But they belong to your dreams.

171
00:14:00,467 --> 00:14:02,233
they are bogus.

172
00:14:03,933 --> 00:14:07,300
I am the one who really is by your side.

173
00:14:08,133 --> 00:14:10,467
But I’m afraid that even you will lie to me.

174
00:14:11,867 --> 00:14:13,933
Like my ex boyfriend.

175
00:14:13,933 --> 00:14:16,267
He used sweet talks to

176
00:14:16,267 --> 00:14:19,133
calm me down

177
00:14:19,133 --> 00:14:21,267
to be a rebound.

178
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,200
Once I found the truth.

179
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,767
I became rebellious.

180
00:14:26,767 --> 00:14:28,133
Then he decided to toss me away.

181
00:14:30,167 --> 00:14:33,800
After all, I was a child

182
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,467
got abandoned by his mother.

183
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,633
I don’t deserve to be loved.

184
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,500
I think that’s why I love you.

185
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:01,633
Because she abandoned you.

186
00:15:05,233 --> 00:15:07,467
I can give you the love you need.

187
00:15:20,367 --> 00:15:22,500
I only told you

188
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,167
my mom died young, right?

189
00:15:27,367 --> 00:15:29,133
But I’ve never filled in the details.

190
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,433
Hmm…

191
00:15:36,967 --> 00:15:39,400
My mother ran away from home with my brother

192
00:15:40,633 --> 00:15:42,633
when I was in kindergarten.

193
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,633
She told me

194
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:53,167
to behave

195
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,700
do not cry.

196
00:16:00,267 --> 00:16:02,367
So that my dad wouldn’t find out.

197
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,300
I did what she told me to do.

198
00:16:08,433 --> 00:16:11,133
But…

199
00:16:14,633 --> 00:16:17,033
She died of liver cancer in the

200
00:16:19,633 --> 00:16:21,567
summer vacation when I was 15 years old.

201
00:16:31,133 --> 00:16:32,767
So, twice.

202
00:16:34,633 --> 00:16:36,567
She left me twice.

203
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,433
Even though I know

204
00:16:47,433 --> 00:16:49,433
I can’t fix your problems.

205
00:16:52,067 --> 00:16:54,833
I’ll still try my best to

206
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,900
stay by your side.

207
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,267
Aren‘t you afraid that my symptoms are getting worse?

208
00:17:02,067 --> 00:17:03,733
I’m afraid.

209
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,233
But in the meantime,

210
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,500
all I can do is love you more.

211
00:17:15,767 --> 00:17:17,633
While I love you,

212
00:17:25,032 --> 00:17:26,932
the child in my mind can be also cured.

213
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,100
So you can completely rely on me.

214
00:17:35,933 --> 00:17:38,833
And I will completely rely on you

215
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:41,167
as well.

216
00:17:41,167 --> 00:17:42,633
Okay?

217
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:48,167
Let us…

218
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,133
Let us…

219
00:17:54,133 --> 00:17:55,800
walk through our shadows.

220
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,100
Although it’s full of fragments,

221
00:18:07,033 --> 00:18:09,200
I will do my best to

222
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,267
protect you from getting hurt.

223
00:18:31,133 --> 00:18:32,567
Mr. Raccoon,

224
00:18:32,567 --> 00:18:34,100
is the pressure okay?

225
00:18:34,733 --> 00:18:36,300
Yeah.

226
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,600
But…

227
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,300
The foam got into my eyes.

228
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,633
Really? Let me see.

229
00:18:41,633 --> 00:18:43,200
I don’t see anything wrong.

230
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,267
Just kidding.

231
00:18:44,267 --> 00:18:46,000
You are so easy to trick, silly.

232
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,100
Who is silly.

233
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,900
Don’t think that you can do whatever you want on your birthday today.

234
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,233
All of a sudden?

235
00:18:55,233 --> 00:18:56,900
I think you may need one.

236
00:18:57,867 --> 00:19:00,000
I need more than one, gee!

237
00:19:01,067 --> 00:19:02,433
Thanks, babe.

238
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:05,033
Well, keep cleaning my hair.

239
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:10,033
Have you ever thought that

240
00:19:10,033 --> 00:19:11,900
the Sleeping God is not lonely?

241
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,333
Wait.

242
00:19:14,033 --> 00:19:15,300
You got new inspiration

243
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,167
to overthrow the story?

244
00:19:17,867 --> 00:19:22,433
Maybe the shepherd can’t help

245
00:19:22,433 --> 00:19:24,367
looking at the Sleeping God.

246
00:19:24,367 --> 00:19:26,167
So the magic

247
00:19:26,167 --> 00:19:28,800
can help him to keep looking.

248
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,167
Nonsense.

249
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:33,533
I somehow wondered

250
00:19:33,533 --> 00:19:35,967
there’s a metaphor here.

251
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:39,100
I mean

252
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:42,133
I love you. You are not alone.

253
00:19:42,533 --> 00:19:44,200
Oh…

254
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,800
Oh?

255
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,167
Need more?

256
00:19:47,167 --> 00:19:50,167
I just said a magic spell.

257
00:19:50,167 --> 00:19:51,833
The spell that keeps me awake?

258
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,267
Why’s that?

259
00:19:53,667 --> 00:19:55,133
because…

260
00:19:55,133 --> 00:19:56,767
I’m too happy to sleep.

261
00:21:29,185 --> 00:21:31,885
What’s wrong with you, Kangaroo?

262
00:21:31,885 --> 00:21:33,685
You put the lit candle in the paper bag.

263
00:21:33,685 --> 00:21:35,952
Happy birthday to you.

264
00:21:35,952 --> 00:21:37,985
Happy birthday to you.

265
00:21:37,985 --> 00:21:41,718
I will be with you

266
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:43,418
if something bad is happening.

267
00:21:43,418 --> 00:21:47,618
I just feel sorry that

268
00:21:47,618 --> 00:21:48,552
I don’t know you earlier.

269
00:21:48,552 --> 00:21:50,418
Do you usually read Greek mythology?

270
00:21:50,418 --> 00:21:51,385
Nope.

271
00:21:51,385 --> 00:21:54,085
But I saw someone

272
00:21:54,085 --> 00:21:57,085
came out of the sea and cast a spell on me.

273
00:21:57,085 --> 00:21:58,852
Made me fall in love with you.

274
00:22:50,396 --> 00:22:52,030
Babe.

275
00:22:53,833 --> 00:22:57,999
Do you still remember the story of the Sleeping God and the shepherd?

276
00:22:59,304 --> 00:23:01,537
Shall I tell you again?

277
00:23:02,334 --> 00:23:04,767
In Greek mythology,

278
00:23:04,767 --> 00:23:08,300
Nyx, the goddess of the night, has twins.

279
00:23:09,434 --> 00:23:14,300
They are Hypnos, the god of sleep, and Thanatos, the god of death.

280
00:23:14,923 --> 00:23:16,456
Hypnos loves in a cave

281
00:23:16,456 --> 00:23:19,423
that the sunshine could never cast.

282
00:23:21,334 --> 00:23:23,101
He planted poppies

283
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:24,668
and all the plants that help people sleep

284
00:23:24,668 --> 00:23:27,634
in front of the cave.

285
00:23:28,892 --> 00:23:30,526
Although Hypnos

286
00:23:30,526 --> 00:23:32,792
looks dark and treacherous,

287
00:23:32,792 --> 00:23:34,859
he is actually a god with strong magic power

288
00:23:34,859 --> 00:23:38,085
and gentle and kind personality.

289
00:23:38,085 --> 00:23:39,885
The wings on his back

290
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:41,485
take him to fly over

291
00:23:41,485 --> 00:23:43,852
the mountains and the sea every night.

292
00:23:43,852 --> 00:23:46,252
He brings sleep to all things in the world,

293
00:23:47,056 --> 00:23:49,423
and the wind vibrating

294
00:23:49,423 --> 00:23:52,389
from his wings hides a gentle power.

295
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:55,723
No matter how hard you work every day,

296
00:23:55,723 --> 00:23:58,323
when the gust of wind blows,

297
00:23:58,323 --> 00:24:01,923
you can untie the deep lock.

298
00:24:01,923 --> 00:24:03,523
When we fall asleep,

299
00:24:03,523 --> 00:24:06,989
we can relieve the pressure and pain of life,

300
00:24:06,989 --> 00:24:09,889
and then wake up to face a brand new day.

301
00:24:10,974 --> 00:24:13,007
Later, the Sleeping God Hypnos

302
00:24:13,007 --> 00:24:14,574
fells in love with the young and handsome

303
00:24:14,574 --> 00:24:17,007
shepherd, Endymion.

304
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,407
He likes the shepherd too much.

305
00:24:19,407 --> 00:24:20,773
In order to look at the beauty

306
00:24:20,773 --> 00:24:24,073
of the shepherd all the time,

307
00:24:24,073 --> 00:24:26,140
Hypnos gave Endymion the ability

308
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:29,207
to sleep with his eyes open.

309
00:24:29,207 --> 00:24:31,073
Even if he falls asleep,

310
00:24:31,073 --> 00:24:32,207
he can open his beautiful eyes

311
00:24:32,207 --> 00:24:35,007
which are clear as a lake

312
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:37,573
to please the Sleeping God.

313
00:24:43,496 --> 00:24:46,130
Mommy hopes you sleep well every day.

314
00:24:47,033 --> 00:24:50,033
But if you must open your eyes to please the Sleeping God

315
00:24:50,537 --> 00:24:53,937
Let me draw false eyes on your eyelids, okay?
