(Search Result: Raccoon0802 not found)

4
00:02:39,433 --> 00:02:54,833
(Do you want to unblock Kangaroo Dai?)

5
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:22,667
(Kangaroo: Can we meet and make it clear?)

6
00:03:28,567 --> 00:03:36,400
(Kangaroo: I’m really sorry that I hurt you.)

7
00:05:53,567 --> 00:05:54,500
Yes?

8
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,200
Are…

9
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,867
Are you Raccoon?

10
00:05:57,867 --> 00:06:00,400
Yeah, hello.

11
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,700
You are so handsome in the flesh.

12
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,167
I love your reels so bad.

13
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:08,233
I love you for not showing off your figure

14
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:11,133
or not playing as stupid influencer.

15
00:06:11,133 --> 00:06:13,700
I love you for being yourself.

16
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,267
I can see the innocence in you.

17
00:06:17,567 --> 00:06:18,967
Thanks.

18
00:06:18,967 --> 00:06:20,167
Um…

19
00:06:20,167 --> 00:06:21,100
Is filmmaking

20
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,433
taking a lot of effort?

21
00:06:23,433 --> 00:06:26,067
You have to buy a fancy camera,

22
00:06:26,067 --> 00:06:28,233
or a nice microphone or something?

23
00:06:28,233 --> 00:06:29,167
Can you teach me

24
00:06:29,167 --> 00:06:31,300
how to be a popular guy like you?

25
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,800
Every time I read your post

26
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,967
I can hear a voice inside my mind.

27
00:06:34,967 --> 00:06:36,133
I just want to be like you.

28
00:06:36,133 --> 00:06:37,167
Such a nice-looking guy

29
00:06:37,167 --> 00:06:38,867
who are loved by everyone.

30
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,900
I’m just a lucky guy

31
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,233
who happens to be loved

32
00:06:49,233 --> 00:06:50,600
by people on the internet.

33
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,767
Who told you that?

34
00:06:51,767 --> 00:06:54,300
Good-looking is an advantage to be an influencer.

35
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,267
You have innate advantages.

36
00:06:56,267 --> 00:06:57,633
You don’t need to do weird things for effect.

37
00:06:57,633 --> 00:07:00,033
People follow you spontaneously.

38
00:07:00,033 --> 00:07:03,367
I bet that many people confess their love for you.

39
00:07:03,367 --> 00:07:06,200
You got no romance issue at all,

40
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,733
right?

41
00:07:07,733 --> 00:07:09,433
Most people like me

42
00:07:09,433 --> 00:07:11,667
for the Raccoon identity.

43
00:07:11,667 --> 00:07:13,100
They do not LOVE me for real.

44
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,967
They just like the image

45
00:07:16,967 --> 00:07:19,800
that a guy smile in front of the camera

46
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,933
when the food is great.

47
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,600
And

48
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,500
they like to have

49
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,133
different positive Raccoon to see in their cell phones

50
00:07:30,133 --> 00:07:32,233
However, that’s not me.

51
00:07:32,233 --> 00:07:34,633
Being Raccoon is not my everything.

52
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,400
You are still liked by many people.

53
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,100
Sometimes being liked

54
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,500
is also terrifying.

55
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,333
Once

56
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:50,167
I got a message.

57
00:07:50,167 --> 00:07:53,933
Someone sent me a pic of me eating ice.

58
00:07:53,933 --> 00:07:55,867
The picture was took without asking me.

59
00:07:55,867 --> 00:07:57,733
I had no clue.

60
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,733
I found it offended.

61
00:08:02,767 --> 00:08:06,633
It’s like someone staring at me all the time.

62
00:08:06,633 --> 00:08:09,633
Recording everything I do.

63
00:08:09,633 --> 00:08:12,533
I just can’t figure out who

64
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,367
are taking pictures of me right now.

65
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,300
Or even more…

66
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,967
some people would gaze at me.

67
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:23,267
But instead of talking to me,

68
00:08:24,733 --> 00:08:28,200
they compare me with the photos in their phones.

69
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,367
and even whisper to each other in front of me.

70
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:36,299
I would rather they confront me.

71
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:38,666
That’s even better.

72
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:41,500
Better than the social torturing.

73
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,567
Can you understand?

74
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,333
I got cheated a lot.

75
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,767
You?

76
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:53,233
I got cheated twice by guys in relationships.

77
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:54,633
Does that count?

78
00:09:04,533 --> 00:09:06,967
Usually you wait here

79
00:09:06,967 --> 00:09:08,500
or you go for a walk

80
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,733
and then come back later?

81
00:09:10,733 --> 00:09:11,800
I go back home and come back here again.

82
00:09:13,067 --> 00:09:14,567
For real?

83
00:09:14,567 --> 00:09:16,033
You just  come and go

84
00:09:16,033 --> 00:09:17,333
in this short time?

85
00:09:18,367 --> 00:09:20,767
I always wait it here.

86
00:09:20,767 --> 00:09:22,533
Until the dryer finishes its job.

87
00:09:22,533 --> 00:09:25,033
And I found it interesting to stay here.

88
00:09:25,033 --> 00:09:27,633
Got a game for myself.

89
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:28,767
A game?

90
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,933
Role playing.

91
00:09:32,933 --> 00:09:35,900
What does that mean?

92
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,667
Look over there.

93
00:09:37,667 --> 00:09:40,200
There are clothes wait for reclaiming.

94
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,233
I would wear them

95
00:09:42,467 --> 00:09:44,100
and assign them different characteristics

96
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,867
which I will play.

97
00:09:46,867 --> 00:09:48,067
You just don’t

98
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:50,700
want to buy new clothes

99
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,833
so you wear them.

100
00:09:53,067 --> 00:09:55,000
It has nothing to do with the money.

101
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,200
I make the clothes alive.

102
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,967
Alive?

103
00:09:58,967 --> 00:10:01,167
Each of them has its specialty.

104
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:03,333
But it still needs someone to wear it.

105
00:10:06,067 --> 00:10:07,700
Look at me.

106
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,800
If we never have a conversation,

107
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,500
you would judge me by my appearance.

108
00:10:14,967 --> 00:10:16,667
That is to say…

109
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:18,067
The clothe.

110
00:10:18,067 --> 00:10:20,167
My face, my body.

111
00:10:20,167 --> 00:10:21,667
And my acting.

112
00:10:21,667 --> 00:10:23,633
All of them construct a whole person.

113
00:10:23,633 --> 00:10:26,833
But you ARE a person.

114
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:29,800
I think you mean “a role.”

115
00:10:31,533 --> 00:10:33,167
You’re right.

116
00:10:33,167 --> 00:10:34,400
A role.

117
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,400
People live

118
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,467
to play different kind of roles.

119
00:10:38,867 --> 00:10:40,800
We played nice kids.

120
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,000
Good students.

121
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,167
Wonderful lovers.

122
00:10:43,167 --> 00:10:44,433
They are characters.

123
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:49,500
Well, since you have been playing the roles,

124
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,967
Why would you

125
00:10:50,967 --> 00:10:53,700
wanna play and create more of them?

126
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,200
I take it as a life-training.

127
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,100
I trained myself to deal with different kind of things.

128
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,567
So it would be much easier for me

129
00:11:00,567 --> 00:11:01,667
to face my real life.

130
00:11:04,133 --> 00:11:07,133
I don’t remember the story exactly.

131
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:08,833
But back to my high school life,

132
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,967
A notorious senior student

133
00:11:10,967 --> 00:11:12,133
ran into my classroom.

134
00:11:12,133 --> 00:11:14,033
He wanted to beat me.

135
00:11:14,033 --> 00:11:16,433
I was skinny,

136
00:11:16,433 --> 00:11:18,033
and I would never win the fight.

137
00:11:18,033 --> 00:11:20,267
So I ran away and hide myself.

138
00:11:20,267 --> 00:11:22,133
One day, it just occurred to me.

139
00:11:22,133 --> 00:11:24,433
If I can’t be brave

140
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:27,600
Then at least I can play like I am.

141
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,300
If my figure is too skinny to compel people,

142
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,067
then I could train myself to be a hunk.

143
00:11:34,167 --> 00:11:36,000
If I’m a well-behaved guy,

144
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,467
I should make myself

145
00:11:37,467 --> 00:11:39,667
look like those douche bags.

146
00:11:39,667 --> 00:11:41,300
So no one dares to provoke me.

147
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,033
Well.

148
00:11:47,033 --> 00:11:51,400
Why didn’t you just tell your family

149
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,100
about the bullying?

150
00:11:56,233 --> 00:11:57,833
Because I don’t have a family.

151
00:12:11,667 --> 00:12:14,100
Makoto: My friend got me an empty room,

152
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,033
so I will live with him.

153
00:12:16,033 --> 00:12:18,433
Makoto: I don't know how to distribute

154
00:12:18,433 --> 00:12:21,067
the furnitures.

155
00:12:21,067 --> 00:12:23,700
Makoto: I don't need them anymore.

156
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,600
Makoto: You can keep them.

157
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,533
Makoto: Do you remember how much

158
00:12:34,533 --> 00:12:37,067
you need me and my

159
00:12:37,067 --> 00:12:39,500
advices before?

160
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,033
Makoto: But you can handle things now.

161
00:12:42,033 --> 00:12:46,333
Makoto: Seems like you don’t need me anymore.

162
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,333
Makoto: So why did I cheat on you?

163
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:51,900
Makoto: All I want is a guy who needs me.

164
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:57,167
Makoto: Still. Thank you for taking care of me for eight years.

165
00:12:57,167 --> 00:12:59,000
Makoto: I’m the one who should be blamed.

166
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Makoto: I did hurt you.

167
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,133
1 2 3

168
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:21,067
Action

169
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:23,100
Listen, I met an idiot.

170
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,367
He occupied the training equipment

171
00:13:24,367 --> 00:13:25,767
and he kept using his phone.

172
00:13:25,767 --> 00:13:27,067
Shit. I got so upset.

173
00:13:27,067 --> 00:13:27,833
You know what?

174
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,433
While he was using his phone,

175
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:30,800
I threw his towel away.

176
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,267
And I started to work out.

177
00:13:32,267 --> 00:13:33,467
He was going to have a fight with me.

178
00:13:33,467 --> 00:13:34,500
You know what I said?

179
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,167
“Fuck you,

180
00:13:36,167 --> 00:13:39,367
go get a room with your phone!”

181
00:13:39,367 --> 00:13:40,967
He just got terrified and fled.

182
00:13:40,967 --> 00:13:42,500
Hilarious.

183
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,100
CUT!

184
00:13:48,033 --> 00:13:49,033
Nice job.

185
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,767
1 2 3 Action

186
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,567
Sir, I’ve finished the report.

187
00:13:59,567 --> 00:14:00,667
I sent it to your mailbox.

188
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:02,200
Please check it out.

189
00:14:06,733 --> 00:14:07,700
Ok. No problem.

190
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,067
I’ll amend it later.

191
00:14:09,067 --> 00:14:10,333
I’ll send it tomorrow morning.

192
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,167
You want it done now?

193
00:14:14,167 --> 00:14:15,700
But I have an appointment today…

194
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,933
Ok. I’m sorry…

195
00:14:18,933 --> 00:14:20,100
I’ll do it now.

196
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,100
OK, 1 2 3, action.

197
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:27,800
Why?

198
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,367
Why did you leave without saying anything?

199
00:14:30,767 --> 00:14:32,967
Is saying goodbye to me so hard for you?

200
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,367
Why did you left me behind?

201
00:14:45,933 --> 00:14:48,700
Why…

202
00:14:51,167 --> 00:14:52,433
Please just tell me.

203
00:14:58,133 --> 00:15:00,333
Is it because

204
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,467
that I look like

205
00:15:02,467 --> 00:15:03,967
a guy who can suffer all of that?

206
00:16:01,367 --> 00:16:02,800
Are you okay?

207
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,400
Stop crying.

208
00:16:22,433 --> 00:16:23,500
However have you been?

209
00:16:29,967 --> 00:16:31,600
Why me?

210
00:16:33,733 --> 00:16:35,300
Why do I got to deal with this every time?

211
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,400
Why…

212
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:42,633
I’m sorry.

213
00:16:48,233 --> 00:16:49,800
It’s all my fault.

214
00:16:51,367 --> 00:16:53,533
Please tell me what’s going on?

215
00:16:59,367 --> 00:17:00,767
He had moved out.

216
00:17:02,633 --> 00:17:04,233
It’s not gonna ever happen again.

217
00:17:06,967 --> 00:17:08,467
Please have faith in me.

218
00:17:16,133 --> 00:17:17,167
Raccoon.

219
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:23,499
I miss you so bad.

220
00:20:06,433 --> 00:20:08,367
Death is not scary.

221
00:20:08,367 --> 00:20:10,300
Life is scary.

222
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:12,567
Are you alright?

223
00:20:12,567 --> 00:20:14,167
Your heartbeat was so loud

224
00:20:14,167 --> 00:20:16,233
that I thought you’re going to die.

225
00:20:16,233 --> 00:20:17,967
I’ve been about this.

226
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,500
The Sleeping God makes everyone asleep.

227
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,667
Everyone can have his happy journey in the dream.

228
00:20:23,667 --> 00:20:25,167
What about the Sleeping God?

229
00:20:25,167 --> 00:20:27,167
Isn’t he lonely?

230
00:20:27,167 --> 00:20:28,567
You’re not sleeping.

231
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:35,633
You want a magic to sleep with open eyes?

232
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,933
Is he a performance artist?

233
00:20:50,933 --> 00:20:52,667
Maybe.

234
00:20:52,667 --> 00:20:55,033
He’s really good.

235
00:20:55,033 --> 00:20:56,800
I can tell what he is acting.

236
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,167
Interesting.

237
00:20:59,867 --> 00:21:01,900
What kind of role did you play?

238
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,733
The one inspired from the suit.

239
00:21:03,733 --> 00:21:06,400
When I got that suit.

240
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,400
I can sense a feeling of integrity.

241
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,533
So I thought about a friend.

242
00:21:10,533 --> 00:21:13,467
His job is a manager.

243
00:21:13,467 --> 00:21:14,733
Manager?

244
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:17,067
He is doing showbiz?

245
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,033
No.

246
00:21:18,033 --> 00:21:20,533
The managers work in a

247
00:21:20,533 --> 00:21:23,700
LGPTQ friendly insurance company.

248
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,367
Sometimes we have misunderstanding

249
00:21:27,367 --> 00:21:30,467
about insurance managers.

250
00:21:30,467 --> 00:21:31,967
Actually their duties are quite diverse.

251
00:21:31,967 --> 00:21:34,733
Not only selling people single insurances

252
00:21:34,733 --> 00:21:37,767
but also selling full-coverage cases.

253
00:21:37,767 --> 00:21:40,467
The managers can bring you

254
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:43,400
different kind of products.

255
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,267
They give us better plans to manage our lives.

256
00:21:46,533 --> 00:21:47,933
Got it.

257
00:21:47,933 --> 00:21:49,233
And you know what?

258
00:21:49,233 --> 00:21:51,833
There are so many cute gays in the company.

259
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:54,500
Always makes me feel so great.

260
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:01,733
Well… you just gave me a huge pause.

261
00:22:01,733 --> 00:22:03,433
Even though we just made it up

262
00:22:03,433 --> 00:22:05,567
I still can feel jealous

263
00:22:05,567 --> 00:22:08,167
when you praise someone.

264
00:22:08,167 --> 00:22:10,333
You just end your last relationship today.

265
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,200
I’m not even mad.

266
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,167
You got jealous now?

267
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:16,233
I’ve ended up over a year.

268
00:22:18,867 --> 00:22:20,767
How long was the lease?

269
00:22:20,767 --> 00:22:23,233
Over a year?

270
00:22:24,667 --> 00:22:27,733
I don’t think so.

271
00:22:27,733 --> 00:22:28,933
I’m telling the truth.

272
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:31,133
Are you sure?

273
00:22:31,133 --> 00:22:31,800
YES.

274
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,400
Really?

275
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,367
I promise.

276
00:22:34,367 --> 00:22:35,767
How do you promise that?
