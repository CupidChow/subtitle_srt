1
00:00:44,467 --> 00:00:46,167
Not sleep yet?

2
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,100
i had a bad dream.

3
00:00:59,467 --> 00:01:00,667
Here.

4
00:01:01,767 --> 00:01:03,767
Your eyes are puffy.

5
00:01:03,767 --> 00:01:07,333
I cried…

6
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:08,600
i dreamt

7
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,533
about you.

8
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,500
And you cried? what for?

9
00:01:21,767 --> 00:01:23,533
Just a bad dream.

10
00:01:24,267 --> 00:01:26,167
When is your next appointment with the therapist？

11
00:01:27,167 --> 00:01:28,600
I got no clue

12
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,900
or I have to check the info on the receipt.

13
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:34,233
Why?

14
00:01:34,233 --> 00:01:36,200
I…

15
00:01:37,933 --> 00:01:38,967
I just…

16
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,467
I just have bad dreams a lot lately.

17
00:01:47,467 --> 00:01:50,233
Want to solve my sleep problems.

18
00:01:50,233 --> 00:01:52,900
I need you to tag along with me

19
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:55,867
What? Are you a kid when you're in love?

20
00:01:56,733 --> 00:01:58,933
You really need someone to be with

21
00:01:58,933 --> 00:02:00,433
even when you drink water or go see a doctor?

22
00:02:00,433 --> 00:02:02,633
Do I need to escort you to

23
00:02:02,633 --> 00:02:04,200
bask in the sun when we are old?

24
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,100
Yeah, I’m a kid, okay?

25
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,567
I need to be accompanied like hell.

26
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:15,633
Is it a yes or a no?

27
00:02:15,633 --> 00:02:19,133
Gotta check out my meds.

28
00:02:19,133 --> 00:02:21,233
I’ll go with you after I finish taking them.

29
00:02:21,233 --> 00:02:22,633
OK?

30
00:02:23,433 --> 00:02:25,567
Go check out for the receipt.

31
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,733
You can do it tomorrow.

32
00:02:27,733 --> 00:02:29,867
The receipt won’t fly away itself.

33
00:02:29,867 --> 00:02:32,133
You didn’t notice the remaining pills?

34
00:02:32,133 --> 00:02:34,900
I still got some left.

35
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,600
That’s fine. Let’s go to sleep.

36
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,433
Raccoon Chao.

37
00:02:38,433 --> 00:02:39,500
What?

38
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,833
Did take your meds?

39
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:50,033
Of course I did.

40
00:02:50,033 --> 00:02:51,700
I did it every day!

41
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,333
So, where did you go?

42
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:54,733
I…

43
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:59,233
My friend just texted me.

44
00:02:59,233 --> 00:03:01,433
We had a chat outside.

45
00:03:01,433 --> 00:03:02,767
It was nothing.

46
00:03:02,767 --> 00:03:03,800
Come on. I’m sorry.

47
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,467
Don’t be mad at me.

48
00:03:05,467 --> 00:03:08,167
It’s ok. You don’t have to apologize to me.

49
00:03:12,733 --> 00:03:14,633
But I will take you to the therapist.

50
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:17,900
I told you I still have my meds.

51
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:21,900
But…

52
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,533
Your episodes are much more serious than I thought.

53
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,733
I need you to go to the clinic.

54
00:03:28,733 --> 00:03:30,633
Just have another check.

55
00:03:30,633 --> 00:03:32,800
It’s nothing to do with chatting with a friend.

56
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,367
Why should I go to the clinic?

57
00:03:34,367 --> 00:03:35,800
Raccoon Chao!

58
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,167
What?

59
00:03:37,167 --> 00:03:39,300
Your friend is not even exist. 

60
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,000
You were the only person there.

61
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,267
You were soliloquizing.

62
00:03:47,933 --> 00:03:49,967
You are out of your mind.

63
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,400
My friend was definitely there.

64
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,333
I’m out of my mind?

65
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,600
I’m out of my mind?

66
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,433
You were the only person in the laundry.

67
00:03:58,433 --> 00:04:01,333
You spoke to no one and my mind is just fine!

68
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:03,267
What are you talking about?

69
00:04:03,267 --> 00:04:05,067
My friend was there.

70
00:04:05,067 --> 00:04:06,500
He was there.

71
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,767
Fine.

72
00:04:08,767 --> 00:04:10,733
Call him right now.

73
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:12,300
Let me comfort him.

74
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,633
Fine.

75
00:04:16,367 --> 00:04:17,733
I can call him.

76
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,600
(Mom)

77
00:04:36,733 --> 00:04:38,500
It’s late.

78
00:04:39,162 --> 00:04:40,862
He should be asleep now.

79
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,867
I wan to be alone and clear my mind.

80
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,000
You were the only person in the laundry.

81
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,967
You were soliloquizing.

82
00:05:10,733 --> 00:05:12,700
Story telling is over.

83
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,367
Still don’t want to sleep?

84
00:05:15,367 --> 00:05:20,867
Or do you want the magic to sleep with open eyes?

85
00:05:22,567 --> 00:05:24,300
Why does it must be

86
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,667
square and intact?

87
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:29,067
It’s special because of the

88
00:05:29,067 --> 00:05:30,400
missing pieces.

89
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,500
Humans are dangerous. Haven’t you learned your lesson?

90
00:05:37,233 --> 00:05:38,867
I was not the only one there.

91
00:05:39,867 --> 00:05:41,533
I was not the only one there.

92
00:05:42,767 --> 00:05:45,300
Why’d you said that?

93
00:05:47,733 --> 00:05:51,067
Why…

94
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:12,300
(Dolphin)

95
00:06:16,567 --> 00:06:31,167
(It’s been a long time, Raccoon.)

96
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:34,667
(Raccoon)

97
00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:37,667
(Who are you? Why do you have my childhood picture?)

98
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:47,500
(I met you when you were a child.)

99
00:06:54,467 --> 00:07:10,567
(Why do you have this one?)

100
00:07:10,567 --> 00:07:18,333
(I don’t even have this. Who the fuck are you?)

101
00:07:21,367 --> 00:07:27,667
(You don’t recognize me? I’m Dolphin.)

102
00:07:27,667 --> 00:07:33,733
(You used to call me Big Bro. I live in Nanfang'ao, too.)

103
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:43,000
(You wanna go out sometime?)

104
00:07:46,500 --> 00:08:01,067
(I’m not there. It’s just a region setting.)

105
00:08:01,067 --> 00:08:18,300
(Don’t be kidding me. You really know me?)

106
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:27,500
(I just can’t remember.)

107
00:08:29,267 --> 00:08:35,667
I’ll celebrate your birthday the day after tomorrow. Come to meet me.)

108
00:08:35,667 --> 00:08:46,800
(Maybe you will remember then.)

109
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,000
Raccoon Chao.

110
00:09:58,567 --> 00:10:00,067
You are…

111
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:02,567
I’m Big Bro. The one who sent you the pictures.

112
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,600
Do you recognize me now?

113
00:10:06,867 --> 00:10:08,733
I think I do…

114
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,200
But I don’t remember any detail.

115
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,567
Human brain is amazing.

116
00:10:13,567 --> 00:10:15,633
Just take a break.

117
00:10:15,633 --> 00:10:17,767
You might recall everything later.

118
00:10:22,233 --> 00:10:23,667
How’s that?

119
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:26,567
Get any better after seeing the ocean?

120
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,300
Every time I go to the aquarium,

121
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,333
I would sit in front of the biggest glass wall.

122
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:33,867
By staring at it and doing nothing,

123
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,700
I can get tranquility.

124
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,600
But it’s different from an aquarium to the ocean.

125
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,933
You can hear waves from the ocean.

126
00:10:46,933 --> 00:10:48,467
I think it’s better.

127
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:51,133
I can’t get better

128
00:10:51,133 --> 00:10:53,333
when I hear the waves.

129
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,667
I would be frustrated.

130
00:10:56,633 --> 00:10:58,233
You won’t be when I’m with you.

131
00:11:01,467 --> 00:11:04,967
so why do you have my childhood pictures?

132
00:11:05,967 --> 00:11:07,233
I just told you.

133
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:09,333
Give your brain a chance to rest.

134
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:10,667
No rush.

135
00:11:11,367 --> 00:11:12,200
Oh…

136
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,067
Do you remember the fried shrimp cake?

137
00:11:13,067 --> 00:11:14,700
The vender you loved when you were little

138
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,800
is now a famous shop right now.

139
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,867
I do remember.

140
00:11:19,867 --> 00:11:24,000
So it is not a vender anymore?

141
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,967
A famous shop, huh?

142
00:11:25,967 --> 00:11:28,833
I remember that your mom hate you for

143
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:31,100
eating too much fried shrimp cake at that time

144
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,167
You would lie down on the floor.

145
00:11:33,167 --> 00:11:34,833
And you would cry and make a big scene.

146
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:37,433
He wouldn’t stop until your mom

147
00:11:37,433 --> 00:11:38,233
give you the permission to buy it.

148
00:11:38,233 --> 00:11:39,800
such a crying baby.

149
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,700
Wanna try the fried shrimp cake later?

150
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,133
Sure, I miss it.

151
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,433
It’s weird that when you were a kid,

152
00:12:42,433 --> 00:12:44,300
you didn’t like to stay at home.

153
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,533
you preferred to come to the beach.

154
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:50,433
You used paper board

155
00:12:50,433 --> 00:12:52,233
to build a funny house

156
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,133
and you always liked to do role playing.

157
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:00,800
Tried to assign who could be the right family members.

158
00:13:04,267 --> 00:13:06,833
I think it’s the same even if you are an adult.

159
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,233
You save money to buy a house.

160
00:13:10,233 --> 00:13:13,100
You find somebody to make a family.

161
00:13:14,633 --> 00:13:18,000
It’s like a formula which you need to be strictly followed.

162
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:20,900
Like it’s a path to having a perfect life.

163
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,933
But…

164
00:13:23,933 --> 00:13:26,900
It’s also boring when you are alone.

165
00:13:28,667 --> 00:13:31,167
After detaching your family,

166
00:13:31,167 --> 00:13:33,000
you could be losing focus.

167
00:13:34,033 --> 00:13:35,567
You alone now?

168
00:13:35,567 --> 00:13:37,300
Not really.

169
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,667
I met a boy who I care about.

170
00:13:42,067 --> 00:13:44,667
But…

171
00:13:44,667 --> 00:13:46,467
Still losing focus?

172
00:13:46,933 --> 00:13:49,833
We. Are not exclusive.

173
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,967
All we have is intimacy.

174
00:13:51,967 --> 00:13:53,933
That’s not what I want.

175
00:13:55,767 --> 00:13:57,333
so what do you want?

176
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:58,667
Have you discussed with him?

177
00:14:03,633 --> 00:14:05,100
I want…

178
00:14:06,733 --> 00:14:07,800
Play with water.

179
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,467
You must get wet

180
00:14:10,467 --> 00:14:12,233
if you come to the beach.

181
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:15,067
Go.

182
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,633
Let‘s play a game about holding breath.

183
00:15:09,633 --> 00:15:10,967
Sure.

184
00:15:10,967 --> 00:15:12,333
1 2 3

185
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,600
Get out!

186
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,033
Stop playing!

187
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:04,367
Get out of the water!

188
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,900
Just get out!

189
00:16:18,367 --> 00:16:20,867
Shut. I was terrified.

190
00:16:21,533 --> 00:16:23,733
What? Worried about me losing you

191
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:24,933
and sinking into the sea?

192
00:16:24,933 --> 00:16:27,400
You’re insane. Don’t do that again.

193
00:16:30,433 --> 00:16:32,300
I was playing with you.

194
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,733
Why so serious?

195
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,133
Because I would be afraid.

196
00:16:36,867 --> 00:16:38,167
Of what?

197
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,200
I’m not a treasure box

198
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,833
I won’t be sinking into the sea.

199
00:16:56,367 --> 00:16:57,700
Raccoon Chao!

200
00:17:05,967 --> 00:17:07,733
Where are you?

201
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,633
(Kangaroo)

202
00:17:15,633 --> 00:17:18,633
(The password is right. I’m in.)

203
00:17:18,633 --> 00:17:24,300
(Kangaroo)

204
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,032
(He is not home. What should I do?)

205
00:17:27,032 --> 00:17:33,933
(Tina)

206
00:17:33,933 --> 00:17:36,800
(Have you searched everywhere?)

207
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:41,567
(Kangaroo)

208
00:17:41,567 --> 00:17:45,067
(Everywhere.)

209
00:17:45,067 --> 00:17:47,767
(Tina)

210
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:51,700
(He had never gone awol.)

211
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:55,600
(He hasn’t reply my message. What happened to you?)

212
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:01,000
(Kangaroo)

213
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,500
(Do you know the therapist thing?)

214
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,567
(Tina)

215
00:18:07,567 --> 00:18:12,067
(Why? Is it serious?)

216
00:18:12,067 --> 00:18:16,433
(Kangaroo)

217
00:18:16,433 --> 00:18:18,200
(Serious now.)

218
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,700
(Kangaroo)

219
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,800
(I’m worried about him. Any place he would go?)

220
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,233
(Tina)

221
00:18:26,233 --> 00:18:28,733
(Let me contact his father. Keep in touch.)

222
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:33,267
(Kangaroo)

223
00:18:33,267 --> 00:18:36,700
(Thanks, Tina.)

224
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,967
Good boy, it’s okay.

225
00:18:58,667 --> 00:19:01,967
You met me just at that time.

226
00:19:02,667 --> 00:19:04,200
You can remember, right?

227
00:19:11,667 --> 00:19:14,267
You can now also remember the

228
00:19:14,267 --> 00:19:15,967
bad dream you had.

229
00:19:18,433 --> 00:19:20,167
A deep deep dream.

230
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,400
About the bottom of the sea.

231
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,467
There’s no sunshine in the bottom of the sea.

232
00:19:32,467 --> 00:19:35,700
And there’s only a secret treasure box there.

233
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:39,733
It’s the only thing can glow in the dark.

234
00:19:40,267 --> 00:19:42,833
Staring and sparkling.

235
00:19:44,067 --> 00:19:45,133
It’s interesting.

236
00:19:45,133 --> 00:19:46,733
You passed the area every time

237
00:19:46,733 --> 00:19:49,067
when you took a bus.

238
00:19:49,067 --> 00:19:52,300
It was like you can see through the sea.

239
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,067
You cried because of

240
00:19:54,767 --> 00:19:57,267
the shine from the treasure box.

241
00:19:57,267 --> 00:19:58,933
It’s just too bright so that your eyes got hurt.

242
00:20:00,167 --> 00:20:04,633
However you just can’t help going back to the area.

243
00:20:04,633 --> 00:20:08,333
Because you felt when your tears dropped,

244
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,833
you left a part of yourself

245
00:20:11,133 --> 00:20:13,767
to stay with the shiny treasure box.

246
00:20:15,233 --> 00:20:18,967
So what is in the box?

247
00:20:29,867 --> 00:20:33,167
It’s the 18th anniversary that you know me.

248
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:46,533
Wanna come with me

249
00:20:46,533 --> 00:20:49,267
to open the treasure box?

250
00:21:59,233 --> 00:22:00,267
You know what?

251
00:22:00,267 --> 00:22:02,733
I was really upset.

252
00:22:02,733 --> 00:22:04,400
You didn’t leave any word to me

253
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,100
before you left.

254
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,733
I was so upset.

255
00:22:07,733 --> 00:22:09,667
How could you left me behind?

256
00:22:09,667 --> 00:22:12,633
The people in your dreams were so real.

257
00:22:12,633 --> 00:22:14,433
But they were still bogus.

258
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:17,700
I was the real one to you.

259
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,867
But I’m afraid of you lying to me.

260
00:22:19,867 --> 00:22:21,367
Like my ex.

261
00:22:21,367 --> 00:22:26,667
My mom abandoned me.

262
00:22:26,667 --> 00:22:28,967
Maybe that’s because I don’t deserve to be treated well.

263
00:22:39,767 --> 00:22:42,233
I want to go to Okinawa.

264
00:22:42,233 --> 00:22:44,033
Okinawa?

265
00:22:44,033 --> 00:22:45,533
Nice place.

266
00:22:45,533 --> 00:22:48,100
I want to eat the food there.

267
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,933
Okinawa onigiri.

268
00:22:50,933 --> 00:22:52,467
Ishigaki Gyu.

269
00:22:52,467 --> 00:22:54,133
Agu pork.

270
00:22:54,133 --> 00:22:56,267
And one thing special.

271
00:22:56,267 --> 00:22:58,533
Red bean sweet ice chips.

272
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,467
You can go to Okinawa to shoot reels.

273
00:23:02,167 --> 00:23:04,033
Full of food in your mind.

274
00:23:04,033 --> 00:23:07,233
I didn’t even get to say my opinions.

275
00:23:07,233 --> 00:23:09,067
Are you a pig?

276
00:23:09,067 --> 00:23:12,967
Okinawa aquarium is nice , too.

277
00:23:12,967 --> 00:23:15,233
Aquariums are everywhere.

278
00:23:15,233 --> 00:23:16,933
It doesn’t have to be Okinawa.

279
00:23:16,933 --> 00:23:17,933
It’s different.

280
00:23:17,933 --> 00:23:20,767
I want to meet cute guys there.

281
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:22,533
I’m done with your face.

282
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,967
Okay.

283
00:23:24,967 --> 00:23:26,533
Done with me, huh?

284
00:23:26,533 --> 00:23:27,767
Just open your dating App.

285
00:23:27,767 --> 00:23:30,633
You can pick anyone you want.

286
00:23:31,933 --> 00:23:35,467
You still use the dating App? While we are together?

287
00:23:35,467 --> 00:23:37,800
What? You cheater?

288
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,467
I’m not the one who are going to use it.

289
00:23:39,467 --> 00:23:40,867
I offered you a solution for

290
00:23:40,867 --> 00:23:43,933
being done with me.

291
00:23:43,933 --> 00:23:45,200
And you must know one thing.

292
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,000
There’s an awesome function on the App.

293
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,567
You can set your region

294
00:23:48,567 --> 00:23:50,267
to anywhere you like.

295
00:23:50,267 --> 00:23:54,233
Then you can check out the local boys.

296
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:56,133
Busted!

297
00:23:56,133 --> 00:23:58,433
You picked a lot of guys on that, right?

298
00:23:58,433 --> 00:24:02,400
I did, but I’ve never met them.

299
00:24:03,633 --> 00:24:05,833
Another function for you.

300
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:09,233
If you are really in the region you’ve set.

301
00:24:09,233 --> 00:24:11,567
You can check out the activity label.

302
00:24:11,567 --> 00:24:14,133
There are many events showed on the list.

303
00:24:14,133 --> 00:24:16,467
Some of it would even give you a link

304
00:24:16,467 --> 00:24:18,633
to purchase the tickets.

305
00:24:18,633 --> 00:24:20,500
Isn’t that convenient?

306
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,133
Sounds great!

307
00:24:22,133 --> 00:24:24,200
I’m going to book the flight ticket.

308
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,567
Can’t wait to meet cute guys on that App.

309
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:29,133
You mean guys in Okinawa?

310
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,600
Let me check out my day off plan.

311
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,433
What? It’s none of your business.

312
00:24:34,433 --> 00:24:36,267
I want to go alone.

313
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:38,067
Say that again, Raccoon Chao!

314
00:24:38,667 --> 00:24:40,567
Okay, okay. I’m joking!
