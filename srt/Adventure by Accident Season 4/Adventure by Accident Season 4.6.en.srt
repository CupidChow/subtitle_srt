1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:01,970
(6th night of their trip in Nepal)

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,310
Gosh, I'm tired.

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,640
(The Four Brothers returned
to their lodging.)

4
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:10,080
(Tough off-road experiences
in the morning)

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,080
(Swimming in freezing water
in the cold in the evening)

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,020
(Shivering)

7
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:18,390
(They dragged their exhausted bodies
to a photo studio in Nepal.)

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,630
We're taking a short break.

9
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:21,630
(Knocked out due to their tough schedule)

10
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:22,760
(Staring)

11
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,760
(Chuckling)

12
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,500
They look like dead batteries.

13
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:31,170
(Among the brothers
who are sprawled out like dead batteries)

14
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:34,740
(Rummaging alone in the corner)

15
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,680
Since I'm leaving earlier than you,

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,510
I brought gifts from Korea.

17
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:42,610
What?

18
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:44,120
They got up automatically.

19
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:50,260
(The youngest was scheduled
to leave earlier than them.)

20
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,260
(Before they knew it,
his last night arrived.)

21
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:55,830
I brought these.

22
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,260
(Feeling sad to say goodbye,
he brought presents for the brothers.)

23
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,300
Feel free to stay in bed
when I give it to you.

24
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,130
- I'll start with Kian84.
- Yes?

25
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,940
I brought Kian84's favorite.

26
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:05,740
(Ta-da)

27
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,270
(Fancy whiskey)

28
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:09,610
- It's alcohol.
- What's that?

29
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:12,710
I bought you an expensive one
so that you don't get a headache.

30
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,650
(He looked for whiskey
everywhere in the world.)

31
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,220
(Kian, aged 84 years)

32
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,790
Kian84 doesn't drink...

33
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,220
a lot of alcohol.

34
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,590
I thought that he found comfort
in alcohol.

35
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,530
It's a customized gift.

36
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:30,730
Whenever he feels tired...

37
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,330
or needs comfort,
I hope that he can enjoy it...

38
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:36,000
during the rest of their trip.

39
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,440
- Oh, my.
- This is for you.

40
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,000
You bought an expensive one.

41
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:42,140
I felt so thankful to him.

42
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:46,740
Actually, you know the thing that
people take out from their pockets...

43
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,780
in movies.

44
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,780
I bought it for him.

45
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:51,720
But it got delivered on the day
I was leaving Korea.

46
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,590
I'll give it to you
during our shoot in the studio.

47
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,750
That's a bummer.

48
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,960
- So I brought it today.
- Really?

49
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,860
- Yes.
- Seriously?

50
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,130
That's why he was rummaging a moment ago.

51
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,130
(Arrived on a plane...)

52
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,060
You can keep alcohol inside.

53
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,530
- Gosh, thank you.
- Goodness.

54
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,770
- It's a little late.
- That's amazing.

55
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:09,800
Thank you.

56
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,900
I'll drink everything from this,
including soju.

57
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,810
- This is great.
- I should've given it to him a while ago.

58
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,480
(Precious)

59
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,110
(Satisfied)

60
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,850
- This is for Si Eon.
- What is it?

61
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,750
- These are poles.
- The ones you used yesterday?

62
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,850
(Trekking poles)

63
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,350
Surprisingly, Si Eon and I have
many hobbies in common.

64
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,090
Riding the motorcycle, camping...

65
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,290
- Right.
- That's right.

66
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,790
They have similar tastes.

67
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,960
So he probably has almost everything
that I'd like to give him.

68
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,370
But I thought that
he wouldn't have packed...

69
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:43,100
- trekking poles.
- They make hiking very comfortable.

70
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,840
Si Eon, these are very comfortable.

71
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,340
You ended up bringing them.

72
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,140
I deliberately showed...

73
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,480
those trekking poles to Si Eon.

74
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,750
To see if he was interested in them.

75
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,650
I wanted to see if he liked them.

76
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,950
- Aren't they nice?
- Yes.

77
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,520
I casually brought it up,
and he liked them.

78
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,990
I hope that during the remaining trip,

79
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,790
these poles will be
another set of legs for Si Eon.

80
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,560
I gave them to him
hoping that they'll help him.

81
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,600
- These are nice.
- And so...

82
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:19,540
I wanted you to use them
in case the remaining trip is hard.

83
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,040
(Feeling proud)

84
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:24,840
I got something special for Pani Bottle.

85
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,780
What do you think this is?

86
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,550
Shampoo for hair loss?

87
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,950
- "Shampoo for hair loss?"
- Goodness.

88
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,050
Isn't it shampoo for hair loss?

89
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,480
While traveling...

90
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,450
with you guys for a while,

91
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,320
I figured out what you like.

92
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,360
Pani Bottle is very curious,

93
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:44,300
and he likes trying various things.

94
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,300
So I brought a Swiss Army knife.

95
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:51,170
Right. He likes knives.

96
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,240
- That's right.
- I still have that.

97
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,380
- It includes all types of tools.
- That's amazing.

98
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,410
There are so many.

99
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,210
- Thank you.
- And...

100
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,610
there's one more.

101
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,280
Why does Pani Bottle get two presents?

102
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,220
I wanted to get this for Pani Bottle.

103
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,890
I thought that he'd love it.

104
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,090
I removed the packaging
in order to test it.

105
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:14,190
- What?
- What is it?

106
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:16,530
These are binoculars.

107
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,760
What makes them special is
that they're night-vision binoculars.

108
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,470
(His jaw drops.)

109
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,530
That's incredible.

110
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,730
I've really wanted these.

111
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,400
You can record videos with them.

112
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,540
- They record videos?
- When you shoot for YouTube...

113
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,010
He runs a YouTube channel.

114
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,180
(A present dedicated to Pani Bottle)

115
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:34,180
- That's amazing.
- Wait, after doing this...

116
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,810
I've wanted to buy them for a while.

117
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,120
That's an awesome present.

118
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,520
- Shall we test them outside?
- How do they work?

119
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,720
- Let's take a look outside.
- This is the general mode.

120
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,120
(Everyone goes outside
to check the function.)

121
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,460
- I'm curious about this.
- Unbelievable.

122
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,490
When you do this...

123
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:51,730
When you switch to IR mode,

124
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,130
the night vision turns on.

125
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,700
- The color is different.
- That's fascinating.

126
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:59,070
Do you see the dark spot over there?

127
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,270
- Adjust...
- Can you zoom in?

128
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,880
You can't zoom in, but you can film it.

129
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,840
- It's 4K.
- It's 4K?

130
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,050
- When you press record...
- How is 4K possible?

131
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,050
(A raspy voice)

132
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,850
- It's recording.
- That's amazing.

133
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,790
Let's say hello.

134
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:14,820
(Let's say hello to the camera.)

135
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,860
- Hello, Dex.
- Wait, you're too close.

136
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,920
Si Eon.

137
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,760
Si Eon, you look like you're in "Gonjiam."

138
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,700
- It looks like "Gonjiam."
- That's scary.

139
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,060
It looks like "Gonjiam."

140
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,960
- That's frightening.
- Right?

141
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,970
That's creepy.

142
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,630
Pani Bottle looks scary too.

143
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:33,440
- This is my son.
- It looks like "Gonjiam."

144
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,870
- The ghost of Nepal.
- They look so scary.

145
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,010
(A wandering baby ghost in Nepal)

146
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:41,080
This is how you turn off the recording.

147
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,350
Do you want to turn off the lights
and test it inside?

148
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,150
This is real infrared.

149
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,150
I'll turn off the lights. Come inside.

150
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,920
- Hide.
- I'll hide underneath.

151
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,490
- That's fun, you know.
- It's fun.

152
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:56,830
Why is it making me nervous?

153
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:02,200
This house has been abandoned
for 30 years.

154
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,270
He's definitely an actor.

155
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,440
I'll look and see if there are ghosts.

156
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,240
- "Gonjuiam."
- "Gonjuiam."

157
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,880
It's Kian84. He died 30 years ago!

158
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,090
- Why would you kill me?
- Why does he keep killing him?

159
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,490
Pani Bottle's nose is stuffed!

160
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:28,560
No!

161
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,360
(And then there were none.)

162
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,330
I knew what was going on,
but it was still scary.

163
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,770
- This is amazing.
- Can you see?

164
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,100
Don't turn on the lights. I'll show you.

165
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,000
I didn't expect them to have so much fun.

166
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,310
Take a look, Si Eon.

167
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,610
It's very short. It's like a movie. Watch.

168
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:45,010
I'll look for myself.

169
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,440
- "Gonjuiam 2."
- "Gonjuiam 2."

170
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,850
The sequel already came out?

171
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,710
It's because the first one was a hit.

172
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:50,980
I knew it.

173
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:55,150
This is where Actor Lee Si Eon...

174
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:56,920
tragically lost his life...

175
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,320
in an accident.

176
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,590
- What is he doing?
- Why did you kill him?

177
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:04,160
After hearing that
Lee Si Eon appears here often,

178
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,830
I came here to boost my view count.

179
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,470
- The story is interesting.
- My gosh.

180
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,070
(Screaming)

181
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,170
That really startled me.

182
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,670
You startled me.

183
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,640
(Achieving enlightenment through joy)

184
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,710
- Goodness.
- "Achieving enlightenment through joy."

185
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,880
- What?
- He was really scary.

186
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:31,020
I know that he's acting,
but it's still scary.

187
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,520
I knew it, but I was scared.

188
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,390
(Growling)

189
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,830
(The audience's response
makes his acting more passionate.)

190
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:40,000
The four guys are having a lot of fun
with a night-vision device.

191
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:41,870
- That was really scary.
- Dex.

192
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:43,330
It was really frightening.

193
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,400
- Amazing.
- I'm satisfied.

194
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,440
It's the first time in my life that
someone figured out my exact taste.

195
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,240
He was more exact than anyone else.

196
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:53,110
It made me shudder as soon as I saw it.

197
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:54,810
We're close,

198
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,850
but not close enough to be best friends.

199
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,380
I need to get permission
from Dex's manager to say that.

200
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,480
That's not true.

201
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,520
(We're best friends.)

202
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,620
I thought,
"How did he know that I like this?"

203
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:05,820
It gave me goosebumps.

204
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:08,530
I got very excited
while playing with the device.

205
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:10,830
Right, I've never seen him happier.

206
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,060
(Beaming)

207
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,170
- Gosh, thank you.
- Here's the manual.

208
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,910
(Reaching)

209
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:25,380
- I bought this T-shirt for you.
- A T-shirt?

210
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:28,110
- I bought it in the Himalayas.
- Gosh.

211
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,620
- I have nothing to give him.
- Thank you.

212
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,720
What's this? Oh, my.

213
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,090
What's this?

214
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,120
There's a drawing.

215
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,260
(The one and only portrait of Dex)

216
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,260
This is amazing.

217
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,320
(The one and only portrait of Dex)

218
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,030
- That's really amazing.
- Oh, my.

219
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,290
When did he draw that?

220
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:45,300
- Where are you going?
- It's a secret.

221
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,030
- Where are you going?
- It's a secret.

222
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:49,170
He kept wanting to go somewhere.

223
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:55,640
(As Sherpa84,
he carries his bag on his head.)

224
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,940
(In front of a beautiful view)

225
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,810
(Flopping down)

226
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,710
(My goodness)

227
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:07,390
(He takes out the watercolor.)

228
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:10,050
I brought some watercolors with me.

229
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,060
Usually, he travels very light.

230
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,360
I made a drawing for Si Eon.

231
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,860
I also made one for Pani Bottle
on his birthday.

232
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,330
I made a drawing for everyone but Dex.

233
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,730
Before he left,

234
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:24,440
I wanted to make one for him.
That's why I went to draw.

235
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,410
(Instead of ordinary drawing paper)

236
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,310
(A T-shirt that he bought
in the Himalayas)

237
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,540
Was it at that time?

238
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,550
What?

239
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,950
(After getting changed on the street)

240
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,780
I didn't know about that.

241
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,290
He knows how to recycle.

242
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,990
(When he met Dex
with 100 percent energy...)

243
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:46,220
(The T-shirt was peeking out.)

244
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,460
Oh, that T-shirt.

245
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:51,530
(In a place marked with memories
and sweat from the journey,)

246
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,530
(he draws Dex,
a part of his precious memories.)

247
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:57,000
Gosh, he picked a good photo of me.

248
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,640
(He even selected it carefully.)

249
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,740
(He must have been very tired
that morning.)

250
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:03,710
(Mixing each color)

251
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,740
He only has five colors.

252
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,850
(Concentrating on the painting
without moving an inch)

253
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,020
That's a painting in itself.
It looks beautiful.

254
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:13,650
My leg feels numb.

255
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,720
(Groaning)

256
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,990
- That's touching.
- Gosh.

257
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:22,060
- He paints well.
- His drawings are nice.

258
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,590
(The painting is being completed.)

259
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:27,930
(He presses down hard to write his name.)

260
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:28,930
"Dex."

261
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,040
"To Adventure by Accident."

262
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:32,640
He looks handsome.

263
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,070
(He took 2 hours
to finish Dex's portrait.)

264
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,110
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

265
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:36,740
It's a family treasure.

266
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,180
- That's amazing.
- Thank you.

267
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,550
- It looks incredible.
- It looks amazing.

268
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,020
It's too nice to wear it.

269
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,380
"The closing trip
of Adventure by Accident?"

270
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,250
That makes me sad.

271
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:51,360
It's a message to Dex...

272
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,290
and to myself.

273
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,130
Actually,

274
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,360
every time Dex came to shoot
Adventure by Accident,

275
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,230
he vomited and got an upset stomach.

276
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,500
(He often suffered
due to his fragile intestines.)

277
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,470
- He went through a lot.
- He never showed how tough it was.

278
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,740
However, he was willing to come back.

279
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,610
(However, he was willing to come back.)

280
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:13,240
Dex probably thinks
that this is his last trip.

281
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,250
(Dex came in a hurry
since it's his last trip.)

282
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,180
(They finally became complete
when the youngest joined them.)

283
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,620
I'm thankful that he joined us.

284
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,050
I'll remember this for a long time.

285
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,150
(The Four Brothers' closing trip)

286
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,560
I'm happy that he came.

287
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,820
(The Four Brothers' closing trip)

288
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:29,030
I didn't expect him to give me a present.

289
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:32,460
I never imagined that it'd be a painting.

290
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:36,030
I remember feeling very envious
in Madagascar.

291
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:37,640
(Ta-da)

292
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,540
- That was really...
- I envy him.

293
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,570
This is very...

294
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,540
I thought,

295
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,480
"It should have been my birthday instead."

296
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,340
"That present should have been mine."

297
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:49,410
Even back then,

298
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,350
I didn't envy him
for getting a painting...

299
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,490
by a famous cartoonist in Korea.

300
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,790
Giving a present made with so much love...

301
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:59,160
to someone else...

302
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,460
That's what made me envious.

303
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:06,300
I'm happy to receive such a present.

304
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:10,870
To receive care and love from Kian84.

305
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:13,600
On the T-shirt,

306
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:17,680
there was a message
that said this was our last trip.

307
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,610
The date was written on it,

308
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,880
and that felt so meaningful.

309
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,520
I think the time we had together
is captured in the picture.

310
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,590
Looking at the picture,

311
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,450
well,

312
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:33,060
this trip could be the last one together,

313
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,990
and I thought I could remember it...

314
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,490
with the picture being its symbol.

315
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,930
I feel so thankful, and I am happy.

316
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:42,230
(I'm thankful to Kian84.)

317
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,570
So, I...

318
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:45,970
What is that?

319
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,340
This is so nice.

320
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,610
This is awesome.

321
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,910
- Gosh.
- Oh, my.

322
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:57,080
I should have drawn a nicer picture.

323
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,180
- This is good enough.
- The paint didn't soak well.

324
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:02,350
I will surely hang this at home.

325
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,190
It's really nice.

326
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:05,360
It's great.

327
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,560
It's his last day here.
How about the last drink?

328
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,060
- Shall we have the last drink?
- Let's have the last drink.

329
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,800
- Let's drink fast.
- Dex, I'll open this.

330
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,700
I gave it to you. Do as you like.

331
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,730
It's yours.

332
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,870
I'll cut this for you.

333
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:20,500
Do you want to try?

334
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,810
- All right.
- You can do it, right?

335
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:23,340
It's easy. Cut this in half.

336
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,340
Here you go.

337
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,650
That knife was very sharp.

338
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:29,050
It goes deep into the fruit.

339
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,520
(It tastes even better.)

340
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,690
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

341
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,650
It should taste good with whiskey.

342
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,490
This is what I'm curious about.

343
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,360
Which gift makes you the happiest?

344
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:42,730
A picture or something practical.

345
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,360
- Right.
- Something I really need.

346
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,560
But to gift something practical,

347
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,060
you need to have a good knowledge
of the person you're giving it to.

348
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,030
I forgot the fact that I said I wanted it.

349
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,440
- I'm glad to hear that.
- I was so happy when I got it.

350
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,040
When I was serving in the military,
I was dispatched abroad.

351
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:56,910
I marched in the desert,

352
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:59,810
put up a tent in the middle of the desert,
and slept in it.

353
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,010
When I was a junior soldier,
things were so tough for me.

354
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,180
When I was lying in the desert,

355
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:07,520
looking at the night sky
with the night-vision device and focusing,

356
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,560
numerous stars in the universe...

357
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,290
unfolded before my eyes.

358
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,660
I was so shocked and thought that...

359
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,660
(Thinking over)

360
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,730
when I meet someone I want to marry,

361
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,930
I'd show her the stars with
a night-vision device and propose to her.

362
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,800
That's so romantic.

363
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,970
Oh, my.

364
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,500
- So Pani Bottle is the one?
- That's...

365
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,570
Goodness.

366
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,540
(What's going on between you?)

367
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,940
- No.
- Wait.

368
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,380
I'm not ready.

369
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:36,180
(Dex, I'm not ready yet.)

370
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:38,180
- Shall I move my seat?
- Come on.

371
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,680
This is how they do it.

372
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,950
(The best friends are united
by a night-vision device.)

373
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:43,050
It means that I gave him...

374
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,020
my favorite item, a night-vision device.

375
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,420
(Pleased to see them)

376
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:50,630
Where do we take the plane?
Where do we stop over?

377
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,500
I guess we have a direct flight to China.

378
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,870
It's either diesel or gasoline, isn't it?

379
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,070
Gosh.

380
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,970
He never stops.

381
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,440
(Very satisfied)

382
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,940
He's smiling.

383
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,470
(Fueling up laughter by force
with his dad joke)

384
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,310
You like these kinds of jokes.

385
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:08,150
You're smiling now, unconsciously.

386
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,610
It's because I'm annoyed.

387
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:11,120
You'll show it when you're annoyed.

388
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,220
He's half-annoyed and half-satisfied.

389
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,290
The fact I'm laughing at your joke
makes me annoyed.

390
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,550
I'm kind of immersed.

391
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,760
- Yes, and...
- I imagined it.

392
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:24,630
tonight, it's just like us.

393
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,400
- Don't you think so?
- You're right.

394
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,530
When a day is over,
we talk over a drink like this.

395
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:35,140
(They used to share laughs and talks
on many nights.)

396
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:39,110
Kian84 ate chicken, sitting on the ground.

397
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:42,280
(A part of "being like us")

398
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:45,780
So this trip delights me more than ever.

399
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,920
Really?

400
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,150
We have a lid on the toilet,
in the first place.

401
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,120
It was much nicer than I thought.

402
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,860
During this trip,
Si Eon was so awesome to me.

403
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,700
He never got angry. Not even once.

404
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,730
- That's right.
- Right.

405
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:02,300
- He looked gentle from beginning to end.
- Come on.

406
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:04,200
He really is a grown-up.

407
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,440
He really feels like a grown-up,
an elder brother.

408
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,640
Among these three, I like you the most.

409
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,480
(Among these three, I like you the most.)

410
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,180
I like you the most, Dex.

411
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,610
(Competitive)

412
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:16,950
They're nice together.

413
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,520
(Things get very sweet.)

414
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:23,120
It was the last day of my trip.

415
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,720
And the last night...

416
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:28,090
was spent between ourselves
in a small, simple,

417
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,830
ordinary,

418
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,930
and complete manner.
That felt more meaningful.

419
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,430
And it was nice to be with them.

420
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:40,570
(India, 2 years ago)

421
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:41,570
That was his first trip with us.

422
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,070
It's already been two years?

423
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,070
(Glad to see him)

424
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,950
(He met Kian84 while feeling nervous.)

425
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,120
(The Kim brothers
didn't even know their first names.)

426
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,950
(Is your name Kim Ki An?)

427
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,590
(Is your name Kim Dex, then?)

428
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,960
(With the other brother,)

429
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,020
(he laughed awkwardly.)

430
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,990
- I felt awkward in the beginning.
- Right.

431
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,660
(Dex was a strange man
before he became the youngest member.)

432
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,770
Gosh, it's suffocating.

433
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,100
They're turning heads.

434
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,600
(It was hard to make eye contact,)

435
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,000
(but soon they hit it off.)

436
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,210
They hit it off so well.

437
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:18,710
(With his energy...)

438
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,840
(and sweet charms)

439
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,750
- He's sweet.
- Isn't that Alex?

440
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,450
- Hi.
- I missed you.

441
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:30,020
(Snuggling into his brothers' arms)

442
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:34,790
(Having nice talks,)

443
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:37,800
(he became the youngest member
the brothers want to walk with.)

444
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,030
On Adventure by Accident,

445
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,770
Dex is an indispensable axis.

446
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:47,170
He's the ace among us.

447
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,410
(Enjoying the thrill...)

448
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:52,440
(in a relaxed manner)

449
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:55,050
(Welcoming challenges...)

450
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:57,350
(with passion)

451
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,920
(As he took the lead
in the adventure all the time,)

452
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,350
(he received wholehearted support.)

453
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,490
- Let's go, Dex!
- He's the cheerleader captain.

454
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,430
(The youngest became
the pride of the brothers.)

455
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,590
Look how they feel proud.

456
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,900
(Our youngest...)

457
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,300
(is from the Navy special forces.)

458
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,030
(The eldest feels proud.)

459
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,640
I just feel that I was so happy...

460
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,670
in the moment.

461
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:24,980
(In every moment together)

462
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:30,850
(Crying)

463
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:32,480
(Surprised)

464
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,420
Gosh.

465
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,760
I don't know. Why am I like this?

466
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:48,070
(Although he tries to hold back,)

467
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,600
(tears keep streaming down.)

468
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,070
I've never seen him crying like a child.

469
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,010
Thinking those moments
will never come back,

470
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,650
I choked up.

471
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,180
I felt so sorry that it was the last night
the four of us were spending together.

472
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,180
Right.

473
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:11,390
Strangely, what stays in my memory...

474
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,990
is not anything else, but...

475
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,230
In the car, on our way back from camping,

476
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:18,030
how I listened to the lame jokes.

477
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,060
That's the final thing I remember.

478
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,230
(We're in Nepal now.)

479
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,470
(Can't we make 4 arms in groups of 2?)

480
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:25,470
(What?)

481
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,540
(Which country has
the largest number of gangsters?)

482
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,570
(Chile?)

483
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,440
(Glaring)

484
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,680
Those vibes and atmosphere.

485
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:38,750
I just feel that I hate it, but I love it.

486
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:41,550
That's the charm of them.

487
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:42,720
And before I knew it,

488
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:46,660
I got immersed,
as if getting wet in a drizzle.

489
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:48,460
If you get immersed
by those trivial moments,

490
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,830
- there's no way out.
- Right.

491
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:53,060
- Dex, thank you for your effort.
- Thank you for your effort.

492
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,500
Thank you for your effort, Dex.

493
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,600
- Good luck on the rest of our trip!
- Thank you.

494
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,730
- All right!
- All right!

495
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,300
When did you actually go there?

496
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,900
It was about six years ago.

497
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,940
Their conversation doesn't end.

498
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:03,940
(Feeling sorry, they keep talking.)

499
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,240
- Have a good night.
- Good night.

500
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,340
(They go to bed at dawn.)

501
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:09,810
- Dex.
- What?

502
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,650
- See you tomorrow.
- Yes. See you tomorrow.

503
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,620
- Good night.
- Good night.

504
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,050
(As they say good night tenderly,)

505
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,520
(the night in Nepal deepens.)

506
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,860
- Who is it?
- What's that?

507
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,130
- It's me.
- It's Dex.

508
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:28,170
(Dex can't sleep,
so he turns the light on.)

509
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,540
(Gazing)

510
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:38,180
(The youngest looks at
the sleeping brothers for a long time.)

511
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:41,380
I guess I had mixed feelings.

512
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,150
I just, alone,

513
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,850
got sentimental.

514
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,120
(Soothing his heart
by drinking alone at night)

515
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,550
He can't go to sleep.

516
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:56,360
(After packing the T-shirt he was given,)

517
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:02,630
(the Four Brothers all go to sleep.)

518
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:08,040
(The day breaks.)

519
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:11,240
Let's get out. We need to leave.

520
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:14,410
- We had a good time.
- Dex, put on your backpack quickly.

521
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:17,250
Put on your backpack now.

522
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,820
(Put on your backpack now
so that you can come with us.)

523
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,390
Si Eon, have a nice trip.

524
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:24,020
(Hugging to say goodbye)

525
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,020
Have a nice trip.

526
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,290
(Biting)

527
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:27,320
We need to go.

528
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,560
Have a nice trip.

529
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,060
- Thank you for your work.
- Right.

530
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:33,100
Have a nice trip, Pani Bottle. Okay?

531
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:36,400
It feels like leaving someone
who's getting discharged.

532
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,170
I really felt sorry.

533
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:43,710
Kian84.

534
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,980
Wait. How come it feels so hard to leave?

535
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:50,180
How come I hate to stand up now?

536
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:53,450
(Kian84 feels sorry
that it's their last trip together.)

537
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,520
Kian84, here's your hat.

538
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,650
(The youngest takes care of him
until the end.)

539
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,960
It feels like Dex keeps shoving us out.

540
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,960
No.

541
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:03,330
- Gosh.
- Go now, Si Eon.

542
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,800
Go away.

543
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,960
(Kidding)

544
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,760
- Bye.
- Have a good trip.

545
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,000
(Seeing off with love)

546
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:10,530
(Holding hands)

547
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:11,700
Oh, my.

548
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:13,100
Let's take a picture.

549
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,100
All right.

550
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:16,540
- Stand in front of me.
- Si Eon.

551
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:18,340
Ask them,
so all four of us can be in the photo.

552
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,710
Si Eon always took photos of us.

553
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,150
- So he isn't in many photos.
- Of course not.

554
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,980
- Over there.
- Excuse me, sir.

555
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:24,980
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

556
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,480
- Could you take a photo of us?
- Yes.

557
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:30,090
I rarely take photos of myself.

558
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:32,290
- But I had to be in that one.
- We needed a photo...

559
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:33,290
of the four of us.

560
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:38,600
(The last record...)

561
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:42,130
(of the Four Brothers traveling in Nepal)

562
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:48,240
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

563
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,940
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

564
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:50,940
Go on.

565
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:54,240
- You can go in, Dex.
- No, it's okay.

566
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:57,250
- Don't come any farther than this.
- That's right.

567
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:00,120
- You don't have to walk us out.
- I already came this far.

568
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,620
If you step outside these gates,
you have to travel with us.

569
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,890
This is my house, so you should leave now.

570
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,860
It's not like
we won't see each other forever.

571
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,390
- You're right.
- See you in Seoul.

572
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:09,690
You did a good job.

573
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,730
- Good luck.
- Have a safe trip.

574
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:15,170
- Let's go.
- Si Eon.

575
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:17,370
- Go.
- You have to go.

576
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:18,700
(The traveler struggles
with the house owner.)

577
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,470
You two are like
elementary school students.

578
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:23,470
Bye.

579
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,510
Have a safe trip.

580
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,610
- Have a safe trip.
- We got this.

581
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:29,550
- Bye. See you.
- See you in Korea.

582
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,680
Bye.

583
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:33,750
(Saying goodbye to his older brothers)

584
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,190
Did you turn around
and dive into the pool, shouting with joy?

585
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,190
"I'm free."

586
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:40,690
(Hurray! Dex's adventure is over.)

587
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:42,860
(Feeling sad his journey ended first)

588
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:43,990
He seems sad...

589
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,330
that the others are leaving.

590
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:49,530
(He can't stop watching
as the others walk away.)

591
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:53,640
It's not like we won't see him forever.
We'll see him all the time in Korea.

592
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:56,540
(The Three Brothers resume
their journey once again.)

593
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:59,480
This is the 1st time the 3 of us
traveled alone since Season 1.

594
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,140
- It's the first time?
- Wait.

595
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:05,080
It feels like light is shining in
from somewhere.

596
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,880
(Screaming)

597
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,290
- Wait.
- My eyes hurt.

598
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:09,290
Wait a second.

599
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:12,320
What are you doing
on Adventure by Accident, Hye Jin?

600
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,720
Thank you for inviting me.

601
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,360
Welcome.

602
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:21,360
I'm here today instead of Dex
because he is busy.

603
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:23,170
She gladly agreed to stand in for Dex.

604
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,240
- After we return from an overseas trip,
- Yes?

605
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,400
we actually travel with Hye Jin in Korea.

606
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:33,010
(Another travel mate
of Kian84 and Si Eon's)

607
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,650
(They've known one another for 9 years...)

608
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:37,710
(and seem like real siblings.)

609
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,250
(I apologize if you felt uncomfortable.)

610
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,590
You travel overseas on MBC
and in Korea on Hye Jin's YouTube channel.

611
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:47,020
Adventure by Accident...

612
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:50,030
shows the chemistry among the male cast.

613
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,500
- Yes.
- They are very open with one another.

614
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,530
And there are no formalities.

615
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:57,370
- No formalities.
- "No formalities?"

616
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,670
I think she wants to say
that you're dirty.

617
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:00,040
No, I don't.

618
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,810
It's similar to
when we're traveling with you, Hye Jin.

619
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:02,940
- Really?
- Yes.

620
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:05,910
Should we go to a sauna together
next time?

621
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:08,880
Gosh. You've become scary on YouTube.

622
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,480
(You've become scary on YouTube.)

623
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,480
What is it?

624
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,020
I think she understands how I feel.

625
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,990
There's something I feel
when I'm traveling with these two.

626
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:18,120
Actually, I shouldn't say "these 2."
It's more about 1 of them.

627
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:21,760
A person that can relate to
the frustration I feel is here.

628
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,890
Who is that one person?

629
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,190
I wonder who he is.

630
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,500
(We will keep that a secret.)

631
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,130
(Airport in Kathmandu)

632
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,470
Okay. Now,

633
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:37,170
our trip to Nepal is over.

634
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,980
Our trip will now...

635
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,310
follow the Tea Horse Road.

636
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,350
Tea Horse...

637
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:50,790
Horses were raised in the Himalayas.

638
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:54,390
Then the horses were taken
to be exchanged for tea.

639
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:57,030
We will go to the place
where the exchange was made.

640
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:58,560
It's the tea we drink.

641
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:03,800
We have to go through China.

642
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,440
We will go through China.

643
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:08,340
- Hello.
- Hello.

644
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,670
Nice to meet you.

645
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:10,670
(Travel YouTuber, Captain Brother,
who has 600,000 subscribers)

646
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:12,640
- He's famous.
- I'm a subscriber.

647
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,480
(He speaks Chinese suspiciously well.)

648
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,980
(But he's Korean.)

649
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,050
(He's already met several minority groups
along the Tea Horse Road.)

650
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,960
I was thinking of planning a route...

651
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,690
where we can meet
different minority groups.

652
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:31,430
Should we start with Tibet?

653
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,860
In Tibet,

654
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,900
tourists aren't allowed
to travel independently.

655
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,270
There must be restrictions.

656
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:40,940
Many Tibetans live...

657
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,510
around Tibet.

658
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:46,240
There are several well-known areas
on the way there.

659
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,480
There is a place called Shangri-La.

660
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:50,450
- Shangri-La?
- Have you heard of it?

661
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:53,080
Besides the Han Chinese,
there are 55 minority groups.

662
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:54,990
Half of those minority groups
live in that area.

663
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:56,990
They do?

664
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:57,990
(Around half of the minority groups
live in Yunnan, where Shangri-La is.)

665
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:00,320
We were planning to travel
along the Tea Horse Road.

666
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:04,590
We were told that Shangri-La is where
we could meet various minority groups...

667
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,730
and see the culture of Tibet.

668
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:10,230
So that is the final destination
of our trip.

669
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,400
(Final destination: Shangri-La)

670
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,370
I looked up the route to China.

671
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:16,810
I think it would be best
to fly into Chengdu.

672
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:19,540
When we went from Nepal to China,

673
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:22,250
we flew into a city called Chengdu
to get to our destination.

674
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:26,280
Let's say goodbye to Nepal.
Goodbye, Nepal.

675
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,120
(Saying goodbye to Nepal,
where they made many memories)

676
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:32,820
(They are off to Chengdu, where the trip
of the Three Brothers will begin!)

677
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:39,660
We are flying from Nepal to China.

678
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,460
Under those clouds...

679
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:46,000
are the Himalayas.

680
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,070
(The stretch of the Himalayas)

681
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:51,980
The Himalayas we saw in Nepal...

682
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:54,280
stretches out to this point.

683
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:56,380
It lies over hundreds of kilometers.

684
00:27:56,850 --> 00:28:00,820
We are traveling along
the stretch of the Himalayas.

685
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,090
(They travel along the mountain range
of thousands of kilometers.)

686
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:04,190
(Kathmandu, Chengdu)

687
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:07,020
(3-hour flight)

688
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:13,360
We have to exchange money.

689
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:15,500
But I heard the Chinese don't use cash.

690
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,470
We don't need to exchange money.

691
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,570
They use...

692
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:21,040
Let's charge our Alipay here.

693
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,740
- We can use our phones.
- Then we...

694
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,170
Give all your money to Pani Bottle.

695
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,840
Do I need to give you any money?

696
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,950
I'm the only one paying.

697
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,220
That will make it seem like
you're doing everything by yourself.

698
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,120
- We'd just be following you around.
- All right.

699
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:37,090
We'll stay at a hotel...

700
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,460
in Chengdu tonight.

701
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:40,920
I'll get a taxi.

702
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,760
Wait a minute. Since we arrived,

703
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,800
you exchanged the money,
got a hotel, and will get a taxi.

704
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,030
You're doing everything.

705
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,870
- That's right.
- Come to think of it,

706
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:50,400
he did everything since Season One.

707
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,300
But I had no idea what to do.

708
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,470
That's the biggest problem.

709
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:56,970
That's right. I'm sure you wanted to help.

710
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:59,510
It's a relief that I'm used to doing it.
So it wasn't much trouble.

711
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,240
It wasn't anything tough.

712
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,410
It's a Pani Bottle Tour.

713
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:04,380
(Pani Bottle, the guide)

714
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,420
(Pani Bottle Tour is back
after approximately 3 years.)

715
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,120
We're back to where we started.

716
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:11,720
What are we doing today, Pani Bottle?

717
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:15,490
- We'll check in first.
- Check in.

718
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,430
There is a night market in Chengdu.
Let's have dinner there.

719
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,930
- Sounds good.
- That sounds amazing.

720
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:25,470
(After hearing the satisfying plan,
they head to the taxis.)

721
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,100
(Gasping)

722
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,740
They look like electric cars.

723
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,340
(While taking a look
at the taxis in Chengdu...)

724
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,340
It's a panda.

725
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:34,310
They're known for their pandas.

726
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:35,650
(Around 12 million people visit
the panda research base annually.)

727
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:37,350
We're familiar with pandas.

728
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,350
That's right.

729
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,350
(Chengdu is serious about pandas.)

730
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,720
- Gosh.
- So cute.

731
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,990
The panda must be the mascot of the city.

732
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:47,020
(Welcome to Chengdu.)

733
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,530
Sit in the front, Pani Bottle.

734
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:51,430
(They get into the cute panda taxi...)

735
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:54,800
(and head to their hotel.)

736
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:56,930
Since Dex isn't with us anymore,

737
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:59,370
the fangirls will gather around me.

738
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,700
Fangirls?

739
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,710
Right.

740
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:04,810
(What is he talking about?)

741
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:06,740
You're being ridiculous.

742
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:10,080
He said something totally useless.

743
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,450
Yes, that's right.

744
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,220
The Chinese must rarely use cash.

745
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,020
I've never seen anyone use cash.

746
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,020
- Really?
- Gosh.

747
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,160
I heard...

748
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,360
that even the homeless...

749
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,390
- hold out QR codes for money.
- That's right.

750
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:24,730
- I actually saw someone like that.
- Isn't that surprising?

751
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:26,130
- Really?
- I'd only heard about it...

752
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:27,200
- but went and saw someone.
- How does that work?

753
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,460
Do they beg for money
and hold up their phones?

754
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,100
- No, they hang it around their necks.
- They wear it.

755
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,200
- Really?
- It's laminated.

756
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,200
- Yes.
- It's laminated.

757
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,400
Even the donations at temples...

758
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,540
- are made through QR codes.
- A QR code is on the donation box.

759
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:39,980
Almost no one accepts cash or cards.

760
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:42,280
- It's all done with QR codes.
- That's right.

761
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:46,020
I'm looking forward to the night market.

762
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,950
Chengdu is known for its mapo tofu.

763
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:50,650
- Gosh.
- Gosh, that looks tasty.

764
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:51,920
It looks amazing.

765
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,530
(From the irresistible malatang...)

766
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:59,330
I'm okay with hot pot
or any type of Chinese food.

767
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:02,230
There are probably restaurants
near the stalls on the streets.

768
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:04,170
So we can eat some street food...

769
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:05,570
and go have hot pot.

770
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,400
Let's eat and rest today.

771
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:09,340
We're here.

772
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,570
(They arrive at the hotel
while deciding their dinner menu.)

773
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:13,580
That was around 40 dollars
for driving 70km.

774
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,250
It's slightly cheaper than in Korea.

775
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:17,380
Let's go eat.

776
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,510
(They head straight to the night market
after checking in.)

777
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,680
Look at all the pandas.

778
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,490
The pandas are even on the streets.

779
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:25,920
Chengdu is known for its pandas.

780
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,020
That's so cute.

781
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,020
(Souvenirs
suitable for the city of pandas)

782
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,890
They're so cute, aren't they?

783
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:32,630
This is called the Fuqin Night Market.

784
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:34,300
- Fuqin?
- Yes, the night market on Fuqin Road.

785
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:36,770
I think this is it.

786
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:39,170
- It's on the left.
- It's the night market.

787
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:40,170
This is where it starts.

788
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:42,870
There are so many people.

789
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:45,780
(The oldest night market in Chengdu)

790
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,840
- It's quite big.
- That must've been fun.

791
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:52,120
Fuqin Night Market is one
of the oldest night markets in Chengdu.

792
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,980
It has numerous stalls
and a variety of unique foods.

793
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,250
It is known for its exquisite cuisine.

794
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:58,290
(A huge night market in Chengdu)

795
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:01,520
- Skewers.
- What's that?

796
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:03,390
- Tofu.
- That looks tasty.

797
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:06,830
There was a huge variety of food
and many of them in mala flavor.

798
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:12,170
(You can taste local food
at Fuqin Night Market)

799
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:14,840
What's this?

800
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:16,870
It must be lamb.

801
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,310
It's either goat or lamb.

802
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:20,910
- It's here.
- It's lamb.

803
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,510
- That's a brain.
- I thought it was intestines.

804
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:24,680
(There is a variety
of unique ingredients as well.)

805
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,320
- What is that?
- It's duck.

806
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,680
(Duck head)

807
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:29,990
There are many seats outside.

808
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:32,220
It's very crowded.

809
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,990
It's a night market.

810
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,090
It was very crowded, although it was late.

811
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:41,230
(Waving)

812
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:43,930
- What is this?
- It looks like alcohol.

813
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:45,100
(A kiosk draws their attention
in the midst of the welcoming crowd.)

814
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,740
- That must be made with roses.
- He's telling you to try it.

815
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:50,340
- It's like a traditional fruit wine.
- Yes, it is.

816
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:52,180
(Welcome drink)

817
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,010
- It's alcohol.
- Yes, but it's light.

818
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:55,710
It's similar to makgeolli.

819
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:59,650
- It tastes like roses.
- It must smell nice.

820
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:01,720
Should we buy one since we tried it?

821
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,620
This one.

822
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:06,090
- How much is it?
- How much is it?

823
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,190
- It's 5 dollars.
- It's 5 dollars?

824
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,590
I'll pay for it.

825
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:12,800
(Pani Bottle is in charge of paying.)

826
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,330
How do we pay for it?

827
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,100
I think you get a notification
on your phone.

828
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:18,740
We wouldn't have been able to buy it
if it weren't for Pani Bottle.

829
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,440
You would've starved
if it weren't for him.

830
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,110
You can't even beg for money
since you don't know how to use QR codes.

831
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:25,880
- They can't even beg.
- They would've starved.

832
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,750
(Pani the Guide pays
so the older brothers don't starve.)

833
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:30,150
- It's five dollars?
- Jianpasi.

834
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:33,620
- "Kian84."
- No way.

835
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,720
- "Kian84."
- Some people recognized me.

836
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,750
Gosh.

837
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:37,750
Thank you.

838
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:39,490
Your name in Chinese...

839
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:41,990
- must be Jianpasi.
- Jianpasi.

840
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:43,760
- "Pasi" is 84.
- Jianpasi.

841
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,830
Pasi.

842
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,900
- Thank you. That's interesting.
- A photo.

843
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,770
- Take a photo? Okay.
- Okay.

844
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:51,730
- Without Dex, Kian84 is popular.
- That's right.

845
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,740
- Okay.
- Jianpasi.

846
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,440
- Okay, thank you.
- Thank you.

847
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,840
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

848
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,010
(Laughing)

849
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:02,910
- His face reveals his feelings.
- He's happy.

850
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:04,910
I wonder if this is how Dex feels.

851
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,450
(He has global fan meetings
everywhere he goes.)

852
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:10,990
(Jealous)

853
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:12,820
(Numerous people ask for photos.)

854
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:15,890
- You must've been jealous.
- You took so many photos for him.

855
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:16,890
(Brother 1, who was jealous of Dex)

856
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,630
(He went from the jealous brother
to Jianpasi.)

857
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:22,700
I wish Dex were there to see that.

858
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,330
(Proud)

859
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:26,000
It's not a bad feeling.

860
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,440
(Smiling)

861
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,840
- This is interesting.
- It made your day as soon as you arrived.

862
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,370
(They happily go back
to exploring the market.)

863
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:33,240
- What's this?
- What is it?

864
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,610
They're softshell turtles.

865
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:36,680
- Softshell turtles.
- Softshell turtles?

866
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,950
- Softshell turtles?
- Gosh.

867
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,080
They're frogs and softshell turtles.

868
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,120
Frogs and softshell turtles on the street?

869
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:43,150
The frogs look tasty.

870
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:45,520
- Frogs taste like chicken. They're okay.
- Frogs...

871
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,630
(They continue walking for now.)

872
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:51,590
It's larvae.

873
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,560
(They see something familiar.)

874
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,770
Scorpions?

875
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:58,430
- I want to try a scorpion.
- What's this?

876
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,840
They sell it like that?

877
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:03,310
That looks terrifying.

878
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:04,310
They also have grasshoppers.

879
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:06,480
Si Eon doesn't eat any of that.

880
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,580
Jianpasi started drooling
as soon as he saw that.

881
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,850
(Drooling)

882
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:13,080
- His mouth started watering.
- He couldn't wait to eat it.

883
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,890
I want to try a scorpion.
I'm curious what it tastes like.

884
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:18,620
- Should I try it?
- That larva is alive.

885
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,320
- What?
- It's alive.

886
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,860
- Really?
- It isn't moving.

887
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,990
- It's moving. Watch it.
- It's moving?

888
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:25,500
- It's alive. I'm serious.
- You're right.

889
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,260
- It's alive.
- You're right.

890
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,430
- Right?
- It's really moving.

891
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:30,500
It's moving.

892
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,570
It's alive.

893
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,910
- Who is that?
- He came up to see it.

894
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:37,540
- Who was that?
- Who was that man?

895
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,540
Who was it?

896
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:40,240
Look. They're all eating it.

897
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,710
It must be like us eating silkworms.

898
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,650
Many young people ate it, right?

899
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,320
(Glancing)

900
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,950
Let's see.

901
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:51,820
- I think that's alive too.
- Are you trying the scorpion?

902
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,090
- Gosh.
- Really?

903
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:54,890
- I can't have that anywhere else.
- Right.

904
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:56,890
- Are you really going to eat it?
- I'm curious too.

905
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:57,930
I'll try it.

906
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,160
I should try it while I'm here.

907
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,230
(I always want to try local things
while traveling.)

908
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:09,470
(Trying local foods
is the true charm of traveling.)

909
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:11,610
(Unstoppable love for local foods)

910
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:12,880
- Won't it be okay?
- Let's see.

911
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,550
- He cuts off the venomous tail.
- Of course.

912
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:16,810
- Since it's venomous?
- Yes.

913
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:20,880
Scorpions look like lobsters.

914
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:23,320
I think it will taste like a lobster.

915
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,720
(He hopefully wishes for it
to taste like a lobster.)

916
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,420
(Leaning forward)

917
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:30,190
- This is tasty.
- A recommendation.

918
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:32,130
- Are you Korean?
- No.

919
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:35,060
We have this in Korea.

920
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:38,470
- It's a large-sized silkworm.
- It's bigger.

921
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,540
(He tries the recommended skewer.)

922
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:43,970
He's applying sauce to it.

923
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:46,580
That looks spicy. I think it's mala sauce.

924
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,880
(He applies plenty of mala sauce
on the Sichuan delicacy.)

925
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,450
(Focused)

926
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:52,420
Hello.

927
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,520
- Hello.
- Kian84?

928
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,520
- What was that?
- Can I take a photo with you?

929
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,060
I thought it was...

930
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,390
- Captain Brother.
- I'm a fan.

931
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:04,360
- I thought it was Captain Brother.
- Give me a second.

932
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,230
(They look quite similar.)

933
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:09,100
Are you Korean?

934
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:11,800
No, I'm Korean-Chinese.

935
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,540
- Can I take a photo with you?
- Yes.

936
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,600
Thank you.

937
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:17,670
Kian84.

938
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,540
- Thank you.
- Jianpasi.

939
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:22,240
- You're slimmer than I expected.
- Thank you.

940
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:23,410
Slimmer than he expected.

941
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:25,150
- Have fun safely.
- Thank you.

942
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:26,220
(Successful street fan meeting)

943
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,480
It would've been crazy if Dex were here.

944
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,290
- Dex?
- Yes, traffic would've come to a stop.

945
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,350
- We wouldn't be able to walk around.
- Right.

946
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,860
- I'm glad he didn't come.
- Without Dex here,

947
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,090
- I'm getting attention.
- Yes.

948
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,490
- It's the trickle-down effect.
- "The trickle-down effect."

949
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:39,500
(While enjoying
the trickled-down popularity)

950
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,500
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

951
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,400
- Gosh.
- I'll do it.

952
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:45,640
How much is it?

953
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:50,510
- I don't know numbers.
- Pani Bottle speaks English, Spanish,

954
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:52,440
and even Chinese.

955
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:54,440
He's a human translator.

956
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:57,010
I don't speak Chinese.
That's all I know how to say.

957
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:58,310
(Modest translator)

958
00:37:58,310 --> 00:37:59,350
How much is it?

959
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,080
It's around six dollars.

960
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,150
(Scorpion skewer and 2 insect skewers,
approximately 6.6 dollars)

961
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:05,920
(The 1st thing Kian84 grabs)

962
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,490
Try it and see if it's good.

963
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:11,430
It still has legs. He only cut off
the tail because of the venom.

964
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:15,700
- Eat the arm.
- The arm...

965
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,530
- The arm...
- You're trembling.

966
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,070
I'm scared to try this.

967
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:22,200
It's meaty.

968
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,610
(Crocodile meat? To my mouth)

969
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:24,710
The crocodile tasted okay.

970
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:26,940
He even tasted the Ganges River.

971
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:29,080
The Ganges River is Tier One.

972
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:31,680
Wait.

973
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,080
- I'm scared to try this.
- He rarely hesitates.

974
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:37,620
- It looked like it might move.
- Yes, that's right.

975
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,560
(Shaking)

976
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,560
Why are you shaking?

977
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,960
I was scared.

978
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,430
(He shakes while getting a taste
of the wild.)

979
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:48,100
(Crunchy)

980
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,830
- Listen to that.
- Is it crunchy?

981
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,040
(He takes a bite
after hearing the crunchy sounds.)

982
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,570
It tastes good.

983
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:57,740
It has some kind of scent.

984
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,240
It tastes like shrimp.

985
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:01,940
- It's shrimp but...
- It tasted like shrimp head.

986
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,910
- Then it must taste savory.
- Yes, that's right.

987
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:07,350
(He couldn't be more serious
while tasting it.)

988
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:09,350
It tastes like a closet.

989
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:11,250
It tastes like my grandmother's closet.

990
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,520
- Like a closet?
- It tasted like a closet.

991
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,090
- When did you taste a closet?
- It tasted like my grandmother's closet.

992
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,990
Go home
and bite your grandmother's closet.

993
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,260
- It tastes like that.
- Stale and woody?

994
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,930
I think I know what you mean.

995
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:26,170
Listen to that.

996
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:27,200
(Grabbing the skewer)

997
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,140
(The eldest grabs
the closet-flavored scorpion.)

998
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,140
Si Eon has a weak stomach.

999
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,170
(Si Eon has a weak stomach.)

1000
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,510
Okay.

1001
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:35,710
(When Kian84 was eating pupae,)

1002
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:37,480
(Si Eon, the city guy, shook his head.)

1003
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,480
I have a weak stomach.

1004
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:41,650
- Try one of the arms.
- It's 33.

1005
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:44,190
Si Eon is trying it.

1006
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,060
It's scary at first.

1007
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:50,890
He tried it.

1008
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:54,630
(Closing his eyes)

1009
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:57,130
- It must be painful.
- It must be tough for him.

1010
00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:01,170
I regretted not trying the pupae.

1011
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:03,510
I went home and thought about it.

1012
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,610
When else would I get a chance to try it?

1013
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:09,080
I regretted it then
and thought I might regret it again...

1014
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,080
if I didn't try the scorpion.
That's why I tried it.

1015
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:14,180
I was able to grow during this trip.

1016
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,290
It's too hard.

1017
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:21,060
It's amazing that he tried an insect.

1018
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:24,130
What's that? Is it a diving beetle?

1019
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:26,930
- It's a diving beetle.
- Really?

1020
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,030
Beetles are harder to eat.

1021
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:32,330
(He takes a bite without hesitating.)

1022
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:33,540
He eats it without hesitation.

1023
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:36,110
(The eldest, who has matured,
quickly takes it.)

1024
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:37,210
This is better than the scorpion.

1025
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,470
Is he going to eat it?

1026
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:41,110
- Is it better than the scorpion?
- Yes, it is.

1027
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:42,140
The scorpion wasn't bad.

1028
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:44,350
(He tries one.)

1029
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,650
- This isn't bad.
- Are you okay with this big one?

1030
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:50,790
- It's huge. Look at the legs.
- It's huge.

1031
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:51,950
I have to eat it without looking at it.

1032
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,320
(Looking up)

1033
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:56,030
- It's like chips.
- It's savory.

1034
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:59,460
What did the diving beetles taste like?
Were they juicy?

1035
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,660
- No.
- Were they juicy?

1036
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,900
- No.
- Juicy?

1037
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,470
Juicy? You sound elegant.

1038
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:07,870
I'm sure you're curious.
But it wasn't juicy.

1039
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:09,410
That's a relief.

1040
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,440
But I could feel the wings.

1041
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:12,880
(Dizzy)

1042
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,080
(He cleanses his palate
with the large silkworm.)

1043
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,080
Is it tasty?

1044
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:18,980
- It's tasty.
- Silkworm is tasty.

1045
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,050
Try this.

1046
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:21,280
(He highly recommends it to his brothers.)

1047
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,790
- It was tasty. It was mala-flavored.
- It's good.

1048
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:25,820
- It's the same as the Korean silkworm.
- It's the same.

1049
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,060
- Thank you.
- How do you say "tasty" in Chinese?

1050
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:30,360
- Hao chi.
- Hao chi.

1051
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,430
- Hao chi.
- Hao chi.

1052
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:33,760
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1053
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:38,630
A lot of it is stuck in my teeth.

1054
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,540
A leg of the diving beetle
is stuck between my molars.

1055
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,810
I think I have something
stuck in my teeth too.

1056
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:46,540
It's stuck between my molars.

1057
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:47,780
(It feels unpleasant.)

1058
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,580
(He suddenly reaches into his pocket.)

1059
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,110
I knew it and brought floss.

1060
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,890
(He flosses his teeth right away.)

1061
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,620
Floss is essential when eating insects.

1062
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:00,260
(Taking out the bug leg)

1063
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,760
- What is he doing?
- It must've swam diligently.

1064
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,230
(Kian84...)

1065
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:04,290
Is it not coming out?

1066
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,160
(I have to film this.)

1067
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:09,160
How am I supposed to give you this
when you're flossing?

1068
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,170
Give it to me.

1069
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:12,740
(I'll use it again later.)

1070
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:15,940
Eating something strange makes me wonder
what the frog will taste like.

1071
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:18,010
Eating frogs must be easy now.

1072
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:19,380
Other things must be
more approachable now.

1073
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,110
Didn't you have them often in childhood?

1074
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:22,950
- Really?
- I didn't have frogs in childhood.

1075
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:24,350
Frogs and grasshoppers.

1076
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:25,450
- Everyone had them.
- I had grasshoppers.

1077
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:29,820
(He'll eat frogs
for the 1st time in 42 years.)

1078
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,020
Two of these.

1079
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,420
- Will you eat two?
- Yes.

1080
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,590
Where else will you eat frogs?

1081
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:37,590
- That's right.
- Yes. It's an experience.

1082
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:38,690
You need to eat them at times like this.

1083
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,030
- They're so big.
- These frogs must've exercised a lot.

1084
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:42,330
These frogs are so big.

1085
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:43,800
- They're like bullfrogs.
- Yes.

1086
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:45,500
They have Dex's legs.

1087
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,970
Those are the legs Dex wants.

1088
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:50,810
- Gurkha frogs.
- They have Gurkha's legs.

1089
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:51,910
(Their muscles rival
those of UDT and Gurkha.)

1090
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:54,380
- Si Eon.
- They're boiled in spicy soup.

1091
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:58,510
(They're boiled in mala broth.)

1092
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:02,050
(They take on spicy flavors.)

1093
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,590
It looks like chicken.

1094
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:04,650
(At a glance, it looks like chicken.)

1095
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:06,360
- Seriously.
- No one will know if you don't say it.

1096
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,360
That's right.

1097
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:08,720
Let's taste it.

1098
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:11,360
It looks spicy.

1099
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,730
Look at his eyes.

1100
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:17,300
It's so chewy.

1101
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:19,600
- "Try it, Si Eon."
- It suits his taste.

1102
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,170
- You mean that it's tasty, right?
- Yes.

1103
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,940
It's totally... It's 100 percent protein.

1104
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:28,310
(Pani Bottle takes a bite
of the protein-rich dish.)

1105
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:29,780
Weightlifting...

1106
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:33,720
(My goodness)

1107
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,950
- It's too spicy.
- I guess he can't eat spicy food.

1108
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:37,950
- Is it tasty?
- It's tasty, but spicy.

1109
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:39,150
It's so spicy.

1110
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:41,120
The seasoning must be spicy.

1111
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,690
- It numbs the mouth.
- That's how it is in that region.

1112
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:44,330
- I can see that they use chili oil a lot.
- That's right.

1113
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,830
People with no spice tolerance
can't eat it.

1114
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:47,160
I can't eat it.

1115
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,530
- Is it spicy?
- It's numbing my mouth. Yes.

1116
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:51,070
The taste isn't the problem.
It's tasty. But it's too spicy.

1117
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:54,970
(Pani Bottle is so weak.)

1118
00:43:54,970 --> 00:43:56,270
(Oh, my.)

1119
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:59,910
I liked the dish.
I liked how chewy the meat was.

1120
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:01,880
It's tasty.

1121
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,380
(Is it that tasty?)

1122
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:05,910
- I'll have a leg on standby.
- A leg.

1123
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,680
Si Eon, try this part.

1124
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,120
If you try it, you'll see how chewy it is.

1125
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,650
- That's right, Si Eon.
- It's unexpectedly chewy.

1126
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:14,690
To be honest, I'm a vegetarian.

1127
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,060
So suddenly?

1128
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:18,630
If they sell this dish in Korea,

1129
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:19,660
I'll order it again.

1130
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:21,500
- Will you order it again?
- That's how tasty it is.

1131
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:24,500
Chicken breast is dry, right?

1132
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:26,770
- It doesn't have that dryness.
- That's right. It's chewy.

1133
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:28,070
- Yes.
- It's like chewy chicken.

1134
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:31,470
You're something else.

1135
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:33,440
- He's eating it with so much gusto.
- It's spicy.

1136
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,010
Kian84 is like Heebab right now.

1137
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:36,180
Seriously.

1138
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:37,910
(Heebab84)

1139
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,120
(He's eating with gusto.)

1140
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:41,950
He'll eat the bones at this rate.

1141
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:43,720
(Perfect deboning)

1142
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,990
(Clean)

1143
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:48,720
Did you see the bones in front of him?

1144
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,490
- Yes.
- He ate the dish so cleanly.

1145
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:51,560
I'll pay.

1146
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:55,000
- Then I'll pay for the hot pot.
- Okay.

1147
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,300
How much is it?

1148
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,030
(How much is it?)

1149
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:00,200
It's five dollars.

1150
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:02,940
- How much is it?
- The prices are low at the market.

1151
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:04,370
- Yes.
- It's like that overall.

1152
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:06,310
So it's 2.5 dollars per frog. Not bad.

1153
00:45:06,310 --> 00:45:07,310
(After enjoying a light snack,)

1154
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:08,910
(they move to the hot pot restaurant.)

1155
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:09,910
Let's go.

1156
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,850
You have to eat hot pot in Chengdu.

1157
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:13,950
- That's right.
- It's a must.

1158
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:15,620
- It's the hometown of hot pot.
- That's right.

1159
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:17,520
- Is it a hot pot restaurant?
- That place was the best.

1160
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,650
- Oh, my.
- It's nice.

1161
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:20,320
- Si Eon, let's eat here.
- We could smell the hot pot.

1162
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:24,660
(They follow the smell.)

1163
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:25,990
- Where should we sit?
- Here.

1164
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:27,060
Is it a hot pot restaurant?

1165
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,470
(They sit at a table they see.)

1166
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,270
Does this place have beef?

1167
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,070
I see many dishes on the menu.

1168
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:35,900
(There's only Chinese.)

1169
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:38,810
- You don't see a lot of English in China.
- That's right.

1170
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:40,840
(Getting up)

1171
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,140
What's that?

1172
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:44,450
(Taking photos)

1173
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,620
Look at that. The two of them are sitting
while Pani Bottle is working.

1174
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:48,780
You're right.

1175
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:52,050
- It happens when you travel with elders.
- I think that's what it is.

1176
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:54,060
He was about to chew the food
and feed it to us.

1177
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:58,390
Look at this, Kian84. It's the menu.

1178
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:00,530
Beef, intestines...

1179
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:02,400
- As for this one...
- Pork stomach.

1180
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,800
I think it's pig stomach.

1181
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:06,240
There's pork belly.

1182
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:08,240
"Dragon beef?"

1183
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:09,940
"Dragon beef?"

1184
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:11,540
- The translation is strange at times.
- What's that?

1185
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:13,710
Order what you want.
I'm okay with everything.

1186
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:15,780
How do I order?

1187
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:17,380
(They set off to order something.)

1188
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:18,910
How do I order?

1189
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:22,520
(They're struggling
because they don't know how to order.)

1190
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,920
- You write it here.
- I see.

1191
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:26,790
I'll do it. I can do it.

1192
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,360
All right. Okay.

1193
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:30,860
(He acquired the order sheet
in a cool way.)

1194
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:33,030
(Clicking)

1195
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:35,700
What's going on?

1196
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,870
We can mark what we want.

1197
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:39,200
(Proud)

1198
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:40,940
Here.

1199
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,840
Many of those translations
will appear strange.

1200
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:45,440
"Tofu skin."

1201
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:47,640
- Tofu skin.
- Tofu skin.

1202
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:49,080
It's tasty. Order a lot.

1203
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:50,550
- Tofu skin.
- Three.

1204
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:54,180
- "Bamboo shoot, 3."
- Bamboo shoot, 3.

1205
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:55,280
Bamboo shoot.

1206
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:57,750
"Hanging beef."

1207
00:46:57,750 --> 00:47:00,590
- Hanging beef.
- Such translations are so funny.

1208
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:01,820
What's "Hanging beef?"

1209
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:04,360
- I think it's aged meat.
- I see.

1210
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,990
- "Hanging beef."
- "Tender beef."

1211
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:07,430
One tender beef.

1212
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:10,570
"Kung fu broke a potato."

1213
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:12,900
- "Kung fu broke a potato?"
- That's right.

1214
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,870
"Pure milk cow heart."

1215
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:18,540
"Pure milk cow heart."

1216
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:20,610
(What does that even mean?)

1217
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:23,310
Shall we try one pure milk cow heart?

1218
00:47:23,450 --> 00:47:25,080
No! Try it later.

1219
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,520
Put in an additional order later.

1220
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:29,020
Let's order a lot of vegetables for now.

1221
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:31,290
- Vegetables.
- Let's eat one serving each.

1222
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:34,420
(Lastly, they order the drinks.)

1223
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:36,760
Kaoliang liquor looks incredible.

1224
00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:38,560
This one.

1225
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:40,260
- This one.
- Size...

1226
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:41,560
- This one?
- Yes.

1227
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:43,830
- Let's go.
- Thank you.

1228
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:46,500
(They complete their order
and go back to their table.)

1229
00:47:46,770 --> 00:47:49,610
You know,
there are so many fascinating food items.

1230
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:52,470
The category of food is very broad.

1231
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:55,180
- This city is famous for food.
- Duck?

1232
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:56,750
- Food.
- Food?

1233
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:58,880
They say that Chinese people
eat everything with legs.

1234
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,180
- Except for tables.
- Except for tables.

1235
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:02,850
They even eat mosquito eyeballs.

1236
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:04,550
What did he put on his lips?

1237
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:05,750
Seriously.

1238
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:08,360
- His lips are red from eating frogs.
- I ate frogs.

1239
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,460
- I became flushed.
- "What did he put on his lips?"

1240
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:12,730
He isn't the type to do that.

1241
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:15,030
- Is it a frog lipstick?
- Yes.

1242
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:16,270
The souls of dozens of frogs.

1243
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:18,070
(The heart-fluttering mala red)

1244
00:48:18,370 --> 00:48:20,270
This restaurant runs until 11 p.m.

1245
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:22,870
(Glancing)

1246
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:26,910
(A generous amount)

1247
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:28,780
Didn't we order too much?

1248
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:30,050
Let's eat.

1249
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:31,610
- You know...
- No. There's more.

1250
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:34,250
They shrink in size when they're boiled.

1251
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:39,190
- There's too much food.
- There's too much food.

1252
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:41,120
(Coming through)

1253
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:45,460
(They get another tray.)

1254
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,030
(What?)

1255
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:48,760
Pani Bottle's eyes are shaking.

1256
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,600
We thought that we'd get a piece per one.

1257
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:53,340
You couldn't tell
how big the portion would be.

1258
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:55,000
- For three people,
- You ended up ordering a lot of food.

1259
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,200
we ordered three servings per item.

1260
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:57,640
(3 servings)

1261
00:48:58,110 --> 00:48:59,140
(3 servings)

1262
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:01,240
- There's so much food.
- Kian84.

1263
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:02,940
- My goodness.
- Why is there so much...

1264
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,410
This is why I order.

1265
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,280
(They understand perfectly.)

1266
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,580
- I see.
- Otherwise, something like this happens.

1267
00:49:08,850 --> 00:49:10,790
- Of course.
- Kian84 and I ordered.

1268
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:13,190
Did we order this much food?

1269
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:16,020
(We should've sat still to help him.)

1270
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:18,890
You can eat more food
once you get started.

1271
00:49:18,890 --> 00:49:20,460
That's right. They're vegetables.

1272
00:49:20,730 --> 00:49:22,830
- Will you add all of them?
- I'll add just a few.

1273
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:24,830
Sichuan hot pot is the original.

1274
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,470
It looks tasty.

1275
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:27,570
(Adding the hanging beef)

1276
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,610
There are so many hot pot restaurants.

1277
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:32,640
It's as popular as kimchi stew in Korea.

1278
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,180
Most restaurants sell hot pot.

1279
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,510
(He takes some food.)

1280
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:43,120
(He adds chilis to the sauce.)

1281
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:44,950
(Mixing)

1282
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:46,290
It looks tasty.

1283
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:51,690
(A mouthful of original hot pot)

1284
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:53,300
(Impressed)

1285
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:55,500
The bamboo shoot is tasty.

1286
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:58,370
I see why pandas only eat bamboo shoots.

1287
00:49:58,530 --> 00:49:59,570
It's tasty.

1288
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:01,300
Oh, it was tofu.

1289
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:05,770
(Pani Bottle takes a ladleful of food
from the white soup.)

1290
00:50:05,770 --> 00:50:07,510
It was nice.
Since I couldn't eat spicy food,

1291
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:09,240
we ordered red soup for one side...

1292
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,950
- and white soup for the other side.
- That's right.

1293
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:14,180
(He eats the tofu dipped in sauce first.)

1294
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:15,380
- It was so tasty.
- It looks tasty.

1295
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:18,220
(My goodness)

1296
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:20,760
(It's hot.)

1297
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:22,790
- The sauce is tasty.
- The sauce is really tasty.

1298
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:23,990
- It's tasty, right?
- Yes.

1299
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:25,860
I think we'll be able
to find this soup in Korea,

1300
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:28,230
- but this sauce is so tasty and nutty.
- Yes.

1301
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:31,070
It has a bit of spiciness
and a hint of the cilantro.

1302
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:35,170
(The eldest tries the sauce
Pani Bottle recommended.)

1303
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:36,610
It's tasty.

1304
00:50:37,270 --> 00:50:38,940
It's definitely different
from the hot pot...

1305
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:40,240
- you get in Korea.
- Yes.

1306
00:50:40,310 --> 00:50:41,880
The taste is more legitimate.

1307
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:46,750
(The eldest finally found
the food he liked.)

1308
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:52,750
(He eats and eats.)

1309
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:55,890
(Then he eats some more.)

1310
00:50:56,090 --> 00:50:58,230
To be honest, it was so tasty.

1311
00:50:58,230 --> 00:51:00,630
Seeing you eat well puts my heart at ease.

1312
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:02,230
(He inhales the food
regardless of the ingredient.)

1313
00:51:02,230 --> 00:51:04,030
(He eats the meat as well.)

1314
00:51:04,030 --> 00:51:05,370
It's so tasty.

1315
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,740
I'm serious. It's so tasty.

1316
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,670
- This soup is tasty too. Seriously.
- It's tasty.

1317
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:12,940
When I saw you guys eat frogs earlier,

1318
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:14,240
I became a bit discouraged.

1319
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:15,840
Eating this encouraged me.

1320
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:17,280
Do you want to try the frog tomorrow then?

1321
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:19,710
(Oh, my.)

1322
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,250
The kaoliang liquor is nice.

1323
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:25,790
Just because we flew for about two hours,

1324
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:28,620
the food has completely changed.
It's different from Nepali food.

1325
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:30,330
- Three hours.
- Three hours.

1326
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:32,790
It's so tasty.

1327
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:34,030
(Absorbed in the atmosphere,
he takes a sip of kaoliang liquor.)

1328
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:36,570
(My goodness)

1329
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,830
- It's nice.
- It must be really nice.

1330
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,400
I'm full.

1331
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,400
Are you full?
Hey, we need to eat all the food.

1332
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,740
We still ate a lot.

1333
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:45,710
- We ate so much.
- We ate quickly.

1334
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:47,780
- He's right.
- They could eat a lot of it.

1335
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:49,540
In the soup, the amount isn't a lot.

1336
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:50,650
That's right. They shrink in size.

1337
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:53,620
That's right. We need to talk about
the schedule for tomorrow.

1338
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:55,950
I have a suggestion
since we came to China.

1339
00:51:55,950 --> 00:51:57,790
There's a place called Yunnan.

1340
00:51:57,950 --> 00:52:00,590
- It's right next to...
- Are we going to Yunnan tomorrow?

1341
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,660
There's a place called Lijiang
inside Yunnan.

1342
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:03,760
- Lijiang.
- Lijiang.

1343
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:05,290
Lijiang is inside Yunnan.

1344
00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:09,260
It's a place many people visited
on the Tea Horse Road.

1345
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:12,630
- That's right. I know.
- It's the gate of the trade route.

1346
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:15,270
(It unfolds
under the snow-capped mountain.)

1347
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:17,270
There's a place called
the Old Town of Lijiang.

1348
00:52:17,810 --> 00:52:20,340
It's like the scene you see in the dramas
about "Romance of the Three Kingdoms."

1349
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:21,340
Seriously.

1350
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:22,680
(Many horses have passed
the city of traditions and romance.)

1351
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:24,810
The final destination was Shangri-La,
right?

1352
00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:27,420
Lijiang is a city next to Shangri-La.

1353
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:30,250
In ancient times, horses rested there.

1354
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:32,550
Since it was an important place
on the Tea Horse Road,

1355
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:33,990
I thought it'd be nice to visit.

1356
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:35,460
(They decide to visit the city
on the Tea Horse Road.)

1357
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:37,960
I looked up tasty restaurants in Lijiang.

1358
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:40,530
I found the traditional food of Lijiang.

1359
00:52:40,830 --> 00:52:44,400
- Traditional food?
- Preserved ribs hot pot.

1360
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:47,700
- Hot pot again?
- It exists only in Lijiang.

1361
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:49,500
- It exists only in Lijiang.
- Only in Lijiang?

1362
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,540
Only in Lijiang.

1363
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:52,540
- Then...
- You can't eat it anywhere else.

1364
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:55,910
Lijiang has many minority groups.

1365
00:52:56,510 --> 00:52:58,610
Nakhi people. There are Nakhi people.

1366
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:00,480
Do they wear sleeveless shirts?

1367
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,350
- What was that? For goodness' sake!
- Nakhi sounds like "sleeveless shirt."

1368
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,390
(What kind of a lousy joke is that?)

1369
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:05,590
Many people would think that.

1370
00:53:05,590 --> 00:53:06,890
- No!
- What a rotten joke.

1371
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:08,020
They're called the Nakhi people.

1372
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:09,290
- Still...
- "Do they wear sleeveless shirts?"

1373
00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:11,130
- You could ask them.
- Really?

1374
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:12,360
- Si Eon.
- The Na'vi...

1375
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:13,360
- No.
- Thank goodness Dex isn't here.

1376
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,130
- Had Dex been here...
- No.

1377
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:17,170
(Si Eon, save your comments
even when I'm not around.)

1378
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:18,630
Save your comments.

1379
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,940
Shall we spend the day
at Lijiang tomorrow?

1380
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:23,570
- Okay.
- Let's do that.

1381
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:26,040
- I'll look up the minority group.
- It's an item on your bucket list.

1382
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:27,410
You continue to be in a bad condition.

1383
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,010
To be honest, you should've gone to Korea
instead of Dex.

1384
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:33,250
- "You should've gone to Korea."
- Why did you say that?

1385
00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:34,720
He was in a bad condition.

1386
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,850
That would've been nicer in many ways.

1387
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:39,190
You can either rest
or hang out by yourself.

1388
00:53:39,190 --> 00:53:41,520
You can do whatever you want tomorrow.

1389
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:44,390
I'll do the planning from tomorrow onward.

1390
00:53:45,630 --> 00:53:48,060
Pani Bottle, get some rest.
I'll do the planning.

1391
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:50,830
From the day after,
Si Eon and I will work.

1392
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:52,330
- Let's have another sip and go.
- Okay.

1393
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:54,140
Cheers.

1394
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:55,140
(They wrap up for tomorrow.)

1395
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,770
How much is the total?

1396
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:59,470
You need to do it.

1397
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:01,180
(Please write it here.)

1398
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:04,650
It's 73 dollars.

1399
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:07,550
- Including the liquor?
- Including the liquor. That's the total.

1400
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:08,720
- Gosh.
- You guys ate so much.

1401
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:11,450
The price is quite nice.

1402
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:12,750
We're paying.

1403
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:14,160
(Hot pot: About 73 dollars)

1404
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,190
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1405
00:54:16,490 --> 00:54:19,430
(The Three Brothers
leave for the lodging.)

1406
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:24,400
(How will Lijiang be tomorrow?)

1407
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:32,240
Let's go.

1408
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,280
(On the 8th day of the trip,
they go to Lijiang.)

1409
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:39,550
The direct flight to Lijiang from Chengdu
is early in the morning.

1410
00:54:41,350 --> 00:54:42,350
We're checking out.

1411
00:54:42,350 --> 00:54:43,590
(Pani Bottle checks out again.)

1412
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:46,990
(He calls the taxi in one go.)

1413
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:49,190
Hello.

1414
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:51,130
- Airport.
- Airport.

1415
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:52,930
Domestic airport.

1416
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:55,560
We're going to the domestic airport.

1417
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:56,670
Domestic airport.

1418
00:54:57,330 --> 00:54:59,730
- Okay.
- Okay. Thank you.

1419
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:02,870
(Chengdu, Lijiang)

1420
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:06,370
(1 hour and 30 minutes)

1421
00:55:06,810 --> 00:55:10,550
(Si Eon and Pani Bottle rest
as they watch videos.)

1422
00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:13,620
(What is Kian84 doing?)

1423
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:17,850
(He's playing a game on his phone.)

1424
00:55:19,450 --> 00:55:20,890
- What?
- What is it?

1425
00:55:20,890 --> 00:55:22,790
Is he playing a game while sleeping?

1426
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:26,130
(His fingers stopped.)

1427
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:28,530
To be honest, I was physically exhausted.

1428
00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:29,800
Of course.

1429
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:34,340
(They arrive at Lijiang Airport.)

1430
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:36,170
This is Lijiang.

1431
00:55:37,110 --> 00:55:38,910
Lijiang of the Lijiang Tower.

1432
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:41,180
Gosh, does that place really exist?

1433
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:42,180
Is that it?

1434
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:44,380
It's like a place in "Spirited Away."

1435
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:46,310
- It's like a set for a period drama.
- A set.

1436
00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:47,320
That's what it looks like.

1437
00:55:47,450 --> 00:55:50,650
That's the Old Town of Lijiang.

1438
00:55:51,350 --> 00:55:54,060
Let's grab a taxi and go there.

1439
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:56,690
- Okay.
- I'm sorry, Pani Bottle.

1440
00:55:56,990 --> 00:55:59,330
- Please grab a taxi. We'll do the rest.
- Yes.

1441
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:01,300
You can stop working
after grabbing a taxi.

1442
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,060
Is there anything
other than grabbing a taxi?

1443
00:56:03,830 --> 00:56:06,000
Just grab the taxi and pay.
We'll do the rest.

1444
00:56:06,870 --> 00:56:07,940
I think I'll do all the work.

1445
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:10,710
You know, I had this realization.

1446
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:13,240
People here can't speak English very well.

1447
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:14,310
They only speak Chinese.

1448
00:56:14,310 --> 00:56:16,110
Still, you do most of the work.

1449
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:17,980
(I know that.)

1450
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:19,180
It wasn't about the language.

1451
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,650
There wasn't anything hard.

1452
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,150
Look at the weather.

1453
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:24,750
It's nice.

1454
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:27,060
- The sky is clear.
- It's nice.

1455
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,960
It's the nicest
the weather has been during this trip.

1456
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:33,630
(When they were in Nepal,)

1457
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:37,800
(the sky was full of fine dust.)

1458
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,200
(Warm sunlight welcomes them in Lijiang.)

1459
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,970
- The weather is nice.
- The weather is so nice.

1460
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:48,240
He's training his eyes
for the first time in a while.

1461
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:51,080
The weather is the clearest.

1462
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:55,250
(Worker Bottle looks for a taxi.)

1463
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:57,220
Okay. Let's ride this taxi.

1464
00:56:57,220 --> 00:56:58,520
Pani Bottle grabbed a taxi.

1465
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:00,520
- Don't put it down.
- Pani Bottle is doing all the work.

1466
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:01,920
They'll be in trouble without Pani Bottle.

1467
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,120
(He safely boards the taxi.)

1468
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,330
Have you looked for a lodging?

1469
00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:06,190
- A lodging? No, I'll go and see.
- Yes.

1470
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:07,200
Will you go and see?

1471
00:57:07,530 --> 00:57:09,560
It was convenient
when you booked the lodging.

1472
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:11,300
I feel bad.

1473
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:13,130
Pani Bottle, we're sorry.

1474
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:14,600
Don't be sorry.

1475
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:19,340
This place is different from Chengdu.

1476
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,440
This place is exotic.

1477
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,140
(The exotic scenery unfolds.)

1478
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:24,850
But it's also homely.

1479
00:57:25,010 --> 00:57:26,350
Look at the flowers.

1480
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:30,190
I can't believe we're seeing flowers
on Adventure by Accident.

1481
00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:33,220
They must've looked beautiful
thanks to the nice weather.

1482
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:36,020
The air is cold, and the sunlight is warm.

1483
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:37,690
The air is clean.

1484
00:57:37,690 --> 00:57:39,490
When you're on Adventure by Accident,
the scenery changes...

1485
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:40,730
- after each night.
- I know.

1486
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:45,670
It's so dramatic.
How did the world change so much in a day?

1487
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:48,900
The snow-capped mountain is no joke.

1488
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,540
I can see so far.

1489
00:57:51,570 --> 00:57:53,010
This is incredible. What's that mountain?

1490
00:57:54,310 --> 00:57:55,310
Yulong Snow Mountain.

1491
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:57,050
Is there a snow-capped mountain?

1492
00:57:57,050 --> 00:57:58,210
(The snow-capped mountain looks majestic.)

1493
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:00,180
Do Yeon!

1494
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:03,150
We're curious about Lijiang.

1495
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:04,150
It was nice.

1496
00:58:04,890 --> 00:58:06,390
(After the gravelly "Do Yeon")

1497
00:58:06,590 --> 00:58:08,290
Do Yeon, please read it.

1498
00:58:08,290 --> 00:58:09,420
(He's good.)

1499
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:11,930
I'll tell you about Lijiang.

1500
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:16,000
Lijiang is located in Yunnan, China.

1501
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,770
It's a city that's 2,400m above sea level.

1502
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:19,770
(Under the majestic Yulong Snow Mountain
that's 5,596m tall)

1503
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,100
It was a key point in the trade route
of the Tea Horse Road...

1504
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:23,940
and a stopover site for the horses.

1505
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:28,210
It's also the home of the Nakhi people,
a minority group,

1506
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:31,210
The majestic nature
of the snow-capped Yulong Snow Mountain...

1507
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:32,780
and the ancient vibes...

1508
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:35,580
make it a charming travel destination.

1509
00:58:36,050 --> 00:58:38,490
(Proud)

1510
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,960
Is it okay to be so happy?

1511
00:58:41,090 --> 00:58:43,360
- I'm so happy right now.
- It feels wrong.

1512
00:58:44,030 --> 00:58:46,630
(They enjoy the beautiful scenery.)

1513
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:48,660
- Are we there, Pani Bottle?
- Yes, we're nearly there.

1514
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:49,660
(They arrive at the Old Town of Lijiang.)

1515
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:52,070
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1516
00:58:56,670 --> 00:58:58,840
(My goodness)

1517
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:00,510
It's cool.

1518
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:04,280
(They see a fancy building upon arrival.)

1519
00:59:04,850 --> 00:59:07,620
Will you be able to find a lodging here?

1520
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,150
- A lodging?
- Let's look for it.

1521
00:59:09,350 --> 00:59:10,620
- If you walk for a while...
- You know,

1522
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:12,750
there won't be a sign that reads, "Hotel."

1523
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:14,560
Shall we walk around?

1524
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:15,560
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1525
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:17,660
We hadn't reserved a hotel.

1526
00:59:18,130 --> 00:59:19,530
Kian84 decided to look for a place.

1527
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:21,200
We decided to look for it
since we felt bad for Pani Bottle.

1528
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,400
After all,
Pani Bottle always makes a reservation.

1529
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,670
We wanted to find it on the spot.

1530
00:59:26,370 --> 00:59:28,040
That place is pretty.

1531
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:31,910
That's the scenic spot.

1532
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:33,040
(Gosh)

1533
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,040
It's so big.

1534
00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:38,680
(The scenery makes them exclaim.)

1535
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:41,120
- It's so nice.
- The town is so big.

1536
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:44,490
(The tile roofs are lined up.)

1537
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:49,920
My goodness.

1538
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:52,930
Here's the thing about Lijiang.

1539
00:59:53,290 --> 00:59:55,200
When our ancestors took
the state exam in the old days,

1540
00:59:55,630 --> 00:59:58,000
they spent the night in Suwon...

1541
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:00,570
before entering the capital.

1542
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:02,400
They didn't have cars.

1543
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:05,810
They had a horse or a donkey,
so they had to rest.

1544
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:06,940
(A rest area for the exhausted travelers)

1545
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:10,110
It's like the Meeting Square Rest Area
in Seoul.

1546
01:00:10,110 --> 01:00:11,180
(It's like the Meeting Square Rest Area
in Seoul.)

1547
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:12,750
That's right. A rest area in Cheonan.

1548
01:00:13,650 --> 01:00:15,950
(An important base of the trade route
on the Tea Horse Road)

1549
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:19,120
I see why people compare it to Gyeongju.

1550
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:21,690
The scale is incredible.

1551
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:25,860
What? I know what that is.
It's the clothes of the minority group.

1552
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:28,060
Pani Bottle,
they're the clothes of the minority group.

1553
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:29,500
- Was it the Hmong people?
- Really?

1554
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,130
Was it the Hmong people?

1555
01:00:32,130 --> 01:00:33,530
The Miao people.

1556
01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:35,970
There was a comic book
I really liked back in the day.

1557
01:00:36,370 --> 01:00:38,810
In "3×3 EYES," there was...

1558
01:00:38,810 --> 01:00:40,810
a really cute heroine called Pai.

1559
01:00:40,810 --> 01:00:42,440
It looks like the clothes
of the people who live in the mountains.

1560
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:45,810
It's a makeup studio.

1561
01:00:46,550 --> 01:00:47,720
They lend you clothes and do your makeup.

1562
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:50,320
I guess people wear costumes like they do
in Gyeongbokgung Palace.

1563
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:53,490
For photos?

1564
01:00:53,490 --> 01:00:57,960
The locals made the place very stylish,
right?

1565
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:58,960
Yes.

1566
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:02,100
(Gasping)

1567
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:05,200
How do we enter a new world every day?

1568
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,230
Oriental.

1569
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:10,000
(Giggling)

1570
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,810
Is it a school? Kids are chatting.

1571
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:13,880
It must be an elementary school.

1572
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:16,380
Where? It's a kindergarten.

1573
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:17,480
How cute.

1574
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:18,650
Look at them.

1575
01:01:18,650 --> 01:01:20,050
(Oh, my!)

1576
01:01:20,050 --> 01:01:21,050
Hello.

1577
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:23,790
He'll make it big.

1578
01:01:24,050 --> 01:01:25,820
- Do you guys want to go home?
- Hello.

1579
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:27,760
"Primary school."

1580
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:31,060
- Elementary schoolers...
- They must be elementary schoolers.

1581
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:32,290
What's "elementary school" in English?

1582
01:01:33,530 --> 01:01:34,530
Middle school?

1583
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:37,300
- Is it "elementary school?"
- Hello.

1584
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,570
Is it an elementary school?

1585
01:01:41,970 --> 01:01:42,970
No?

1586
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:46,210
(We don't understand.)

1587
01:01:46,210 --> 01:01:47,710
- They don't understand.
- No?

1588
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:49,810
No English classes?

1589
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:51,980
They're so cute.
They're sticking to the gate.

1590
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:53,080
It's old.

1591
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:54,920
All right. It must be break time.

1592
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:57,750
- Bye.
- Bye.

1593
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:59,150
- Bye.
- They know "bye."

1594
01:01:59,150 --> 01:02:00,390
(Bye.)

1595
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:02,020
Kids are cute.

1596
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:03,520
We need to find a lodging now.

1597
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:04,990
(We'll go and find a lodging.)

1598
01:02:04,990 --> 01:02:08,230
Hey. "Wan Fang An He Inn."

1599
01:02:08,230 --> 01:02:09,330
Is it in English?

1600
01:02:09,430 --> 01:02:10,430
What?

1601
01:02:10,430 --> 01:02:12,430
(They find a building
that looks like an inn.)

1602
01:02:12,870 --> 01:02:14,370
This won't do. I'll look it up.

1603
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:17,810
We must call in order to make a booking.

1604
01:02:18,410 --> 01:02:20,040
- Who's going to make the call?
- The lodging?

1605
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:21,780
Gosh, I have zero confidence.

1606
01:02:22,610 --> 01:02:24,580
I can't speak Chinese,
and they can't speak English.

1607
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:26,880
Had Pani Bottle made the booking,
we could've gone right away.

1608
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,250
But we wandered around.

1609
01:02:31,850 --> 01:02:33,520
There's one over there.
Do you want to check it out?

1610
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,460
- The leader.
- Is he finally doing something?

1611
01:02:36,220 --> 01:02:38,030
The room is 37.5 dollars.

1612
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:40,700
- It says this is the place.
- Here?

1613
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:42,500
- Hi.
- Hi.

1614
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:45,870
- Is it a homestay?
- Is it a homestay?

1615
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,200
Hold on.

1616
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:50,440
- There's one here too.
- No room?

1617
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:51,840
- No.
- No room?

1618
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:53,840
Oh, no.

1619
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:55,910
(What now?)

1620
01:02:56,410 --> 01:02:58,080
We'll waste too much time finding a room.

1621
01:02:58,710 --> 01:03:00,980
I'll look for one on my own.

1622
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:03,750
Moving as a group of three lacks mobility.

1623
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:04,920
Exactly, it's a waste of time.

1624
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:06,690
- There aren't any, right?
- No.

1625
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:09,090
- I'm going to look around the area.
- Okay.

1626
01:03:09,090 --> 01:03:10,460
- Let's go together.
- Let's go.

1627
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:12,130
Going as a group will take too much time.

1628
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:15,160
You should look around too.
It's hard to find available rooms.

1629
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:16,660
- Separately?
- Let's go.

1630
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:18,100
- We went on our own.
- Yes.

1631
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:20,500
I'll look around.

1632
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:22,540
(I'll look around.)

1633
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:24,840
I realized after arriving in China.

1634
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:28,310
That Pani Bottle was doing everything
without a word.

1635
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:30,850
What were Si Eon and I doing?

1636
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:34,250
Feeling terrible,
I went around looking for a room.

1637
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:36,580
Pani Bottle never boasts about it.

1638
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:38,390
He's going to steal my job.

1639
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:42,360
(I'll find a room for us.)

1640
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,360
- Did you look for one on foot?
- Yes.

1641
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:47,300
If only there were signs.

1642
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:50,130
(A map is a must.)

1643
01:03:50,530 --> 01:03:55,540
(Relying on the navigation app,
he moves forward.)

1644
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:57,340
There it is.

1645
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:03,950
(He finally located an accommodation.)

1646
01:04:03,950 --> 01:04:05,010
It's big.

1647
01:04:05,010 --> 01:04:07,650
(Is this the place?)

1648
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:11,520
Excuse me?

1649
01:04:12,450 --> 01:04:13,690
Do you have a room?

1650
01:04:14,490 --> 01:04:15,920
I hope they do.

1651
01:04:19,590 --> 01:04:20,800
(We do.)

1652
01:04:24,330 --> 01:04:26,000
Do you want to look at the room first?

1653
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,570
They even show you the room.

1654
01:04:27,570 --> 01:04:28,700
Yes.

1655
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:33,840
(On his way to check the room)

1656
01:04:35,140 --> 01:04:37,310
- What? It even has a living room.
- It looks amazing.

1657
01:04:38,010 --> 01:04:40,110
- Nice.
- It's really nice.

1658
01:04:40,950 --> 01:04:41,980
One bed.

1659
01:04:42,950 --> 01:04:43,990
There are three of them.

1660
01:04:43,990 --> 01:04:45,020
(A room with 2 beds)

1661
01:04:45,020 --> 01:04:46,020
It's perfect.

1662
01:04:46,890 --> 01:04:47,960
It's perfect.

1663
01:04:50,660 --> 01:04:52,830
He did it. Kian84 got 1 thing done.

1664
01:04:53,330 --> 01:04:56,060
(Touting? He passed it.)

1665
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:58,470
(English? Nice.)

1666
01:04:59,070 --> 01:05:02,040
(Finding a room? A success.)

1667
01:05:02,770 --> 01:05:03,770
(Success by Accident)

1668
01:05:03,770 --> 01:05:04,810
He did it.

1669
01:05:04,910 --> 01:05:07,980
We're a variety show from South Korea.

1670
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:09,680
Can we shoot here?

1671
01:05:10,210 --> 01:05:11,210
(He's even asking for permission
to shoot.)

1672
01:05:11,210 --> 01:05:12,480
Is he even getting permission?

1673
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:13,680
That's very thorough of him.

1674
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:15,850
(It's okay.)

1675
01:05:15,850 --> 01:05:18,720
- He's okay with it.
- We'll take the room for one night.

1676
01:05:19,150 --> 01:05:20,150
How much is it?

1677
01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:21,290
(Being clear)

1678
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:23,660
(It's 500 yuan per night.)

1679
01:05:23,660 --> 01:05:25,460
That's about 100 dollars per night...

1680
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:26,990
That's cheap.

1681
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:29,000
Good.

1682
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:31,200
Good.

1683
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:32,800
(Perfect Chinese)

1684
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:34,700
What does that mean?

1685
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:36,670
- Good.
- "Okay."

1686
01:05:36,670 --> 01:05:38,640
- You didn't know what it meant?
- He kept saying, "Good."

1687
01:05:39,270 --> 01:05:41,210
(Smiling)

1688
01:05:41,210 --> 01:05:44,050
There's joy in finding available rooms.

1689
01:05:44,910 --> 01:05:47,580
- It felt great.
- Of course.

1690
01:05:48,450 --> 01:05:51,390
(Calling Pani Bottle right away)

1691
01:05:52,220 --> 01:05:53,590
- Hello?
- Pani Bottle.

1692
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:56,720
- Yes?
- I found a room, and it's nice.

1693
01:05:57,390 --> 01:05:58,630
- Really?
- Yes.

1694
01:05:58,630 --> 01:06:00,430
- The room has three beds.
- Is it actually nice?

1695
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:02,760
- Okay.
- And it's cheap. It's great.

1696
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,170
- Let's go.
- Yes, come.

1697
01:06:05,730 --> 01:06:07,800
- I'll send you the address.
- Okay.

1698
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:10,100
(A welcome mandarin)

1699
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:11,570
There was mandarin to eat for free.

1700
01:06:14,410 --> 01:06:15,480
(Keeping the peels)

1701
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:16,580
- Gosh.
- Come on.

1702
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:19,180
He's using mandarin instead of perfume.

1703
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:21,580
A mandarin scent.

1704
01:06:21,580 --> 01:06:22,620
A citrus scent.

1705
01:06:22,850 --> 01:06:25,090
I should smell good
when I meet the minority group.

1706
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:28,860
Isn't that good manners? He kept it
in his pocket instead of littering.

1707
01:06:29,660 --> 01:06:30,730
(Keeping his manners
with the mandarin peels)

1708
01:06:30,730 --> 01:06:31,760
(Wiping)

1709
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:33,890
(Wiping)

1710
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:37,400
(While he rubs the perfume
on his whole body,)

1711
01:06:37,930 --> 01:06:40,300
(Si Eon and Pani Bottle arrive.)

1712
01:06:40,970 --> 01:06:42,840
Kian84. I like the place so far.

1713
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:44,040
- Is it okay?
- Yes.

1714
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:45,140
It's really pretty.

1715
01:06:46,270 --> 01:06:48,640
(Satisfied with the view,
he makes the payment.)

1716
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:51,180
The room needs cleaning,
so we have to wait here for 20 minutes.

1717
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:53,280
- Okay. Let's relax a bit.
- Okay.

1718
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:55,820
Hold on. Let me ask that.

1719
01:06:57,950 --> 01:06:59,420
Excuse me.

1720
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:04,060
Where must I go to meet the Nikhi people?

1721
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:06,890
- "Nikhi?" Wasn't it the Nakhi people?
- "Nikhi?"

1722
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:10,330
(While searching for minority groups
last night)

1723
01:07:10,330 --> 01:07:11,400
The Nakhi people?

1724
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:13,400
(He found the Nakhi people.)

1725
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:16,600
- The Nakhi people?
- Nakhi.

1726
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:19,770
It said many of the Nakhi people
lived in that area.

1727
01:07:20,310 --> 01:07:23,480
Please wait. We have Nakhi people here.

1728
01:07:23,910 --> 01:07:25,710
So there are Nakhi people here.

1729
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:29,620
Is this accommodation
run by the Nakhi people?

1730
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:32,520
(His heart is pounding.)

1731
01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:35,760
There are 2 Nakhi people and 1 Mongolian.

1732
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:37,360
We're running this place.

1733
01:07:37,930 --> 01:07:39,430
In Lijiang, I felt...

1734
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:42,530
a lot more like a tourist.

1735
01:07:43,030 --> 01:07:44,430
The scenery was beautiful and all,

1736
01:07:45,030 --> 01:07:47,900
but I wanted to quickly meet
the minority people.

1737
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:51,370
- Good.
- I wanted to ask...

1738
01:07:51,370 --> 01:07:53,870
where the Nakhi people mainly lived.

1739
01:07:55,340 --> 01:07:56,340
The Nakhi people.

1740
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:58,780
- According to Wikipedia,
- Yes?

1741
01:07:58,780 --> 01:08:01,250
they are a matriarchal tribe.

1742
01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:03,250
The Mosuo people.

1743
01:08:03,350 --> 01:08:05,490
They don't mix their property
or financial activities.

1744
01:08:06,020 --> 01:08:07,120
Each household...

1745
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:08,120
(He's not interested.)

1746
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:09,390
- And...
- Our room is ready.

1747
01:08:09,860 --> 01:08:11,330
- Here. Listen to this first.
- Okay.

1748
01:08:12,290 --> 01:08:13,990
Information out of nowhere?

1749
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:15,400
It's the happiest moment for him.

1750
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:18,700
- To the Nakhi people,
- Yes?

1751
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:20,840
the frog is their deity.

1752
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:23,040
- I see.
- And...

1753
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:26,210
Look. Si Eon.
They are a matriarchal tribe.

1754
01:08:26,810 --> 01:08:27,880
So...

1755
01:08:29,110 --> 01:08:31,110
(Thinking)

1756
01:08:31,110 --> 01:08:33,050
(So this is...)

1757
01:08:33,050 --> 01:08:36,250
It's a matriarchal society
practicing polyandry.

1758
01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:37,280
How do I put it?

1759
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:38,950
(What is he saying?)

1760
01:08:39,220 --> 01:08:41,390
If a married couple has a child...

1761
01:08:42,260 --> 01:08:45,290
- Even if a child is born...
- He's obsessed with the minority group.

1762
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:47,230
- What are you saying?
- So...

1763
01:08:48,230 --> 01:08:50,530
- Why don't we go in first?
- Please. Don't trust the blog...

1764
01:08:50,530 --> 01:08:51,700
- too much.
- I don't get it.

1765
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,270
I'll study them again later.

1766
01:08:56,670 --> 01:08:58,770
(He wrapped up the private lesson.)

1767
01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:00,240
(Checking into the room)

1768
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:02,010
I wasn't sure what the room would be like.

1769
01:09:02,010 --> 01:09:03,380
(I wasn't sure
what the room would be like.)

1770
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:04,380
- Goodness!
- Thank you.

1771
01:09:05,050 --> 01:09:06,550
- Beautiful!
- The room is big.

1772
01:09:06,550 --> 01:09:08,980
- What?
- I was genuinely surprised.

1773
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:10,820
- It even has a terrace.
- Nice.

1774
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:11,820
Let's use this room.

1775
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:13,720
- Unbelievable.
- It's really nice.

1776
01:09:14,590 --> 01:09:17,360
Kian84. I've known you for 10 years,
and I've never been prouder.

1777
01:09:18,390 --> 01:09:19,390
I was shocked too.

1778
01:09:19,630 --> 01:09:20,790
Were you shocked at yourself?

1779
01:09:20,790 --> 01:09:23,460
(Scenery worth 10 years of compliments.)

1780
01:09:24,030 --> 01:09:26,100
I couldn't believe that
Kian84 found the room.

1781
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:29,440
It was hard to believe that
Kian84 found that place.

1782
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,610
- How did you find this room?
- The sky helped him.

1783
01:09:32,610 --> 01:09:33,670
No way this was just luck.

1784
01:09:33,910 --> 01:09:35,740
- It was pure luck.
- They're saying it's luck.

1785
01:09:35,740 --> 01:09:36,940
- They won't admit it was his skill.
- No.

1786
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:39,610
(The accommodation deity helped Lucky84.)

1787
01:09:39,810 --> 01:09:41,880
Pani Bottle. Let's go grab a bite.

1788
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:44,390
- I'm going to rest a bit.
- Sure.

1789
01:09:45,350 --> 01:09:47,790
I wasn't feeling well, so I skipped lunch.

1790
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:51,190
You should go easy on yourself
when traveling together.

1791
01:09:51,190 --> 01:09:53,660
You can't even eat
because you're always working alone.

1792
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:54,700
I'm sorry.

1793
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:57,600
You don't need to apologize.

1794
01:09:57,930 --> 01:09:59,930
She was being thoughtful,
but he apologized.

1795
01:09:59,930 --> 01:10:01,670
- I'm sorry.
- He's shaking right now.

1796
01:10:01,670 --> 01:10:03,100
- I'm just upset.
- Go down on your knees.

1797
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:06,040
- Why are you getting angry at him?
- I'm just so upset. I want him to rest.

1798
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:07,880
What you said was heartwarming,
but it was scary.

1799
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:09,640
(Honestly, you scared me too.)

1800
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:13,480
(While Pani Bottle is recovering)

1801
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:15,350
- First off...
- Yes?

1802
01:10:15,350 --> 01:10:17,080
(The others leave to get lunch.)

1803
01:10:17,450 --> 01:10:21,060
There's a place in Yunnan
that serves the best rice noodles.

1804
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:23,520
Is it only sold in Yunnan?

1805
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:26,760
When I said I was craving noodles,
Si Eon looked it up.

1806
01:10:26,990 --> 01:10:29,630
- I searched for a place online.
- That was sweet of him.

1807
01:10:30,330 --> 01:10:33,200
- I'll trust you and follow you around.
- You can trust me.

1808
01:10:33,930 --> 01:10:34,970
Turn right.

1809
01:10:34,970 --> 01:10:35,970
(Heading out with confidence)

1810
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:41,310
(With every step, peaceful alleys unfold.)

1811
01:10:41,310 --> 01:10:42,710
This place is truly beautiful.

1812
01:10:42,710 --> 01:10:44,350
Walking there would be a joy.

1813
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:47,350
You should come with your wife one day.

1814
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:50,480
It's a decent enough place
to bring my wife.

1815
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:53,120
Look at them twinning with jeans-on-jeans.

1816
01:10:53,450 --> 01:10:54,520
They're like newlyweds.

1817
01:10:56,090 --> 01:10:57,990
- Hold on.
- This must be the main street.

1818
01:10:57,990 --> 01:10:59,930
- Gosh. My camera!
- This is the main street.

1819
01:11:00,890 --> 01:11:05,270
(The place where all the alleys
of Lijiang come together)

1820
01:11:07,270 --> 01:11:09,800
"Sifang Street."
Are there streets on all four sides?

1821
01:11:10,070 --> 01:11:11,070
You're correct.

1822
01:11:11,070 --> 01:11:12,110
(How is it possible?)

1823
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:14,810
Sifang Street,
with streets on all four sides,

1824
01:11:15,010 --> 01:11:17,140
is the central square
in the Old Town of Lijiang.

1825
01:11:17,140 --> 01:11:19,150
(The central square
of the Old Town of Lijiang)

1826
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:22,280
The street is full of interesting sights
from the Nakhi culture.

1827
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:23,920
(Where diverse minority cultures
have mingled)

1828
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:27,090
- This must be the main street.
- Yes.

1829
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:30,090
(Amazed)

1830
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:33,030
Did you notice the place is filled
with the number eight?

1831
01:11:33,390 --> 01:11:35,330
- Where?
- Over there. Eight.

1832
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:38,830
And our Wi-Fi password was 8 8s.

1833
01:11:38,830 --> 01:11:40,270
- True.
- Come to think of it,

1834
01:11:40,270 --> 01:11:42,900
our room numbers are 803, 801, and 802.

1835
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,040
You're right.

1836
01:11:45,210 --> 01:11:47,570
That's why G-DRAGON is popular in China.

1837
01:11:47,740 --> 01:11:49,610
What? His birthday is August 18?

1838
01:11:49,610 --> 01:11:50,640
- Really?
- Yes.

1839
01:11:51,180 --> 01:11:52,580
That's some fate right there.

1840
01:11:52,580 --> 01:11:55,550
- We have Jianpasi with us.
- Yes.

1841
01:11:55,550 --> 01:11:57,790
- Jianpasi.
- If only my name were Kian88.

1842
01:11:57,790 --> 01:11:59,490
- It would've been nice.
- "Kian88?"

1843
01:11:59,490 --> 01:12:01,790
- You should've held back four years.
- I know, right?

1844
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:04,860
- That should be said to his parents.
- Right. I'm sorry.

1845
01:12:05,390 --> 01:12:06,430
My apologies.

1846
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:09,930
Let's go.
It's only one minute away from here.

1847
01:12:11,070 --> 01:12:12,470
We're almost there.

1848
01:12:15,670 --> 01:12:17,770
Hold on, Kian84. Take a look.

1849
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:22,480
Let me see.

1850
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:25,110
(Even when they were finding
the accommodation,)

1851
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:27,480
(the map app didn't work well.)

1852
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:29,080
Why does the map keep changing?

1853
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:31,150
It must be because
the streets were narrow.

1854
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:33,520
(It's acting up again.)

1855
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:34,590
From here...

1856
01:12:34,890 --> 01:12:38,960
(They turn around again
and head to the square.)

1857
01:12:40,030 --> 01:12:41,200
From here...

1858
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:43,930
We have to get to where the red is, right?

1859
01:12:45,730 --> 01:12:48,370
- Your destination is on the right.
- Lending my clothes...

1860
01:12:48,370 --> 01:12:50,040
Hold on. We've arrived.

1861
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:51,410
What? Where is it?

1862
01:12:51,410 --> 01:12:53,310
- Sifangjie.
- "Sifangjie?"

1863
01:12:53,310 --> 01:12:54,640
"Sifangjie?"

1864
01:12:54,980 --> 01:12:56,610
Is it actually called Sifangjie?

1865
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:59,780
- Is this Sifangjie?
- Sifangjie?

1866
01:13:00,650 --> 01:13:03,350
Sifangjie?

1867
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:06,950
(Over there.)

1868
01:13:07,390 --> 01:13:08,420
- Over there?
- Sifangjie.

1869
01:13:08,690 --> 01:13:09,760
Is that a tea house?

1870
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:11,090
It looks like a hot pot place.

1871
01:13:11,890 --> 01:13:13,260
Oh, Sifangjie.

1872
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:14,530
(They head in the pointed direction.)

1873
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:17,830
- It's on the left.
- The dragon...

1874
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:19,730
What is wrong with this?

1875
01:13:19,730 --> 01:13:20,930
Why? Let me.

1876
01:13:20,930 --> 01:13:22,600
- What app is this?
- I'll take a look.

1877
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:24,070
It's Google Maps.

1878
01:13:24,070 --> 01:13:25,710
Even though it's Google Maps?

1879
01:13:25,710 --> 01:13:27,470
Google Maps doesn't really work in China.

1880
01:13:27,470 --> 01:13:30,210
- China has its own map app.
- He's right.

1881
01:13:30,210 --> 01:13:32,250
- Really?
- It's easier to use that.

1882
01:13:33,810 --> 01:13:36,120
(Fortunately,
they find an information desk nearby.)

1883
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:37,250
Excuse me.

1884
01:13:38,650 --> 01:13:40,420
Sifangjie?

1885
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:42,590
Sifangjie?

1886
01:13:43,190 --> 01:13:45,290
- This way.
- Where?

1887
01:13:45,290 --> 01:13:47,160
- This way.
- "This way?"

1888
01:13:47,330 --> 01:13:48,530
- Here?
- Yes.

1889
01:13:48,530 --> 01:13:49,730
- Here?
- Here.

1890
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:52,530
- Sifangjie...
- Yes?

1891
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:55,540
must not be the restaurant's name.

1892
01:13:55,540 --> 01:13:58,710
Sifang means four sides.
Yes, "si" is four.

1893
01:13:58,910 --> 01:14:00,440
(Sifangjie)

1894
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:01,940
"Sifang Street."

1895
01:14:01,940 --> 01:14:03,080
She was right.

1896
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:04,810
Sifangjie is where they are currently.

1897
01:14:04,810 --> 01:14:06,510
Exactly. It's Sifangjie wherever they go.

1898
01:14:06,510 --> 01:14:09,250
Sifangjie must not be
the restaurant's name.

1899
01:14:09,250 --> 01:14:10,380
(We didn't know
the restaurant's name until now?)

1900
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:11,890
Hey, excuse me.

1901
01:14:12,150 --> 01:14:13,590
The restaurant's name...

1902
01:14:14,390 --> 01:14:15,490
Let's see.

1903
01:14:15,490 --> 01:14:18,090
(Gosh, Si Eon.)

1904
01:14:18,930 --> 01:14:20,160
(Excuse me?)

1905
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:21,530
(Do you have a room?)

1906
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,130
(I've grown so much.)

1907
01:14:24,130 --> 01:14:25,470
Seriously?

1908
01:14:25,470 --> 01:14:27,530
What about me?

1909
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:29,840
Si Eon tried looking for this place.

1910
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:30,970
Getting lost is no biggie.

1911
01:14:31,710 --> 01:14:32,910
It can happen.

1912
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:34,470
"It can happen?"

1913
01:14:34,580 --> 01:14:35,940
The restaurant's name...

1914
01:14:36,610 --> 01:14:37,680
Lisien?

1915
01:14:38,150 --> 01:14:40,010
(Misien means rice noodles.)

1916
01:14:40,010 --> 01:14:41,850
- Misien.
- Lisien?

1917
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:43,480
- Go straight?
- Yes.

1918
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:46,650
He's struggling to find the place
until the end.

1919
01:14:46,890 --> 01:14:47,960
Did you find it?

1920
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:50,290
Go straight.

1921
01:14:50,290 --> 01:14:52,860
- "Go straight?"
- Yes, for 20 minutes.

1922
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:54,930
- "Twenty minutes?"
- No.

1923
01:14:54,930 --> 01:14:56,060
No, 20m.

1924
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:57,500
For 20m?

1925
01:14:57,900 --> 01:14:59,330
You seem very anxious.

1926
01:14:59,330 --> 01:15:01,570
What? No, I let go of everything.

1927
01:15:02,970 --> 01:15:04,440
The name of the restaurant is Lisien.

1928
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:05,610
- "Lisien?"
- Yes.

1929
01:15:06,540 --> 01:15:08,440
(Off they go.)

1930
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:10,140
Lisien?

1931
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:11,810
You came the other way.

1932
01:15:11,810 --> 01:15:12,810
What?

1933
01:15:13,210 --> 01:15:14,650
- Return?
- Thank you.

1934
01:15:14,950 --> 01:15:16,180
You went the other way?

1935
01:15:16,180 --> 01:15:17,280
Oh, no.

1936
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:19,120
We found it. We're almost there.

1937
01:15:19,150 --> 01:15:20,690
This looks like a restaurant.

1938
01:15:20,690 --> 01:15:22,520
"Sifang Inn."

1939
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:23,660
(Sifang Inn)

1940
01:15:23,660 --> 01:15:25,930
- That's not the place.
- That was an inn, not a restaurant.

1941
01:15:26,060 --> 01:15:28,100
Tell me if you crave anything
as we walk by.

1942
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:29,330
Let's just go in anywhere.

1943
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:31,330
That makes you want
to find the place more.

1944
01:15:31,470 --> 01:15:32,470
Excuse me?

1945
01:15:32,630 --> 01:15:34,170
"Go straight all the way,
then turn left at the end."

1946
01:15:34,170 --> 01:15:35,870
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1947
01:15:37,070 --> 01:15:38,610
You guys had it hard.

1948
01:15:38,610 --> 01:15:39,770
(Did they finally get a lead?)

1949
01:15:39,770 --> 01:15:41,580
- Turn left here.
- Turn left.

1950
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:45,010
- We need to go 200m.
- Go 200m?

1951
01:15:45,010 --> 01:15:46,010
For real?

1952
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:47,920
Our room might appear
if we walk 200m more.

1953
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:49,220
Darn it.

1954
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:50,980
Let's try it.

1955
01:15:51,290 --> 01:15:53,190
I've become curious,
although I wasn't earlier.

1956
01:15:53,190 --> 01:15:55,820
After you try it,
you'll thank me 100 times in Japanese.

1957
01:15:55,820 --> 01:15:58,060
- No, in Chinese.
- In Japanese?

1958
01:16:00,460 --> 01:16:02,230
- Si Eon. This is bad.
- What's wrong?

1959
01:16:02,430 --> 01:16:03,630
Si Eon. This is bad.

1960
01:16:03,630 --> 01:16:04,830
- What's wrong?
- What is it?

1961
01:16:04,930 --> 01:16:06,100
We've come here before.

1962
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:07,900
- No!
- No!

1963
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:08,900
That's the worst.

1964
01:16:09,070 --> 01:16:11,810
(The story behind the Lisien mystery)

1965
01:16:11,810 --> 01:16:13,270
Is that the street we took?

1966
01:16:13,270 --> 01:16:15,410
- Goodness.
- You made a big detour.

1967
01:16:15,410 --> 01:16:17,010
- It was...
- What a big detour.

1968
01:16:17,010 --> 01:16:18,710
(They might conquer Sifang Street.)

1969
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:21,150
- Si Eon. This is bad.
- What's wrong?

1970
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:22,950
(Welcome to Sifang Street.)

1971
01:16:22,950 --> 01:16:24,750
- "Welcome to Sifang Street."
- Isn't that like...

1972
01:16:24,750 --> 01:16:25,790
an urban myth or something?

1973
01:16:25,790 --> 01:16:27,450
It's like an unsettling nightmare...

1974
01:16:27,450 --> 01:16:28,760
where you just go round and round.

1975
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:32,130
Rumor has it that the Sifang Street people
found you two scary.

1976
01:16:32,130 --> 01:16:33,760
- Because they kept seeing them?
- They kept seeing them.

1977
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:35,030
"Who are they?"

1978
01:16:35,030 --> 01:16:37,400
"What's with those two
wearing jeans-on-jeans?"

1979
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:38,700
- Rice noodles spirits.
- That's hilarious.

1980
01:16:39,770 --> 01:16:41,540
We've been here before.

1981
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:43,270
No, Kian84. You're just imagining it.

1982
01:16:43,270 --> 01:16:45,140
- Come here.
- Okay, let's go back to square one.

1983
01:16:45,270 --> 01:16:46,910
- Here.
- Back to square one.

1984
01:16:46,910 --> 01:16:49,580
Oh, no. It's actually the same place.

1985
01:16:49,580 --> 01:16:50,740
They must've been frustrated.

1986
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:53,380
But we also get lost
in the middle of Myeongdong.

1987
01:16:53,380 --> 01:16:55,150
- True. It's hard.
- The place is a maze.

1988
01:16:55,620 --> 01:16:57,050
I think the information desk...

1989
01:16:57,050 --> 01:16:58,790
- told us the wrong direction.
- Sifang something?

1990
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:01,760
(Trudging without a choice)

1991
01:17:02,260 --> 01:17:04,160
Wait. Hi.

1992
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:05,890
What? Are you Korean?

1993
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:08,030
- Do you speak Chinese?
- Yes.

1994
01:17:08,030 --> 01:17:10,430
We're looking for this place right now.

1995
01:17:10,430 --> 01:17:12,330
- He's Korean.
- That's great.

1996
01:17:12,970 --> 01:17:14,030
Rice noodles.

1997
01:17:14,170 --> 01:17:16,040
I don't think they'll know
since it's their first trip.

1998
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:17,270
This is also our first trip.

1999
01:17:17,270 --> 01:17:18,270
I see.

2000
01:17:18,410 --> 01:17:19,640
But they can speak Chinese.

2001
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:21,210
(They ask the information desk
on their behalf.)

2002
01:17:21,940 --> 01:17:23,440
(That way.)

2003
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:26,410
- That lady again.
- We have to...

2004
01:17:26,410 --> 01:17:28,050
- take that street again.
- We walked 400m.

2005
01:17:28,050 --> 01:17:30,120
- It's over there.
- We went there, but it wasn't there.

2006
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:32,350
It's over here.

2007
01:17:32,490 --> 01:17:33,720
- Where?
- What?

2008
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:35,320
- It was right in front of you?
- Was it right in front of them?

2009
01:17:36,590 --> 01:17:38,230
The place next to it with the sign?

2010
01:17:38,230 --> 01:17:39,290
Yes.

2011
01:17:39,290 --> 01:17:41,090
- Is it the place with the sign?
- Yes.

2012
01:17:41,090 --> 01:17:43,100
- I see. Thank you.
- Thank you.

2013
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:44,560
What?

2014
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:47,370
Why did you thank the Koreans in Chinese?

2015
01:17:47,530 --> 01:17:49,040
We were just too happy.

2016
01:17:49,340 --> 01:17:50,800
- Did we find it?
- Yes, we did.

2017
01:17:51,770 --> 01:17:53,070
It's this restaurant.

2018
01:17:53,170 --> 01:17:54,610
They finally found it.

2019
01:17:54,610 --> 01:17:55,710
(They finally found
the rice noodles place, Misien.)

2020
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:58,550
- Look.
- Is this the place?

2021
01:17:58,550 --> 01:17:59,610
Don't tell me...

2022
01:18:00,110 --> 01:18:03,350
(The place Google Maps
kindly guided them to.)

2023
01:18:05,190 --> 01:18:07,620
- What?
- It was that restaurant?

2024
01:18:07,790 --> 01:18:08,960
How frustrating.

2025
01:18:09,290 --> 01:18:10,520
Yes. We're here, Kian84.

2026
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:11,760
- Is this the place?
- Yes.

2027
01:18:11,830 --> 01:18:13,560
What's funny is that...

2028
01:18:13,830 --> 01:18:16,130
I showed the person the address.

2029
01:18:16,130 --> 01:18:17,800
But she told me it was over there.

2030
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:20,000
- It was the address of this place, right?
- Yes.

2031
01:18:20,570 --> 01:18:21,940
(Hesitating)

2032
01:18:21,940 --> 01:18:24,100
(Sifang Street)

2033
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:26,640
- You asked for Sifangjie.
- The square.

2034
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:28,280
- You asked for the square.
- That's right.

2035
01:18:29,540 --> 01:18:31,650
He's holding back. Kian84 is holding back.

2036
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:33,250
(Thinking)

2037
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:35,120
- Kian84 looks extremely annoyed.
- He's...

2038
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:36,320
- He's enraged.
- enduring it.

2039
01:18:36,950 --> 01:18:39,120
Walking around made me hungry. It's great.

2040
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:40,650
(A fatal blow)

2041
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:42,860
And we got to look around.

2042
01:18:44,090 --> 01:18:45,230
Nice.

2043
01:18:45,230 --> 01:18:47,390
He said that while gritting his teeth.

2044
01:18:47,790 --> 01:18:48,830
Here.

2045
01:18:48,830 --> 01:18:52,230
(Feeling bad, he quickly asks
if the restaurant has a table.)

2046
01:18:53,570 --> 01:18:55,640
I was walking on eggshells.

2047
01:18:56,300 --> 01:18:59,410
I had no idea. If I had known,
I would've guided him inside.

2048
01:18:59,410 --> 01:19:00,710
I swear I had no idea.

2049
01:19:01,540 --> 01:19:03,880
Traveling alone isn't an option yet.

2050
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:05,950
(Sniffling)

2051
01:19:05,950 --> 01:19:07,880
- But aren't such incidents fun?
- Yes.

2052
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:09,250
- It's memorable.
- Exactly.

2053
01:19:09,250 --> 01:19:10,880
- It'll become a memory.
- Smooth sailing isn't fun.

2054
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:13,050
Hard times become memories. This phrase...

2055
01:19:13,050 --> 01:19:14,350
is always right.

2056
01:19:14,350 --> 01:19:15,960
If you ever visit that restaurant,

2057
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:17,320
please take a tour around first.

2058
01:19:18,260 --> 01:19:20,760
- Like the Si Eon route?
- Yes, the route.

2059
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:22,460
- How hilarious.
- There's a lot to see.

2060
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:26,070
- Okay. Come, Kian84.
- Okay.

2061
01:19:26,870 --> 01:19:28,400
- Thank you.
- We walked around for an hour.

2062
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:30,570
- Really?
- You must've been starving.

2063
01:19:31,970 --> 01:19:33,510
(Going upstairs for an empty table)

2064
01:19:33,510 --> 01:19:35,580
- Hi.
- Hi.

2065
01:19:35,580 --> 01:19:36,610
Hi.

2066
01:19:36,980 --> 01:19:39,150
It'd be nice
if we could eat while looking outside.

2067
01:19:39,510 --> 01:19:40,550
(An unexpected terrace view)

2068
01:19:40,550 --> 01:19:42,350
- The restaurant looks nice.
- It's really nice.

2069
01:19:42,650 --> 01:19:44,580
- Gosh.
- The view here is amazing.

2070
01:19:46,020 --> 01:19:47,390
- Not bad, right?
- No.

2071
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:50,360
I'll try to order us food.

2072
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:52,590
I felt bad, so I wanted to order the food.

2073
01:19:52,590 --> 01:19:54,130
- I found the place.
- Got it.

2074
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:56,030
The rice noodles come in either...

2075
01:19:56,030 --> 01:19:57,600
white broth or red broth.

2076
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:59,930
- I want red broth.
- Same here.

2077
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:01,270
(Would you like to order?)

2078
01:20:01,270 --> 01:20:03,400
Thank you.

2079
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:06,270
(They must select
the rice noodles topping.)

2080
01:20:06,670 --> 01:20:08,780
I want this one.

2081
01:20:08,780 --> 01:20:11,410
- What's this?
- I don't know, but I'll take it.

2082
01:20:11,410 --> 01:20:12,510
(Kian84 picks with his instinct.)

2083
01:20:12,510 --> 01:20:13,610
One of this.

2084
01:20:13,980 --> 01:20:15,080
One of this.

2085
01:20:15,550 --> 01:20:16,580
Red.

2086
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:18,890
- Red. And...
- Okay.

2087
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:20,390
And...

2088
01:20:20,990 --> 01:20:22,260
Well...

2089
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:24,560
What's this?

2090
01:20:26,030 --> 01:20:28,160
- It looks like squid.
- Fried beef.

2091
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:30,130
- Fried beef? I want this one.
- Yes.

2092
01:20:30,130 --> 01:20:31,930
- What is it? Let me ask.
- Just order it.

2093
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:33,600
(What's this?)

2094
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:39,340
- Wild bacteria.
- "Wild bacteria?"

2095
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:42,110
(The personalized food
is perfect for him.)

2096
01:20:42,110 --> 01:20:44,140
- It's mushrooms.
- Mushrooms.

2097
01:20:44,140 --> 01:20:46,380
- Wild bacteria. Mushrooms.
- This one.

2098
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:47,380
One of this.

2099
01:20:47,750 --> 01:20:50,580
(Yunnan rice noodles, fried beef,
stir-fried mushrooms, about 30 dollars)

2100
01:20:51,350 --> 01:20:52,890
(The fried beef is served first.)

2101
01:20:52,890 --> 01:20:55,690
- Thank you.
- Chop steak. No, chopsticks.

2102
01:20:56,260 --> 01:20:57,420
This is fried beef.

2103
01:20:57,420 --> 01:20:58,430
(Golden)

2104
01:20:58,760 --> 01:21:00,230
What part of beef is it?

2105
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,430
(Let me try.)

2106
01:21:04,660 --> 01:21:06,600
You studied his face.

2107
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:07,830
That's pitiful.

2108
01:21:07,830 --> 01:21:09,400
- No...
- That's pitiful.

2109
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:10,500
(Kian84, do you like it?)

2110
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:12,640
We saw it. It's all caught by the camera.

2111
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:13,640
You were studying his face.

2112
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:15,040
Si Eon studied my face?

2113
01:21:15,140 --> 01:21:17,110
If that was bad...

2114
01:21:17,110 --> 01:21:19,080
- Of course.
- You'd feel bad.

2115
01:21:19,780 --> 01:21:22,720
(He quietly scans Kian84's reaction.)

2116
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:24,120
I hope it's good.

2117
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:25,890
It better be good.

2118
01:21:27,690 --> 01:21:28,920
- He approves.
- Good.

2119
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:30,360
He exclaimed.

2120
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:33,530
- It's good.
- This is good. I'm glad to hear that.

2121
01:21:34,490 --> 01:21:36,130
What if it was bad
when we came all the way here?

2122
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:39,300
Things wouldn't be good.

2123
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:40,830
- That's a pass.
- That must've been relieving...

2124
01:21:40,830 --> 01:21:42,900
- when he exclaimed.
- I was relieved.

2125
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:45,710
(Yunnan rice noodles arrive.)

2126
01:21:45,710 --> 01:21:47,510
You ordered the yak meat.

2127
01:21:48,010 --> 01:21:50,310
- What's this?
- Why are there so many toppings?

2128
01:21:51,310 --> 01:21:52,750
I ordered regular beef.

2129
01:21:52,850 --> 01:21:54,950
Do you get a little bit of everything?
That's amazing.

2130
01:21:55,450 --> 01:21:58,420
(In the red suantang)

2131
01:21:58,420 --> 01:22:01,190
If this is 15 dollars for everything,
it's not expensive.

2132
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:03,260
Add everything.

2133
01:22:03,260 --> 01:22:04,290
(Adding all the toppings?)

2134
01:22:04,290 --> 01:22:06,130
It's like shabu-shabu.

2135
01:22:06,730 --> 01:22:09,100
Do you boil it on the spot?

2136
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:10,560
- It was similar to mala xiang guo.
- That's unique.

2137
01:22:10,660 --> 01:22:12,200
You can only try it there.

2138
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:13,400
That's a good find.

2139
01:22:13,700 --> 01:22:15,270
I'll try it my way.

2140
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:18,170
This is...

2141
01:22:18,170 --> 01:22:20,670
from Yangpyeong hangover soup.

2142
01:22:21,210 --> 01:22:23,640
- Hey, this is beef omasum.
- Beef omasum.

2143
01:22:24,410 --> 01:22:26,280
This is fish.

2144
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:27,280
(Various toppings)

2145
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:28,480
The yak meat is the main ingredient.

2146
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,850
(The yak meat he tried with Tamang before)

2147
01:22:30,850 --> 01:22:31,850
This too.

2148
01:22:31,850 --> 01:22:32,850
(Adding all the ingredients)

2149
01:22:32,850 --> 01:22:34,490
It was fun to add everything myself.

2150
01:22:34,990 --> 01:22:36,520
And the noodles.

2151
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:39,860
The noodles look really good.

2152
01:22:40,430 --> 01:22:42,800
These noodles are firm
because they're rice noodles.

2153
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:43,800
I know.

2154
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:45,900
It looks good.

2155
01:22:46,830 --> 01:22:47,830
(Stir it to cook, and it's ready to eat.)

2156
01:22:47,830 --> 01:22:48,840
Let's try it.

2157
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:52,240
(Cooling)

2158
01:22:52,910 --> 01:22:53,910
(Slurping)

2159
01:22:53,910 --> 01:22:55,210
(Oh, it's hot.)

2160
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:00,310
- What's wrong?
- The noodles got in my eyes.

2161
01:23:00,510 --> 01:23:01,980
(Blowing his nose)

2162
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:04,150
- Do you like it?
- Yes, it's good.

2163
01:23:05,890 --> 01:23:06,890
That's a relief.

2164
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:10,960
(This time, they try the soup.)

2165
01:23:12,230 --> 01:23:14,460
(Exclaiming)

2166
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:18,200
This soup is really good.
How can it taste like this?

2167
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,600
- It was really good.
- That looks spicy.

2168
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:21,870
It was darn good.

2169
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:23,700
I'm craving soju.

2170
01:23:23,700 --> 01:23:25,910
It reminds me of tom yum kung.

2171
01:23:25,910 --> 01:23:27,310
Right. It is kind of like tom yum kung.

2172
01:23:27,740 --> 01:23:30,580
It tastes like malatang in yukgaejang.

2173
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:32,450
Yukgae mala?

2174
01:23:33,350 --> 01:23:34,410
Yukgae mala noodles?

2175
01:23:35,650 --> 01:23:37,920
I think this is the best food
I've had so far on this trip.

2176
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:38,920
- Really?
- Really?

2177
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:40,820
- It was really good.
- We should go too.

2178
01:23:40,820 --> 01:23:42,390
- I want to try it.
- I can't believe I missed it.

2179
01:23:43,660 --> 01:23:45,230
Oh, no. After all that hardship.

2180
01:23:45,230 --> 01:23:48,260
When we were planning things,
we didn't feed him.

2181
01:23:48,260 --> 01:23:50,000
(Regretful)

2182
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:52,700
What's this?

2183
01:23:54,030 --> 01:23:56,370
- Mushrooms.
- But it doesn't look like a mushroom.

2184
01:23:58,770 --> 01:23:59,770
I don't know what this is.

2185
01:24:02,810 --> 01:24:04,510
(While Kian84 tries the wild bacteria...)

2186
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:09,680
What's wrong?

2187
01:24:12,890 --> 01:24:13,890
(Laughing)

2188
01:24:13,890 --> 01:24:14,890
Thank you.

2189
01:24:14,890 --> 01:24:18,060
She said,
"Hi, do you need anything else, handsome?"

2190
01:24:18,060 --> 01:24:20,630
(Handsome?)

2191
01:24:20,930 --> 01:24:22,260
Thank you.

2192
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:24,530
- Did you see that?
- What?

2193
01:24:24,630 --> 01:24:26,430
"Do you need anything else, handsome?"

2194
01:24:28,330 --> 01:24:29,840
- Why aren't you answering me?
- They eat this.

2195
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:32,340
What? The translation...

2196
01:24:32,970 --> 01:24:35,240
(It must've been mistranslated.)

2197
01:24:35,510 --> 01:24:37,480
I don't know how to react
when you do that.

2198
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:38,610
(Does he mean it?)

2199
01:24:39,950 --> 01:24:40,980
What's this, Kian84?

2200
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:43,520
Don't eat that. That was in my mouth.

2201
01:24:46,090 --> 01:24:47,390
What are you doing?

2202
01:24:47,490 --> 01:24:48,590
- Why did you put that in mine?
- You are like "Dumb and Dumber."

2203
01:24:48,590 --> 01:24:49,660
They look like they're putting on a skit.

2204
01:24:49,660 --> 01:24:51,090
(The jean-on-jean couple has
unnecessarily perfect teamwork.)

2205
01:24:51,620 --> 01:24:52,990
(When Si Eon was enjoying the flattery...)

2206
01:24:52,990 --> 01:24:54,690
- Oh, that's when.
- "Flattery."

2207
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:57,760
(He gave birth to a baby cartilage
in secret.)

2208
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:59,630
There was a bone in the meat.

2209
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:03,000
There was a bone in the meat.

2210
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,770
Are you sure that wasn't reversed?

2211
01:25:05,340 --> 01:25:07,740
(He spat it out like it was reversed.)

2212
01:25:10,410 --> 01:25:12,710
(He put it next to fried beef.)

2213
01:25:12,710 --> 01:25:14,250
I thought he had finished it.

2214
01:25:14,810 --> 01:25:17,150
He has no common sense.

2215
01:25:17,150 --> 01:25:19,390
There's one left.

2216
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:22,020
(Feeling leery)

2217
01:25:22,220 --> 01:25:23,220
It's good.

2218
01:25:23,220 --> 01:25:24,990
You're like family.

2219
01:25:25,490 --> 01:25:30,100
I have a feeling that
Pani Bottle is enjoying his meal alone.

2220
01:25:31,830 --> 01:25:34,200
He kept sleeping because he was tired.

2221
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:35,700
I was ill.

2222
01:25:35,700 --> 01:25:36,770
You were tired.

2223
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:40,470
We asked him too much.

2224
01:25:41,070 --> 01:25:42,080
It was you.

2225
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:43,980
- You ask him a lot too.
- I don't.

2226
01:25:43,980 --> 01:25:46,710
You're like,
"Pani Bottle. Will you book the hotel?"

2227
01:25:46,910 --> 01:25:49,450
(Input)

2228
01:25:49,450 --> 01:25:51,220
(Output)

2229
01:25:51,580 --> 01:25:52,690
He's right.

2230
01:25:53,190 --> 01:25:54,590
He's almost like an AI.

2231
01:25:54,820 --> 01:25:55,820
- Look.
- Okay.

2232
01:25:55,820 --> 01:25:57,560
Did I ask him to call a taxi...

2233
01:25:57,560 --> 01:25:58,860
or book a hotel?

2234
01:25:58,860 --> 01:25:59,860
This is what you say.

2235
01:26:00,330 --> 01:26:01,490
"How do we get there?"

2236
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,360
Then Pani Bottle goes,
"I'll call the taxi."

2237
01:26:03,730 --> 01:26:06,430
(Do we have to call the taxi?)

2238
01:26:06,830 --> 01:26:09,100
(The sneaky guy orders Pani Bottle
as if he's curious.)

2239
01:26:09,570 --> 01:26:12,310
- I'm only asking.
- "How do we get to the hotel?"

2240
01:26:12,310 --> 01:26:13,940
Whereas you put him in trouble.

2241
01:26:14,910 --> 01:26:18,110
Let's have Pani Bottle rest
for the rest of the afternoon.

2242
01:26:19,180 --> 01:26:23,950
At 4:30 p.m.,
let's visit the place I want to visit.

2243
01:26:24,220 --> 01:26:25,220
Where's that?

2244
01:26:26,220 --> 01:26:28,890
I can guarantee you that you'll like it.

2245
01:26:29,590 --> 01:26:32,030
You could say it's a place meant for you.

2246
01:26:32,030 --> 01:26:33,160
What? What is it?

2247
01:26:33,390 --> 01:26:34,390
Are we going to the Buddhist university?

2248
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:36,200
There's none around here.

2249
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:39,730
(Hiding something)

2250
01:26:39,730 --> 01:26:40,830
Are we going to the Buddhist university?

2251
01:26:40,830 --> 01:26:43,170
I'm sorry, but we have to drive there.

2252
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:46,170
Does it take like five hours or something?

2253
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:48,940
You haven't unpacked yet, have you?

2254
01:26:51,210 --> 01:26:52,710
What's the point of booking the lodging?

2255
01:26:52,710 --> 01:26:54,050
(There's no break in our memories.)

2256
01:26:54,450 --> 01:26:55,450
I finished it.

2257
01:26:56,780 --> 01:26:58,720
I gained all that weight I lost in Nepal.

2258
01:26:58,720 --> 01:26:59,720
(They finished the rice noodles.)

2259
01:27:00,550 --> 01:27:01,590
- That was good.
- That was good.

2260
01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:04,260
That was good.

2261
01:27:05,090 --> 01:27:06,560
(Going back to the lodging
to get Pani Bottle)

2262
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:07,590
Did you pay already?

2263
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:10,230
How was the food?

2264
01:27:10,230 --> 01:27:12,930
That was the best on this trip for me.

2265
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:16,840
Pani Bottle.

2266
01:27:17,540 --> 01:27:18,540
Pani Bottle.

2267
01:27:18,540 --> 01:27:19,570
(The eldest looks for Pani Bottle
as soon as he returns.)

2268
01:27:19,570 --> 01:27:21,110
- Pani Bottle.
- Pani Bottle's sleeping.

2269
01:27:21,110 --> 01:27:22,480
- Why are you shocked?
- Pani Bottle.

2270
01:27:22,580 --> 01:27:25,080
He's like, "Yes. Do you need help?"

2271
01:27:25,310 --> 01:27:27,580
"I'm sorry. I slept in."

2272
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:29,080
"Yes, master."

2273
01:27:30,020 --> 01:27:32,320
- "What do you need?"
- "Master?"

2274
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:33,790
"Just give me your order."

2275
01:27:33,790 --> 01:27:35,090
"Please don't hit me."

2276
01:27:35,090 --> 01:27:36,320
"I'll grab the taxi."

2277
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:38,360
You were startled.

2278
01:27:38,590 --> 01:27:39,890
We're back. Did you eat?

2279
01:27:39,890 --> 01:27:41,660
No. I just rested.

2280
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:44,100
- Let's go, Pani Bottle. Are you coming?
- Where did you go?

2281
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:46,300
Where are we going?

2282
01:27:47,630 --> 01:27:49,300
A place I want to go.

2283
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:51,770
Let me get ready.

2284
01:27:51,770 --> 01:27:53,810
(He doesn't know where he's going,
but he still gets ready.)

2285
01:27:55,910 --> 01:27:57,280
(Feeling refreshed)

2286
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:59,150
- Are you okay?
- I feel so refreshed.

2287
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:00,880
- Did you sleep?
- Yes.

2288
01:28:01,180 --> 01:28:03,280
(His eyes are shining again.)

2289
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:05,520
The place I want to go closes at 5:30 p.m.
We have to hurry up.

2290
01:28:05,950 --> 01:28:08,420
If you tell me where we're going,
I'll call the taxi.

2291
01:28:08,420 --> 01:28:10,060
- His voice is gone.
- Oh, no.

2292
01:28:10,060 --> 01:28:11,920
I can't watch it anymore.

2293
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:16,760
- I feel so bad for him.
- Watch what I say next.

2294
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:18,870
I'll call the taxi. Don't do it.

2295
01:28:19,170 --> 01:28:20,870
- Did you make the wallet?
- What?

2296
01:28:20,870 --> 01:28:22,200
It's so pitiful because his voice is gone.

2297
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:24,170
- Did you make it?
- Now, I know how to spend money.

2298
01:28:24,170 --> 01:28:25,670
We can just call the taxi outside.

2299
01:28:25,670 --> 01:28:27,340
If I learn to call the taxi,
I can do everything.

2300
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:28,910
- We can call the taxi outside. Let's go.
- But...

2301
01:28:29,010 --> 01:28:30,010
I'll grab it then.

2302
01:28:30,110 --> 01:28:31,680
- The taxi...
- I can do that too.

2303
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:33,150
Don't call it. Let's just grab one.

2304
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:35,650
- But...
- You can rest.

2305
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:38,420
There's a taxi coming.

2306
01:28:38,420 --> 01:28:39,890
The older ones are stepping forward
for you.

2307
01:28:40,350 --> 01:28:41,550
Do you have the address?

2308
01:28:41,650 --> 01:28:43,520
- Taxi!
- We were going old-fashioned.

2309
01:28:43,620 --> 01:28:44,620
Taxi.

2310
01:28:44,860 --> 01:28:46,430
- He's taking us to where he wants to go.
- Taxi.

2311
01:28:46,430 --> 01:28:47,990
(They decided to trust and follow Si Eon.)

2312
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:52,100
- You found one.
- When I did this,

2313
01:28:52,100 --> 01:28:53,500
- they just stopped in front of me.
- Really?

2314
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:54,500
Nice.

2315
01:28:54,870 --> 01:28:57,170
Wait. The address is in English.
What do I do?

2316
01:28:57,170 --> 01:28:58,170
(Facing a crisis already)

2317
01:28:58,870 --> 01:29:00,470
(Showing the address out of nowhere)

2318
01:29:00,470 --> 01:29:01,470
This way.

2319
01:29:02,940 --> 01:29:05,210
- Okay?
- It's good.

2320
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:07,610
Hey, they understand you.

2321
01:29:07,610 --> 01:29:09,750
- You just need to give it a try.
- Yes.

2322
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:11,680
Where are we going?

2323
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:15,050
I'll take the lead today.

2324
01:29:15,250 --> 01:29:16,260
Where are we going?

2325
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:18,730
Si Eon said it was a secret.

2326
01:29:19,190 --> 01:29:22,800
You might like it or not like it.

2327
01:29:24,100 --> 01:29:27,430
Si Eon was taking us somewhere,
but I had no idea where we were going.

2328
01:29:28,230 --> 01:29:29,500
We're leaving the city.

2329
01:29:29,500 --> 01:29:30,840
(Getting far from the city)

2330
01:29:31,470 --> 01:29:32,970
Where are we going?

2331
01:29:34,340 --> 01:29:35,510
Is it a museum or what?

2332
01:29:35,980 --> 01:29:37,710
A museum? Or a park?

2333
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:39,780
It's very secluded.

2334
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:42,220
- We're here.
- I'll pay.

2335
01:29:42,220 --> 01:29:43,380
(They arrived at the mysterious place.)

2336
01:29:43,380 --> 01:29:44,450
Three, six, four, zero?

2337
01:29:45,490 --> 01:29:47,690
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2338
01:29:48,250 --> 01:29:49,490
I see people going in.

2339
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:51,960
What's this place?

2340
01:29:52,690 --> 01:29:55,060
Honestly, I'm not sure if you'll like it.

2341
01:29:56,130 --> 01:29:57,460
- But Kian84.
- Yes?

2342
01:29:57,560 --> 01:29:58,600
This is for you.

2343
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:00,470
What does Kian84 like?

2344
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:02,900
- Close your eyes and follow me.
- Okay.

2345
01:30:03,870 --> 01:30:06,410
(They approach the entrance.)

2346
01:30:06,410 --> 01:30:07,970
A wedding?

2347
01:30:09,780 --> 01:30:12,810
- Come here.
- Okay.

2348
01:30:12,810 --> 01:30:14,180
I think this is...

2349
01:30:14,180 --> 01:30:15,480
Pani Bottle noticed it.

2350
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:18,220
I saw it, so I didn't say anything.

2351
01:30:18,220 --> 01:30:20,920
- You knew?
- It's a meaningful place.

2352
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:23,790
(What is this place?)

2353
01:30:23,790 --> 01:30:25,830
- Is it a botanical garden?
- Come in.

2354
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:27,830
Are these canola flowers?

2355
01:30:28,130 --> 01:30:29,500
These are canola flowers.

2356
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:31,530
- That's beautiful.
- They bloomed everywhere.

2357
01:30:31,530 --> 01:30:33,370
They must've bloomed at Han River too.

2358
01:30:33,470 --> 01:30:34,470
Can you find them by the Han River too?

2359
01:30:34,970 --> 01:30:36,670
- This is barley.
- That's barley?

2360
01:30:36,670 --> 01:30:38,470
Yes. It's either wheat or barley.

2361
01:30:38,470 --> 01:30:40,770
That place was really beautiful.

2362
01:30:41,240 --> 01:30:45,610
(Wheat and barley are growing)

2363
01:30:47,380 --> 01:30:49,680
The windmills look great.

2364
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:52,720
- It's a beautiful sight.
- Yes.

2365
01:30:53,320 --> 01:30:54,420
The weather is...

2366
01:30:54,420 --> 01:30:56,960
(It looks even more exotic
because of the amazing weather.)

2367
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:58,560
The mountain looks amazing.

2368
01:31:00,190 --> 01:31:02,030
All the seasons can be seen.

2369
01:31:02,030 --> 01:31:03,200
(Yulong Snow Mountain
with the outstanding view)

2370
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:04,260
That's nice.

2371
01:31:04,260 --> 01:31:05,700
(Yulong Snow Mountain
with the outstanding view)

2372
01:31:07,330 --> 01:31:09,440
We get to visit a botanical garden often
with Kian84.

2373
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,000
It's beautiful.

2374
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:12,970
The flower smell.

2375
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:15,370
- Nice.
- You can smell the flowers.

2376
01:31:15,780 --> 01:31:16,810
- Right.
- It's so rich.

2377
01:31:16,810 --> 01:31:18,780
(The rich scent of the flowers
gives joy to their noses.)

2378
01:31:18,780 --> 01:31:20,780
It was rich like fabric softeners.

2379
01:31:21,250 --> 01:31:23,020
- What kind of flowers are these?
- They smell so nice.

2380
01:31:23,620 --> 01:31:26,050
- It was nice to visit nice places.
- The flowers smell nice.

2381
01:31:26,050 --> 01:31:27,090
There was a reason it was nice.

2382
01:31:27,220 --> 01:31:30,460
I didn't expect three men to be so happy
to see flowers.

2383
01:31:30,460 --> 01:31:32,330
Everyone likes flowers.

2384
01:31:32,330 --> 01:31:33,330
(The botanical garden is filled
with the scent of flowers.)

2385
01:31:33,630 --> 01:31:34,760
- Over there.
- There's a wedding.

2386
01:31:35,830 --> 01:31:38,330
- Gosh.
- Oh, the wedding photo.

2387
01:31:39,370 --> 01:31:41,400
They're really getting married.

2388
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:43,400
There were mostly newlywed couples.

2389
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:45,300
It's worth taking wedding photos there.

2390
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:47,140
(There are grooms and brides here...)

2391
01:31:47,970 --> 01:31:49,980
(and there.)

2392
01:31:49,980 --> 01:31:51,040
- Pani...
- Wait a minute.

2393
01:31:52,110 --> 01:31:53,850
- I thought that was Pani Bottle.
- I thought that was Pani Bottle.

2394
01:31:53,850 --> 01:31:54,910
- Who?
- I thought that was Pani Bottle...

2395
01:31:54,910 --> 01:31:55,980
- on the left.
- Really?

2396
01:31:56,220 --> 01:31:57,980
- What?
- Isn't that Pani Bottle?

2397
01:31:57,980 --> 01:32:00,220
(Groom?)

2398
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:01,720
Am I seeing things?

2399
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:03,820
Yes. They look the same.

2400
01:32:03,820 --> 01:32:05,590
Hey, what are you doing in there?

2401
01:32:05,590 --> 01:32:07,430
- We're both short.
- No.

2402
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:09,860
You should take your wedding photo there.

2403
01:32:09,860 --> 01:32:11,700
When I get married,
I must not wear sunglasses.

2404
01:32:13,700 --> 01:32:14,700
I'd look like him.

2405
01:32:15,940 --> 01:32:18,140
(There are grooms and brides here...)

2406
01:32:18,370 --> 01:32:20,540
(and there.)

2407
01:32:21,340 --> 01:32:24,840
(People are taking wedding photos
everywhere.)

2408
01:32:25,710 --> 01:32:26,850
(It's famous among grooms and brides.)

2409
01:32:26,850 --> 01:32:28,750
The photos will look great wherever.

2410
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:32,450
(We're getting married.)

2411
01:32:32,450 --> 01:32:34,420
- That's great.
- Congratulations.

2412
01:32:37,690 --> 01:32:38,720
What?

2413
01:32:40,330 --> 01:32:42,090
Are we here to take wedding photos?

2414
01:32:43,630 --> 01:32:45,800
I didn't know why we were there.

2415
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:47,930
- I wondered why he brought us there.
- You felt lonely.

2416
01:32:47,930 --> 01:32:49,200
(It's not Pani Bottle.)

2417
01:32:49,670 --> 01:32:52,310
Where are... Hey, I can't find them.

2418
01:32:52,310 --> 01:32:53,840
- Who?
- That guy.

2419
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:54,940
(The guy they saw at the entrance)

2420
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:57,080
(Let me see.)

2421
01:32:58,280 --> 01:32:59,280
Wait.

2422
01:32:59,380 --> 01:33:00,780
Over there.

2423
01:33:01,150 --> 01:33:02,380
Why are they so far?

2424
01:33:02,380 --> 01:33:03,880
- What's there?
- What's there?

2425
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:05,020
(While the brothers are whispering...)

2426
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:07,590
Look. The couples are multiplying.

2427
01:33:08,190 --> 01:33:10,890
- The couples are multiplying.
- Keep going.

2428
01:33:11,290 --> 01:33:13,660
Kian84, we have to go to the end.

2429
01:33:14,590 --> 01:33:16,630
But people are taking pictures.

2430
01:33:17,030 --> 01:33:18,330
Let's walk slowly.

2431
01:33:21,130 --> 01:33:22,370
- Kian84.
- Yes?

2432
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:24,940
Over there.

2433
01:33:24,940 --> 01:33:27,410
(Over there.)

2434
01:33:28,670 --> 01:33:29,940
Look carefully.

2435
01:33:29,940 --> 01:33:31,180
(All he sees are the couples.)

2436
01:33:32,380 --> 01:33:33,380
Wait.

2437
01:33:33,810 --> 01:33:35,080
- Wait.
- He found something.

2438
01:33:35,720 --> 01:33:36,720
Si Eon.

2439
01:33:36,920 --> 01:33:37,980
Isn't that an alpaca?

2440
01:33:39,450 --> 01:33:40,490
You finally found it.

2441
01:33:41,820 --> 01:33:42,890
Alpaca...

2442
01:33:42,890 --> 01:33:44,290
(Laughing)

2443
01:33:44,990 --> 01:33:47,790
(Hiding among the couples)

2444
01:33:47,790 --> 01:33:50,530
- Over there.
- Oh, my gosh. It's so cute.

2445
01:33:50,530 --> 01:33:55,870
(Alpacas)

2446
01:33:56,440 --> 01:33:58,340
(Happy)

2447
01:33:58,540 --> 01:33:59,610
You finally saw it.

2448
01:33:59,610 --> 01:34:02,110
Alpaca. It's so cute.

2449
01:34:02,710 --> 01:34:04,240
- Kian84. We're here to see that.
- Yes?

2450
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:06,550
For real?

2451
01:34:06,550 --> 01:34:09,850
I felt so bad that
I didn't let you take photos in Peru.

2452
01:34:09,850 --> 01:34:11,920
Go hold its neck.

2453
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:13,450
Really?

2454
01:34:14,450 --> 01:34:16,390
(When they were traveling
in South America,)

2455
01:34:17,220 --> 01:34:20,060
(they ran into an alpaca on the street.)

2456
01:34:21,060 --> 01:34:23,400
(Kian84 wanted to take a picture with it.)

2457
01:34:24,630 --> 01:34:26,930
(But Si Eon was against it
in case they'd get ripped off.)

2458
01:34:26,930 --> 01:34:28,770
(Can I take a picture with the alpaca?)

2459
01:34:28,770 --> 01:34:30,340
(I want to take a picture
with the alpaca.)

2460
01:34:30,340 --> 01:34:31,840
(He couldn't move on.)

2461
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:33,470
He couldn't take his eyes off it.

2462
01:34:33,470 --> 01:34:35,840
You should've let him take one.
He wanted it so badly.

2463
01:34:35,940 --> 01:34:38,280
My wife blamed me so much at home.

2464
01:34:39,110 --> 01:34:41,150
For not letting him take a picture
with it.

2465
01:34:41,410 --> 01:34:44,280
So my wife knitted it. It's handmade.

2466
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:45,420
Oh, my gosh.

2467
01:34:45,620 --> 01:34:47,120
She's pretty good.

2468
01:34:47,120 --> 01:34:49,220
(He was soothed
by the handmade alpaca doll instead.)

2469
01:34:49,220 --> 01:34:50,290
I feel like I'm in Cusco.

2470
01:34:50,290 --> 01:34:51,460
(He was soothed
by the handmade alpaca doll instead.)

2471
01:34:52,460 --> 01:34:55,860
(Si Eon wanted to show him real alpacas.)

2472
01:34:56,260 --> 01:34:59,870
I heard there were alpacas.
So I took them there...

2473
01:34:59,870 --> 01:35:02,000
to take photos.

2474
01:35:02,100 --> 01:35:04,140
- That's touching.
- Yes.

2475
01:35:04,140 --> 01:35:06,670
- To show alpacas.
- You felt bad.

2476
01:35:06,670 --> 01:35:09,440
- You can take all the photos you want.
- You can take as many as you want.

2477
01:35:09,740 --> 01:35:11,240
- What a nice brother.
- My goodness.

2478
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:13,050
(Oh, yes!)

2479
01:35:13,680 --> 01:35:14,910
The alpaca is cute.

2480
01:35:14,910 --> 01:35:17,620
The other alpacas are busy.

2481
01:35:17,620 --> 01:35:19,450
Let's meet the one that's not busy.

2482
01:35:19,850 --> 01:35:21,020
The alpacas were busy.

2483
01:35:21,950 --> 01:35:23,560
I think that one's free.

2484
01:35:24,690 --> 01:35:27,160
(Me?)

2485
01:35:27,190 --> 01:35:31,060
That's so cute. What is that, a chair?

2486
01:35:32,700 --> 01:35:34,800
- Does it bite?
- Probably not.

2487
01:35:35,940 --> 01:35:36,970
- He...
- Look at the teeth.

2488
01:35:38,270 --> 01:35:39,310
Its front teeth are protruding.

2489
01:35:40,370 --> 01:35:41,440
Get close to it.

2490
01:35:42,810 --> 01:35:44,640
- Closer.
- Is it nice?

2491
01:35:44,910 --> 01:35:46,510
How do I know? This is my first time too.

2492
01:35:47,750 --> 01:35:50,120
(Scared84 approaches him slowly.)

2493
01:35:50,650 --> 01:35:51,650
(Spitting)

2494
01:35:51,650 --> 01:35:53,650
- Did he spit?
- He spat.

2495
01:35:53,820 --> 01:35:56,120
- He spat.
- He spat.

2496
01:35:56,120 --> 01:35:57,190
(Screaming)

2497
01:35:57,190 --> 01:35:58,260
- That's cute.
- Hey.

2498
01:35:58,460 --> 01:35:59,460
Maybe it doesn't like you.

2499
01:35:59,990 --> 01:36:02,060
There was a reason no one was around it.

2500
01:36:02,060 --> 01:36:04,130
If there's no one around the alpaca,
there's a reason.

2501
01:36:05,300 --> 01:36:06,700
- It's sensitive.
- It must be sensitive.

2502
01:36:07,170 --> 01:36:08,370
Let's get to know it.

2503
01:36:09,470 --> 01:36:10,540
It's cute.

2504
01:36:10,540 --> 01:36:11,870
(He approaches the alpaca again.)

2505
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:14,270
(Spitting)

2506
01:36:14,670 --> 01:36:16,040
- It hates it.
- It hates it.

2507
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:19,350
I tried to approach it like a dog.

2508
01:36:19,650 --> 01:36:20,710
But it didn't want me to touch it.

2509
01:36:21,380 --> 01:36:22,980
- Maybe I'm annoying.
- "Get lost."

2510
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:26,320
Them.
They stay still even if people touch them.

2511
01:36:27,250 --> 01:36:30,320
- All the alpacas were so busy.
- Of course. They're cute.

2512
01:36:30,690 --> 01:36:31,760
Anyway,

2513
01:36:32,730 --> 01:36:34,390
they look cute like poodles.

2514
01:36:34,590 --> 01:36:36,400
Yes. They all look fluffy.

2515
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:38,360
I think they had a haircut.

2516
01:36:39,700 --> 01:36:40,970
They look kind.

2517
01:36:42,970 --> 01:36:44,000
They're cute.

2518
01:36:44,470 --> 01:36:45,640
Are they a couple?

2519
01:36:46,910 --> 01:36:48,870
- A photo together?
- Stand in front of them.

2520
01:36:49,580 --> 01:36:51,180
(Approaching carefully)

2521
01:36:51,180 --> 01:36:52,180
Is it okay?

2522
01:36:54,610 --> 01:36:56,150
(Tapping)

2523
01:36:56,150 --> 01:36:57,680
(Tapping)

2524
01:36:57,680 --> 01:36:59,520
- So cute.
- They're all different.

2525
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:01,290
This one's still.

2526
01:37:01,490 --> 01:37:04,360
- They were kind.
- They don't even spit.

2527
01:37:05,360 --> 01:37:06,390
You're so cute.

2528
01:37:08,090 --> 01:37:09,600
How about this pose?

2529
01:37:10,230 --> 01:37:12,330
(He takes off his bag and fidgets.)

2530
01:37:15,370 --> 01:37:16,370
Why...

2531
01:37:16,970 --> 01:37:19,810
(What are you doing?)

2532
01:37:21,570 --> 01:37:22,640
You have the same bottom.

2533
01:37:23,740 --> 01:37:25,140
Stay just like that. It's perfect.

2534
01:37:25,240 --> 01:37:27,110
Finally,
he's taking a photo with the alpaca.

2535
01:37:28,010 --> 01:37:29,620
(Clicking)

2536
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:31,150
That one's gentle.

2537
01:37:31,150 --> 01:37:32,350
(Three alpacas are
taking a photo quietly.)

2538
01:37:32,350 --> 01:37:35,650
I'm sure he's the only one who took
a photo like that in the whole world.

2539
01:37:37,720 --> 01:37:40,090
- You finally had a photo with the alpaca.
- Finally.

2540
01:37:40,090 --> 01:37:42,090
- After 3 years.
- After 3 years.

2541
01:37:42,090 --> 01:37:44,500
(His wish of 3 years became the poster.)

2542
01:37:44,500 --> 01:37:46,330
(Smiling)

2543
01:37:46,870 --> 01:37:47,870
Good.

2544
01:37:49,870 --> 01:37:50,900
"Denim alpaca."

2545
01:37:51,700 --> 01:37:52,810
Is this the alpaca's poop?

2546
01:37:54,370 --> 01:37:55,980
It's probably a mix of their poop and mud.

2547
01:37:56,910 --> 01:37:57,980
I want to touch it.

2548
01:37:58,640 --> 01:38:00,410
- This one's gentle.
- It's gentle.

2549
01:38:00,410 --> 01:38:01,780
Stay there.

2550
01:38:02,180 --> 01:38:03,750
(Staring)

2551
01:38:04,280 --> 01:38:05,820
Its neck is so long.

2552
01:38:05,820 --> 01:38:07,290
- So cute.
- What are you doing?

2553
01:38:07,750 --> 01:38:08,790
I look like a gorilla.

2554
01:38:08,790 --> 01:38:11,420
Kian84, 1, 2...

2555
01:38:11,990 --> 01:38:13,660
(A gorilla and alpacas)

2556
01:38:13,660 --> 01:38:14,660
That's cute.

2557
01:38:15,530 --> 01:38:16,900
Can you take a picture of us?

2558
01:38:17,230 --> 01:38:19,470
We asked the cameraman
to take a picture of us.

2559
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:22,770
We must not scare them.
So walk behind them quietly and graze.

2560
01:38:22,770 --> 01:38:24,470
- We must not scare them.
- Of course.

2561
01:38:24,940 --> 01:38:27,140
Okay. Be quiet, so they won't be scared.

2562
01:38:28,610 --> 01:38:30,040
Oh, my goodness.

2563
01:38:31,580 --> 01:38:34,550
(The Three Brothers are crawling.)

2564
01:38:35,110 --> 01:38:37,480
Why do we have to crawl?

2565
01:38:38,380 --> 01:38:39,550
What did the other two do to deserve that?

2566
01:38:39,550 --> 01:38:40,590
(The other two)

2567
01:38:40,620 --> 01:38:41,650
Gosh. Poop.

2568
01:38:42,760 --> 01:38:44,390
- Poop?
- He stepped on the poop.

2569
01:38:44,820 --> 01:38:45,890
Oh, no.

2570
01:38:48,190 --> 01:38:51,130
- What are they doing?
- Don't eat that, Kian84.

2571
01:38:51,130 --> 01:38:52,560
You'd really eat it.

2572
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:53,800
It was full of poop.

2573
01:38:54,300 --> 01:38:56,600
(Visiting Pani Bottle)

2574
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:00,510
They're looking at me.

2575
01:39:01,240 --> 01:39:02,270
They're looking at me strangely.

2576
01:39:02,270 --> 01:39:03,310
They're like,
"I've never seen anyone like that before."

2577
01:39:04,310 --> 01:39:05,410
Let's wait until they graze.

2578
01:39:06,710 --> 01:39:09,620
- Are we grazing for real?
- Don't graze for real.

2579
01:39:11,120 --> 01:39:12,120
I feel like throwing up.

2580
01:39:13,450 --> 01:39:14,490
They're looking at me like I'm weird.

2581
01:39:15,620 --> 01:39:17,360
They're watching Pani Bottle.

2582
01:39:18,320 --> 01:39:19,990
It's looking at me.
I'm getting embarrassed.

2583
01:39:20,690 --> 01:39:21,730
Maybe it likes you.

2584
01:39:21,730 --> 01:39:22,800
(Are you here alone?)

2585
01:39:23,930 --> 01:39:25,330
(Smacking lips)

2586
01:39:25,830 --> 01:39:27,830
(I like you.)

2587
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:29,370
(While Pani Bottle
is drawing the alpaca's attention,)

2588
01:39:29,370 --> 01:39:30,370
It's grazing.

2589
01:39:31,240 --> 01:39:33,170
(the alpaca begins grazing.)

2590
01:39:33,510 --> 01:39:36,180
(They're grazing together.)

2591
01:39:37,680 --> 01:39:39,210
(Turning)

2592
01:39:39,550 --> 01:39:41,350
(The alpaca leaves.)

2593
01:39:41,550 --> 01:39:43,350
(Eating)

2594
01:39:43,580 --> 01:39:44,580
What are they doing?

2595
01:39:44,820 --> 01:39:46,950
What a sight for the alpacas.

2596
01:39:49,490 --> 01:39:50,560
I wonder what he thought about them.

2597
01:39:51,120 --> 01:39:53,330
(They draw the passersby's attention too.)

2598
01:39:54,060 --> 01:39:55,260
Get closer. Hurry.

2599
01:39:55,830 --> 01:39:57,000
Raise your bottom, Pani Bottle.

2600
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,030
(Raising)

2601
01:39:58,030 --> 01:40:00,030
- Raise your bottom.
- I did.

2602
01:40:00,100 --> 01:40:02,630
- Lift your head too.
- The bottoms like that?

2603
01:40:02,630 --> 01:40:05,170
- We wanted to stand in line.
- To take a picture from the back.

2604
01:40:05,200 --> 01:40:06,270
Who's taking the picture?

2605
01:40:06,270 --> 01:40:07,270
I don't know.

2606
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:08,540
It seems no one is.

2607
01:40:09,810 --> 01:40:10,810
(Alpacas and bottoms)

2608
01:40:10,810 --> 01:40:13,310
We won't be able to take a picture
like alpacas like that again.

2609
01:40:15,010 --> 01:40:16,420
What's going on?

2610
01:40:16,550 --> 01:40:19,450
- Pani Bottle is loved by alpacas.
- I know.

2611
01:40:19,720 --> 01:40:21,720
They began to recognize me
as their colleague.

2612
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:24,390
At this rate, people might take
their wedding photos with Pani Bottle.

2613
01:40:26,020 --> 01:40:28,190
(Jealous)

2614
01:40:28,590 --> 01:40:29,860
They were not coming to us.

2615
01:40:29,860 --> 01:40:30,930
(I like Pani Bottle.)

2616
01:40:31,830 --> 01:40:33,130
Now they got close.

2617
01:40:33,130 --> 01:40:34,130
(Blowing)

2618
01:40:34,130 --> 01:40:36,140
- It's blowing.
- It's how alpacas flirt.

2619
01:40:36,140 --> 01:40:37,800
I guess it likes him.

2620
01:40:38,070 --> 01:40:40,970
I guess they recognize a kind person.

2621
01:40:42,270 --> 01:40:44,640
(Sniffing)

2622
01:40:45,080 --> 01:40:46,850
- I got their poop on myself.
- I see.

2623
01:40:46,850 --> 01:40:48,450
After smelling the poop on me,

2624
01:40:48,610 --> 01:40:49,680
they come close to me.

2625
01:40:49,680 --> 01:40:51,120
- I see.
- They're smelling the poop.

2626
01:40:51,550 --> 01:40:53,050
- Is that so?
- "Is that so?"

2627
01:40:53,490 --> 01:40:54,890
How come he says, "Is that so?"

2628
01:40:54,890 --> 01:40:56,120
They recognize me as their buddy.

2629
01:40:57,960 --> 01:41:00,530
(After smelling the poop,)

2630
01:41:00,930 --> 01:41:02,230
(alpacas look for Pani Bottle only.)

2631
01:41:02,230 --> 01:41:04,430
It's amazing.
They look at Pani Bottle only.

2632
01:41:05,200 --> 01:41:07,600
(Bitter)

2633
01:41:08,170 --> 01:41:09,670
(The eldest gives it a try.)

2634
01:41:09,670 --> 01:41:11,040
He had poop on his hand.

2635
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:12,340
(Shaking its head)

2636
01:41:12,340 --> 01:41:14,210
- It's saying no to Si Eon.
- It doesn't like him.

2637
01:41:14,210 --> 01:41:15,210
It's saying no to Si Eon.

2638
01:41:15,940 --> 01:41:17,540
It clearly expresses its intent.

2639
01:41:17,540 --> 01:41:18,880
That's amazing.

2640
01:41:19,010 --> 01:41:20,180
Si Eon, there is a lot of poop here.

2641
01:41:20,180 --> 01:41:22,110
- "There is a lot of poop here."
- It's full of poop.

2642
01:41:22,110 --> 01:41:23,850
Get some poop on your lips
so that you can kiss the alpacas.

2643
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:26,350
What?

2644
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:28,120
(Clapping)

2645
01:41:28,120 --> 01:41:29,760
Kian84,
you finally had your wish come true.

2646
01:41:29,990 --> 01:41:31,360
The dream that didn't come true in Peru.

2647
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:34,090
I didn't need an apology.

2648
01:41:34,830 --> 01:41:38,330
I don't know
why Si Eon feels so sorry about it.

2649
01:41:38,630 --> 01:41:41,500
It's been about 2 years
since our 1st trip.

2650
01:41:41,630 --> 01:41:43,200
He's been talking about it
all along for two years.

2651
01:41:43,540 --> 01:41:44,670
It's fine.

2652
01:41:45,070 --> 01:41:47,810
Stop apologizing. It's fine. I'm okay.

2653
01:41:48,170 --> 01:41:51,440
Still, where the alpaca poop were,

2654
01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:53,410
we were rolling around
and making poses with alpacas.

2655
01:41:53,410 --> 01:41:56,220
I personally appreciated it,

2656
01:41:56,220 --> 01:41:57,550
and it felt warm.

2657
01:41:58,420 --> 01:42:00,390
He's receiving a proper apology.

2658
01:42:00,590 --> 01:42:02,390
I did that because I had the chance.

2659
01:42:02,390 --> 01:42:04,360
I appreciate that you thought about it.

2660
01:42:04,360 --> 01:42:05,420
That's true.

2661
01:42:05,890 --> 01:42:07,190
Stay healthy.

2662
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:09,430
You're going through a lot,
taking pictures with people.

2663
01:42:10,730 --> 01:42:13,330
In your next life,
I hope you reincarnate as humans.

2664
01:42:14,030 --> 01:42:15,070
Bye.

2665
01:42:16,540 --> 01:42:18,670
This was my favorite place on this trip.

2666
01:42:19,300 --> 01:42:20,640
This is the best place on this trip.

2667
01:42:20,640 --> 01:42:22,310
(This is the best place on this trip!)

2668
01:42:22,540 --> 01:42:24,880
(Sitting down)

2669
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:27,610
- We took a photo.
- Yes.

2670
01:42:27,610 --> 01:42:29,450
To be honest, I have no idea
what I'm going to do tomorrow.

2671
01:42:29,650 --> 01:42:32,350
I was going to go there with you.

2672
01:42:32,350 --> 01:42:34,650
- Where?
- The minority village.

2673
01:42:34,650 --> 01:42:36,890
- Here he goes again.
- The minority village, again.

2674
01:42:36,890 --> 01:42:37,960
He's obsessed with minority groups.

2675
01:42:37,960 --> 01:42:40,190
Find it on your phone.
You got the address earlier.

2676
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:43,060
(Aren't they minority groups?)

2677
01:42:43,830 --> 01:42:47,500
(He talked about minority groups
throughout the trip.)

2678
01:42:47,930 --> 01:42:49,030
(It's something like a minority sparrow.)

2679
01:42:49,030 --> 01:42:50,140
(Even a minority sparrow?)

2680
01:42:50,540 --> 01:42:53,140
(There are many minority groups
in Lijiang.)

2681
01:42:53,610 --> 01:42:56,480
(He found out about the Nakhi people
by chance.)

2682
01:42:56,980 --> 01:43:00,010
(Where can I meet the Nikhi people?)

2683
01:43:00,180 --> 01:43:01,810
(Although he's not familiar
with the name yet,)

2684
01:43:02,150 --> 01:43:05,280
(he begins to find the Nakhi people
in earnest.)

2685
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:07,650
(Here they are.)

2686
01:43:08,290 --> 01:43:10,390
(At last?)

2687
01:43:10,860 --> 01:43:14,630
(This afternoon, he got information
from the owner of the lodging.)

2688
01:43:14,630 --> 01:43:18,000
There's a village where real Nakhi people
live, which isn't a tourist attraction.

2689
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:19,830
Tomorrow we're going there.

2690
01:43:19,830 --> 01:43:20,930
(He decided to go meet the Nakhi people.)

2691
01:43:20,930 --> 01:43:23,400
We can't reach there
by public transportation.

2692
01:43:23,670 --> 01:43:25,200
Then we can sleep in the car.

2693
01:43:25,200 --> 01:43:26,840
- Sleep in the car?
- What did he say?

2694
01:43:26,840 --> 01:43:28,010
Where are you going to get a car?

2695
01:43:28,070 --> 01:43:30,280
A car? There are many taxis there.

2696
01:43:30,280 --> 01:43:31,280
- Si Eon.
- What?

2697
01:43:31,280 --> 01:43:32,710
I think this is our chance...

2698
01:43:32,740 --> 01:43:34,710
- to rent a car.
- I like that. I'm in!

2699
01:43:34,710 --> 01:43:37,080
Let's plan to rent a car,
and this evening,

2700
01:43:37,080 --> 01:43:38,920
- let's make a detailed plan.
- Yes.

2701
01:43:38,920 --> 01:43:39,920
All right.

2702
01:43:40,490 --> 01:43:42,190
A rental car. It's going to be so fun.

2703
01:43:42,190 --> 01:43:43,260
I feel so good.

2704
01:43:43,260 --> 01:43:44,360
(What will happen to the Three Brothers,
going deep into the Tea Horse Road?)

2705
01:43:45,820 --> 01:43:48,630
(A minority group living in Lijiang)

2706
01:43:49,730 --> 01:43:53,200

(The only hieroglyphics used
in the world now, Dongba script)

2709
01:44:02,410 --> 01:44:04,680
(The Nakhi people keep
the long-standing tradition.)

2710
01:44:05,380 --> 01:44:08,650
(They go searching for a Nakhi village.)

2711
01:44:08,650 --> 01:44:11,950
(What journey awaits the Three Brothers?)

2712
01:44:19,320 --> 01:44:21,190
(Riding on a beautiful road,)

2713
01:44:21,190 --> 01:44:23,330
(they hit the road on the Tea Horse Road.)

2714
01:44:23,700 --> 01:44:25,630
(What's that?)

2715
01:44:25,630 --> 01:44:27,570
The fence is all destroyed.

2716
01:44:27,900 --> 01:44:29,700
(If we get hit by the rock,
we'll pass away.)

2717
01:44:29,970 --> 01:44:33,740
(To make matters worse,
the only path is blocked.)

2718
01:44:34,170 --> 01:44:36,810
(It's not easy to enter
the Nakhi people's village.)

2719
01:44:36,810 --> 01:44:38,340
(Go for it.)

2720
01:44:38,340 --> 01:44:40,180
- This is wonderful.
- It's a good thing we came up here.

2721
01:44:40,650 --> 01:44:42,110
(After passing the arduous mountain path,)

2722
01:44:42,350 --> 01:44:43,820
(the sight of the Nakhi village
appears before them like a reward.)

2723
01:44:43,820 --> 01:44:47,320
(Now, he wishes to meet the Nakhi people.)

2724
01:44:47,690 --> 01:44:49,190
(A man crazy about Nakhi people)

2725
01:44:49,550 --> 01:44:51,490
(I want to meet the Nakhi people.)

2726
01:44:52,060 --> 01:44:55,360
(I can sleep where this family sleeps.)

2727
01:44:55,590 --> 01:44:58,400
(Nakhi84 is surrounded by Nakhi people.)

2728
01:44:58,600 --> 01:45:01,300
(Like grandsons
visiting relatives in the countryside,)

2729
01:45:01,700 --> 01:45:04,870
(they receive royal treatment.)

2730
01:45:05,200 --> 01:45:06,870
(In the life of a minority group
he always dreamed of,)

(he's being immersed.)

2732
01:45:08,670 --> 01:45:10,080
(You don't have to ask me if I'm fine.)

2733
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:11,310
(I'll take a rest when I need it.)

2734

What?

2742
01:45:28,830 --> 01:45:29,830
Amazing.

2743
01:45:29,830 --> 01:45:31,430
(I've never said that on a show.)
