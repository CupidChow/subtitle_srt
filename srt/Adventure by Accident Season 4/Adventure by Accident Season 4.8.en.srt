1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,410
A long and difficult journey
along the Tea Horse Road.

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:07,310
The journey on Adventure by Accident 4
is nearing its final chapter.

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:09,650
(Full of anticipation)

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:10,880
- Well done.
- It's the end!

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,750
Since today is our last day,

6
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,650
Si Eon brought boxed meals...

7
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,290
- for our staff.
- Boxed meals?

8
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:18,860
You're right. There they are.

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,660
For their hard work,

10
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:21,790
- I brought them boxed meals.
- That's sweet of you.

11
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:23,500
I heard that you brought
something for us too.

12
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,630
- Didn't you, Fairy Si Eon?
- I brought something...

13
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:28,800
- for you too.
- That's great.

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,600
- It's prepared by our surprise fairy.
- Please enjoy.

15
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,340
- Gosh.
- Thank you.

16
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,440
Cumin.

17
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,540
(Glossy)

18
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,380
- It's delicious.
- It's good.

19
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,550
- It's really delicious.
- Yes, it's delicious.

20
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,780
As we enjoy the food,

21
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,650
let's watch the end of Season Four's
journey on the Tea Horse Road,

22
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,350
which felt like a documentary.

23
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,860
Our last destination is Shangri-La.

24
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,290
- Yes.
- To our last destination.

25
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:53,560
Shangri-La.

26
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,690
(Looking around)

27
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,830
- What now?
- What is it?

28
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,200
- What?
- Was there an accident?

29
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,010
(A long line of stalled cars)

30
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,840
The road seems blocked.

31
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:14,350
(And on the other side)

32
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,680
(2 vehicles stand still
in the middle of the 1-way road.)

33
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,950
How will they handle this?

34
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,250
Here's the current situation.
The road suddenly got blocked.

35
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,990
When I got here,

36
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,630
I noticed that
the three-wheeler truck had broken down.

37
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:28,730
Oh, no.

38
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:33,100
The truck in the front tried to pull...

39
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,300
the broken truck with this rope.

40
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,570
However, the rope broke.

41
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,480
Even if the road cleared,

42
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,380
going back and forth wouldn't be easy.

43
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:52,120
Back in the day, this place was...

44
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,620
traveled by horses, donkeys, and oxen.

45
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,660
The road is in bad condition
because it isn't paved.

46
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,330
How did people travel here in the past?

47
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,530
Cars are completely backed up behind us.
What do we do?

48
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,770
More cars keep coming.

49
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:10,900
Since I was driving,
I waited inside the car.

50
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,810
(They try to pull up the truck
behind them.)

51
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:17,540
The wheels are slipping.

52
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,710
(The wheels spin without advancing.)

53
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,450
Pushing it from behind could work.

54
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,780
- Upward...
- He's pushing it alone.

55
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,590
(Traffic problems arose
during every trip.)

56
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,290
(During their trip to South America)

57
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:35,760
(A traffic jam that was a total nightmare)

58
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,730
(Kian84's wish that he had then)

59
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,430
(You know the intersection
with the traffic jam today?)

60
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:44,270
(I want to help with the traffic control.)

61
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:47,540
(Their trip to India after that)

62
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,710
(Colliding)

63
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,950
(A collision with the median barrier)

64
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,580
(Come on.)

65
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,650
"Come on?"

66
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:02,720
(Slowly.)

67
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,760
"Slowly."

68
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,760
He'd get out of the car anywhere
in the world to control the traffic.

69
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,230
Let's push it from the back.

70
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,160
All right. On the Tea Horse Road.

71
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,170
(Also dispatched on the Tea Horse Road)

72
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,700
My love, traffic jam.

73
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,070
The man who controls traffic by accident.

74
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,970
I get excited
when I see traffic congestion.

75
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,970
There's an explosion of dopamine.

76
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,440
The deity of traffic control.

77
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,480
- The deity of TC.
- "The deity of TC?"

78
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,680
(He's the deity of traffic control.)

79
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,650
(Ready for traffic control)

80
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,950
Go.

81
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,490
- One, two.
- One, two,

82
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:36,350
three.

83
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,290
(Grunting)

84
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,290
(Shouting)

85
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:41,860
(Slipping)

86
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,860
Be careful.

87
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,330
(Pushing with all their might)

88
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:48,370
- The road is quite steep.
- Right.

89
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,370
Go.

90
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,940
- It's moving forward a little.
- Yes.

91
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,140
Yes.

92
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:57,610
- Push.
- It's moving.

93
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:58,880
- It's moving.
- There it goes.

94
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,210
It's moving.

95
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,420
(Happy)

96
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,720
- Keep moving.
- It's moving.

97
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,460
It's moving.

98
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,220
Goodness.

99
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,260
- It was impossible without the push.
- It was impossible.

100
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,660
(Smiling proudly)

101
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,430
(The vehicle climbs uphill with momentum.)

102
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:23,400
(Kian84,
we don't need to push it anymore.)

103
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,040
- That was hard.
- He did it.

104
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,170
(He controlled traffic
on the Tea Horse Road.)

105
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,710
He's the deity of traffic control, indeed.

106
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:33,810
That was hard.

107
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:34,950
(The elderly also worked hard.)

108
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,880
- It was very thrilling.
- It felt amazing.

109
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,650
- I'm proud of us.
- Yes.

110
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,660
What a relief.

111
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,520
The Tea Horse Road...

112
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,030
Let's get back on the road to Shangri-La.

113
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:51,200
- The road is cleared. Let's go.
- Goodness.

114
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,130
I'm sweating so much.

115
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:56,500
- Kian84, I'm so exhausted.
- Yes.

116
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,170
Take a nap.

117
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,140
- Take a nap, Kian84.
- Okay.

118
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:01,810
- He's tired.
- He looks so tired.

119
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,440
- Aren't you tired, Pani Bottle?
- I'm fine.

120
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:09,150
(After a tough experience
on the Tea Horse Road)

121
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,050
- The road is finally paved.
- Yes.

122
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,750
The paved road isn't wide either.
It's very curvy.

123
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,660
- I'm grateful that you can move forward.
- Right.

124
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,690
(The Three Brothers head to Shangri-La.)

125
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,340
Pani Bottle,
we're almost there, aren't we?

126
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,700
We have 26 minutes to go.

127
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,640
Gosh, well done driving.

128
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,470
We climbed up a lot.

129
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,940
We're at an altitude of 3,400m.

130
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,910
If I get to do the five-point prostration,

131
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:44,120
I'll pray for my family and friends.

132
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,720
I'll pray for their happiness.

133
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,150
"Five-point prostration?

134
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,290
(Before going on the trip)

135
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,260
(I've heard
of the five-point prostration.)

136
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,230
(It's more intense than
prostration after three steps.)

137
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,860
It's a type of bow.

138
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,660
(Kian84 was interested
in the 5-point prostration.)

139
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:03,130
(I've wanted to go and do that.)

140
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,100
Like that?

141
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,510
(Five-point prostration)

142
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:10,710
Five-point prostration is a Buddhist
practice of bowing by fully touching...

143
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:14,310
the ground with 5 parts of the body,
2 knees, 2 elbows, and forehead,

144
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,610
(A Buddhist practice of bowing)

145
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,350
You lower the body and mind
to express humility and reverence.

146
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,420
It's one of the deepest rituals
in Tibetan Buddhism.

147
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,750
(A Tibetan Buddhist ritual
to express humility and reverence)

148
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,070
You have to be informed. You can't do it
without understanding anything.

149
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,170
Isn't it better
to do it with an instructor?

150
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,540
A temple where we can practice
the five-point prostration.

151
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,310
I'd like to see them do it.

152
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,010
In the documentary, you see...

153
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:53,520
the pilgrims move forward by practicing...

154
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:57,320
the five-point prostration
on the trade route.

155
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,260
For about a millennium, pilgrims have
traveled thousands of kilometers...

156
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,360
along the Tea Horse Road
by practicing the five-point prostration.

157
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,030
Gosh, that's impressive.

158
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:07,430
Are these buildings
that we're seeing Tibetan?

159
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,430
A few of them.

160
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,940
- Look at that tower.
- What?

161
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,440
- A pagoda. We passed it on the right.
- Where?

162
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,210
It's a Tibetan pagoda.

163
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,940
I see a golden temple up ahead.

164
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,350
- Isn't it called...
- It's a stupa.

165
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,980
- "Stupa?"
- Yes, stupa.

166
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,920
That one looks different.

167
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,150
When we got closer to this area,
we could feel the vibe of Tibet.

168
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,520
Right.

169
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,590
- That must be the city we're approaching.
- Goodness.

170
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:36,930
It's a very lively city.

171
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:42,030
Even the apartment buildings look Tibetan.

172
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,300
- Where are the apartments?
- They're over there.

173
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,600
That apartment building.
(Here.)

174
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:50,980
The original name isn't Shangri-La.

175
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,710
It's marked as Deqin on the map.

176
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,150
In 2001, the Chinese government
changed the name to Shangri-La...

177
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,420
for tourism purposes.

178
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,520
Shangri-La is a fictional name
from a novel,

179
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,750
and not an actual geographical location.
That's why it wasn't odd to adopt it.

180
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:07,490
What is the novel about?

181
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,860
Let me tell you about it.

182
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,830
(A novel called "Lost Horizon")

183
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:11,860
I looked it up.

184
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,830
There was an imaginary country
called Shangri-La.

185
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:18,200
Foreigners stumbled upon it by accident.

186
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,400
To them, it was a land out of a dream.

187
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,040
They never imagined...

188
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,910
to find such a place deep in the valley.

189
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:28,450
They started calling it Shangri-La.

190
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:34,890
(A city known as the plateau
above the sky)

191
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,660
(An important hub of trade
on the Tea Horse Road)

192
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,260
(Where Tibetan culture is deeply rooted)

193
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:45,530
(Where Songzanlin Monastery,
a Tibetan monastery, is located)

194
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:49,730
(A holy place of Tibetan Buddhist culture)

195
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,970
(Shangri-La)

196
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,570
It's still nice to see
a different world every day.

197
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:59,340
No world overlaps.

198
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,450
How is it possible to see
a different world every day?

199
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:03,920
- The long drive is paying off.
- Yes.

200
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,950
That's true.

201
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,050
- What's the altitude?
- It's 3,300m.

202
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:10,120
We're at a similar altitude as Cusco.

203
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,620
My first time in Cusco was very hard.
Now, I don't feel a thing.

204
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:14,960
He must have gotten used to it.

205
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,960
(Recalling memories
from high altitude regions)

206
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,160
Is this our lodging on the side?

207
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,230
(Recalling memories
from high altitude regions)

208
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,530
Shangri-La.

209
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,770
(Soon, they arrive at their lodging.)

210
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,170
- Let's check in first.
- Okay.

211
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,940
- "Youth hostel."
- Is this it? This is it.

212
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,380
- Let's stay here for two nights.
- Okay.

213
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,580
- It looks cute.
- We made a reservation beforehand.

214
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,320
Before leaving.

215
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:39,680
Gosh, it's tiring.

216
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,720
It must be altitude sickness.
I'm running out of breath.

217
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,920
(They finish checking it while panting.)

218
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,760
- Shall we go out now?
- Yes.

219
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:50,760
I'd like to meet a monk today.

220
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,900
Let's go and see.

221
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:53,500
Monk.

222
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:55,430
(Before going to bed last night)

223
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:56,630
(What do you want to do there tomorrow?)

224
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,270
(In Shangri-La,)

225
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,310
(we'll do the five-point prostration.)

226
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:04,640
(They planned to look for monks to
get info on the five-point prostration.)

227
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,580
Mr. Monk.

228
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,710
Where are you?

229
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,290
- Hold on. Pani Bottle.
- Yes?

230
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,360
Do we have to walk for 20 minutes?

231
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,190
I was just following you.

232
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,230
Really?

233
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,860
- I thought that you knew.
- I was just following Si Eon.

234
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,530
- Are they fools or what?
- Goodness.

235
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:29,970
Let's just go there.

236
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:31,600
Where are we going?

237
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,010
- I'll just follow you, Si Eon.
- Okay.

238
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,440
This happens often among guys.

239
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,780
"Where are we going?
I was just following you."

240
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:39,780
(A common way that men travel)

241
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,350
They'll arrive somewhere anyway.

242
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:42,710
This is fun.

243
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,950
(Laughing)

244
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:47,850
- This is so much fun.
- I agree.

245
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,860
Although we weren't doing anything big,
it was very fun.

246
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,930
- This looks amazing.
- It's spacious inside.

247
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:59,930
It had a similar vibe to the Old Town
of Lijiang with old buildings.

248
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,070
- In here...
- These are tourist places.

249
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,440
It looks similar to
the Old Town of Lijiang.

250
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:07,610
What? It's the Nakhi people.

251
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:12,380
(Filled with a variety
of traditional costumes at the entrance)

252
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,580
(Looking around)

253
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:19,320
- The buildings look Tibetan now.
- You're right.

254
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,690
From Nakhi architecture to Tibetan design.

255
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,490
It's Potala Palace.

256
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:25,120
It's also fun to look at architecture.

257
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,360
(Potala Palace in Tibet)

258
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,690
Gosh, let's look at the bags.

259
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,530
It looks like
they're made with yak leather.

260
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:35,530
- That's unique.
- Tibet must be known for leatherwork.

261
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,130
It looks amazing.

262
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:39,570
It's caterpillar fungus.

263
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,540
- The caterpillar fungus must be famous.
- It's caterpillar fungus.

264
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,080
(Valuable medicinal herbs
found in regions of high altitude)

265
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,640
(Surprised)

266
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,780
Gosh, what's that?

267
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,610
We saw it from the Tea Horse Road
by the Himalayas.

268
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,980
- It's a mani wheel.
- Mani wheel.

269
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,520
- It's enormous.
- It's spinning.

270
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,890
(He saw it in Namche Bazaar.)

271
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:59,160
(Mani wheel)

272
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,930
- Didn't he see it with Tamang?
- Right.

273
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,760
- What does it mean?
- Good luck.

274
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,600
(An emblem of Tibetan Buddhism
that you spin for good luck)

275
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,970
You can spin it only with a lot of people.

276
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:12,870
- Are they spinning it manually?
- Yes.

277
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:13,940
(A tourist spot where you can see
the world's largest mani wheel)

278
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,110
That's another magnificent sight.

279
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,140
(A tourist spot where you can see
the world's largest mani wheel)

280
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,410
(With 1,300 years of history)

281
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:25,580
(A village that's different
from Old Town of Lijiang)

282
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:31,390
(Dukezong Ancient Town)

283
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:35,090
It's a Buddhist pagoda
built in the traditional Tibetan style.

284
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:37,830
It already got dark.

285
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:40,460
- It has a nice vibe at night.
- There are a lot to see.

286
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,240
What's that?

287
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,470
(What's that?)

288
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,140
(A huge crowd gathered in the square)

289
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,140
Oh, my.

290
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,510
It's called Guozhuang dance,
which is a Tibetan folk dance.

291
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,650
They gather at the town square
every morning...

292
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,280
and dance
that Tibetan traditional folk dance.

293
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,250
(Puzzled by the huge crowd)

294
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,420
Look. There are monks.

295
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,050
- Gosh.
- They're monks.

296
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,790
There's a monk who resembles
Coach Park Hang Seo too.

297
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,190
- You're right.
- They look similar.

298
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,790
- Hello.
- Hello.

299
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,430
(Approaching a monk
who somehow feels familiar)

300
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:14,700
(He prepared what he wanted to ask.)

301
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,430
(Can we do the five-point prostration
with you tomorrow?)

302
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:21,370
(He carefully shows the translator.)

303
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,970
(However, there's no answer.)

304
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:24,980
You can do it.

305
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,280
Are you Korean?

306
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,010
- No, I'm Chinese.
- What?

307
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,280
- What?
- Wait a minute.

308
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,580
- I can speak a little Korean.
- Really?

309
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,450
- Can you ask them a question for us?
- Can you help us?

310
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,220
We're looking for a place...

311
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,760
where we can do
the five-point prostration tomorrow.

312
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,360
And we're asking these monks about it.

313
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,060
Is there any place near here?

314
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,590
- It's far.
- Is it far?

315
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,600
- It's not around here?
- You need a car.

316
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,060
We need a car. I see.

317
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,430
We have a car.

318
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,370
Can you tell us where we can do this?

319
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,800
- Songzanlin Monastery.
- Songzanlin Monastery.

320
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,900
It's near here.

321
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,140
Thank you.

322
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,910
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

323
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,140
Thank you so much.

324
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,480
Do you want to take a picture?

325
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,510
Together?

326
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,350
(Together?)

327
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,450
- What did he say?
- I don't think he wants that.

328
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,120
He didn't want to take a picture, I guess.

329
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,320
- He didn't like that.
- He didn't want to go that far.

330
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,420
(I'm sorry for the misunderstanding.)

331
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,090
Then Si Eon, let's talk about it...

332
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:14,530
with Kian84 later.

333
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:15,890
Where is he?

334
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,600
Kian84!

335
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,230
Jianpasi!

336
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,970
(Among the dancing people...)

337
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:25,840
(Dancing84 has joined.)

338
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,110
(Ecstatic)

339
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,510
He's so engrossed.

340
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,810
He needs to go home now.

341
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:33,980
(Turning the dancing scene
in Shangri-La upside down)

342
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,250
There he is.

343
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,250
(They find Jianpasi.)

344
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,820
- It was amazing.
- We met someone who spoke Korean.

345
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,120
We were talking to the monks,

346
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,690
and suddenly,
a Chinese guy appeared and helped us.

347
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:46,590
- Really?
- That's him.

348
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,830
- Hello.
- I know who you are.

349
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:52,030
- Jianpasi.
- Jianpasi.

350
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,760
(We're Jianpasi's friends.)

351
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,970
They're cute.

352
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,370
- He's famous.
- You're so popular.

353
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:57,500
Thank you.

354
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,400
Do you live here?

355
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,640
I'm traveling.

356
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,010
I'm here to travel.

357
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,540
Can you take a picture with me?

358
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,480
Didn't you say you didn't want to earlier?

359
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,480
Didn't you say you didn't want to earlier?

360
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,650
You said you didn't want to take a photo.

361
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,420
This is the power of JIanpasi.

362
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,580
Is it? Gosh.

363
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,850
You're different, Jianpasi.

364
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,320
(A picture is taken,
thanks to Jianpasi's power.)

365
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,590
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

366
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,190
- Have a nice trip.
- Thank you.

367
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,230
- Let's get going now.
- Let's go.

368
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,190
- Anyway, at 8 a.m. tomorrow,
- Yes.

369
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,030
we'll go to Songzanlin Monastery by car.

370
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,060
All right.

371
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:31,670
(The Three Brothers go to sleep looking
forward to visiting Songzanlin Monastery.)

372
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,010
(Day 11 of their travel,
A visit to Songzanlin Monastery)

373
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:45,450
- Are you all ready?
- Yes.

374
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:49,790
I can apply this
on both the face and body,

375
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,020
so it's very convenient for travel.

376
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,390
- Is that the hydrating balm?
- Yes.

377
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,390
(Very interested)

378
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,260
- It's a dry climate here,
- Yes.

379
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,660
so we need this.

380
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,830
This one can calm insect bites,

381
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:02,030
so it's nice to carry it when you travel.

382
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,800
How come you give it to us
when we're almost done with the travel?

383
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,700
(Mosquito bites)

384
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,170
He's got so many bites.

385
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:10,240
I almost got four nipples
because of the bites.

386
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,010
(He almost got more eyes on his chest.)

387
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:14,550
If you apply it all over your face,
it soothes the skin.

388
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,680
You'd look better.

389
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,580
It'll be nice to apply it
when you travel in a dry area.

390
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:22,020
(Dry Bottle moisturizes
every inch of his skin.)

391
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,590
How do you feel?

392
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:26,360
My body is deteriorating quickly.

393
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,060
Hang in there.

394
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,660
(Avoiding his eyes)

395
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,400
It felt so cold last night.

396
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,800
Is that really true?

397
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:37,570
See? He's out of his mind.

398
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:40,570
- No one has the energy to respond.
- No one is responding.

399
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:41,570
(They lost their smiles
since they didn't feel well.)

400
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:43,010
Let's go.

401
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,310
We'll get there by car.

402
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:46,310
Let's go.

403
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,350
Songzanlin Monastery takes 13 minutes.

404
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:50,850
- It's 13 minutes?
- Yes.

405
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,020
- Kian84.
- Yes?

406
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,190
Are we going far by astral projection?

407
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:56,490
What do you mean?

408
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:57,820
Are we doing astral projection?

409
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:01,560
- You mean five-point...
- Was it the five-point tattoo?

410
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,990
- "Five-point tattoo?"
- Five-point...

411
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,700
- Five-point prostration.
- Five-point prostration.

412
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,100
"Five-point tattoo."

413
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:07,970
- "Astral projection."
- I'm confused.

414
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:10,400
It's harder to remember
five-point prostration than you think.

415
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,100
Everyone looks tired.

416
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,170
"Astral projection."

417
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:14,370
Here we are.

418
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:15,410
(Arriving at the entrance
of Songzanlin Monastery)

419
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:17,640
I wonder what they have in the monastery.

420
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,880
There are many people.

421
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,080
Let's go.
(Going to the ticket office first)

422
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,880
I guess we should ride this bus.

423
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,980
It seems we depart from here
to get somewhere.

424
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:29,590
What's that?

425
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,990
Is it like a village of Buddhist monks?

426
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,860
They see a magnificent view
on their way too.

427
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,430
(Staring)

428
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,830
Is that like Dongtan New Town
for Buddhist monks?

429
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,100
- It looks very nice.
- It's quite large.

430
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,670
(Houses densely packed
like those in Dongtan New Town)

431
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:46,040
It was a Buddhist village.

432
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,040
Like the Paju English Village,

433
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,570
- it was a monk village.
- A monk village.

434
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:55,250
(Living near a big monastery,)

435
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,880
(monks form a practicing community
in Tibetan Buddhism.)

436
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:05,590
(Arriving at the monastery
after passing the monks' houses)

437
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:08,160
This is like a city...

438
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,290
- where monks live.
- A city for monks.

439
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,700
It's a monk city.

440
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,360
- A monk city.
- A monk village.

441
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,000
In Songzanlin Monastery,

442
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,040
about 700 monks live.

443
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,940
It's a large practicing community.

444
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,910
Magnificent architectural beauty
and Tibetan Buddhism...

445
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,540
harmonize at this marvelous sacred site.

446
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,680
(The biggest Tibetan Buddhist temple
in Yunnan Province)

447
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,020
It has wonderful colors.

448
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,390
In Lhasa, the capital of Tibet,

449
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:36,750
Potala Palace is very famous.

450
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,990
And this monastery is called
Mini Potala Palace.

451
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,160
It looks like a painting.

452
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,760
(Songzanlin Monastery)

453
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:46,000
It's really huge
when you look at it in person.

454
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,430
Where are we supposed to do
five-point prostration, by the way?

455
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,430
Are we going to do it
in the center over there?

456
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,870
I think we should go farther up.

457
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,570
(Looking around)

458
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:56,340
I'd be out of breath if I got up here.

459
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,540
(Numerous steps before their eyes)

460
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,650
It's 108 steps.

461
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:03,680
Was that 108 steps?

462
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,880
Let's walk slowly.

463
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,080
Let's go.

464
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,250
It's very splendid, though.

465
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,290
(Vibrant colors inside the temple)

466
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:15,830
It has beautiful colors.

467
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,530
This looks very beautiful.

468
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,670
It's in mint and gold.

469
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:25,340
- They go well together.
- Mint and gold.

470
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:28,070
They use totally different colors
from Korean Buddhist temples.

471
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,170
That's right.

472
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,740
There's a square, too.

473
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,140
(Blown away)

474
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,350
It's magnificent.

475
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,880
- They use a lot of vivid colors.
- Right.

476
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,980
It looks very splendid.

477
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,350
It was grand, splendid,

478
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,390
and large in scale.

479
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:42,990
I liked that.

480
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:45,160
Wait a minute.

481
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:46,860
Have you decided to live there?

482
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,030
(Looking like a local)

483
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,630
How come your shoulders
look so narrow now?

484
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:50,830
(Crouched)

485
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,500
Did anyone scare you?

486
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,900
Did anyone criticize him? What's wrong?

487
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,930
(His shoulders are narrow.)

488
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:58,470
It felt more like a palace than a temple.

489
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,370
The Buddhist temples in Korea...

490
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:01,870
are tranquil and quiet.

491
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:03,940
- Right.
- Temples in Korea look amazing too.

492
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:07,080
The temples here seemed to overwhelm me.

493
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,610
It has a different beauty. It's flashy.

494
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:10,650
(Tibetan temples
have stately magnificence.)

495
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,920
(A must-do activity in a Tibetan temple,
the mani wheel)

496
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,450
You need to turn the mani wheel.

497
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,520
(Passing the mani wheel)

498
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,660
It looks splendid.

499
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:22,230
Silk wraps around the whole building.

500
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,430
Oh, my.

501
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,200
It's colorful.

502
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,130
- All colors exist there.
- Right.

503
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,630
It's dazzling.

504
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:33,140
We went to the rooftop to see the view.

505
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,400
The view from here...

506
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:39,640
(A panorama of Songzanlin Monastery
before their eyes)

507
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:45,980
This place has the best view
in Songzanlin Monastery.

508
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,420
I guess he's a guide for visitors here.

509
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:56,360
There's a guide.

510
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:59,130
Are those houses
that Buddhist monks live in?

511
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,670
(A village where Buddhist monks
and practitioners live)

512
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:03,430
They all live here.

513
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:05,840
(Residing at present)

514
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:09,140
There's a sky burial place
on the opposite side.

515
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,740
- The sky burial site.
- The sky burial site?

516
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:14,040
Where? Where's the sky burial site?

517
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:17,210
(What Kian84 wished before they departed)

518
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:22,990
(The ephemerality of life he felt
while watching a funeral in India)

519
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:25,720
(This time, instead of a cremation,)

520
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:30,790
(he wishes to see a Tibetan funeral.)

521
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,000
(A distinctive funeral practice
in Tibetan culture)

522
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:40,840
(A deceased body...)

523
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,910
(is placed in holy nature...)

524
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:48,650
(and given as food for eagles
in the funeral.)

525
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:55,220
(The body goes back
to a part of nature...)

526
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,060
I heard it disappears
in almost ten minutes.

527
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:00,260
(so that the deceased
shows mercy after death.)

528
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,530
(It shows their wish that...)

529
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:06,100
(the soul goes back to the sky.)

530
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,030
That's why the eagles peck at the body.

531
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:11,030
(A funeral ceremony in the sky)

532
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:14,040
(Sky burial)

533
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,040
Over that mountain?

534
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:18,840
- That's the place.
- Where?

535
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,010
- Isn't it that one over there?
- No.

536
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,980
Are we allowed
to watch a sky burial there?

537
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,950
Can we see it if we visit?

538
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:27,080
Since you're there.

539
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,550
Outsiders can't go in right now.

540
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,060
- That's too bad.
- I see.

541
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:35,890
Only the people holding the funeral
and family members are allowed.

542
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,660
Since it is a sacred place.

543
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,860
(They sadly can't watch the ritual.)

544
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,730
- We can't see it.
- We can't see it.

545
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:45,300
This is the only culture
that holds a sky burial.

546
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:49,270
I wanted to watch it
and tell you how it felt.

547
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:52,210
I was disappointed we couldn't watch it.

548
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,580
(He tries to swallow his disappointment.)

549
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,450
I thought that was
where they held the sky burials.

550
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:00,920
- Do you see where the flags are?
- Over there?

551
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,220
That's a place of prayer.

552
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,190
(He can't look away
in hopes to get a glimpse of it.)

553
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,460
I wasn't curious about sky burials,
but now I am.

554
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,130
Gosh.

555
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:12,000
That is what happens
when you are denied something.

556
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,970
I'll try sprinkling shrimp snacks
all over my body.

557
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:18,100
- You can send me away.
- Will you do that?

558
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,270
- Aren't you hungry?
- Not really. Let's have something simple.

559
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:23,640
- Something like ramyeon?
- Sounds good.

560
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:25,610
- Look.
- Let's go that way.

561
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,180
- It's a big city.
- Yes.

562
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,810
Since we have to go around the city.

563
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,720
If you think about it...

564
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:33,850
Wait, what's that?

565
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:35,690
- Why?
- What's that?

566
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,150
Look.

567
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,160
- Isn't that the five-point prostration?
- Look.

568
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:40,490
Really?

569
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:42,560
- Isn't that the five-point prostration?
- Look.

570
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,830
They're doing it
at the bottom of the hill.

571
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,460
- What is it?
- I see.

572
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:54,540
(Since the moment
they arrived at Shangri-La...)

573
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,580
(to late at night, they asked
about the five-point prostration.)

574
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,680
That's how they do it?

575
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,680
They've already started it.

576
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,080
There are people up higher.

577
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,320
You're right.

578
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:13,860
They seemed to be
going around Songzanlin Monastery.

579
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:14,890
That's right.

580
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,360
Let's take a look from the opposite side.

581
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,100
We can't disturb them
during a religious practice.

582
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,070
- We can't talk to them.
- No, we can't.

583
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,100
(They carefully approach the monks.)

584
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,810
(They silently lower themselves
to the ground.)

585
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:36,610
Maybe the person in front started earlier.

586
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:39,120
It may be a difference
in physical strength.

587
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:42,190
If we start here,
we'll be there in an hour.

588
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:44,350
They really straighten
their arms and legs out.

589
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,390
One, two, three,

590
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:51,160
four, five. They take five steps.

591
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,830
They take five steps forward each time.

592
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:56,600
Some take 3 steps and others take 5 steps.

593
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:59,100
- I see.
- I heard it's different for each person.

594
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:02,240
The weather was quite hot.

595
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,210
That must make you hot.

596
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,040
Just walking is tiring enough.

597
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,310
I bet, in that weather.

598
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:12,050
It would take a long time
just walking around the monastery.

599
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:16,990
The thing I'm most curious
about Tibetan Buddhism...

600
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:19,360
is the five-point prostration.

601
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:21,490
I heard five points of your body
touch the ground.

602
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:23,630
Your knees.

603
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:25,060
(Two knees, two elbows)

604
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,060
Your forehead.

605
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,800
Your whole body has to touch the ground.

606
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,800
(Five parts of the body touch the ground.)

607
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:32,500
I thought, "Do they really do that?"

608
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,510
It was very interesting.

609
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:38,480
You feel reverent
while watching religious practices.

610
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,340
- Right.
- Especially if you see it in person.

611
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,410
They go all the way like that.

612
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:43,510
(They travel thousands of kilometers
to Lhasa like that.)

613
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:45,420
They travel thousands of kilometers
like that?

614
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:49,150
- Does it end in a day?
- I don't think so.

615
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,220
I wonder how physically tiring it must be.

616
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,490
It's like doing burpees.

617
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:54,760
I bet their knees get scraped.

618
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,790
They're wearing aprons
to protect their bodies.

619
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:59,030
- Right.
- I bet they're wearing knee pads.

620
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,260
- Since their bodies touch the ground.
- You're right.

621
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,230
They seemed to have
protective gear for it.

622
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,330
They have protective gear.

623
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:05,640
If they did it with their bare hands,

624
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,140
- they'd get scraped and hurt.
- You're right.

625
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:12,710
Why don't we look for someone
taking a rest and talk to them?

626
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:14,810
We couldn't talk to them
while they were doing it.

627
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:17,110
- We couldn't disturb them.
- Since it's a religious practice.

628
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:19,320
I have the question ready.
"Is it okay to talk to you?"

629
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,020
Have the next question ready, Pani Bottle.

630
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:25,160
I'm most curious about the reason
they do the five-point prostration.

631
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,430
He's taking a rest.

632
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:30,890
Si Eon is running?

633
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:33,430
It looks like
Si Eon has this on his bucket list.

634
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:39,270
(He runs to help Kian84
check this off his bucket list.)

635
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:40,870
(Is it okay to talk to you?)
(Yes.)

636
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:42,940
You were polite.

637
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:46,910
We're from Korea.

638
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:47,910
(Bowing his head)

639
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:52,080
We want to experience the
five-point prostration. Is it possible?

640
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:53,550
Yes, it is.

641
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,290
Tourists sometimes come and do it.

642
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:01,790
- They come here and do it.
- There are others that think like us.

643
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,960
Are you a monk?

644
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,160
(He is a practitioner, not a monk.)

645
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,160
He's not a monk.

646
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,270
Why do you do the five-point prostration?

647
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:13,340
It's for luck and peace.

648
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,570
- Luck?
- I see. That's good.

649
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:18,880
If we give up in the middle...

650
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,680
without finishing the entire course,
does it become meaningless?

651
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:23,810
No, you are allowed to rest.

652
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,350
You can mark the place you stopped.

653
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:27,920
(Next time,
you continue from where you left off.)

654
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,950
- You continue it.
- From where you left off?

655
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:33,390
How long is the distance?

656
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,330
This place is around 4km.

657
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:36,830
And it's uphill.

658
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:38,330
- It isn't 4km on flat land.
- No.

659
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,260
It's longer than the Gurkha course.

660
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,260
It is.

661
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,270
If we want to do this,

662
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:45,400
do we have to learn how to do it?

663
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,970
No,
you'll get it by watching how we do it.

664
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:52,840
(The heart of wanting to practice
is more important than the posture.)

665
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,940
I wish you good luck.

666
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,450
(Bowing)

667
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:58,380
I was curious.

668
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:03,150
You look like a poet.

669
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:05,190
You look like a poet
that recently went broke.

670
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:06,320
(The life of a poet
who has nothing but romance.)

671
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,360
He's had an enlightenment.

672
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,130
- Art is the only thing that motivates me.
- Only art.

673
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:11,860
- I don't need money.
- A poor artist.

674
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,830
You give off a nice artistic vibe.

675
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:17,400
I was curious about what kind of hopes...

676
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:20,300
made them do something so tough.

677
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:24,770
I don't believe in Buddhism
or any kind of religion.

678
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:27,180
It's hard for me to understand
those kinds of practices.

679
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:29,450
That's what made me more curious
about what they thought.

680
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:32,920
It's meaningless...

681
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,550
to just watch how they live.

682
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:39,060
I thought this was something
we should try.

683
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:42,560
I wanted to feel what they felt.
That's the joy of traveling.

684
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,490
Should we sit somewhere and talk?

685
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:45,560
- Okay.
- Should we sit here?

686
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:47,500
- They have instant noodles.
- Yes.

687
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,330
Why don't we each have one while we talk?

688
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:52,140
- Okay.
- What do you think?

689
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:55,670
Let's eat first. We aren't going to
start right away, are we?

690
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:57,840
- It's too hot right now.
- Let's start at sunset.

691
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,610
I think doing this will feel rewarding.

692
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:02,950
We came here and saw people
doing the five-point prostration.

693
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,150
I actually thought I wanted to do this...

694
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:07,550
when we were in Korea
if we were able to see it...

695
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,890
and participate.

696
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:11,350
I have a certain reason.

697
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,990
Is it a secret?

698
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,660
You could say that.

699
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:19,130
I want to do this...

700
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:21,000
and have my hopes come true.

701
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,130
- There is something on my mind.
- I see.

702
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,670
- I have something to say.
- Yes?

703
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:28,170
I'm good with everything,
but can we eat first?

704
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:30,010
- First...
- Let's eat while we talk.

705
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:32,940
- The owner...
- Hello.

706
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,610
- It's the owner of the store.
- Yes.

707
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:37,150
(She waves toward the strong gazes.)

708
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,650
I'll buy it. Is that okay?

709
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:40,950
- The one we had yesterday.
- Okay.

710
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,650
Beef noodles.

711
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:44,050
- I want that too.
- It was tasty.

712
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:45,660
I'll have that too.
It's slightly spicy, right?

713
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,690
It was spicy yesterday.

714
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:48,730
Excuse me.

715
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:50,630
Hello?

716
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:53,460
- Hello?
- Where did she go?

717
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,800
(Ta-da!)

718
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,800
Where did she come from?

719
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,830
She brought hot water.

720
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,840
She's friendly.

721
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:01,940
- How much is it?
- How much is it?

722
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,240
(They pay before pouring the water in.)

723
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,510
They're all 8 yuan,
and you chose 3 drinks.

724
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:09,210
They don't scan barcodes. It's old-school.

725
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:12,120
This is 8 yuan...

726
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,190
(Her head hurts.)

727
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:17,420
(They try using a translator
to communicate.)

728
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,120
I don't know how to read.

729
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:21,190
Goodness.

730
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:23,860
Then you can put it in the calculator.

731
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:26,730
(They try with a different tool.)

732
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,700
Plus 30...

733
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,700
She must've been flustered...

734
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,100
since foreigners suddenly
flocked into her store.

735
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,770
If I add the price of the Coke...
Let's see.

736
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,940
This is like a religious practice itself.

737
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,610
(They begin the calculating discipline.)

738
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,980
- Plus...
- Plus...

739
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:46,980
(She fully concentrates
for the practitioners.)

740
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:49,390
(They concentrate as well.)

741
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,620
(Struggling)

742
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:54,360
I pressed the wrong number.

743
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,890
- My goodness.
- Gosh.

744
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:59,430
You have to know how to calculate
if you own a supermarket.

745
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:01,460
Gosh, she's cute.

746
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:04,070
Doesn't she have the cutest smile?

747
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,700
Yes, it makes you feel better.

748
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,900
Maybe she hasn't had a customer
for a long time.

749
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:11,240
It's taking you too long to calculate.

750
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:14,410
- How much is it?
- This is 27 yuan.

751
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:16,450
Do they have the prices on them?

752
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:18,150
The prices are written here.
Let's calculate it ourselves.

753
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:19,220
- Should we do it?
- Wait a second.

754
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,850
We calculated it together
since we don't speak Chinese.

755
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,050
The calculator turned off,
but I don't know how to turn it on.

756
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:25,320
Did it turn off? What should we do?

757
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,090
- Pani Bottle, use this.
- Okay.

758
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:29,090
- How much are these?
- Is the price written there?

759
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,790
- Should we add each item?
- And five...

760
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:32,530
Plus... How much is the sausage?

761
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:37,170
I think we'd be giving her more
if we paid 15 dollars, so that'd be okay.

762
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,570
- Approximately?
- Yes.

763
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:41,070
(Pani Bottle finishes calculating.)

764
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:43,540
(It's 46 yuan, right?)

765
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,540
Is it not?

766
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:48,610
- Wait a second.
- That's around 8 dollars.

767
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:49,780
This is a new type of discipline.

768
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:53,580
(They go back to the beginning
of calculating discipline.)

769
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,120
She calculated everything once again.

770
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:57,750
We're hungry, grandma.

771
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,720
(The endless calculating discipline)

772
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,590
This is part of the discipline.

773
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:03,660
Let's see.

774
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,360
(Anxious)

775
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,830
(Let's see.)

776
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:08,830
It's 46 yuan.

777
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,100
(It's around 9.2 dollars.)

778
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,270
Okay, 46 yuan.

779
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:13,000
- It was 46.
- Grandma.

780
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,440
- Okay.
- Finally.

781
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,970
(Good.)

782
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:18,210
Gosh.

783
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:19,740
(They applaud.)

784
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,540
- Good work. My goodness.
- Right.

785
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,680
Calculating is so difficult.

786
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:23,780
It's done.

787
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:24,850
She was like a little girl.

788
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:25,920
(Smiling)

789
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,980
(They are finally allowed
to eat the ramyeon.)

790
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,550
We're Koreans.

791
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:32,260
- You're Koreans.
- Yes, we are.

792
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,720
- She's very kind.
- Yes, she is.

793
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,690
- She's cute.
- Yes, she is.

794
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,330
(They take their ramyeon outside.)

795
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:40,330
This looks tasty.

796
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,030
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

797
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:44,270
She's kind.

798
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,900
Thank you, grandma.

799
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:47,940
Thank you.

800
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:51,410
She has a very kind smile.

801
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:52,940
I wonder if you need anything else.

802
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,450
- She's warmhearted.
- Yes.

803
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:57,810
Okay.

804
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:00,580
- I'll enjoy the food. Enjoy, everyone.
- Enjoy.

805
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:05,460
(Slurping)

806
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:09,330
- You must've been hungry.
- It was really tasty.

807
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,190
That person is going home.

808
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,900
(They see a practitioner going home.)

809
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,470
- He's going to eat.
- Good job.

810
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:17,400
It's like a game
that you can save and play later.

811
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:19,800
Pani Bottle and I...

812
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,840
actually aren't Buddhists.

813
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,110
- So we've never done anything like this.
- No.

814
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:25,540
We had no reason to.

815
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:27,440
Will I be able to understand...

816
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,680
the people who do this if I give it a try?

817
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,050
You'll become earnest.

818
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,620
When you are earnest,
the deities help you out.

819
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,120
That's what they say.

820
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:37,290
It's discipline.

821
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:40,120
Since it was something
on Kian84's bucket list,

822
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:42,890
I wanted to understand
the people that practiced it,

823
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:46,100
rather than hoping for a wish
to come true.

824
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,460
That's why I wanted to join them
in doing it.

825
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:50,930
This is a nice and meaningful way
to end our trip.

826
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:51,930
Right.

827
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:55,510
- That was good.
- Let's go now.

828
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:57,840
Let's go.

829
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,410
Let's get going.

830
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,910
- Let's get some rest.
- Let's do that before we head out.

831
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:05,620
(They arrive at their lodging
to discuss their schedule.)

832
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:09,320
Should we just prepare today?

833
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:11,920
- Then when are we doing it?
- It seems like a rush to do it today.

834
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:14,560
I think we might have to do that
due to time.

835
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:17,190
Then are we doing it tomorrow morning?

836
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:18,690
Tomorrow morning.

837
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:22,600
Let's leave before sunrise
and wrap up after watching the sunrise.

838
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,970
While watching the sunrise?

839
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:25,100
- At dawn?
- Yes.

840
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:27,170
Even in Korea, that's the best time...

841
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:29,410
to wish for something.

842
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:32,280
It's when you feel the most desperate
and are heard.

843
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,710
- It's the magical hour?
- Like dawn prayer.

844
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,250
The magical hour is around sunrise.

845
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:37,550
Then we'll prepare ourselves today.

846
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:39,450
What do you think of this?

847
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,750
- When you do something sacred,
- Yes?

848
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:43,420
- you take a bath to purify your body.
- That's right.

849
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,890
Why don't we visit hot springs
and wash our bodies?

850
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:47,960
- That sounds good. But are there any?
- Since it's cold here.

851
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:50,390
- I found a few.
- Sounds good.

852
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:52,360
- Shall we head out?
- Yes.

853
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,860
(For reverence
before the five-point prostration)

854
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:57,670
- Let's go.
- We're preparing a reverent heart.

855
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,800
Let's stay a couple of hours
at the hot springs.

856
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,740
I was excited to go to the hot springs.

857
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:02,910
(They will cleanse their minds and bodies
with hot water.)

858
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:04,570
- That must be it.
- It's over there.

859
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:06,380
(They are soon near the entrance.)

860
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,710
Is that it?

861
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,680
- It looks like a military base.
- What?

862
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,610
- It looks like the Gurkha Academy.
- It like Gurkha Academy.

863
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,850
Dex might be hiding there.

864
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,320
What if someone suddenly
gives me a load to carry?

865
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:19,520
"Carry a 50kg bag filled with rocks..."

866
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,860
"and run up the Himalayas."

867
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:24,660
(The never-ending doko race)

868
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:27,430
It has the mark of a hot spring.

869
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:29,370
- You're right.
- We have to go 600m.

870
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,770
Look at this place.

871
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,340
- It's a cliff.
- It's on a cliff.

872
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,840
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

873
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,210
- There is a stream.
- It's a valley.

874
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:39,210
There is a hot spring here?

875
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,110
This is charming.

876
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:42,480
(Between a cliff and a valley)

877
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,450
- This is interesting.
- We drove down the valley.

878
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:47,720
- Look at this.
- What is this place?

879
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,890
It feels like they'd sell
chicken soup here.

880
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,590
(They get out of the car
while licking their lips.)

881
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,860
- I need to heat my body.
- Good.

882
00:35:57,890 --> 00:35:59,100
Look up there, Kian84.

883
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,460
Doesn't that look like Sun Wukong's home?

884
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:04,170
- You're right.
- It looks exactly the same.

885
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,640
- You're right.
- It looks like it'll reach the sky.

886
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,640
Gosh, it's Sun Wukong's home.

887
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:13,680
- Where do we pay?
- This is where we pay.

888
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,080
- This is the counter?
- Yes.

889
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:16,910
- Hi.
- Hi.

890
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:20,850
We'll take these pants.

891
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:22,450
(These pants)

892
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:23,850
Here.

893
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:25,820
(They buy swimsuits
for the older brothers.)

894
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:27,820
This is the price.

895
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:30,390
- Okay.
- It's 180 yuan in total.

896
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:33,460
It's less than 40 dollars in total.

897
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,230
Okay.

898
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:37,470
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

899
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,640
Go this way.

900
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,740
(Go this way.)

901
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:46,440
- Gosh. What is that cave?
- Look at the cave.

902
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:50,650
(Deep in the mountains
at the foot of a cliff)

903
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:51,810
- Gosh.
- It looks nice.

904
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:52,850
(A natural hot spring
located 3,300m above sea level)

905
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:54,650
- It was amazing.
- It's quite big.

906
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,820
(An open-air bath
as big as a swimming pool)

907
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:58,990
This looks beautiful.

908
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,330
- Look at that cave.
- This place is so nice.

909
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:04,860
- It's very nice.
- We had no information...

910
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:08,700
and didn't expect much,
but it was well-known to the locals.

911
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,500
It's a natural hot spring.

912
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,530
(A place to relax their eyes and body)

913
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:12,840
Even the color of the water
is interesting.

914
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:17,940
- I think there is something in the water.
- Is this the color of sulfur?

915
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:19,310
What could it be?

916
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,580
- It's the same as the one in Peru.
- Yes.

917
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,950
(They visited an open-air bath in Peru.)

918
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,620
The three of us visited a hot spring
at a high altitude in Peru.

919
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:33,190
We did the same thing after three years.

920
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:34,960
It was like deja vu.

921
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,690
It was strange and interesting.

922
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,560
- Change your shoes.
- Change your shoes and get a key.

923
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:44,870
Let's go.

924
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:47,100
(Eon and Pani
go into the changing room first.)

925
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:48,870
What is this?

926
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:53,240
- Bring your camera.
- There's no one here, right?

927
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,750
We checked that there was no one inside
before taking the camera.

928
00:37:57,410 --> 00:38:00,520
- It's unbelievable inside.
- What is it?

929
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,020
This is the changing room.

930
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:06,820
(Dirty)

931
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,920
Nothing happened in there, right?

932
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,730
There are cigarette butts.

933
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,860
- It's wild.
- It's unbelievable.

934
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,370
(It's wild unlike the hot spring outside.)

935
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:18,470
It's nice and rough.

936
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:20,340
It's nice like the wilderness.

937
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:23,970
So many people
left their underwear outside.

938
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:27,680
But the number of underwear
and people didn't match.

939
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:31,050
There were around 30 pairs of underwear.

940
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:34,050
- But there were only three customers.
- Goodness.

941
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,550
Then who do the 27 pairs of underwear...

942
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,190
belong to?

943
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:40,820
It's cold.

944
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,630
I wonder if the water is warm.

945
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:44,390
It's cold.

946
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:46,900
- It's cold.
- I wonder if it's deep.

947
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:51,230
(They go straight into the water.)

948
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:52,770
- It's warm.
- It's warm.

949
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:54,140
(It's warm.)

950
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,710
- It's deep.
- Is it?

951
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,410
Wait.

952
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,580
(Jumping in)

953
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,810
(Sinking)

954
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:04,210
- Help Pani Bottle.
- Gosh.

955
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:05,480
(Help Pani Bottle!)

956
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:08,320
- I might drown.
- Come this way.

957
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,490
I have to jump up and down like Jiangshi.

958
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:11,750
It must be very deep.

959
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,460
I could barely stand in the water.

960
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:16,730
(Here you go.)

961
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:19,530
- This is good.
- There is something like seaweed in here.

962
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:20,700
(Saving Jiangshi Bottle with a tube)

963
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:22,470
- The floor...
- What is this?

964
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:24,730
feels slippery
like when I went to the wash place...

965
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,070
with Dex.

966
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,200
(Gasping)

967
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,110
Why is it so squishy?

968
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:34,380
- It feels like something is living here.
- Is it slippery?

969
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,750
Is sulfur usually mushy like this,
Pani Bottle?

970
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:39,780
Is it mushy like this?

971
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:42,820
- Look at this.
- This is strange.

972
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:45,620
- This makes me feel uneasy.
- It's supposed to be hard.

973
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:46,690
Look at this.

974
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:48,960
It looks like uni.

975
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:51,690
- It looks tasty.
- It's spongy.

976
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:53,930
- It's the color of pistachio.
- Taste it, Si Eon.

977
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:56,870
- Taste it.
- No.

978
00:39:57,570 --> 00:40:00,500
(After eating a scorpion,)

979
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,940
(this is nothing.)

980
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,010
No way.

981
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:05,140
(Joking)

982
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:07,440
He didn't give it to Si Eon,
worried he'd take the Grand Prize away.

983
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:11,780
- He's worried.
- This is worth a Grand Prize.

984
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,950
I could've been in trouble.

985
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:18,750
(The dignity of the Grand Prize winner
allows him to become the joke.)

986
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,920
The water is nice and warm.

987
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,930
It's naturally hot water.

988
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:25,590
This is nice.

989
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:28,200
(They splash around with satisfaction.)

990
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,900
(Working)

991
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,800
I'm sad that my legs are so short.

992
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,540
(Pani Booster is short
but lasts a long time.)

993
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:40,610
(Si Eon grabs onto the tube.)

994
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:45,750
You all look peaceful in the water.

995
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:47,580
(They relax their exhausted bodies...)

996
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:50,950
(and slowly enjoy the hot spring.)

997
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,560
Why don't you hold
another breath-holding contest?

998
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:55,320
- That sounds good.
- Yes?

999
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,990
- A breath-holding contest?
- You can't say no.

1000
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:00,360
(He challenges Pani Bottle,
the freediver.)

1001
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,930
(He has a license.)

1002
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:06,070
(Pani Bottle unexpectedly loses.)

1003
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,370
(They hold a rematch in India.)

1004
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,010
(Pani Bottle loses twice.)

1005
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:12,340
- Kian84 is good.
- He's really good.

1006
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,340
Kian84 is good.

1007
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,980
Right here.

1008
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:16,780
- Try it here.
- This will be a deathmatch.

1009
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:19,620
I'll be the judge like last time.

1010
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,050
- Get ready.
- Okay.

1011
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:24,920
Three.

1012
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,620
(Will the freediver regain his honor?)

1013
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,090
- I feel suffocated.
- Two.

1014
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:29,120
(Or will he lose again?)

1015
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:30,490
One.

1016
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:32,290
(The game begins.)

1017
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:34,430
It was cheap of him
to go underwater later.

1018
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:35,970
I was focusing.

1019
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,540
(Kian84, Pani Bottle)

1020
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:42,470
(Highly focused)

1021
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:46,210
- Look at him.
- Are you okay?

1022
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:47,380
You have to pretend you're meditating.

1023
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:51,450
(Like a toad and a green frog)

1024
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:54,880
(They have become one with water.)

1025
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,150
(Playing the video at 5 times the speed)

1026
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:58,220
We held our breath for a long time.

1027
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:00,960
- Are you okay?
- I was about to pee.

1028
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,090
(I was about to pee.)

1029
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,490
(1 minute passes.)

1030
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,730
(Gasping)

1031
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:09,000
(Kian84 loses.)

1032
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,070
Gosh.

1033
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:11,730
Who won?

1034
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:13,670
- Who won?
- Pani Bottle.

1035
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,270
(Pushing his hair back)

1036
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:16,540
- It felt exhilarating.
- It did?

1037
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:20,140
They often show Pani Bottle
in slow motion now.

1038
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:23,710
(How to forget about the pain of losing?)

1039
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:26,320
He looks like a different person.

1040
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,550
(Open your eyes wide
and ascertain your victory.)

1041
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,250
I finally won.

1042
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:32,420
I was out of oxygen for sure.

1043
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,820
- Congratulations. You're the best.
- Finally.

1044
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,890
- "You're the best."
- "You're the best."

1045
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,090
"You're the best?"

1046
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:39,730
- That sounds strange.
- Pani Bottle.

1047
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,600
You'll hold your breath well
no matter where you go.

1048
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,100
I'm jealous.

1049
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,400
I'll hold my breath when you fart.

1050
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,270
I'll hold my breath when you fart.

1051
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:53,240
I can't swim for a long time
because of the high altitude.

1052
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:55,380
I run out of breath quickly.

1053
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:57,210
It's a high ground.

1054
00:42:58,110 --> 00:42:59,380
Shall we go to the cave?

1055
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:01,320
Let's do that.

1056
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:04,720
- Is it a sauna?
- Yes.

1057
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:06,260
(Men's sauna)

1058
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:07,420
Here.

1059
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:11,460
I checked that no one was inside...

1060
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:13,200
and brought a camera.

1061
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,860
Inside the sauna is a sulfuric cave.

1062
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:17,700
It's quite big.

1063
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,570
- The water is so hot.
- Is it hot?

1064
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:21,170
It must be...

1065
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,240
natural water from the ground.

1066
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:26,240
Is that cold water?

1067
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,240
(Underwear)

1068
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,710
I guess someone left
without wearing underwear.

1069
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,850
Who took off his underwear there?

1070
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:34,280
(The hot spring is eco-friendly
in various ways.)

1071
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:35,420
What?

1072
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:36,790
It's a sauna.

1073
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:39,990
Oh, my!

1074
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:42,190
My goodness.

1075
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:44,130
- My goodness.
- It's nice.

1076
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:45,290
(They marvel at the heat.)

1077
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,830
(It's so nice!)

1078
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:50,730
The humidity is nice. It's humid.

1079
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:52,330
It's nice.

1080
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:53,440
(While they groan and enjoy the sauna,)

1081
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,840
(Kian84 goes somewhere alone.)

1082
00:43:57,870 --> 00:44:00,240
I came down to take a shower
at the shower room.

1083
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,680
The shower room is...

1084
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:05,180
(My goodness)

1085
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:10,890
I think I saw this place in "Saw."

1086
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,160
Isn't it the filming location of "Saw?"

1087
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:15,160
"I want to play a game."

1088
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:16,760
It's a scary place.

1089
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:17,760
(Will the scary shower room be revealed?)

1090
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,800
(Laughing)

1091
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,900
The shower room is very...

1092
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:24,130
intense.

1093
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:25,700
It has a wild vibe.

1094
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:26,800
How do I turn it on?

1095
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:27,800
(How do I turn on the water?)

1096
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,070
- Does water come out?
- Water isn't even coming out.

1097
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,440
How will you shower there?

1098
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:32,670
Do I need to press this?

1099
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:34,810
"Please ring the bell."

1100
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:37,850
Isn't it for emergencies?

1101
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:40,180
(Hesitant)

1102
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:43,820
(He steps back
since there isn't an emergency.)

1103
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:46,560
I don't think I'm supposed to shower
with this water.

1104
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,890
It's dripping.

1105
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:50,730
Okay.

1106
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:54,530
I don't think I need a shower.

1107
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,630
It felt like I had taken a shower already.

1108
00:44:57,630 --> 00:44:58,630
(He completes the shower in his mind.)

1109
00:44:58,730 --> 00:44:59,870
As for the shower...

1110
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,770
Well, I can shower tomorrow
or the day after tomorrow.

1111
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:09,040
Hello, this is "KianTV."

1112
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:11,210
It has been a long while, right?

1113
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:12,280
(He got changed without showering.)

1114
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:14,750
I turned on "KianTV..."

1115
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,020
- to deliver important news.
- What is it?

1116
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,760
What did we come to see today?

1117
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,990
"The Tea Horse Road."

1118
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:24,230
Really?

1119
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,730
(A moment ago at the hot spring)

1120
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,400
Apparently,
there is the Tea Horse Road here as well.

1121
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:33,270
That's the road.

1122
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,540
- Sun Wukong's home.
- It's near that place. Yes.

1123
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:36,540
Over there?

1124
00:45:37,870 --> 00:45:39,310
It's the old Tea Horse Road.

1125
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:40,310
That's right.

1126
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:42,310
The owner of the hot spring told us that.

1127
00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:48,050
I think we should go there.

1128
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:52,190
(After they took their first step
in Nepal,)

1129
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:56,790
(they walk the Tea Horse Road
on the other side.)

1130
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:58,390
The road I'm stepping on...

1131
00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:02,360
is the oldest trade route
in the history of mankind,

1132
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:04,430
the Tea Horse Road.

1133
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,500
How many years have passed?

1134
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,770
This road dates back
to the second century BC.

1135
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:14,280
Thus, it was over 2,200 years ago...

1136
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,750
that this road got made.

1137
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:18,310
(The road with 2,200 years of history)

1138
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:20,520
So many people must've taken that route.

1139
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:22,580
- Ta-da.
- What?

1140
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:24,150
It's what we called Sun Wukong's home.

1141
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:28,220
People lit up incense sticks
and prayed there.

1142
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:29,290
I see.

1143
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:31,130
- Sun Wukong's home.
- I guess it's a small temple.

1144
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:33,100
If you look over here,

1145
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:37,470
you can see horse poop and cow poop.

1146
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:41,770
Do they still use the Tea Horse Road...

1147
00:46:42,370 --> 00:46:43,610
for trade?

1148
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:44,870
Apparently not.

1149
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:48,840
But there are people who use it
with their mode of transportation.

1150
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,980
(The old Tea Horse Road
has traces of trade.)

1151
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:52,210
It's a cool road.

1152
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,190
If I follow this road,

1153
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,650
I'll reach Tibet.

1154
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:00,820
If I go farther, I'll reach Nepal.

1155
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:05,390
Let's say it's 2,200 years ago.

1156
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:07,600
"Tamang, what are you up to?"

1157
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,600
(Kian84 wants to meet Sherpa Tamang.)

1158
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:10,800
"Kian84, I'm working today as well."

1159
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:13,700
"Tamang, let's meet."

1160
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:16,000
If I continue to walk down this road...

1161
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,110
I don't know. How long will it take?

1162
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:19,880
Will it take about a year?

1163
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:23,880
"Gurkha Soneep."

1164
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,710
- "I heard..."
- I remember him.

1165
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:27,020
"that you became a soldier."

1166
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:29,420
"I'll buy you a meal
since you became a soldier."

1167
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:32,190
"Okay, Kian84. Buy me a meal."

1168
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:34,260
"Okay.
You're a private first class right now."

1169
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,930
If I walk down this road,

1170
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:39,600
he'll be a corporal or a sergeant
by the time I meet him.

1171
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:43,070
That's how long this road is.

1172
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:44,800
It's a very lengthy road.

1173
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:49,040
I have this thought
every time I walk the Tea Horse Road.

1174
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:51,470
Nowadays,

1175
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,310
many modern devices are good.

1176
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:55,610
There are speed cameras...

1177
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,550
and self-driving cars,

1178
00:47:57,550 --> 00:47:58,880
but people...

1179
00:47:59,850 --> 00:48:02,720
get into accidents and sustain injuries.

1180
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:05,120
On this road,

1181
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:07,620
so many people...

1182
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:10,360
must've lost their lives.

1183
00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:14,000
They traveled on this road
despite the possibility of death.

1184
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:19,770
(On the rough mountain road)

1185
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:23,010
Because trade was precious enough
to brave...

1186
00:48:23,010 --> 00:48:24,170
the possibility of death,

1187
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:25,910
we continued on with trade.

1188
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:31,010
It must be over 1,000km.

1189
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:32,250
It's 5,000km.

1190
00:48:32,850 --> 00:48:34,750
The total length is 5,000km.

1191
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:36,550
(The total length is 5,000km,
and the average altitude is 4,000m.)

1192
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:38,990
The road isn't flat like an expressway.

1193
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:40,460
It's a winding road along the mountains.

1194
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:41,490
(It's a wild and rough road.)

1195
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:43,730
They took this road.

1196
00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:46,460
(For the people who traveled
on the Tea Horse Road,)

1197
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,230
It's so...

1198
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:50,370
(you feel respect
from the bottom of your heart.)

1199
00:48:50,370 --> 00:48:51,730
I can't imagine it.

1200
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:53,100
(you feel respect
from the bottom of your heart.)

1201
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:55,440
There is another thought I have.

1202
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:59,040
I think the backbone of Korea...

1203
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:01,810
is the Gyeongbu Expressway.

1204
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:03,980
It's like a trade route.

1205
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:04,980
That's right.

1206
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:06,880
Along the trade route,

1207
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:09,820
many cities flourish.

1208
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:14,190
I had this thought during the trip.

1209
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:16,430
Along the Tea Horse Road,

1210
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:17,960
many cities exist.

1211
00:49:19,830 --> 00:49:22,530
Even the cities in Nepal...

1212
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:24,730
were on the Tea Horse Road.

1213
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,270
That was why those cities became big.

1214
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,740
It was the same for Lijiang,
the city we visited.

1215
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:33,110
It was the same for the village
with the minority group.

1216
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:36,040
During this trip,

1217
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,610
you visited various places.

1218
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:39,080
It brings back memories.

1219
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:47,090
(They became immersed
in the life on the road.)

1220
00:49:51,590 --> 00:49:55,200
I think it's safe to say
that this trip came to be...

1221
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,300
because of this road.

1222
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:58,800
(They became a part
of the Tea Horse Road during the trip.)

1223
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:03,640
Tomorrow, we'll try a prayer
called the five-point prostration...

1224
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:07,680
as much as our bodies allow.

1225
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:11,810
If I feel something,
I'll be honest and tell you...

1226
00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:12,950
what I felt.

1227
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:15,080
If I don't feel anything, I'll say that...

1228
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:17,790
- with honesty.
- I'm curious.

1229
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:19,620
I'll do that.

1230
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:20,690
(With his resolution, he wraps up
the story on the Tea Horse Road.)

1231
00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:21,890
It's goodbye for now.

1232
00:50:21,890 --> 00:50:24,160
(With his resolution, he wraps up
the story on the Tea Horse Road.)

1233
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:26,630
Guys, this is the last dinner.

1234
00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:27,700
Yes.

1235
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,970
Time passes like an arrow.

1236
00:50:30,270 --> 00:50:33,030
When I look back on it,
time passed quickly.

1237
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:35,200
It passed so quickly.
I feel like Dex left yesterday.

1238
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:37,910
A Korean restaurant was...

1239
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:39,640
in this alley.

1240
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:42,180
Since we have a big activity
coming up tomorrow...

1241
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:44,510
It's practically CSAT.

1242
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:46,250
- CSAT.
- I hope you guys do well.

1243
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:48,550
- That must be it.
- That's the restaurant. "Korea."

1244
00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:49,750
- "Korea."
- "Korea."

1245
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:51,520
- "Friends Korean Restaurant." Okay.
- "Friends."

1246
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:52,650
It's nice to see a Korean restaurant.

1247
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:55,020
- It'll be tasty.
- Let's eat this...

1248
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:56,320
- and do well tomorrow.
- Okay.

1249
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:00,100
- My goodness. Hello.
- Hello.

1250
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:03,060
- Are three servings of pork belly good?
- Yes.

1251
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,830
- I'll go ahead and order.
- Okay.

1252
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:06,570
Budae stew.

1253
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:08,100
- You can't go wrong with budae stew.
- One.

1254
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:12,140
Also, one stone pot bibimbap.

1255
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:13,880
Aren't you ordering too much food?

1256
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:15,710
- Let's stop here for now.
- Okay.

1257
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:17,510
Thank you, ma'am.

1258
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:19,150
Please make it tasty.

1259
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:21,220
It's here.

1260
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:25,150
Thank you.

1261
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:26,920
Pork belly.

1262
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:28,160
(Korean people's favorite food,
pork belly)

1263
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,160
It's no joke.

1264
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:31,590
- What's this?
- Budae stew.

1265
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:33,200
- Oh, my.
- Thank you.

1266
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,160
- Thank you.
- Gosh, look at that budae stew.

1267
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,630
Oh, my. It must be spicy.

1268
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:38,200
- It's nice to see Korean food.
- It looks good.

1269
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,200
(Traditional Korean dish,
stone pot bibimbap)

1270
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,600
Hey, it's a feast.

1271
00:51:42,370 --> 00:51:43,940
Thank you for the last feast.

1272
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:46,370
(He takes a bite of pork belly first.)

1273
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:47,780
(Humming in approval)

1274
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:49,240
Korean food is the best.

1275
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,410
(Pani Bottle eats as well.)

1276
00:51:51,410 --> 00:51:52,850
(Humming in approval)

1277
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:55,350
(Humming in approval)

1278
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:56,850
It's so tasty.

1279
00:51:56,850 --> 00:51:58,150
(They hum in unison.)

1280
00:51:58,150 --> 00:52:00,360
Pork belly is the best cut.

1281
00:52:00,890 --> 00:52:02,890
It has been a while
since we had food without mala.

1282
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:07,200
(The man who can't handle spicy food,
Pani Bottle, inhales the dishes.)

1283
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,760
(Meanwhile, Kian84...)

1284
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,770
(puts a piece of meat on lettuce.)

1285
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:14,500
I added a garlic clove.

1286
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:16,770
(Pork,)

1287
00:52:16,770 --> 00:52:17,770
(garlic,)

1288
00:52:17,770 --> 00:52:18,870
(and lettuce)

1289
00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:21,480
(Then you eat, okay?)

1290
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:22,480
(It's to die for.)

1291
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:25,950
Yes. He imagined having a wrap
on his first day in the Himalayas.

1292
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:29,180
(He inhales the proper lettuce wrap.)

1293
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:31,390
Gosh, Tamang and Rai should've had that.

1294
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:32,390
(I should've taught them
about this taste.)

1295
00:52:32,990 --> 00:52:34,290
(Glancing over)

1296
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:37,230
(Pani Bottle grabs a piece of lettuce
right away.)

1297
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:38,790
It's a total feast.

1298
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:40,730
(He keeps eating wraps
so that he won't lose to Kian84.)

1299
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:41,760
He keeps eating wraps.

1300
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,600
(He keeps eating wraps
so that he won't lose to Kian84.)

1301
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,170
(Satisfied)

1302
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,870
(Meanwhile, the eldest one, Si Eon,)

1303
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:51,040
(only eats budae stew.)

1304
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,480
Why does Si Eon look like a poet?

1305
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:57,210
Today, he looks like a poet
who is having a team dinner...

1306
00:52:57,510 --> 00:52:58,950
after winning an award.

1307
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:01,650
It's nice to have our fill
on our last night.

1308
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:03,850
I'm full now.

1309
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,790
- Now... Hold on.
- Has it been three years?

1310
00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:08,090
It has been three years.

1311
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:09,390
We went on a trip once a year.

1312
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:11,590
I was in my 30s
when I met you for the 1st time.

1313
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:13,860
- Really?
- I was 39 years old.

1314
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:15,800
That's my current age.

1315
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:17,600
- Seriously.
- Time flew.

1316
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:21,440
When I met you for the first time,
it was awkward since you were a stranger.

1317
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,370
At first, I was shy.

1318
00:53:23,370 --> 00:53:24,970
- Right?
- I didn't know what would happen.

1319
00:53:25,270 --> 00:53:26,610
The two of you were close already.

1320
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,480
So it wasn't easy
to become a part of the group.

1321
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:31,710
The day you arrived wasn't a good one.

1322
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:33,850
- We had fought that day. Yes.
- Why?

1323
00:53:33,850 --> 00:53:34,850
(It was 3 years ago.)

1324
00:53:34,850 --> 00:53:35,880
I was so surprised in Bolivia.

1325
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:39,220
(I planned everything.)

1326
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:40,320
(I don't want to hear about your plans.)

1327
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,620
(You usually build a fire
before going to bed.)

1328
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:44,190
(You can't go to bed like that.)

1329
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:47,300
(There was a fight at every turn...)

1330
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:50,030
(since it was the best friends'
first time traveling together.)

1331
00:53:50,870 --> 00:53:52,900
(Not too long afterward)

1332
00:53:53,370 --> 00:53:54,570
- He was clueless.
- My goodness.

1333
00:53:54,570 --> 00:53:56,140
(The clueless Pani Bottle appeared.)

1334
00:53:57,170 --> 00:54:01,340
(But the two older members
didn't hold themselves back.)

1335
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,980
(Even though they had met Pani Bottle
for the first time,)

1336
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:05,880
(they continued to bicker.)

1337
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:07,680
They fought again.

1338
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,480
(The beginning of the trip wasn't easy.)

1339
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:10,620
You struggled a lot.

1340
00:54:10,990 --> 00:54:11,990
I'm sorry.

1341
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:13,960
(They look back upon themselves
belatedly.)

1342
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,820
You must've thought,
"Why did I come here?"

1343
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:20,660
You struggled a lot
because you met two old men with a temper.

1344
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:21,800
Seriously.

1345
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,530
Pani Bottle, when was the best moment?

1346
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:26,940
I remember riding a motorcycle
in South America.

1347
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:33,110
(The riding trip was full of romance
from the start.)

1348
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,740
I remember almost dying in Leh, India.

1349
00:54:35,910 --> 00:54:37,580
- I caught a cold.
- That's right.

1350
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:39,580
- It was a cold then too.
- That's right.

1351
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:40,580
I catch a cold every day.

1352
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:42,550
I catch a cold every time I visit
Adventure by Accident.

1353
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:44,550
(Eating)

1354
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:46,990
I thought the university in Madagascar...

1355
00:54:47,090 --> 00:54:48,890
was really nice.

1356
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:50,760
- The university was nice.
- It was nice.

1357
00:54:52,090 --> 00:54:53,760
(Do you want to drink beer with us
afterward?)

1358
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,130
(No.)

1359
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:59,070
(His request for beer got rejected.)

1360
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:02,100
Who would've thought to eat
cafeteria food in Madagascar?

1361
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:04,840
Seriously.
You guys had a variety of experiences.

1362
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:10,910
Why do I feel like
I'm on the verge of tears?

1363
00:55:10,910 --> 00:55:13,050
- Why is that?
- Why? Oh, no.

1364
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:14,580
It's the last day of the trip.

1365
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:18,620
Knowing that it was the last day
made me emotional.

1366
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:21,690
That was why I took many photos.
I had brought so many film rolls...

1367
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:23,590
in order to take many photos.

1368
00:55:23,590 --> 00:55:25,160
I printed the photos...

1369
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:27,030
- and turned them into an album.
- Did you print them?

1370
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:28,030
- Yes.
- Really?

1371
00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:29,560
- Yes. Here.
- What?

1372
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:33,170
But... My goodness. Let's take a look.

1373
00:55:34,670 --> 00:55:35,800
(Moved)

1374
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:38,840
It has the vibe
of an old family photo album.

1375
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,380
- Seriously.
- It does.

1376
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:42,180
(Kian84, stop! Pani Bottle.)

1377
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:43,780
(Dex,
the three of you should stand over there.)

1378
00:55:44,410 --> 00:55:46,920
(No matter where they were at,)

1379
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:49,580
(the eldest member
recorded the passing moments.)

1380
00:55:50,450 --> 00:55:52,920
(The passing moments came together.)

1381
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:55,860
- The colors are nice.
- You took nice photos.

1382
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:57,430
(They went into the thick album.)

1383
00:55:57,430 --> 00:55:59,890
- Seriously, I...
- This is nice.

1384
00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:02,230
I've collected photos
from the 1st to 3rd seasons.

1385
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:03,730
- It feels strange.
- There are so many photos.

1386
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,840
I remember this moment.
I was walking ahead of Si Eon...

1387
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:08,940
when he yelled, "Hey, look back."
He took a photo when I looked back.

1388
00:56:09,770 --> 00:56:11,840
- It's the charm of film.
- That's right.

1389
00:56:12,310 --> 00:56:14,210
- This photo is nice.
- Seriously.

1390
00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:15,610
Only photos remain.

1391
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:17,180
- That's right. Only photos remain.
- Only photos remain.

1392
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:18,680
He snapped a photo of my back
as I threw up.

1393
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:20,050
- That's right.
- It happened in Lijiang.

1394
00:56:20,050 --> 00:56:22,220
- I remember this. It was cute.
- Alpacas.

1395
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:25,050
Looking at the photos
makes me remember everything. It's nice.

1396
00:56:25,490 --> 00:56:26,990
He's different since he's an author.

1397
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,290
- A great author.
- He debuted.

1398
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,190
Seo Su Nam and Ha Cheong Il.

1399
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:34,030
Yu Jae Seok and Park Myung Soo.
Cha Tae Hyun and Zo In Sung.

1400
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:35,260
Kian84 and Lee Si Eon.

1401
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:37,330
(And Kian84 and Lee Si Eon)

1402
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:38,700
(We make a fantastic pair.)

1403
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:39,770
I can't believe it.

1404
00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:41,770
I got a letter right here.

1405
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:45,640
"You must've struggled so much
to travel with the two awkward men."

1406
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:47,380
"But you'll go on a trip with us again,
right?"

1407
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:49,910
"You're my multi-talented travelGPT."

1408
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:51,010
"TravelGPT."

1409
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:53,080
(It's Si Eon's unique way
of expressing affection.)

1410
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:54,580
Is there one for Dex as well?

1411
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:56,920
- The one for Dex is gold.
- It's gold.

1412
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,050
What? Why is it different?

1413
00:56:58,250 --> 00:56:59,790
I gilded it in 18k gold.

1414
00:56:59,790 --> 00:57:00,990
The order is taking longer to complete.

1415
00:57:00,990 --> 00:57:02,020
I'll receive it on Sunday.

1416
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:03,890
- I plan to deliver it then.
- Thank you.

1417
00:57:04,190 --> 00:57:06,030
- Thank you.
- It's cool.

1418
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:07,900
It's cool.

1419
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:10,670
- Tomorrow, we'll bow.
- Yes.

1420
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:13,970
The temple opens at 8 a.m.
Why don't we do it there?

1421
00:57:13,970 --> 00:57:14,970
Really?

1422
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:16,340
I need to look it up.

1423
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:18,510
(He quickly looks for a different temple.)

1424
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:22,140
I have something to tell you.
It's about tomorrow.

1425
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:26,820
Kian84 watched people who were doing
the 5-point prostration...

1426
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:28,850
and said that he wanted to do it
with them...

1427
00:57:28,850 --> 00:57:30,250
- on the same spot.
- Yes.

1428
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:34,390
We found a neighborhood you could go to.

1429
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:36,590
Let's do it as much as we can.

1430
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:39,830
It's the last day. Let's fight on.

1431
00:57:39,830 --> 00:57:42,730
- Let's fight on.
- Let's fight on for real.

1432
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:44,230
Are you trying to make it a catchphrase?

1433
00:57:45,870 --> 00:57:48,440
(The Three Brothers come back
to the lodging after eating.)

1434
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:50,310
- Pani Bottle, will you wake up early?
- Yes.

1435
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:52,570
- Please wake me up.
- Okay.

1436
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:54,110
- I have a lot to do.
- Okay.

1437
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:56,340
Pani Bottle worked as an alarm clock too.

1438
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:59,280
"My travelGPT."

1439
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:01,220
We can't do anything without Pani Bottle.

1440
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:02,620
I was practically a machine.

1441
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:05,790
I'll wake up around 4 or 4:30 a.m.

1442
00:58:05,990 --> 00:58:07,120
I'm good with 4:30 a.m.

1443
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:09,320
How nice.

1444
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:11,160
(The last activity is coming up.)

1445
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:13,360
- Shall I turn off the light?
- Yes.

1446
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:14,900
(The Three Brothers' last night deepens.)

1447
00:58:26,370 --> 00:58:29,780
(Alarm Bottle wakes up first.)

1448
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:33,180
(He goes to wash up.)

1449
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:36,950
(Coughing)

1450
00:58:36,950 --> 00:58:37,990
Oh, no.

1451
00:58:37,990 --> 00:58:38,990
(Coughing)

1452
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:42,090
(The room gets filled up
with their coughs.)

1453
00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:43,960
My throat hurt so much.

1454
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:45,130
- It was dry.
- Yes.

1455
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:46,590
It's painful to watch.

1456
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:50,370
Everyone was sick
toward the end of the trip.

1457
00:58:50,830 --> 00:58:52,500
When we were in Nepal in the beginning,
I was the only one who was sick.

1458
00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:54,640
Toward the end, everyone was sick.

1459
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:56,570
Toward the end,
all three of us had caught a cold.

1460
00:58:57,510 --> 00:58:59,240
To be honest, it's painful.

1461
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:01,280
We don't talk in the room.

1462
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:03,240
We only hear coughs.

1463
00:59:03,950 --> 00:59:05,750
I'm not pious to begin with.

1464
00:59:06,950 --> 00:59:08,250
(They communicate through coughs.)

1465
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:09,450
What an experience.

1466
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:11,390
As soon as the three of us woke up,

1467
00:59:11,890 --> 00:59:14,120
we coughed, sighed, and swore.
We only did those three things.

1468
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:15,590
It must've been so hard.

1469
00:59:15,590 --> 00:59:19,430
It has been about a week
since we came to the alpine region.

1470
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:20,760
It has been nearly a week.

1471
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:24,730
We're at our physical limit.
I think that's the case.

1472
00:59:25,030 --> 00:59:26,030
(Sighing)

1473
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:32,810
(Groaning)

1474
00:59:33,910 --> 00:59:35,910
(I want to cry)

1475
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:38,650
It's funny when you swear in your sleep,
Kian84.

1476
00:59:38,850 --> 00:59:39,980
- Did I swear?
- Yes.

1477
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:41,980
- Really? Did I do that in my sleep?
- Yes.

1478
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:43,850
I thought he was fighting someone.

1479
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:45,790
Hey, you punk.

1480
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,420
- Are you serious?
- Why are you telling me now, you punk?

1481
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:52,390
For goodness' sake.

1482
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:54,960
Did he sleep talk like that?

1483
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,900
It wasn't me.

1484
00:59:57,500 --> 01:00:00,700
It was the scream
of the evil spirit inside me.

1485
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:05,210
"Why do you keep praying at a temple?
Why do you do that?"

1486
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:09,040
The evil spirit was startled
when I visited a holy place.

1487
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:11,610
You spat out the evil spirit
before doing the five-point prostration.

1488
01:00:11,610 --> 01:00:14,050
It was almost like an exorcism.

1489
01:00:14,050 --> 01:00:15,150
That's right.

1490
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:18,490
I didn't swear. The evil spirit did.

1491
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:20,790
Let's leave it at that.

1492
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:26,630
I guess the evil spirit inside me
finally woke up.

1493
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:28,530
Let's fight on a bit more.

1494
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:31,370
- Pani Bottle.
- Yes.

1495
01:00:31,930 --> 01:00:32,930
Let's get ready.

1496
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:33,940
(They set off to do
the five-point prostration.)

1497
01:00:39,610 --> 01:00:41,110
(It's still early in the morning.)

1498
01:00:41,110 --> 01:00:42,610
- It's dark.
- It was pitch black.

1499
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:47,450
(The brothers head over
to do the last activity.)

1500
01:00:50,590 --> 01:00:52,190
All of us were in bad condition,

1501
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:53,920
but no one said, "I can't do it."

1502
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:54,990
Seriously.

1503
01:00:55,090 --> 01:00:57,330
- It was the last activity.
- It was the last activity.

1504
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:06,100
Is it because it's the last trip?
It's quite a struggle.

1505
01:01:06,370 --> 01:01:08,500
Our prayer will bring good results.

1506
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:11,910
That's right. This is why people say
that it's hard to pray in the morning.

1507
01:01:11,910 --> 01:01:15,440
That's right. Who would've thought to do
a burpee prayer in the morning?

1508
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:16,780
(Who does a burpee prayer in the morning?)

1509
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:20,310
(Well...)

1510
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:21,320
Now...

1511
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:23,220
This is the last day of our trip.

1512
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,220
We set out for our last activity,

1513
01:01:25,790 --> 01:01:27,360
the five-point prostration.

1514
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:28,620
(Adventure by accident...)

1515
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:29,620
We were on our way...

1516
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:31,630
to the early-morning prayer.

1517
01:01:31,890 --> 01:01:35,060
(The five-point prostration
will complete their journey.)

1518
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:36,900
We made a promise to do it together.

1519
01:01:37,630 --> 01:01:38,670
So...

1520
01:01:39,030 --> 01:01:40,940
personally, I think this is...

1521
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:42,840
the most important activity of this trip.

1522
01:01:43,810 --> 01:01:46,440
- I started to get nervous.
- I see.

1523
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:50,040
- It was definitely a strange feeling.
- It made us feel reverent too.

1524
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:53,450
My gosh, we're here.

1525
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:56,620
- We've arrived. Hey.
- I can't see anything.

1526
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:58,420
(They arrive at the location
for the 5-point prostration at 5:30 a.m.)

1527
01:01:58,750 --> 01:01:59,750
The sun is slowly coming up.

1528
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:01,160
(The sky is still dark.)

1529
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:03,990
It feels like we're going to war.

1530
01:02:05,490 --> 01:02:06,560
Let's tie up our gear.

1531
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:09,900
(Carrying a handful of stuff in each hand)

1532
01:02:10,330 --> 01:02:13,900
(They were coming up with their plan
for the five-point prostration.)

1533
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:17,310
(They decided to pray
in the form they saw fit.)

1534
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:20,840
(Let's show as much respect as we can.)

1535
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:23,410
I don't know what this is,
but it's perfect for protecting the knees.

1536
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:24,850
We can totally use them.

1537
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:28,380
We went to a hardware store
to buy whatever we needed.

1538
01:02:28,850 --> 01:02:30,950
(With the supplies
from the hardware store...)

1539
01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:34,860
There's no set attire or gear
for five-point prostration.

1540
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:37,230
We prepared them with the utmost respect.

1541
01:02:38,830 --> 01:02:41,430
(Gearing up before they begin)

1542
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:43,800
- Gosh, the rocks here are super cold.
- Right.

1543
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:47,470
- We forgot to consider that.
- The rocks are ice cold.

1544
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:51,810
(Padding up their knees first)

1545
01:02:52,710 --> 01:02:55,410
(Then padding up their elbows too)

1546
01:02:57,110 --> 01:02:58,610
Yes. You must fully prepare yourselves.

1547
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:03,550
(They're almost ready to begin.)

1548
01:03:03,550 --> 01:03:05,790
(Thinking)

1549
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:08,690
- Let's not pad up our forehead.
- You won't pad up your forehead?

1550
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:10,560
You won't pad up the forehead?

1551
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:12,030
Let me test it out first.

1552
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:14,730
The forehead is going to be
the first part that hurts.

1553
01:03:15,130 --> 01:03:16,160
Let me show you.

1554
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:18,570
(The eldest brother gives his all.)

1555
01:03:20,370 --> 01:03:21,500
We have to pad up our forehead.

1556
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:23,500
- We'll get scratches if we don't.
- You have to pad up.

1557
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:25,010
I'll carry it with me.

1558
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:26,840
- If it hurts, I'll put it on.
- Try it.

1559
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:29,580
- I'll put it on if it hurts.
- Really?

1560
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:30,580
(He'll try to communicate
with Mother Earth directly.)

1561
01:03:32,010 --> 01:03:33,510
It's gradually getting brighter.

1562
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:35,520
(As they gear up one body part at a time,)

1563
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:37,390
(the sky begins to brighten in no time.)

1564
01:03:37,390 --> 01:03:39,220
- Just getting ready...
- We might be able to see the sun.

1565
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:40,320
(the sky begins to brighten in no time.)

1566
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:44,990
(Morning light creeps in,
tinged with blue.)

1567
01:03:46,330 --> 01:03:51,300
(People wake up before dawn breaks.)

1568
01:03:52,230 --> 01:03:55,400
- I see. They're getting ready.
- They get ready early in the morning.

1569
01:03:57,770 --> 01:03:59,640
Some people did it in the same spot.

1570
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:02,740
- Everyone has their own way of doing it.
- Right.

1571
01:04:03,950 --> 01:04:05,150
Other people are coming.

1572
01:04:05,150 --> 01:04:06,250
- They are?
- Hey.

1573
01:04:07,850 --> 01:04:10,520
They are walking while spinning that.
Walking is another form...

1574
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:13,390
- Right. I heard people did that too.
- of five-point prostration.

1575
01:04:14,620 --> 01:04:17,060
(The Buddhist scriptures are written
on the inside.)

1576
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:20,490
Some people pray
while spinning the mani wheels.

1577
01:04:20,490 --> 01:04:22,030
A lot of people are carrying that.

1578
01:04:22,830 --> 01:04:26,070
(They will begin at the white tower
where others are headed.)

1579
01:04:27,570 --> 01:04:32,370
(Once they walk halfway
around the mountain along the trail,)

1580
01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:36,680
(they will reach the summit
after climbing a steep hill.)

1581
01:04:37,250 --> 01:04:40,080
I bet some people do this every morning.

1582
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:41,080
- Yes.
- Right.

1583
01:04:41,550 --> 01:04:45,720
(The path of prayers heading to Tharchog
on the Tea Horse Road)

1584
01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:47,390
- Let's go before the sun comes up.
- Okay.

1585
01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:50,160
- Pani, don't force it if your back hurts.
- Okay.

1586
01:04:50,860 --> 01:04:53,790
- He has a bad back.
- I have medical conditions all over me.

1587
01:04:54,860 --> 01:04:56,830
(Bowing)

1588
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:01,240
Experiencing a day
in the life of the locals...

1589
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:03,300
and sharing that experience...

1590
01:05:04,570 --> 01:05:05,610
is...

1591
01:05:06,070 --> 01:05:08,240
the aim of our trip in my opinion.

1592
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:11,780
So I wanted to get
a taste of this experience.

1593
01:05:12,650 --> 01:05:13,750
- Here I go.
- Okay.

1594
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:17,390
(They begin with a prayer
from the bottom of their hearts.)

1595
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:24,890
(All three of them fall onto the ground.)

1596
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:30,200
(They walk over to the spot
where their hands touched.)

1597
01:05:30,970 --> 01:05:33,530
(Falling back onto the ground)

1598
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:37,810
(Although it feels awkward,
Eon and Pani are getting the hang of it.)

1599
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:42,780
(On the other hand...)

1600
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:44,480
Hold on.

1601
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:48,180
He didn't have any pads on his forehead.

1602
01:05:51,150 --> 01:05:54,460
(He engraves the stamp
of the local life on his forehead.)

1603
01:05:56,990 --> 01:05:59,090
(That's impressive.)

1604
01:05:59,430 --> 01:06:01,800
- "He's a true Buddhist."
- "He's got my respect."

1605
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:08,170
(Glancing back)

1606
01:06:11,370 --> 01:06:12,540
Who said I shouldn't pad up my forehead?

1607
01:06:15,010 --> 01:06:16,140
What kind of idiot said that?

1608
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:18,280
- Let's not pad up the forehead.
- He was the one who said that.

1609
01:06:18,450 --> 01:06:19,450
I might drill a hole in my forehead.

1610
01:06:19,450 --> 01:06:21,680
(The evil spirit takes over,
3 minutes into their journey.)

1611
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:24,290
(Sealing away his evil spirit
deep inside his head)

1612
01:06:24,290 --> 01:06:26,150
I did a few bows
without the pad on my forehead.

1613
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:29,490
- Gosh, it must have hurt.
- The rock scratched my forehead.

1614
01:06:30,390 --> 01:06:31,930
- The rock scratched my forehead.
- No.

1615
01:06:31,930 --> 01:06:33,060
You have to pad up your forehead for sure.

1616
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:36,930
(After protecting his head
with a tightened pad,)

1617
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,940
(his practice resumes.)

1618
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:54,050
(As the morning dew settles on them,)

1619
01:06:55,150 --> 01:07:01,320
(the three of them place their foreheads
on the dusty ground.)

1620
01:07:04,530 --> 01:07:07,960
(They're in a foreign land,)

1621
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:11,530
(experiencing an unfamiliar culture.)

1622
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:21,310
(But they move forward
one step at a time with respect.)

1623
01:07:21,810 --> 01:07:23,580
(Coughing)

1624
01:07:24,310 --> 01:07:25,580
When I breathed in
with my head on the ground,

1625
01:07:25,580 --> 01:07:26,650
the dust went up my nose.

1626
01:07:26,650 --> 01:07:28,550
- The dust went up your nose.
- Yes, I inhaled the dust.

1627
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:31,590
(Staggering)

1628
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:43,330
Physically speaking...

1629
01:07:44,170 --> 01:07:46,900
I mean, I like running
and participating in marathons.

1630
01:07:48,370 --> 01:07:51,070
I just thought it would be difficult.

1631
01:07:51,610 --> 01:07:54,810
I didn't think much of it beyond that.
But once I began,

1632
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:00,510
it was different.

1633
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:04,790
The gravel on the ground was quite sharp.

1634
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:07,960
The gravel kept poking my knees.

1635
01:08:10,930 --> 01:08:12,790
I kept breathing in the dust.

1636
01:08:12,790 --> 01:08:14,500
(There were gravel, dust,)

1637
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:16,360
And there was poop too.

1638
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:18,570
(and animal excrement.)

1639
01:08:20,770 --> 01:08:23,070
The act itself...

1640
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:25,710
It's just tough.

1641
01:08:27,210 --> 01:08:29,610
My ribs hurt a lot.

1642
01:08:31,580 --> 01:08:33,910
Because the ground was bumpy,
I thought my ribs would break.

1643
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:39,550
(Exhaling)

1644
01:08:42,290 --> 01:08:44,190
Once I started, I couldn't believe it.
"People do this until they reach Lhasa?"

1645
01:08:44,190 --> 01:08:46,860
(They endure this much pain
until they reach Lhasa?)

1646
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:50,230
Walking there would already be tough.

1647
01:08:50,230 --> 01:08:52,170
(The journey of hardship
goes beyond the bounds of ordinary life.)

1648
01:08:53,070 --> 01:08:54,100
It's just unimaginable.

1649
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:58,810
People say life is a struggle.
That's what a real struggle looks like.

1650
01:09:01,710 --> 01:09:05,480
(As the journey is much harder
than they imagined,)

1651
01:09:07,050 --> 01:09:12,150
(the three of them continue praying
without saying a word.)

1652
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:19,690
(The only sounds they hear
are hands scraping the earth...)

1653
01:09:22,230 --> 01:09:28,070
(and their heavy breaths
as they try to catch their breath.)

1654
01:09:31,210 --> 01:09:33,610
I thought we would talk a bit
during our journey there.

1655
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:35,340
But we couldn't.

1656
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:38,250
I couldn't help but focus on myself.

1657
01:09:39,580 --> 01:09:41,780
When I run marathons,
I get to focus on myself too.

1658
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:45,320
But I have to check the time
for my record when I run.

1659
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:47,890
But during this journey,

1660
01:09:48,460 --> 01:09:50,420
I fully focused on myself.

1661
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:52,560
(An exclusive conversation with yourself)

1662
01:09:53,530 --> 01:09:56,760
(Meanwhile, ahead of them...)

1663
01:09:57,430 --> 01:09:59,370
(is the eldest brother...)

1664
01:09:59,370 --> 01:10:04,810
(who executes each posture
with the utmost care.)

1665
01:10:07,610 --> 01:10:10,240
Well, I have a lot of wishes,
like good health for my parents...

1666
01:10:11,050 --> 01:10:13,310
and my wife
who's waiting for me at home now.

1667
01:10:14,820 --> 01:10:16,050
And...

1668
01:10:16,050 --> 01:10:19,620
(And he carefully opens up.)

1669
01:10:19,620 --> 01:10:20,990
just like everyone else,

1670
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:24,560
I must also have a wish of my own.

1671
01:10:25,530 --> 01:10:27,630
There is one big wish...

1672
01:10:28,230 --> 01:10:30,460
my family and I are hoping for.

1673
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:36,340
(A few days ago,
when they were in the Nakhi village...)

1674
01:10:36,940 --> 01:10:39,810
(There's something
I want to ask him for real, but I can't.)

1675
01:10:40,470 --> 01:10:43,040
(Hesitant)

1676
01:10:43,580 --> 01:10:44,780
(Is it a secret?)

1677
01:10:46,050 --> 01:10:48,120
(He seemed much more nervous...)

1678
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:51,150
(before trying
the five-point prostration.)

1679
01:10:52,450 --> 01:10:54,990
Well, it's not a big secret or anything.

1680
01:10:55,620 --> 01:10:57,960
The truth is...

1681
01:10:58,490 --> 01:11:01,630
I mean,
everyone thinks about forming a family.

1682
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,330
It's about that.

1683
01:11:03,330 --> 01:11:05,700
We decided to try for a baby
starting this year.

1684
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:08,740
I just wanted
our sincere wish to come true.

1685
01:11:09,070 --> 01:11:12,610
That's why I took this journey
more seriously.

1686
01:11:12,610 --> 01:11:14,740
(The eldest brother wholeheartedly
partook in the five-point prostration.)

1687
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:22,550
I wondered if taking this seriously
would help...

1688
01:11:22,550 --> 01:11:24,820
my wish come true.

1689
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:33,490
If that was the case, I thought
I should perhaps take it seriously...

1690
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:38,530
and give it a try
without inconveniencing others.

1691
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:40,170
I wondered
if it was something we could do.

1692
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:41,570
That's what crossed my mind.

1693
01:11:44,710 --> 01:11:46,040
I'm not religious.

1694
01:11:47,210 --> 01:11:49,140
But I was praying to the world.

1695
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:51,880
(A prayer to the world)

1696
01:11:57,450 --> 01:11:59,420
I wanted my wish...

1697
01:11:59,420 --> 01:12:00,990
to come true someday.

1698
01:12:00,990 --> 01:12:02,760
It didn't matter
if it happened this year or next year.

1699
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:06,490
Throughout my journey, I focused...

1700
01:12:06,860 --> 01:12:09,330
on praying for that wish of mine.

1701
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:11,770
When you want something
with your whole heart, it comes true.

1702
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:21,210
(Far...)

1703
01:12:23,110 --> 01:12:25,910
(behind him,)

1704
01:12:26,750 --> 01:12:27,750
(Pani Bottle struggles to catch up.)

1705
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:28,950
- He has a bad back.
- He wasn't feeling well.

1706
01:12:28,950 --> 01:12:30,780
He has a bad back.
So this was tough on him.

1707
01:12:33,490 --> 01:12:36,860
Well, you also have to take
our height difference into consideration.

1708
01:12:37,460 --> 01:12:38,830
The gravel hurts a lot.

1709
01:12:38,830 --> 01:12:41,830
The gravel kept scraping me.

1710
01:12:43,630 --> 01:12:45,100
(Coughing)

1711
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:46,830
(Sighing)

1712
01:12:47,070 --> 01:12:49,100
Gurkha Academy focused...

1713
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:50,970
on the physical training.

1714
01:12:51,110 --> 01:12:53,040
But the five-point prostration...

1715
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:54,810
- was mental training.
- Right.

1716
01:12:58,150 --> 01:13:00,450
It's important for me
to try it and experience it.

1717
01:13:01,650 --> 01:13:03,950
I wanted to make it as far as I could
without injuring myself.

1718
01:13:03,950 --> 01:13:06,620
(Let's make it as far as I can.)

1719
01:13:07,620 --> 01:13:10,390
(Meanwhile, to wait for Pani,)

1720
01:13:10,890 --> 01:13:14,830
(the older ones take a short break.)

1721
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:17,330
- Aren't you tired?
- I am.

1722
01:13:18,370 --> 01:13:20,930
But this is making me feel reverent
for some reason.

1723
01:13:20,930 --> 01:13:23,440
- I kind of choked up down there.
- Same here.

1724
01:13:23,770 --> 01:13:25,470
- Hey.
- I even teared up at first.

1725
01:13:25,470 --> 01:13:26,610
- Really?
- Yes.

1726
01:13:26,940 --> 01:13:29,310
I didn't cry because I didn't want people
to call me a crybaby.

1727
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:31,380
I cried way too many times on this show.

1728
01:13:31,780 --> 01:13:33,750
(Teary-eyed)

1729
01:13:34,350 --> 01:13:36,150
I rarely cry too.

1730
01:13:36,350 --> 01:13:37,790
Because I don't cry at all...

1731
01:13:37,790 --> 01:13:40,990
I thought
my heart wasn't functioning or something.

1732
01:13:40,990 --> 01:13:42,960
- Really?
- Yes. After that day,

1733
01:13:43,660 --> 01:13:46,630
- I've been crying a lot.
- I saw him cry a lot on TV after that.

1734
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:49,560
I think my emotional block was removed
after the five-point prostration.

1735
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:51,930
This is fascinating.

1736
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:54,430
It might be because we want it
from the bottom of our hearts.

1737
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:55,470
(A priceless experience
of looking after their emotions)

1738
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:57,770
But the monks from earlier...

1739
01:13:58,470 --> 01:13:59,540
Yes?

1740
01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:01,040
- Hello.
- Hello.

1741
01:14:06,050 --> 01:14:07,210
(Speaking a foreign language)

1742
01:14:07,210 --> 01:14:08,280
- Yes.
- What?

1743
01:14:08,350 --> 01:14:09,820
- Does she want us to buy that?
- What does that mean?

1744
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:10,950
Does she want us to buy that?

1745
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:12,820
(Have some bread.)

1746
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:13,820
Bread?

1747
01:14:14,590 --> 01:14:16,220
I guess she wants us to eat this.

1748
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:17,990
She gave it to us for free.

1749
01:14:17,990 --> 01:14:19,860
- Really?
- I see.

1750
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:21,330
- She's giving it to you.
- Thank you.

1751
01:14:21,330 --> 01:14:22,800
(An unexpected gesture of warmth)

1752
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:23,830
Thank you.

1753
01:14:23,830 --> 01:14:26,700
I see. When they see people
doing the five-point prostration,

1754
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:29,800
they give out snacks and food
out of respect.

1755
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:31,340
- It's their culture.
- I see.

1756
01:14:31,340 --> 01:14:33,040
- Just like the drinks at marathons.
- Thank you.

1757
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:34,110
- Right.
- Yes.

1758
01:14:34,110 --> 01:14:36,110
- They're cheering for you.
- Yes, people cheer for you.

1759
01:14:36,110 --> 01:14:37,240
"It will come true."

1760
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:39,910
(The residents offer blessings
for each other's prayers.)

1761
01:14:39,910 --> 01:14:41,320
Let's share one together.

1762
01:14:44,650 --> 01:14:46,620
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1763
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:51,230
(It tastes amazing!)

1764
01:14:51,230 --> 01:14:54,330
- She really encouraged us big time.
- Right.

1765
01:14:54,330 --> 01:14:56,400
- She knew what you were going through.
- Yes.

1766
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:57,500
(Then she goes on her way.)

1767
01:14:58,670 --> 01:15:01,030
(She also offers bread...)

1768
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:06,270
(to Pani Bottle
who's been falling behind.)

1769
01:15:08,740 --> 01:15:09,740
Is it tough?

1770
01:15:09,940 --> 01:15:10,980
(Chuckling)

1771
01:15:10,980 --> 01:15:13,150
Thank you.

1772
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:15,250
I love the smile of the Tibetan people.

1773
01:15:15,250 --> 01:15:17,580
- They have this benevolent smile.
- They're such kind people.

1774
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:23,890
I don't actually like bread like that.

1775
01:15:23,890 --> 01:15:25,860
I like hard bread like the baguette.

1776
01:15:26,090 --> 01:15:28,360
I don't like bread
that has bits of chocolate...

1777
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:29,600
here and there.

1778
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:31,130
- You don't like bread with chocolate?
- No.

1779
01:15:31,570 --> 01:15:34,900
So let me finish.
Listen to the whole interview.

1780
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:36,670
After having the bread,
I suddenly felt a surge of energy.

1781
01:15:36,670 --> 01:15:38,240
I'm serious. It was like magic.

1782
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:39,870
I didn't think I could get up again.

1783
01:15:39,870 --> 01:15:41,210
But after having the bread,

1784
01:15:41,580 --> 01:15:42,880
I suddenly felt more energetic.

1785
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:44,010
(An ordinary greeting
and a piece of bread)

1786
01:15:44,180 --> 01:15:45,410
Pani Bottle.

1787
01:15:47,250 --> 01:15:49,250
(The eldest brother comes
to check on Pani Bottle as he's worried.)

1788
01:15:50,050 --> 01:15:51,120
Do you think you can do it?

1789
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:52,190
(Nodding)

1790
01:15:52,190 --> 01:15:54,490
- He's back at it again.
- He goes back to it with some energy.

1791
01:15:54,490 --> 01:15:55,790
(He gets his energy up
and sets out again.)

1792
01:15:56,220 --> 01:15:57,620
Then we'll resume too.

1793
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:00,790
Gosh, the bread is tasty.

1794
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,270
Gosh, I'm burping.

1795
01:16:06,130 --> 01:16:07,270
His digestive system is good.

1796
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:13,270
(Meanwhile,
the sun has come up completely.)

1797
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:18,080
(The scenery along the Tea Horse Road
in the midst of Mother Nature...)

1798
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:19,950
(is lit up, one spot at a time.)

1799
01:16:19,950 --> 01:16:21,950
Greeting the morning while doing that...

1800
01:16:21,950 --> 01:16:23,150
must feel surreal.

1801
01:16:23,150 --> 01:16:24,650
(is lit up, one spot at a time.)

1802
01:16:25,890 --> 01:16:29,190
(With the most earnest gestures,)

1803
01:16:29,990 --> 01:16:31,290
(they leave their marks
on the Tea Horse Road.)

1804
01:16:31,290 --> 01:16:33,830
You guys really outdid yourselves
this time.

1805
01:16:35,030 --> 01:16:37,900
(In no time, they pass the halfway point.)

1806
01:16:39,530 --> 01:16:41,800
(They arrive at a steep hill...)

1807
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:44,610
(leading up to the summit.)

1808
01:16:44,610 --> 01:16:46,610
- That's a very steep hill.
- Yes.

1809
01:16:48,810 --> 01:16:52,550
(They begin climbing the hill
without bracing themselves.)

1810
01:16:54,210 --> 01:16:59,990
(Labored breathing)

1811
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:05,060
(As the hill becomes steeper,)

1812
01:17:05,060 --> 01:17:07,830
(Exhaling)

1813
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:13,600
(their energy is drained.)

1814
01:17:15,670 --> 01:17:18,110
(Plopping down)

1815
01:17:24,750 --> 01:17:27,580
As I continued,
I became more desperate for it.

1816
01:17:29,180 --> 01:17:32,390
I wanted more desperately
my wish to come true,

1817
01:17:32,390 --> 01:17:34,320
which was quite shallow of me.

1818
01:17:37,860 --> 01:17:39,630
I was afraid that...

1819
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:43,500
my wishes wouldn't come true
if I gave up halfway through.

1820
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:44,830
(The fear of his wishes
not coming true...)

1821
01:17:44,930 --> 01:17:46,900
That thought made me anxious.

1822
01:17:47,470 --> 01:17:49,940
I know what you mean.
There are times when you get scared.

1823
01:17:55,540 --> 01:17:58,050
It might have to do with the posture...

1824
01:17:58,410 --> 01:18:01,310
where I'm laying myself down
on the ground.

1825
01:18:02,580 --> 01:18:05,520
It made me reflect on my life.

1826
01:18:11,790 --> 01:18:14,190
This posture stops me
from getting arrogant,

1827
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:18,100
overstepping,

1828
01:18:19,230 --> 01:18:22,300
or doing whatever I please.

1829
01:18:24,170 --> 01:18:26,770
This act itself humbles me...

1830
01:18:27,010 --> 01:18:28,180
and keeps me grounded.

1831
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:32,810
Bless you.

1832
01:18:33,810 --> 01:18:36,780
You must be praying
for something meaningful.

1833
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:38,520
Bless you.

1834
01:18:41,090 --> 01:18:42,760
But once I got past that,

1835
01:18:43,060 --> 01:18:45,630
it felt like it cleared up my mind.

1836
01:18:45,630 --> 01:18:48,730
Should I say
it felt like I was meditating?

1837
01:18:54,570 --> 01:18:57,000
Toward the end of the trip,

1838
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,110
we went from travelers to practitioners
of five-point prostration.

1839
01:19:02,210 --> 01:19:05,650
This was quite fitting for our show,
Adventure by Accident.

1840
01:19:06,010 --> 01:19:07,680
This trip brought us back to the roots.

1841
01:19:10,150 --> 01:19:13,290
(As they boldly throw themselves
into the culture of their destination,)

1842
01:19:13,890 --> 01:19:19,060
(they look back on their lives
at the same time.)

1843
01:19:19,390 --> 01:19:20,930
- Kian84.
- Yes.

1844
01:19:21,290 --> 01:19:23,430
I think we're getting close.

1845
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:27,670
(They've been walking
with their heads down for an hour.)

1846
01:19:27,670 --> 01:19:28,900
Let's do this.

1847
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:32,640
- My gosh.
- They're almost there.

1848
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:34,810
(In no time,
they approach the highest point.)

1849
01:19:35,740 --> 01:19:39,250
(The two brothers stand at the summit
side by side.)

1850
01:19:44,420 --> 01:19:46,050
We should keep circling
until Pani Bottle arrives.

1851
01:19:46,620 --> 01:19:48,260
- Really?
- You've done enough.

1852
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:49,690
But you guys made it.

1853
01:19:51,890 --> 01:19:56,060
(They drop down to the ground
without hesitating for a second.)

1854
01:19:57,660 --> 01:20:01,270
We saw some kind of Tibetan tower.

1855
01:20:01,540 --> 01:20:05,340
When I started,
I bowed down after taking five steps.

1856
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:10,810
Pani Bottle was lagging pretty far behind.

1857
01:20:11,910 --> 01:20:13,280
So I bowed down after three steps instead.

1858
01:20:14,650 --> 01:20:17,820
We don't have much left.
Why don't we do 3 steps, 1 bow?

1859
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:19,350
- Three steps, one bow? Okay.
- Yes.

1860
01:20:20,820 --> 01:20:22,990
That was how we went up the trail.

1861
01:20:23,890 --> 01:20:25,330
We couldn't spot Pani Bottle.

1862
01:20:26,690 --> 01:20:29,500
Since then,
we kept going around the pagoda.

1863
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:32,800
We just kept going around the pagoda
until Pani Bottle arrived.

1864
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:35,170
(While the older brothers
are praying for Pani Bottle,)

1865
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:41,310
(Pani Bottle has been left alone.)

1866
01:20:45,580 --> 01:20:46,850
I thought about it while lying down.

1867
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:52,650
I couldn't help but think about
why we were going this far.

1868
01:20:55,220 --> 01:20:58,460
If the others had finished the course
but I hadn't,

1869
01:20:58,460 --> 01:21:01,530
I was going to mark it and stop.

1870
01:21:09,070 --> 01:21:10,100
But as I kept going,

1871
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:13,010
it felt similar to life.

1872
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:17,410
Life isn't about achieving things quickly.

1873
01:21:22,450 --> 01:21:26,450
It sure was hard.
But here was the important part.

1874
01:21:28,590 --> 01:21:31,690
Whether you walk 5 steps, 3 steps,
or take a break in between,

1875
01:21:31,890 --> 01:21:33,230
no one will say anything.

1876
01:21:34,660 --> 01:21:35,860
A slight difference in posture...

1877
01:21:35,860 --> 01:21:37,430
doesn't mean
it's not a five-point prostration.

1878
01:21:39,270 --> 01:21:40,670
It simply felt great.

1879
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:45,440
It cleared up my mind.

1880
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:48,710
(My own answer found through hardship)

1881
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:51,340
As I continued,

1882
01:21:52,350 --> 01:21:53,880
it felt strange.

1883
01:21:55,020 --> 01:21:57,850
I had a flashback to Season One
of Adventure by Accident,

1884
01:21:58,790 --> 01:22:00,150
which made me emotional.

1885
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:03,390
Practicing
the five-point prostration well...

1886
01:22:03,390 --> 01:22:04,890
means wrapping up this trip
on a good note.

1887
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:07,430
Not giving up until the end...

1888
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:11,230
would mean
concluding our trip successfully.

1889
01:22:18,670 --> 01:22:21,710
When I thought it was the end of the show,

1890
01:22:21,710 --> 01:22:24,210
I wanted to be a part of it
until the very end.

1891
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:28,520
It was not only the end
of the five-point prostration...

1892
01:22:28,820 --> 01:22:30,120
but also the end of the show.

1893
01:22:32,690 --> 01:22:33,850
Great work, Pani Bottle.

1894
01:22:35,790 --> 01:22:37,320
The last one.

1895
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:39,490
(They were together until the end.)

1896
01:22:39,490 --> 01:22:40,630
The last one.

1897
01:22:40,630 --> 01:22:43,700
(The brothers
hug each other passionately.)

1898
01:22:44,230 --> 01:22:46,500
Finishing the last trip...

1899
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:50,500
with the members I began the show with...

1900
01:22:51,870 --> 01:22:53,410
made me...

1901
01:22:55,410 --> 01:22:56,480
happy.

1902
01:22:58,650 --> 01:23:00,380
The sunlight is shining on the mountain.

1903
01:23:00,380 --> 01:23:01,820
- My gosh.
- Perfect timing.

1904
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:05,850
(As if celebrating
the brothers' last journey,)

1905
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:09,660
(the Tea Horse Road scenery
shines brilliantly!)

1906
01:23:13,330 --> 01:23:15,060
- Do you feel better now?
- What?

1907
01:23:15,060 --> 01:23:16,200
We did what you wanted.

1908
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:17,830
Yes. I'm sorry.

1909
01:23:17,830 --> 01:23:19,200
No, I'm not nagging at you.

1910
01:23:20,270 --> 01:23:21,500
I'm just asking how you feel.

1911
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:23,100
- Okay.
- I'm not angry.

1912
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:25,470
I feel good too.

1913
01:23:26,910 --> 01:23:27,910
Same here.

1914
01:23:29,810 --> 01:23:30,940
I was really happy back then.

1915
01:23:32,350 --> 01:23:34,950
We may have started it
as it was on Kian84's bucket list,

1916
01:23:34,950 --> 01:23:37,180
but it felt like all three of us
were truly desperate.

1917
01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:40,250
It was an amazing experience,
and I mean it.

1918
01:23:40,250 --> 01:23:43,160
(The last trip
became memorable to all of us.)

1919
01:23:46,090 --> 01:23:47,730
Our fourth trip has finally ended.

1920
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:51,430
Honestly, I was in pain
and feeling under the weather...

1921
01:23:51,430 --> 01:23:53,700
because I had a cold throughout the trip.

1922
01:23:54,230 --> 01:23:56,240
But I came because...

1923
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:59,540
it was the last trip
with Kian84, Si Eon, and Dex.

1924
01:24:00,010 --> 01:24:03,540
Now that I think about it,

1925
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:06,610
I made the right choice coming here.

1926
01:24:07,150 --> 01:24:08,150
I don't regret a thing.

1927
01:24:08,980 --> 01:24:11,580
(From the first trip)

1928
01:24:11,820 --> 01:24:14,990
(Devoting himself
to the point of getting a nosebleed)

1929
01:24:15,190 --> 01:24:17,220
(When there was trouble,)

1930
01:24:17,620 --> 01:24:20,590
(Charismatic Pani handled it.)

1931
01:24:20,830 --> 01:24:23,200
(Overflowing with energy)

1932
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:26,800
(Pani Baguette had a good appetite.)

1933
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:29,070
(But during this trip,)

1934
01:24:29,340 --> 01:24:31,700
(Pani Bottle lost his appetite.)

1935
01:24:32,140 --> 01:24:35,980
(Vomit Bottle threw up
at least once a day.)

1936
01:24:36,180 --> 01:24:37,180
(Groaning)

1937
01:24:37,180 --> 01:24:38,380
(I give up.)

1938
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:41,780
(Even if he died, Pani Bottle wanted
to share the endless hardship.)

1939
01:24:41,980 --> 01:24:44,480
(Bottle! Pani Bottle!)

1940
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:47,020
(But with brothers cheering him on,)

1941
01:24:47,550 --> 01:24:50,520
(he successfully finished...)

1942
01:24:51,020 --> 01:24:53,530
(what he wouldn't have
even attempted alone.)

1943
01:24:53,860 --> 01:24:56,530
(He took on the tough jobs
for his grateful brothers.)

1944
01:24:56,530 --> 01:24:59,000
(You're doing everything from
booking the hotel to calling the taxi.)

1945
01:24:59,470 --> 01:25:01,600
Pani Bottle is very reliable.

1946
01:25:01,940 --> 01:25:05,440
(He took care of the brothers
as fast as an AI.)

1947
01:25:06,210 --> 01:25:08,170
We can't do anything without Pani Bottle.

1948
01:25:08,940 --> 01:25:09,940
(The show's indispensable guide)

1949
01:25:09,940 --> 01:25:11,410
It looks like the large intestine.

1950
01:25:11,410 --> 01:25:13,010
Without him, it would've been impossible.

1951
01:25:13,010 --> 01:25:16,320
Either way,
I've come this far, to the fifth trip,

1952
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:17,880
as Assistant Pani Bottle.

1953
01:25:18,150 --> 01:25:22,060
I felt relieved that we were able to spend
the last moments together.

1954
01:25:22,420 --> 01:25:24,860
Pani Bottle was like a different person
when traveling in his videos,

1955
01:25:24,860 --> 01:25:27,360
compared to when he traveled
with the three members.

1956
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:29,600
That difference must be why
I joined the trips.

1957
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:31,430
It's a lot more fun than traveling alone.

1958
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:33,830
Here's what I realized
now that the trip is over.

1959
01:25:34,430 --> 01:25:37,340
Our goal in life isn't simply to go fast.

1960
01:25:37,340 --> 01:25:41,410
Having fun and being happy
with the current situation is important.

1961
01:25:41,910 --> 01:25:44,580
(Having enjoyed every moment
at his own pace,)

1962
01:25:45,250 --> 01:25:48,380
(Pani Bottle is a true traveler.)

1963
01:25:48,780 --> 01:25:52,490
As I thought,
there are no answers in life.

1964
01:25:52,650 --> 01:25:55,050
I simply have to live
by doing what I want.

1965
01:25:55,520 --> 01:26:00,060
I'm proud of who I am right now,
living without big desires...

1966
01:26:00,060 --> 01:26:01,360
or ambitions.

1967
01:26:03,030 --> 01:26:05,970
I'm a guy who indulges in life...

1968
01:26:05,970 --> 01:26:08,200
to find fun and happiness.

1969
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:10,140
I really understood myself this time.

1970
01:26:10,670 --> 01:26:13,170
The big journey of three years
was amazing.

1971
01:26:13,810 --> 01:26:14,840
It was fun.

1972
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:18,040
I came to like traveling...

1973
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:21,650
because of the travel shows
I watched on TV when I was young.

1974
01:26:21,650 --> 01:26:23,380
I dreamed of traveling
while watching those shows.

1975
01:26:23,380 --> 01:26:25,320
Adventure by Accident
could become a show like that.

1976
01:26:25,420 --> 01:26:27,320
And now that I think about it,

1977
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:29,190
having appeared in it makes me feel...

1978
01:26:29,390 --> 01:26:30,490
emotional and happy.

1979
01:26:30,490 --> 01:26:31,520
(Touching as it could be someone's dream)

1980
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:35,360
All right, everyone.
Let's live doing the fun...

1981
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:37,700
and joyful things we want,
without suffering.

1982
01:26:38,670 --> 01:26:39,830
Life is fun, right?

1983
01:26:42,070 --> 01:26:43,070
The end.

1984
01:26:43,070 --> 01:26:45,070
(Adventure by Pani Bottle,
enjoyed at his own pace,)

1985
01:26:45,070 --> 01:26:47,670
(has ended.)

1986
01:26:48,070 --> 01:26:51,140
(They each left a farewell letter
in their own way.)

1987
01:26:52,550 --> 01:26:53,850
- Eon?
- The eldest.

1988
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:59,150
Adventure by Accident 4 has finished.

1989
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:01,390
When the show started,

1990
01:27:01,590 --> 01:27:05,020
I was happy and overjoyed
that I could travel...

1991
01:27:05,020 --> 01:27:06,860
with my beloved friend.

1992
01:27:07,530 --> 01:27:10,700
That was the sole reason
I decided to be on Adventure by Accident.

1993
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:15,900
(A joyful adventure,
relying on his best friend)

1994
01:27:15,900 --> 01:27:17,400
Yes, that was the first moment.

1995
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:21,370
(But there was a difference in opinion
from the start.)

1996
01:27:21,910 --> 01:27:26,110
(The city guy was more on edge
because of the unfamiliar food.)

1997
01:27:26,110 --> 01:27:28,410
(And before him,
the first strange man appeared.)

1998
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:29,920
(Is he your friend, Kian84?)

1999
01:27:30,150 --> 01:27:33,090
(Accompanied by another strange man)

2000
01:27:33,090 --> 01:27:34,820
(But the awkwardness didn't last long.)

2001
01:27:34,820 --> 01:27:35,820
They looked away.

2002
01:27:36,390 --> 01:27:42,030
(The brothers became like family
in no time.)

2003
01:27:42,030 --> 01:27:44,900
I was already best friends with Kian84.

2004
01:27:44,900 --> 01:27:47,530
But through Adventure by Accident,

2005
01:27:47,530 --> 01:27:50,370
I met Dex and Pani Bottle,
which I'm grateful for.

2006
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:52,910
We get along really well, like it's fate.

2007
01:27:52,910 --> 01:27:55,110
I've gained so much
through Adventure by Accident.

2008
01:27:55,410 --> 01:27:57,410
(For his beloved younger brothers,)

2009
01:27:57,810 --> 01:28:00,010
(the eldest turned a new leaf.)

2010
01:28:00,410 --> 01:28:03,080
(The thought of his younger brothers
gave him energy.)

2011
01:28:03,350 --> 01:28:06,490
(He found a shortcut for a short while,)

2012
01:28:06,850 --> 01:28:08,960
(but he pulled himself together
and worked hard until the end.)

2013
01:28:09,260 --> 01:28:11,260
(He grew by trying local cuisine.)

2014
01:28:11,260 --> 01:28:12,990
The city boy has changed a lot.

2015
01:28:13,290 --> 01:28:15,730
(When the younger brothers
weren't smiling enough)

2016
01:28:16,030 --> 01:28:18,800
(Tandoori is for two.)

2017
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:20,070
(Since we're in Nepal,)

2018
01:28:20,070 --> 01:28:21,900
(can't we make 4 arms
with 2 members each?)

2019
01:28:21,900 --> 01:28:23,100
It started then.

2020
01:28:23,100 --> 01:28:24,570
(Gifting laughter with his dad jokes)

2021
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:30,110
(The attentive eldest made his brother's
long-held dreams come true.)

2022
01:28:30,410 --> 01:28:32,850
Kian84. Pani Bottle. Dex.

2023
01:28:33,310 --> 01:28:36,850
Thank you for taking care of,
understanding,

2024
01:28:37,050 --> 01:28:38,420
and protecting the useless me.

2025
01:28:38,420 --> 01:28:41,850
But since you, Kian84,
got mad at me, I'll scold you.

2026
01:28:42,160 --> 01:28:43,990
(Joking)

2027
01:28:44,690 --> 01:28:48,160
Either way, thank you very much,
and I mean it.

2028
01:28:49,860 --> 01:28:51,660
I hope you can feel my sincerity.

2029
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:53,000
(A heartfelt message of gratitude)

2030
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,300
Now that it's over,

2031
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:00,910
all of our adventures are flashing by,
like life flashing before my eyes.

2032
01:29:02,780 --> 01:29:04,310
This must be what the end is like.

2033
01:29:07,780 --> 01:29:08,920
(Knowing it's the last adventure,)

2034
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:12,850
(he is overwhelmed
by bittersweet feelings.)

2035
01:29:19,330 --> 01:29:21,560
- Is he crying?
- What a crybaby.

2036
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:22,700
Oh, no.

2037
01:29:26,630 --> 01:29:28,370
I'm crying because I'm happy.

2038
01:29:32,070 --> 01:29:35,640
Oh, dear.
I've never seen him cry like that before.

2039
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:46,550
(Once this adventure is over,)

2040
01:29:48,050 --> 01:29:52,730
(he must bid farewell
to his dearest brothers.)

2041
01:29:54,730 --> 01:29:59,600
(The eldest doesn't want to let go
of this moment.)

2042
01:30:00,030 --> 01:30:02,540
The fact that I won't be able to meet...

2043
01:30:02,740 --> 01:30:05,940
Dex, Kian84, and Pani Bottle
on Adventure by Accident again...

2044
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:08,210
is heartbreaking.

2045
01:30:10,540 --> 01:30:11,840
But it's not the end,

2046
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:13,650
but "and."

2047
01:30:13,650 --> 01:30:15,720
We will meet again.

2048
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:19,020
Adventure by Accident ends here,

2049
01:30:19,020 --> 01:30:21,620
but if possible, I'd like to go on
World Adventure by Accident.

2050
01:30:22,690 --> 01:30:24,220
- An "and."
- There's no difference.

2051
01:30:24,220 --> 01:30:25,990
- "But it's not the end, but and."
- But...

2052
01:30:25,990 --> 01:30:27,130
It's a different show.

2053
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:29,230
(Wanting to be together again,
even by changing the title)

2054
01:30:29,730 --> 01:30:33,100
Those were precious and happy moments
in my life.

2055
01:30:34,370 --> 01:30:35,430
Thank you.

2056
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,900
(Dreaming of another beginning)

2057
01:30:38,370 --> 01:30:39,370
(Adventure by Si Eon,
ending with an "and,")

2058
01:30:39,370 --> 01:30:40,410
(Kissing)

2059
01:30:40,410 --> 01:30:41,470
(has ended.)

2060
01:30:41,470 --> 01:30:42,510
- The end.
- With a kiss.

2061
01:30:43,910 --> 01:30:46,610
Hi. It's "KianTV."

2062
01:30:47,210 --> 01:30:50,020
I've turned on "KianTV" for the last time.

2063
01:30:50,620 --> 01:30:53,250
I've traveled to many countries.

2064
01:30:53,820 --> 01:30:56,460
I've been to Bolivia and Peru
in South America,

2065
01:30:56,620 --> 01:30:58,860
India,

2066
01:30:59,130 --> 01:31:02,030
and Madagascar,
the only island nation in Africa.

2067
01:31:02,030 --> 01:31:05,330
This time, I've come to Nepal and Tibet...

2068
01:31:05,830 --> 01:31:07,130
along the Tea Horse Road.

2069
01:31:08,230 --> 01:31:10,370
I visited places I normally...

2070
01:31:10,370 --> 01:31:12,570
wouldn't be able to visit.

2071
01:31:14,170 --> 01:31:16,210
If you say it's an escape,
then it's an escape.

2072
01:31:16,210 --> 01:31:18,910
If you say it's a second chapter in life,
then so be it.

2073
01:31:18,910 --> 01:31:20,480
Don't people dream of it?

2074
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:26,290
(The trip he took
when he was slowly losing himself)

2075
01:31:26,290 --> 01:31:28,750
(Prey of touts from the very beginning)

2076
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:30,560
(Cash or credit card?)

2077
01:31:30,890 --> 01:31:32,120
(Laughing)

2078
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:33,130
(Gas or make it card?)

2079
01:31:33,330 --> 01:31:35,490
(Showing off his shocking English skills)

2080
01:31:35,830 --> 01:31:38,500
(Easily passing by the touts
on this 5th trip)

2081
01:31:38,900 --> 01:31:41,570
(Even his English skills
improved quickly.)

2082
01:31:41,770 --> 01:31:43,440
(I might be good at English.)

2083
01:31:43,970 --> 01:31:47,570
(But what had never changed
throughout the adventures was...)

2084
01:31:47,910 --> 01:31:50,440
(his way of feeling and embracing
the unfamiliar world...)

2085
01:31:50,810 --> 01:31:51,810
(with his whole body.)

2086
01:31:51,810 --> 01:31:53,380
That requires real courage.

2087
01:31:53,950 --> 01:31:55,210
In an unknown place...

2088
01:31:55,480 --> 01:31:58,280
filled with unknown things.

2089
01:31:58,850 --> 01:32:01,150
Carrying luggage for three days...

2090
01:32:01,350 --> 01:32:03,490
out of the five days was...

2091
01:32:04,790 --> 01:32:07,330
But traveling is experiencing
what you haven't.

2092
01:32:07,590 --> 01:32:09,630
I just threw myself into it.

2093
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:11,630
(An unfiltered traveler)

2094
01:32:11,630 --> 01:32:13,300
In a way...

2095
01:32:13,300 --> 01:32:15,500
I was never the class president...

2096
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:16,870
or department head.

2097
01:32:17,270 --> 01:32:20,210
Either way,
I was the host of this adventure.

2098
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:23,010
I had fun the way I wanted to.

2099
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:24,940
It was the best adventure.

2100
01:32:26,310 --> 01:32:32,220
(The unforgettable friends
who made the adventures more enjoyable)

2101
01:32:32,850 --> 01:32:35,120
(Sharing both luggage and feelings)

2102
01:32:35,420 --> 01:32:38,220
(They formed friendships
beyond nationality and age.)

2103
01:32:39,290 --> 01:32:41,590
You have friends in various places.

2104
01:32:41,590 --> 01:32:42,900
You're the richest of all.

2105
01:32:42,900 --> 01:32:46,370
Stay at someone’s home for a long time,
and you end up like family.

2106
01:32:47,030 --> 01:32:50,300
(Times shared with warm,
family-like affections)

2107
01:32:50,300 --> 01:32:53,140
Revealing one's life isn't easy.

2108
01:32:53,540 --> 01:32:55,240
I'm grateful that they did.

2109
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:58,610
Experiencing different people,

2110
01:32:58,610 --> 01:33:01,150
cultures, lifestyles,

2111
01:33:01,150 --> 01:33:03,750
and eating habits...

2112
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:05,750
has helped broaden my world.

2113
01:33:05,750 --> 01:33:06,790
(Kian84's world has broadened.)

2114
01:33:06,790 --> 01:33:09,690
If not,
I would've been a babe in the woods.

2115
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:12,120
(Hola!)

2116
01:33:12,330 --> 01:33:13,890
(Namaste.)

2117
01:33:14,290 --> 01:33:17,960
(He greeted many in different languages.)

2118
01:33:18,160 --> 01:33:19,870
(A record of 57 days over 3 years)

2119
01:33:19,870 --> 01:33:21,970
You traveled all over the world.

2120
01:33:22,070 --> 01:33:24,540
It was my only chance
to experience this kind of thing.

2121
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:28,570
The adventure
was a turning point in my life.

2122
01:33:29,980 --> 01:33:32,450
I used to draw webtoons,

2123
01:33:32,550 --> 01:33:35,980
served in the military,
attended university, and more.

2124
01:33:35,980 --> 01:33:37,080
Out of everything I've done in my life,

2125
01:33:37,480 --> 01:33:39,520
these adventures brought...

2126
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:41,790
the most successful outcomes.

2127
01:33:42,150 --> 01:33:43,320
I was even loved by many.

2128
01:33:44,690 --> 01:33:46,590
The show changed my life.

2129
01:33:46,690 --> 01:33:48,460
- A life-changing show.
- Yes, my life.

2130
01:33:50,030 --> 01:33:51,030
And...

2131
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,170
Either way, in the end...

2132
01:33:55,630 --> 01:33:58,800
Together, the members went on trips...

2133
01:33:59,340 --> 01:34:00,610
they wanted to take.

2134
01:34:01,270 --> 01:34:03,640
But we mainly focused on
what I wanted to do.

2135
01:34:04,440 --> 01:34:05,980
It must not have been easy.

2136
01:34:12,920 --> 01:34:13,920
What's wrong with me?

2137
01:34:23,530 --> 01:34:25,360
I know it wasn't easy, but...

2138
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:31,640
Gosh.

2139
01:34:31,740 --> 01:34:34,110
- Is that why...
- Why did you cry?

2140
01:34:37,940 --> 01:34:41,210
(Thinking of the brothers
who shared the tough journey...)

2141
01:34:42,050 --> 01:34:45,280
(made him emotional.)

2142
01:34:46,120 --> 01:34:49,890
(Crying from a sense of guilt)

2143
01:34:50,290 --> 01:34:51,790
I wonder how he felt.

2144
01:34:52,630 --> 01:34:55,230
Grateful? Feeling bad?

2145
01:35:03,540 --> 01:35:04,700
I felt bad.

2146
01:35:05,470 --> 01:35:07,910
Everyone has different tastes
and appetites.

2147
01:35:08,370 --> 01:35:09,810
But they followed me around,

2148
01:35:10,810 --> 01:35:12,950
ate food that didn't suit them,

2149
01:35:13,250 --> 01:35:14,710
and slept in uncomfortable places.

2150
01:35:16,350 --> 01:35:19,690
They even climbed the mountain with me
while praying.

2151
01:35:19,950 --> 01:35:22,090
I'm really grateful
that they went along with me.

2152
01:35:23,090 --> 01:35:25,020
Si Eon, Pani Bottle,

2153
01:35:25,020 --> 01:35:26,960
Dex, and Teo.

2154
01:35:27,630 --> 01:35:29,260
Do Yeon and Seung Hoon.

2155
01:35:29,830 --> 01:35:31,300
Also Simon Dominic.

2156
01:35:31,660 --> 01:35:33,600
Thank you very much.

2157
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:35,600
Great job.

2158
01:35:36,670 --> 01:35:39,940
I didn't think I'd see the sunrise today.
But here it comes.

2159
01:35:42,170 --> 01:35:43,740
- A new...
- It was amazing.

2160
01:35:43,810 --> 01:35:45,680
I hope your future...

2161
01:35:45,680 --> 01:35:47,810
is filled with such brightness.

2162
01:35:49,220 --> 01:35:50,450
Is it cringey?

2163
01:35:50,980 --> 01:35:52,080
(Scratching)

2164
01:35:53,490 --> 01:35:54,490
Anyway,

2165
01:35:55,250 --> 01:35:56,320
great work.

2166
01:35:56,320 --> 01:35:59,130
(An adventure that sparkled brightly
with everyone's hearts united)

2167
01:36:02,030 --> 01:36:03,100
I'll end it here.

2168
01:36:03,100 --> 01:36:06,630
(Adventure by Kian84, which shone
thanks to everyone, has ended.)

2169
01:36:09,140 --> 01:36:10,140
Si Eon...

2170
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:12,040
Oh, dear.

2171
01:36:12,570 --> 01:36:14,170
We can't both be crybabies.

2172
01:36:14,170 --> 01:36:16,640
Come on. Don't call me a crybaby.

2173
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:18,610
- I cried too.
- What?

2174
01:36:18,710 --> 01:36:19,710
I cried too.

2175
01:36:20,010 --> 01:36:21,450
- Why?
- I don't know.

2176
01:36:21,450 --> 01:36:22,650
(The brothers bicker until the end.)

2177
01:36:22,650 --> 01:36:24,220
I can blame it on my old age.

2178
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:26,690
Did you cry?

2179
01:36:27,120 --> 01:36:28,390
- No.
- Your eyes are red.

2180
01:36:29,590 --> 01:36:31,790
- Good job.
- Your eyes are red.

2181
01:36:32,390 --> 01:36:34,360
Goodness.

2182
01:36:34,830 --> 01:36:37,330
- If only Dex were here.
- I know, right?

2183
01:36:37,900 --> 01:36:40,700
Since it was our last adventure,
we missed Dex.

2184
01:36:41,530 --> 01:36:44,200
(Before the worn-out brothers,)

2185
01:36:44,670 --> 01:36:48,710
(Dex appeared like a ray of light.)

2186
01:36:49,310 --> 01:36:52,080
(The youngest
who is the prettiest in the world)

2187
01:36:52,440 --> 01:36:56,180
(The youngest's cuteness
made the brothers melt.)

2188
01:36:56,520 --> 01:36:57,650
Dex...

2189
01:36:57,920 --> 01:36:59,850
is a great younger brother and friend.

2190
01:37:00,190 --> 01:37:01,590
In Adventure by Accident,

2191
01:37:01,590 --> 01:37:03,320
Dex was one of the indispensable pillars.

2192
01:37:03,560 --> 01:37:05,660
I'm grateful he was with us.

2193
01:37:05,960 --> 01:37:09,760
I kept remembering Dex.

2194
01:37:10,830 --> 01:37:13,530
Traveling with the others
made it much better.

2195
01:37:14,030 --> 01:37:16,140
(My brothers are the best.)

2196
01:37:16,470 --> 01:37:18,270
When it started, I was alone.

2197
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:21,370
But I got to know Si Eon and Pani Bottle,

2198
01:37:21,670 --> 01:37:22,710
as well as Dex.

2199
01:37:23,110 --> 01:37:25,410
(An adventure of all four)

2200
01:37:25,410 --> 01:37:28,480
Traveling alone would've been very lonely.

2201
01:37:28,950 --> 01:37:30,820
Being together gave me strength.

2202
01:37:31,450 --> 01:37:33,290
Since it was the last adventure,

2203
01:37:33,290 --> 01:37:35,690
I became emotional and teared up.

2204
01:37:35,690 --> 01:37:37,760
But the girl in the studio
bawling her eyes out...

2205
01:37:39,090 --> 01:37:40,630
- wouldn't look good.
- It's...

2206
01:37:40,930 --> 01:37:44,030
I held back, but there were many moments
when I teared up.

2207
01:37:44,030 --> 01:37:45,260
(She was touched.)

2208
01:37:45,630 --> 01:37:47,870
It made me want to go on an adventure...

2209
01:37:47,870 --> 01:37:49,870
- like Kian84 someday.
- Like a challenge?

2210
01:37:50,870 --> 01:37:53,710
Some people aren't able to go on trips
for their own reasons.

2211
01:37:54,140 --> 01:37:57,640
We went on adventures
to experience things...

2212
01:37:58,240 --> 01:37:59,380
on their behalf.

2213
01:37:59,510 --> 01:38:01,550
Thank you for enjoying the show...

2214
01:38:02,110 --> 01:38:04,680
- until the end.
- Thank you.

2215
01:38:07,190 --> 01:38:08,620
Our adventure may have ended here,

2216
01:38:09,050 --> 01:38:11,120
but there's more in the future.

2217
01:38:11,620 --> 01:38:12,690
An adventure called life.

2218
01:38:13,160 --> 01:38:16,560
I hope many fun and good things happen.

2219
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:18,660
(I hope many fun and good things happen.)

2220
01:38:19,270 --> 01:38:22,470
(Adventure by Accident...)

2221
01:38:22,470 --> 01:38:26,610
(by the Four Brothers)

2222
01:38:30,640 --> 01:38:35,180
(The end of Adventure by Accident 4's
last adventure)

2223
01:38:38,250 --> 01:38:42,550
(Thank you to everyone
who has traveled with us.)

2224
01:38:43,160 --> 01:38:44,390
(Kian84)

2225
01:38:44,390 --> 01:38:45,790
(Pani Bottle)

2226
01:38:45,790 --> 01:38:46,830
(Lee Si Eon)

2227
01:38:46,830 --> 01:38:48,260
(Dex)

2228
01:38:48,260 --> 01:38:49,260
(Lee Seung Hoon)

2229
01:38:49,260 --> 01:38:50,700
(Jang Do Yeon)
