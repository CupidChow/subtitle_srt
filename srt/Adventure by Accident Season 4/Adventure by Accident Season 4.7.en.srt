1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:01,740
Wait a minute.

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:06,080
Another suspicious smell
is stimulating my nose today.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,180
Last time, Kian84 brought us pizza.

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,920
- Yes.
- He also gave us transportation cards.

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,650
- Pani Bottle treated everyone to a meal.
- He did.

6
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:16,420
Today,
Seung Hoon bought coffee for everyone.

7
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:17,820
(And Seung Hoon's coffee)

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,220
Only I hadn't brought anything.

9
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,230
Today, I brought some food for us.

10
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:24,630
That looks amazing.

11
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,060
This tteokbokki brand is very famous.

12
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,100
The beef brisket looks delicious.

13
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,070
- It's the dipping sauce.
- Right.

14
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,570
With cheese...

15
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,070
(Eating)

16
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,910
It's really soft and chewy.

17
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,110
- Is it delicious?
- I love the smell of the cheese.

18
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,480
The combination is fantastic.

19
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,510
The beef brisket is extremely juicy.

20
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:45,250
It'll be more enjoyable to watch
with some delicious food.

21
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,020
Shall we take a look at your trip?

22
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,020
Okay.

23
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:53,590
(As they spend time with alpacas,)

24
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:54,630
Shall we go eat now?

25
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:55,660
- Let's eat.
- Let's go.

26
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:56,660
(soon, the sky gets dark.)

27
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,360
Let's go this way.

28
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,870
(They head to the Old Town of Lijiang
for dinner.)

29
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,900
- Pani Bottle, this place is...
- Yes?

30
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:06,000
the Nakhi people's city.

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,240
(Nakhi people, a minority group)

32
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,570
The type of architecture
belongs to the Nakhi people.

33
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,310
Is this their style of architecture?

34
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,050
Yes, that's what I heard.

35
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,250
- Do you know what this is?
- Isn't it Nikhi language?

36
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,320
- It's the Nikhi people's...
- I mean, the Nakhi people..

37
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,850
It looks similar to Egyptian hieroglyphs.

38
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,020
- This is also Nakhi language.
- That's it.

39
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:24,590
Is that a cat?

40
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:26,120
It's their traditional hieroglyphs.

41
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,030
They also represent Nakhi culture.

42
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,090
Their hieroglyphs look very cute.

43
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:33,100
This is where we walked around
with our luggage.

44
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,970
Yes, but it looks different at night.

45
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,800
What's this?

46
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,940
(Exclaiming in awe)

47
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:44,010
(A breathtaking night view
that leaves you in awe)

48
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:45,080
Look at the night view.

49
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,340
That's incredible.

50
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,150
It looks even more beautiful
than during the day.

51
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,480
The atmosphere is different at night.

52
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,780
(Roof tiles embodying
the traditional charm)

53
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,350
This style is extraordinary.

54
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,120
This style of architecture...

55
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,520
It seems more beautiful at night.

56
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,390
(It transformed into a spectacular view
at night with the lighting.)

57
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,990
It's dazzling.

58
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:04,930
(A series of captivating moments)

59
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,130
How is this possible?

60
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,970
The water that's flowing is glacier water.

61
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,400
It's glacier water?

62
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,570
From the icecap?

63
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,110
Yes, water from the icecap.

64
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,510
It's romantic.

65
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,410
Look at this hat.

66
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,250
- It's ten yuan.
- You mean that cowboy hat?

67
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,250
Isn't that two dollars?

68
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,590
It suddenly feels like we're in Texas.

69
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,290
It goes well with his jean jacket.

70
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,990
- Do you know why I bought this hat?
- Why?

71
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,860
In case you miss Teo.

72
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,730
The guy from Texas.

73
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,700
Kian84, look at me from the back.

74
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,760
You look similar to Teo from the back.

75
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,800
- Teo.
- They dressed exactly the same.

76
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,470
His back looks similar to Teo's.

77
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,270
I miss Yoo Teo.

78
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,610
- He came with us.
- Teo.

79
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:51,910
Seeing that makes me miss Teo.
I wonder if he's doing well.

80
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,480
He's shooting a movie in Canada right now.

81
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,310
- Really?
- In Canada?

82
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,950
Also, the movie seems quite big.

83
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,480
Right, he's in a lot of big ones.

84
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,790
I'm afraid that
I won't get to see him anymore.

85
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:03,560
Next time you see him,

86
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,620
you should say,
"Do you remember me? I sang 'Dandelion.'"

87
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,260
"Hello, Dandelion."

88
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,330
"Teo, we even sang together."

89
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,970
It's making me feel confident.

90
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:14,970
(He gets excited at the thought of Teo.)

91
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,670
It goes well with your jean jacket.

92
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,700
I've never seen him so full of energy.

93
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,740
Teo was never this frivolous.

94
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,840
Call him whenever you miss Teo.

95
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,550
- I'll summon him.
- Okay.

96
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,780
Is this the right way?

97
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,150
- It's over here.
- They should eat already.

98
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,920
- We're a group of three.
- I also found this restaurant.

99
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:38,990
(They enter the restaurant
picked by the eldest.)

100
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,490
Have you seen my camera?

101
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:45,330
No way.

102
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:46,500
(Did he lose his camera?)

103
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,140
What?

104
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,570
What's with the camera angle?

105
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,270
Whose show is this?

106
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,340
Could this be...

107
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,410
Have you seen my camera?

108
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:03,150
- Si Eon.
- From the last store we were at...

109
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:05,180
(Here you go.)

110
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,220
(While looking at hats)

111
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,620
(Leaving)

112
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,090
Did he leave that there? My goodness.

113
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,060
I almost gave them the camera
after buying a hat.

114
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:14,990
Thank you.

115
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:17,730
- That's nice of her.
- I'm so grateful.

116
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,460
- She's very kind.
- What a relief.

117
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,930
I never told you, but I picked it up
after you about three times.

118
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,500
Don't lose it, Si Eon.

119
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,840
(Thanks to the lady, he's back on camera.)

120
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,740
How should we order? We need to translate.

121
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,710
Thank you.

122
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,180
Thank you.

123
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,550
"Thank you?"

124
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,750
Isn't that the right word?

125
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,750
"Thank you?"

126
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:39,480
(The server comes to respond
to his thank you.)

127
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,090
Can we get a mix of ribs and jokbal?

128
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,420
With any vegetables... Is there a set?

129
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,690
One medium vegetable set.

130
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,320
I'll bring some alcohol.

131
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,660
- I want to take a look.
- Alcohol?

132
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,660
I like looking at different liquors.

133
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,700
(Their order arrives.)

134
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,000
(Gasping)

135
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,270
This looks delicious.

136
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,840
These are really ribs.

137
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,640
- What's that?
- A hot pot with ribs?

138
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,010
It's like a greasy hot pot with ribs
from Yunnan.

139
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,210
A hot pot with ribs?

140
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,840
I've never seen anything like this.

141
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:10,010
(Unlike Chengdu mala hot pot
from yesterday)

142
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,550
(A hot pot with dried ribs
is made with a milky broth.)

143
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,550
It looks delicious.

144
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:16,550
As it's made with dried ribs,
the broth had a milky color.

145
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,590
- Half of it is meat.
- I know.

146
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,160
I read that
this is a very popular restaurant.

147
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,000
It's something you must try at that place.

148
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,170
(Once the hot pot broth boils...)

149
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:29,600
I see. Soup.

150
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,400
This is different from hot pots.
You don't eat the broth from a hot pot.

151
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,210
- You eat the broth in this dish.
- Soup. Thank you.

152
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,510
You eat the broth.

153
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,880
It looks like a type of stew.

154
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,880
(Taking a sip carefully)

155
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:43,480
- It tastes just like seolleongtang.
- It must be savory.

156
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,250
It tastes like an ox bone broth
with medicinal herbs.

157
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,150
It would definitely suit my taste.

158
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,860
(He takes a bite of a thick piece of rib.)

159
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,190
(Exclaiming)

160
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:59,700
There's more meat on the bones
than Korean ribs.

161
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,770
- All the food they try is good.
- I know.

162
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,700
(Devouring)

163
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,440
(Amazed)

164
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,040
It feels good to eat rice
after a long time.

165
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,140
- He's eating well.
- He's started.

166
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,880
It's been a long time.

167
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,420
- He always ate so well like this.
- Glutton Bottle.

168
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,750
(Kian84 dips it in the sauce.)

169
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:21,920
(Eating)

170
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,790
(This is good.)

171
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,360
I'll make a wrap with this.

172
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,990
Like ssambap.

173
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,430
You can make a wrap with it?

174
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,830
I see. A hot pot wrap.

175
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,330
Gosh, he's eating well.

176
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,940
- Gosh, he's eating neatly.
- That looks...

177
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:41,840
(Spitting it out)

178
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,480
- What? Is it not good?
- What?

179
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,650
- He spat it out on his wrap.
- It was to put the meat on top.

180
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:50,150
Then you can enjoy it twice.

181
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,650
(He's a genius.)

182
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:52,720
You can enjoy one piece of meat twice.

183
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,350
(As expected,
he has a different way of eating.)

184
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,060
Gosh, Kian84 is eating well.

185
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,960
(Spitting out again)

186
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,800
He looked like an alpaca.

187
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,300
(Spitting out the meat
like a spitting alpaca)

188
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,270
- This is...
- Didn't I find a good restaurant?

189
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:09,930
You found a good restaurant this time.

190
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,470
It makes me proud
to see them enjoy the food.

191
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:15,540
It has no mala flavor at all.
It tastes slightly different...

192
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,840
from what Koreans are used to,
so it's pleasant to eat.

193
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,650
Does anyone have a power bank?

194
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,780
I have it. I'll give it to you.

195
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,320
I need to send a message to my wife,
but I'm out of battery.

196
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,620
Si Eon used his phone all day long
to do some research.

197
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:29,890
Mine is an iPhone.

198
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,720
It can charge any type of phone.

199
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,230
It charges very fast.

200
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,830
(Connected)

201
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:40,460
It's very convenient
because it's light and small.

202
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:43,770
You can see the percentage
when you press the button.

203
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,570
- It's 100 percent.
- The remaining amount.

204
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,510
Does the green light mean
that it's charging?

205
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,010
We have to go all the way there tomorrow.

206
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,810
To meet the Nakhi people.

207
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,180
(Since they found out about
a minority group called the Nakhi people,)

208
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:02,050
(they searched for them.)

209
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,620
(The lodging owner is Nakhi.)

210
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,190
(He asks the owner.)

211
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:11,960
(Is there a village
where many Nakhi people live?)

212
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,800
(Yes, there is.)

213
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,570
(Could you tell me how to get there?)

214
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,600
(He finally got information
on where Nakhi people live.)

215
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,240
We'll be able to find Nakhi people.

216
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,110
- What time do we need to get up tomorrow?
- At 7 a.m.

217
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:27,380
It was our first time going there,
so we had to set out early.

218
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,280
The food is amazing here.

219
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,680
- I'm so happy to hear that.
- The quality is good.

220
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,190
I'm so glad to hear
that you like the food.

221
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:36,850
Let's go after this.

222
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,690
(Thanks to the eldest,
they had an excellent dinner.)

223
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:39,760
We'll get to sleep a lot tonight.

224
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:44,900
(They spend their night in Lijiang
while looking forward to tomorrow.)

225
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,330
(The morning of their 9th day, Lijiang)

226
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:49,370
It's their ninth day already.

227
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:52,470
The minority group lover's wish
is finally coming true.

228
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,840
Let's go.

229
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,170
Let's go.

230
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,440
Gosh, it's windy.

231
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:00,780
It's cold.

232
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:01,850
(A lot of luggage)

233
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,710
Hey, Pani Bottle.

234
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,920
Hurry and tell everyone
that those are all your bags.

235
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,590
- Hurry and tell them.
- By the way,

236
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:11,190
he has the same hairstyle
as a donkey's on the Tea Horse Road.

237
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,290
He's carrying his master's luggage.

238
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,790
(Mule Bottle carrying
his master's luggage?)

239
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,490
I had a lot of luggage with me
because I traveled for a long time.

240
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:17,660
(Actually, the luggage belongs to him.)

241
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:20,330
(They head out with their bags.)

242
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,300
- It's here.
- Goodness.

243
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,730
- It looks nice.
- It's a tank.

244
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,670
(The eldest’s bucket list for this trip)

245
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:31,310
(Going on a road trip)

246
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,110
Unless you pass the driver's test
in the country...

247
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,810
And if you don't speak Chinese,

248
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:38,350
it's impossible to get
the local driver's license.

249
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,550
So I had given up. No one knew,

250
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,390
including me and the staff.

251
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:45,020
Then Pani Bottle got
his driver's license in China.

252
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,590
Without telling the staff?

253
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,630
That's really moving, Pani Bottle.

254
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,660
You're the best.

255
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:53,330
My friend who speaks Chinese helped me.

256
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,670
That's amazing. I'm so happy.

257
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,070
Pani Bottle, thank you so much.

258
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,200
Let's rent a car in China.

259
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,370
(A step closer to his bucket list,
thanks to all-around Pani Bottle)

260
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:02,840
This is amazing.

261
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,340
I'd like to rent a big car.

262
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,140
My goodness.

263
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,150
I do everything I want to do on YouTube.

264
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,980
It was fun
listening to what others wanted to do.

265
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,190
He's the wish fairy.

266
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:17,460
What do you think of the orange vehicle?
It looks stylish.

267
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,760
- It's clean.
- It looks nice.

268
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,060
(With his heart fluttering, he pats it.)

269
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,300
An item on my bucket list
is about to come true.

270
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,330
Pani Bottle,
this was really on my bucket list.

271
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,440
- That's great.
- Thank you so much.

272
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,940
It made Si Eon very happy.

273
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,970
(Feeling proud)

274
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:35,710
- Let's go.
- Thank you.

275
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:36,740
(They set out full of excitement.)

276
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,780
- Please drive carefully.
- Be careful.

277
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,380
When I turn on the blinker,
they advance suddenly to block me.

278
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,580
- Really?
- Yes.

279
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,990
It's like they're saying,
"How dare you come in?"

280
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,690
(The road in Lijiang is quite rough.)

281
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:50,820
That would drive me insane.

282
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:54,560
- What's wrong with his hair?
- Where did that beggar come from?

283
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,260
- Does he have a QR code? Look.
- It looks like he's about to beg.

284
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:58,700
A beautiful beggar in Lijiang.

285
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,600
(Beautiful Beggar Si Eon)

286
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,170
Guys, how about some sponge cake
that we bought yesterday?

287
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:05,200
That sounds good.

288
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,540
(There are even people on the busy road.)

289
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,210
Their driving is...

290
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:12,940
- Their driving is intense.
- Here you go, Kian84.

291
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,310
(This won't work.)

292
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,150
(With the cake in his mouth)

293
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:20,990
- I'm falling for him.
- Why are they playing it in slow motion?

294
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,750
Seriously.

295
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,260
Gosh. Reversing.

296
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,960
(He shows some sexy reversing.)

297
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,360
- Goodness.
- That's sexy.

298
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,430
What's this?

299
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,690
- He looks like a New Yorker.
- Charismatic Pani.

300
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,900
Once we get out of the city carefully,

301
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,070
the road will get less busy.

302
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,670
The city is quite big. That's not the end.

303
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,400
(They get out of the heart of the city,
thanks to Charismatic Bottle.)

304
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,510
(Entering the open road outside the city)

305
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,640
They drove for a while.

306
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,710
(Entering the open road outside the city)

307
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:48,050
- What's the altitude?
- It's 3,300m.

308
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:49,510
(The current altitude is 3,300m.)

309
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:51,750
- It's increasing.
- Is it 3,700m?

310
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,850
At 3,700m... Look at that.

311
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:54,850
(They see a herd of yaks around them.)

312
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,420
- They're water buffaloes.
- They're yaks.

313
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,390
(Yaks that they saw in the Himalayas...)

314
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,430
Yaks are hairier than water buffaloes.

315
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:05,860
(When they reach 3,000m in altitude,
they come into sight again.)

316
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,330
(After passing by a herd of yaks)

317
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,300
- The road is endless.
- They're driving endlessly.

318
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,170
No way. The scenery changed.

319
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,210
(Endlessly...)

320
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:16,340
- High toward the sky.
- Goodness.

321
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:20,310
Look at the road on the GPS.

322
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:22,510
It's curvy like intestines.

323
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,620
What's wrong with the road?

324
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:26,920
It couldn't be helped
because we were on a mountain.

325
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,090
Right. Otherwise, you can't go up.

326
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,420
The mountain looks so beautiful.

327
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,160
(The view in front of them is art itself.)

328
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,360
- Gosh, what's that?
- Goodness.

329
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,060
- Look at the waterfall.
- Where?

330
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:42,500
- It's over there.
- You're right.

331
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,600
(A waterfall on a cliff)

332
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,000
The water disappears while falling.

333
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,540
It's incredible. Look at that.

334
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:50,240
It's like...

335
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,250
There are clashes in such places
in "Romance of the Three Kingdoms."

336
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,580
- Right, after waiting in ambush.
- People attack.

337
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,880
Isn't this where the Shu kingdom was?

338
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,280
- Shu.
- Right.

339
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,490
Where Liu Bei, Guan Yu,
and Zhang Fei lived.

340
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,520
My goodness.

341
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,090
(They're startled by something else.)

342
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:07,120
This place looks insane.

343
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,060
- Shall we stop and look?
- Yes.

344
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,160
Let's take a photo.

345
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,000
(The view that stopped the Three Brothers)

346
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,040
This is exactly
what was on my bucket list.

347
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,340
Stopping at places on the road.

348
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:22,010
Stand together in the middle.

349
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:23,470
Let's stand here.

350
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,540
(Such a moment calls for taking photos.)

351
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,710
We always traveled on big buses.

352
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:31,580
We can stop and go whenever we want.

353
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,120
This is the best part of a road trip.

354
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,620
We can stop at places we want.

355
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,490
That's what I always dreamed of.

356
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,260
It felt...

357
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,290
freer to me. That's what I liked about it.

358
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,360
Let's go. This is fun.

359
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,600
(They continue their way
to the Nakhi village.)

360
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:51,440
(Humming)

361
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,770
(Humming)

362
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,970
Do you know this song...

363
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,780
- from Uncharted Waters II?
- It's an old game.

364
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,640
"Uncharted Waters Online?"
I know that game.

365
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,980
This song is very suitable for our trip.

366
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:07,420
(Listening to a song that evokes nostalgia
for those born in the 1980s,)

367
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,850
(the Three Brothers sail
in search for the Nakhi village.)

368
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,560
Look at the water. It's jade.

369
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,960
It reminded me of our motorcycle trip
in South America.

370
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,000
I can see that.

371
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,200
(Setting out to pursue Si Eon's dream)

372
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:24,270
(Their bike tour in South America)

373
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,000
(To pursue Kian84's dream,)

374
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,070
Look at the mountains.

375
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,980
(they get deeper into the mountains
to find Nakhi people.)

376
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,340
There must be many rockfalls.

377
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:36,710
- There are nets everywhere.
- It looks dangerous.

378
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:37,920
Goodness.

379
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,250
All the fences are damaged
because of rockfalls.

380
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:43,590
- Because of the rocks.
- That must be scary.

381
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:44,720
- You should pass by quickly.
- Let's be careful.

382
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,960
We have to leave it up to fate.

383
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,160
If we get by a rock,
it's just meant to be.

384
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,660
Right, it's all about luck.

385
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:53,330
Rocks could possibly fall here.

386
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,600
The road is quite dangerous.

387
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:57,430
Even the mirror is shattered.

388
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:00,070
- The road was very spectacular.
- Was it hit by a rock?

389
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,770
- There was never a boring moment.
- Right.

390
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:04,210
(It's not easy to get there by car.)

391
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:05,240
There's someone.

392
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,780
- Is she carrying something?
- Are they going on foot?

393
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,850
Are they going on foot?

394
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,980
(The locals and cows
seem to be used to walking here.)

395
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,590
In documentaries
about the Tea Horse Road in the past,

396
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,250
people were walking on this kind of road.

397
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,720
The road in the mountain
was about 2m wide.

398
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,760
Now, they have built a road.

399
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,860
(A new road was constructed
on the footprints of thousands of years.)

400
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:27,000
Are they walking all the way?

401
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,470
Lijiang is there too.

402
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:31,570
Lijiang is like a rest stop
where tea from all over China...

403
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:34,470
is brought before it goes up farther.

404
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,510
That's why the city expanded, I guess.

405
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,540
Then how many days
does it take to get there?

406
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,810
- It might take several months.
- It would take several months.

407
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:42,310
They really need to walk
for several months.

408
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,050
Gosh, I can't believe they walk here.

409
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:45,220
They're risking their lives.

410
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,680
They really have to risk their lives.

411
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:50,050
I'm so curious about how they live.

412
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,090
Exactly.

413
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,260
It doesn't look like people can live here.

414
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,290
A minority group in the mountains in Asia.

415
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:57,260
It looked like no one lived there.

416
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,000
What's that? There they are.

417
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:01,030
- Where are they?
- Over there, on the right.

418
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,300
What's that?

419
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:03,630
What are they seeing?

420
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,170
(Opening the window)

421
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,070
Gosh, that's amazing.

422
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,640
- Goodness.
- What's that?

423
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:10,210
Are people living there?

424
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:11,680
It's so deep in the mountains.

425
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,480
No car can go in there.

426
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,580
It's so hidden in the valley.

427
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,110
- It's a new world.
- It's a new world.

428
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,220
That's amazing.

429
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,550
It's quite big.

430
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,690
Shall I pull over there?

431
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,490
It's really amazing here.

432
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:27,490
(They arrive at the village
after a long drive.)

433
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:28,590
Gosh.

434
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,260
(Speechless to see
an awe-inspiring spectacle)

435
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,830
It's another new world.

436
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,600
I never expected
something like this to appear,

437
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,140
- but it's before my eyes.
- Gosh.

438
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,600
- Seriously.
- It's huge.

439
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,840
It really is.

440
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,870
(Nakhi village)

441
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,040
It's the Nakhi people's village.

442
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,780
It looks very unique.

443
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:50,610
(Nakhi people
live around Lijiang and its vicinity.)

444
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,850
(Built on the mountain slopes)

445
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,250
It's a sight I've never seen before.

446
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,350
- It looks like a terraced area.
- Right.

447
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,350
(Houses are built in a unique way.)

448
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,490
(People farm on the fields
across the village.)

449
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,590
- It looks very peculiar.
- Exactly.

450
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,160
It sort of feels animated.

451
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,360
They use such a narrow road.

452
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:10,570
(Keeping a traditional way of life,
moving by donkeys and mules)

453
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,870
(Stepping into
the Nakhi traditional village)

454
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,310
I actually see no people.

455
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:21,480
- No.
- Isn't that our lodging?

456
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,850
Everyone might be out for work.

457
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,920
They hung their laundry here.

458
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,350
(Signs of everyday life here and there)

459
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,620
It looks like a really old village.

460
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:33,860
The alleys are narrow.

461
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,330
The letters have colors, too.

462
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,330
It's their traditional characters, right?

463
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:39,730
- What?
- I saw that in Lijiang.

464
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,630
- The characters look very cute.
- They're cute.

465
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:43,930
Isn't this our hotel?

466
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,400
(They find a place
that looks like their lodging.)

467
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,040
This looks like a hotel.

468
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,370
Is this a hotel?

469
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:50,870
(Going inside)

470
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,240
Shall I ask?

471
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,810
Is this a lodging?

472
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,780
Right. This is a tea house.

473
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,450
- A tea house. I see.
- What is a tea house?

474
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:01,720
A tea house means a lodging.

475
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,420
It's a lodging, like a guest house.

476
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,960
- A guest house. I see.
- People stop here on their way.

477
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,520
- Shall we stay here?
- Okay.

478
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,730
(Going to see the rooms)

479
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:11,130
There were only a few lodgings.

480
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,930
There were about 2 or 3 lodgings
in the village.

481
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:13,930
I figured.

482
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,270
This is very nice.

483
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,470
It has a nice view.

484
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:19,940
(A room on the 3rd floor with a nice view)

485
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,370
(Inside the room)

486
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,110
- Three beds.
- It looks cozy.

487
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,210
The room is simple.

488
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:26,210
(The room has 3 large beds.)

489
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:27,780
- It's very nice.
- Above the toilet,

490
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,080
- there's a shower.
- Where?

491
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,420
- I guess it's this.
- At the same time.

492
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,520
How do you use it?
Pooping at the same time?

493
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,720
You can take a shower
while going to the bathroom.

494
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,260
And if you move your feet,
you can do the laundry too.

495
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,390
(Getting three things done at once)

496
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:41,460
You can do three things.

497
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,660
- Like this?
- Yes.

498
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:46,400
(Doing the laundry)

499
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,470
- The water from the shower flows there.
- Right.

500
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:51,640
It's a toilet and a drain.

501
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,640
It's connected?

502
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,010
Well, this is...

503
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,940
- It's a new experience.
- not bad.

504
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,080
(While Eon and Pani are looking around)

505
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,680
The room is nice.

506
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:03,010
How long has it been
since this lodging was built?

507
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:07,420
(Kian84 explores
the Nakhi village in earnest.)

508
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,050
It's been 10 to 20 years.

509
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,760
Do residents here live off the land?

510
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,690
Yes. That's right.

511
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:16,690
Almost?

512
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:17,900
- "Almost."
- "Almost."

513
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,300
- It sounds like that.
- It was almost right.

514
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:24,230
Where should I go
to meet the Nakhi people?

515
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:27,970
He's crazy about the Nakhi people.
He's Nakhi84.

516
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:30,470
He talks about the Nakhi people
all day long.

517
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,910
- He's so into them.
- He only thinks about the Nakhi people.

518
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,610
If you want to meet the Nakhi people,

519
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:36,950
you can go farther into the village.

520
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,580
I guess that's where people have lived
since old times.

521
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,620
Shall we ask her how much it costs?

522
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:43,950
How much is the lodging?

523
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,120
It's 100 yuan.

524
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,130
- How much is 100 yuan?
- It's 20 dollars.

525
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:49,590
- It's cheap.
- Is it 20 dollars per person?

526
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:50,930
- No, just 20 dollars in total.
- Just 20 dollars?

527
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,430
- Really?
- The room was so cheap.

528
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,460
- That's great.
- It's nice, so let's stay here.

529
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,230
- There are not many lodgings anyway.
- Let's stay here.

530
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,270
- I like it here.
- Yes, here.

531
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:58,470
Good.

532
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,840
(We'll stay in this room.)

533
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,110
What's that?

534
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,380
Something is coming down.

535
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,680
What's that?

536
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,280
- It's a luggage delivery service.
- The luggage.

537
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,210
Surprisingly, it's not manual.

538
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:15,320
It's like getting fried chicken
delivered to a college dormitory.

539
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,850
Yes, in high school too,

540
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,190
because we couldn't climb over the fence.

541
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,260
(They can lift the luggage conveniently.)

542
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,630
Thank you.

543
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:25,660
(Checking in at 4:38 p.m.)

544
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,830
(Sprawling out)

545
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:30,430
You can only travel
when you're physically strong.

546
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,070
They were in the car for many hours.

547
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,370
I want to go...

548
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:36,110
- to a supermarket.
- Let's go together.

549
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:39,240
I want to get some water and drinks.

550
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,310
I asked the owner,

551
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:45,720
and she said
the villagers are out to farm.

552
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,150
- I see.
- So,

553
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:49,220
they'll come back in the evening.

554
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,450
That's why there's no one around.

555
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:51,960
So, when the evening comes,

556
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,660
I'll see what the Nakhi people are like.

557
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,190
He's talking in his sleep.

558
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,200
I'm going to ask that.

559
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,600
(Leaving dreamy Nakhi84 in the room)

560
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,660
- I'll do that.
- "Nakhi84."

561
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,530
See you later, Kian84.

562
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,740
(Eon and Pani set off
to do grocery shopping.)

563
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,870
It's time for personal maintenance.

564
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:10,040
- Jianpasi has passed out.
- Can we leave the key?

565
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,110
Yes.

566
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:14,040
(A supermarket near their lodging)

567
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,510
- It's quite nice.
- There wasn't a convenience store.

568
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,150
It was the largest supermarket around.

569
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,450
What do they have?

570
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:20,620
(Looking for something for a light meal)

571
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:23,320
Look at this. It's a fake Buldak ramyeon.

572
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,590
Right?

573
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:27,160
Has it even arrived there?

574
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,860
It's a collaboration with a game.

575
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,730
(While Eon and Pani are grocery shopping)

576
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:34,460
I should go.

577
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,640
(Waking up suddenly)

578
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,010
(Picking up his camera
without saying anything)

579
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:47,080
(Rummaging)

580
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:51,180
(Going outside with clothes)

581
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,250
The laundry...

582
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:57,920
Since I started this trip,

583
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,790
it's been about ten days, I guess.

584
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,560
I need to do some laundry.

585
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,330
(He asks the owner
if there's a wash place nearby.)

586
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:09,930
There's a wash place.

587
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:13,070
(Using a translation tool)

588
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:17,110
About two volumes of books go up there,

589
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:19,180
and after going down
from left and right...

590
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,010
- How can he get there with that?
- He can't.

591
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:22,680
- The translation is wrong.
- He's in big trouble.

592
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,750
I can find it
if I go straight all the way.

593
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,120
(Nodding)

594
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,820
Actually,
I didn't understand what she said.

595
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,990
The translation was wrong,
but she told me to go.

596
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:34,620
It's not polite to ask
the same thing over and over.

597
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,160
I'll just go.

598
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:40,000
But I saw a stream,

599
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,830
so I thought I would see it
following the stream.

600
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,130
- You're smart.
- Yes.

601
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,340
I have no idea how far I should go.

602
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,470
I don't see anything.

603
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,410
During other trips,

604
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:51,370
I was wearing T-shirts and shorts.

605
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:54,410
So when I went swimming,
I naturally washed the clothes.

606
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,980
- Is he doing the laundry?
- The laundry...

607
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,650
Back then,
I didn't need to do the laundry often.

608
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:00,320
My clothes didn't smell much
when I wore them.

609
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,820
This time,
I'm in long sleeves and long pants.

610
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,690
So without doing the laundry,

611
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,490
it is tough.

612
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,660
What is he saying?

613
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,130
(He sees another resident.)

614
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:14,200
Is there a wash place around here?

615
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,370
(Well...)

616
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:21,770
- What does that mean?
- What's that?

617
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:25,910
(We met again today)

618
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:27,540
He's singing.

619
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,850
He suddenly sang a song.

620
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:32,250
(The old man starts to sing right away.)

621
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:34,990
I got it.

622
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,590
It seems that he's had a drink.

623
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:39,720
(Smirking)

624
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,730
I asked him if there was a wash place,

625
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:44,390
- and he sang.
- It's a welcome song.

626
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:47,000
Excuse me, sir.

627
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,830
(Arriving at a place after asking around)

628
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,240
Is that a wash place?

629
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,010
- Is it a wash place?
- It doesn't look like one.

630
00:23:58,010 --> 00:23:59,440
The water is flowing, so... No?

631
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,950
(Taking off his clothes)

632
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,850
(Changing into a laundry suit)

633
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,050
(Pouring)

634
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,220
(Putting the outerwear in the water first)

635
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:16,030
(However, the color of the water is...)

636
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,860
(The Mother's wash place he went to
2 years ago comes to mind.)

637
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,460
- It's Varanasi.
- It looks the same.

638
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,260
After traveling in India,
I like that color.

639
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,630
- Is that your personal color?
- That's his personal color.

640
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,300
- It's his personal color.
- It's his personal color.

641
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,210
(Dyeing the clothes in his personal color)

642
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,240
(Beating)

643
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,040
(Beating)

644
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,750
He learned how to do it back then.

645
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:37,910
My body remembers it.

646
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,320
(Starting to beat)

647
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,350
As expected.

648
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:44,860
He's good.

649
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:45,860
(On fire)

650
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:49,030
(Beating in the original Ganges style)

651
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,460
(Startled)

652
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:51,930
She's startled.

653
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:53,300
(Even a local is surprised.)

654
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,730
(Doing it quickly as he's experienced)

655
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,570
(Done with the top in an instant)

656
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:05,440
- I'm doing the laundry.
- What is she saying?

657
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:11,250
(Speaking a foreign language)

658
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,880
(He reaches for his translator.)

659
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:18,150
(It's dangerous
because the current is fast.)

660
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,290
Should I go somewhere else?

661
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:23,030
That wasn't the wash place.

662
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,830
Since the current is fast.

663
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:26,960
(The local tells him
where a nearby wash place is.)

664
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,570
- She's so kind.
- She's kind.

665
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:31,170
You could've been in danger.
That was so kind of her.

666
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:34,670
Where are you from?

667
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:37,010
I'm supposed to do it here.

668
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:38,810
(Miscommunication)

669
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:42,450
(She continues speaking to him
in an unfamiliar language.)

670
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:45,850
My hands are full,
and I can't hold up my translator.

671
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,850
(He turns the camera off.)

672
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:50,390
Still, turning the camera off
doesn't seem like a good solution.

673
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:52,460
The conversation is more important to him.

674
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:55,030
Are you friends?

675
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,730
We're sisters.

676
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:59,000
- You're sisters?
- There were two of them?

677
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Oh, sisters.

678
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,330
- Were they going to do the laundry?
- I see.

679
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:03,330
- Yes.
- Laundry friends.

680
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:07,840
(Meanwhile, Eon and Pani return
after grocery shopping.)

681
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,170
Where did Kian84 go?

682
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:12,110
He said he'd take a look around.

683
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,280
Jianpasi.

684
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,550
- Should I give him a call?
- Yes.

685
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,520
(Worried about his younger brother)

686
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:23,190
- Hello.
- Kian84.

687
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,920
- Yes?
- Where are you?

688
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,160
I'm doing the laundry.

689
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,160
Did you go to do the laundry?

690
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,100
Yes, I'll do the laundry and go back.

691
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,860
- Okay.
- Bye.

692
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:36,430
He went to do the laundry.

693
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:37,800
Is there a place to do the laundry?

694
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,270
I think he's doing it at a stream.

695
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,300
I wonder if there's a wash place.

696
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:43,540
Is only your audio on?

697
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,640
We don't have any footage?

698
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,010
We have to listen to it
and imagine what it looks like.

699
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,280
It's okay. You can do it there.

700
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,950
I'll do it here.
You can have the better spot.

701
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,050
I had to do the laundry...

702
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:54,520
while using the translator
to talk to them.

703
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,520
You didn't have enough hands.

704
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,450
I had to shake out the clothes
while using the translator.

705
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,290
- It's a pity we don't have footage.
- I know.

706
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,590
Are you a Nakhi?

707
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:05,730
Yes.

708
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:09,570
This is a Korean TV show.

709
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:12,100
- This is a Korean TV show.
- TV show?

710
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,300
- Yes, a Korean TV show.
- A TV show.

711
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:19,140
We heard about the minority groups here
and came to visit.

712
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:22,010
(I see.)

713
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:24,710
We had a long conversation.

714
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:28,080
What's in the village?

715
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:35,130
Take a look at the buildings
in our village.

716
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:36,830
Buildings?

717
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:39,200
Then...

718
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,630
I have friends.

719
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:46,340
I'll bring my friends.

720
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:48,270
Can you show us around the village?

721
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:52,180
(Laughing)

722
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,340
Is 6:30 p.m. okay?

723
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:59,480
(Shaking the clothes)

724
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,280
- What?
- He's here.

725
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,750
(Is Kian84 here?)

726
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:07,190
- Si Eon must be really tired now.
- He's knocked out.

727
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,730
- Where did you do the laundry?
- What?

728
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,190
- Where did you do the laundry?
- There is a wash place.

729
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,700
Come on.

730
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:19,440
(Laundry attack)

731
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,240
Doing the laundry after ten days
felt so relieving.

732
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,010
- There is a wash place?
- Yes.

733
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:26,010
Where?

734
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,240
It's around 300m away.

735
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:33,950
I met Nakhi sisters there.

736
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,890
- Sisters?
- They said they're sisters.

737
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:38,860
- Okay.
- They'll show us around the village.

738
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,320
They will?

739
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:43,230
Did you use a translation app
to talk to them?

740
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:48,060
They said they'd meet us at 6:30 p.m.

741
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,730
Why are you doing that?
It's splashing on your face.

742
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:53,870
- You can hold it upside down.
- It's an underwear mist.

743
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:55,640
What? That's unbelievable.

744
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,170
(Underwear mist?)

745
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,510
- I can hold it upside down.
- Yes, you can.

746
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:00,540
You're smart.

747
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,750
It's splashing water all over your face.

748
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:04,650
How did you think of that?

749
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,550
It still splashes water on my face.

750
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:13,590
He's shaking it in his face.
What is he doing?

751
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:16,930
I think it will dry quickly
if we use hangers.

752
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:17,990
I'm too tired to wring it out.

753
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,400
(The weather is fine,
but their conversation is not.)

754
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,430
It'll dry soon.

755
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:21,900
Who did you say you met?

756
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:23,800
(The eldest wakes up.)

757
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,800
What's going on?

758
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,370
Did you get their number?

759
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,340
No, I didn't.

760
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:32,540
We agreed to meet at 6:30 p.m.
at the bridge by the wash place.

761
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,510
- I see.
- I don't believe it.

762
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:36,410
"Let's meet in front of the clock tower."

763
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:37,410
That's romantic.

764
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:40,050
We use different apps.

765
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:41,720
That's how people met back in the day.

766
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,690
"Meet me in front of Busan Theater
in Nampo-dong at 3 p.m."

767
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:45,690
That's right.

768
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:47,160
We just had to keep waiting
if our friend was late.

769
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,460
- That's right.
- We had no way to reach them.

770
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:50,490
It's 6:09 p.m. We have to go now.

771
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:51,860
- We do?
- Okay.

772
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,660
- Should we leave right now?
- Let's go.

773
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:56,730
Okay.
This is nice since I was getting bored.

774
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:01,470
We're meeting at 6:30 p.m.
We have 6 minutes left.

775
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,510
They said they'd meet us at this bridge.

776
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:06,040
- Here?
- Yes.

777
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,750
- The wash place is down there.
- Okay.

778
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,520
There is a place to do the laundry?
Did you wash it with this water?

779
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,390
- Yes, all the villagers do it here.
- I see.

780
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:17,920
(Bridge, Wash place)

781
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:22,090
This is the village...

782
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:24,530
where the Nakhi people live.

783
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:25,800
(Where the locals live)

784
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,360
- What about over there?
- Is it a new town?

785
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,370
That's the new town, like Ilsan.

786
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:30,970
But it's right next to each other.

787
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:33,100
There are lodgings and a hair salon.

788
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,640
You learned a lot about that area.

789
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,470
I'd like to go up that way.
You haven't been up there, right?

790
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:39,810
They're taking us up there to look around.

791
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:41,440
- Are these homes?
- Yes, like an apartment complex.

792
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,980
They must go up and down this hill
all the time.

793
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,650
It's pretty steep.

794
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:50,290
We happened to meet several...
What's that? It's coming by itself.

795
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:51,620
Self-driving.

796
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:52,720
- Is it a car?
- A car?

797
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,460
- What's that?
- What is it? Where are they going?

798
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,090
Are they like taxis?

799
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:00,600
- They are Tesla mules.
- "Tesla mules."

800
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,170
- They're going by themselves.
- Are they like taxis?

801
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:04,400
Maybe we can just get on them.
I saw a mule going up those steps.

802
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,400
- "Mulesla."
- That's unbelievable.

803
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,870
Here comes more.

804
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,170
Go on.

805
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,410
- Go on.
- They are even carrying stuff.

806
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:17,010
- That's impressive.
- They're smart.

807
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:18,380
- You're right.
- Mule.

808
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,620
The world has improved.

809
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,550
(Anyway...)

810
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,190
Why aren't they here when it's time?

811
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,460
The sun is setting.

812
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:30,690
(It's now 6:35 p.m.,
which is past their meeting time.)

813
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,530
Why aren't they here yet?

814
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:34,730
(Dropping onto the ground)

815
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:37,500
What time is it Pani Bottle?
It's past 6:30 p.m.

816
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:40,370
Well,
waiting 5 to 10 minutes isn't that bad.

817
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:41,840
- You're right.
- I'm sure there's a reason.

818
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:48,280
(Sad)

819
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,280
My gosh.

820
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,380
Wait.

821
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,320
(Kian84,
are you sure they agreed to meet us?)

822
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,650
Maybe they aren't coming.

823
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:59,820
(They were overly kind to Kian84.)

824
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,660
What happened? Did you get stood up?

825
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,060
Was there a miscommunication?

826
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:04,730
(Was the wash place of Nakhi84
just a dream?)

827
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:06,800
Oh, no.

828
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,770
They might be saying,
"I bet they're waiting for us."

829
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:13,500
Most women make up excuses
to turn you down.

830
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,940
Maybe they think
we're meeting at 7:30 p.m.

831
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:16,940
- Why aren't they here?
- Is it 7:30 p.m.?

832
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,610
I said 6:30 p.m.

833
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:22,180
(It's time to accept the reality.)

834
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,450
They aren't coming.

835
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:28,050
Should we go to the wash place?
Maybe they're waiting there.

836
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,890
I thought they could've
misunderstood the location.

837
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:31,890
- That's possible.
- That's right.

838
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:32,960
- Of course.
- Since you couldn't understand...

839
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,990
- each other.
- That happens sometimes.

840
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,990
I'll go check it out.
I don't want them to be waiting for us.

841
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,000
Go ahead. But what if they come here?

842
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,900
You can wait here
just in case they come here.

843
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,530
Do they know your name?

844
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,600
You can just call me
"the person who did the laundry."

845
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,140
(The person who did the laundry)

846
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:55,080
(The person who did the laundry
goes back to the wash place.)

847
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:58,350
I told them 6:30 p.m.

848
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:00,320
I think they might be
waiting somewhere else.

849
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,090
- I know.
- That is flustering.

850
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:04,090
They're cute.

851
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:08,590
Mules seem like
the main means of transportation here.

852
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:11,230
Is that them?

853
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:13,200
I think you're right.

854
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,600
(Did they finally meet the Nakhi sisters?)

855
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,000
- I think you're right. Hello.
- Hello.

856
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:19,300
- Wait a second.
- Let's see.

857
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,040
Jianpasi?

858
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:23,510
- What?
- What?

859
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,270
Wait a second.

860
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:27,710
We're friends of the guy
who did the laundry.

861
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:29,680
- They'll understand right away.
- Friends of the laundry guy.

862
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,950
That's right.

863
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:32,550
That's right. Okay.

864
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,320
Please wait.

865
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,120
- I'll get Kian84. Please wait.
- Okay.

866
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,660
- Jianpasi, they're here.
- They are?

867
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:44,330
I can tell they're sisters right away.

868
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,160
Two girls who look alike came.

869
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,900
I knew it was them even before asking.

870
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,930
- Really?
- Yes.

871
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:51,770
(Eon is left alone.)

872
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:53,200
(Well...)

873
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,170
He thought you were coming to
the wash place and went to look for you.

874
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:01,240
(I see.)

875
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:05,580
(They all feel awkward.)

876
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,350
(Laughing)

877
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,550
(Hurry up and come, Laundry Guy.)

878
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,820
- Hello.
- Hello.

879
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:14,390
(Kian84 joins them as well.)

880
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:16,860
- We should introduce ourselves.
- Yes.

881
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,930
I'm Pani Bottle.

882
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:20,400
- Pani Bottle?
- Pani Bottle.

883
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,330
- I'm Kian84.
- Jianpasi.

884
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:23,370
- Kian84.
- Jianpasi.

885
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:24,500
- Jianpasi?
- Yes, Jianpasi.

886
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:25,800
Kian84 and Pani Bottle.

887
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,940
Si... Bao Nyeon.

888
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:29,770
"Si Bao Nyeon?"

889
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,280
- What are you saying?
- Were you swearing?

890
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:33,580
It's Lee Bao Nyeon.

891
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,980
- But I started saying "Si Eon."
- "Si Bao Nyeon."

892
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:37,180
So it became "Si Bao Nyeon."

893
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,210
You just met them.

894
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:39,750
That's how I pronounce my name, right?

895
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:41,020
- Bao Nyeon.
- Yes, but it's funny.

896
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:43,250
- Lee Bao Nyeon.
- Lee Bao Nyeon.

897
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,350
- Bao, Pani, Jian.
- Pani.

898
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:47,490
(Hesitant)

899
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:49,060
- Bao Nyeon.
- Bao Nyeon.

900
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,160
I can try writing it here.

901
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,360
- In Chinese characters?
- Lee Bo Yeon.

902
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,300
Write it in Chinese characters.

903
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,870
- What's your name?
- Kao Jie.

904
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:57,100
- Kao Jie.
- Kao Ji?

905
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,840
- Kao Jie.
- Kao Jie.

906
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,210
- Kao Jie.
- Kao Jie.

907
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,810
- Xiaomi.
- Xiaomi.

908
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,110
- Xiaomi.
- I'm familiar with that name.

909
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,180
The battery.

910
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:10,280
- Xiaomi.
- Xiaomi.

911
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,050
When I heard they were part
of a minority group, I thought...

912
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:14,780
- they'd wear traditional clothes.
- That's right.

913
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,150
They're very trendy.

914
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:18,150
How old are you?

915
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:21,560
- I'm 23.
- You're 23 and you're 24?

916
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:23,260
They're 23 and 24.

917
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,390
I might be older than their dad.

918
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,130
- I think you'd be around the same age.
- I think so too.

919
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,300
(Who is the oldest out of you three?)

920
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,770
(Raising his hand)

921
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,670
- I'm 44.
- I'm sick of hearing 44.

922
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:37,540
- That way, they treat me with respect.
- As an elder?

923
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,740
(Forty-four)

924
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:42,350
(You don't look that old.)

925
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,510
- Young.
- Young.

926
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:46,120
- Young.
- Young.

927
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,450
(They stutter as they tell Si Eon
he looks young.)

928
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:50,820
Young.

929
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,620
He's young, right?

930
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,460
- Gosh.
- This is high.

931
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,460
The view is amazing.

932
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,660
None of the homes are in a low area.

933
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,630
Gosh, this is high.

934
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,730
(It's scary from the entrance.)

935
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,740
Stay close since you might get lost.

936
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:09,770
- Okay.
- Thank you.

937
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:14,740
(They follow the sisters
deep into an alley.)

938
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,080
It's so pretty here.

939
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,350
Gosh.

940
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:20,450
Our hotel was fascinating,
but this is even more fascinating.

941
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:21,480
(Looking out from inside the village)

942
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:24,420
The architecture is unique.

943
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,560
I wonder how they built that.
It's interesting.

944
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:30,890
Look over there.
One side of that home is a net.

945
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:32,400
(A net instead of a window)

946
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,500
This house is huge.

947
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:38,630
- Big house.
- Yes, it's big.

948
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:40,400
- You're right.
- And it has a high ceiling.

949
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,310
All these houses have three floors.

950
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:46,910
- All the houses are three stories.
- I see.

951
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:50,110
They have mules on the first floor.

952
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:54,120
- The 1st floor is for livestock.
- They keep livestock on the 1st floor?

953
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,120
It's the parking lot.

954
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:59,020
(The 2nd floor has a living room
and common area.)

955
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:02,160
(The 3rd floor has bedrooms.)

956
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:04,060
The houses are big.

957
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:07,930
The houses all look different
but have the same structure.

958
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:10,970
The houses are fit for living together.

959
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:12,700
They're well-suited for communal living.

960
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:16,870
I think there was a similar structure
in Switzerland.

961
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:19,980
- In Switzerland?
- With horses and cows on the first floor.

962
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,840
- It must be similar.
- It was a mountainous area.

963
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,510
Are there Nakhi people in Switzerland?

964
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,350
No, they aren't Nakhi people.

965
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,250
The minority group of Switzerland.

966
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:29,850
- Do you want to visit Switzerland?
- My mouth is watering.

967
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:31,820
(My mouth is watering.)

968
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,520
The minority group of Switzerland?

969
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,860
- Look over there.
- You're right.

970
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:41,400
Why are the roofs of the houses...

971
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,400
so flat?

972
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:47,040
(They can go from one house to another...)

973
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,040
(across the rooftops.)

974
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,310
- Gosh.
- They move across the rooftops?

975
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:54,540
Gosh, look at this.

976
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:57,210
- They're drying this here.
- It's pork.

977
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:58,650
- It's pork.
- Pork?

978
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,020
They're drying pork.

979
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,080
Like pork jerky?

980
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:04,490
The ribs we had in Lijiang
were made with dried pork.

981
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,820
- That's right.
- It must've been dried like that.

982
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,520
(Something else is hanging from above.)

983
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:10,460
It's mule hide.

984
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,960
(Honking)

985
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,230
The self-driving mule got a call.

986
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:19,740
(The Mulesla walks along the street.)

987
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:22,740
(The mules walk along the alleys
as a means of transport and mobility.)

988
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,240
- They can't live without the mules.
- You're right.

989
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,470
(The mules walk along the alleys
as a means of transport and mobility.)

990
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,380
The mules transported everything...

991
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,250
used to build these houses.

992
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,320
The mules transported everything
to build these houses?

993
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:36,520
How did they transport everything?

994
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,250
The mules must've been so tired.

995
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:39,760
"The mules must've been so tired."

996
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,760
(Yes.)

997
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,530
(I know the pain of transporting loads.)

998
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:44,590
Mules...

999
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:50,200
(He pats a mule
while empathizing with it.)

1000
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,940
You're doing a good job.

1001
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,310
(People and mules walk along the alleys.)

1002
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:59,040
It's like a maze.

1003
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:00,640
I'd get lost.

1004
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,880
- Yes, it looked easy to get lost.
- It looks easy to get lost.

1005
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:06,320
(The Nakhi people
preserve their traditional culture...)

1006
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,950
That place is very unique.
It's interesting.

1007
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:10,820
(as they live together.)

1008
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:14,560
What kind of work do the people do?

1009
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:19,200
We plant crops like corn and wheat...

1010
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,960
and raise various types of livestock.

1011
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,170
A small number of people
own lodgings or restaurants,

1012
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:29,540
- That's only a few of them.
- but most of them are farmers.

1013
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:32,880
- They also make paper.
- They're known for their paper.

1014
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,440
(They make traditional Nakhi paper...)

1015
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,280
They carry on their tradition.

1016
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,650
(with the bark of paper mulberry.)

1017
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:40,450
(His questions are answered.)

1018
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:42,490
What do Nakhi people do at night?

1019
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:44,890
Do you live around here?

1020
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:48,590
- Do you eat cacti?
- You have so many questions.

1021
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:51,030
- He's making good use of that app.
- Seriously.

1022
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:55,230
I heard the Nakhi worship a frog.
Is that true?

1023
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,630
No, it's a tiger.

1024
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,640
- Tiger?
- The tiger is a deity?

1025
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,670
Not a frog.

1026
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:02,940
(The Nakhi people worship the tiger.)

1027
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:05,370
(Nakhi84 is highly satisfied
with the productive answers.)

1028
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:06,580
It's like I'm obsessed
with the Nakhi people.

1029
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:07,940
(Nakhi84 is highly satisfied
with the productive answers.)

1030
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:11,280
Kian84 showed so much interest...

1031
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,750
that they were grateful.

1032
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,550
(They enter an alley that goes uphill.)

1033
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:20,260
- It was steep and endless.
- It was very steep.

1034
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,720
(The stairs are quite steep.)

1035
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:26,260
- I'm out of breath.
- This is a high mountain.

1036
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,560
Aren't you out of breath?

1037
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,170
Should we slow down?

1038
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,940
- No, it's okay.
- Let's go.

1039
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:37,010
- They must not be out of breath.
- They said they're used to it.

1040
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,940
They're in shape like the Sherpas
and can continue walking.

1041
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:43,910
We will soon reach the highest point
of the village.

1042
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,510
- Okay.
- Okay.

1043
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,980
Look at the path. Gosh.

1044
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,690
Is this an official path?

1045
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,090
This isn't easy.

1046
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:55,490
(They take the unofficial path
to the top.)

1047
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,390
Gosh.

1048
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,930
- Gosh.
- Come on.

1049
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:02,130
- We can see everything.
- This must be the top.

1050
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:03,530
(They gasp as they get a view
of the whole village.)

1051
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:05,770
It's beautiful.

1052
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,900
(They can see the traditional houses
in a glace.)

1053
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,370
- You can see everything.
- You can see everything.

1054
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:11,670
It was beautiful.

1055
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:16,650
The houses are 500 years old.

1056
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:18,450
- They're very old.
- They're 500 years old?
(The history of the Nakhi people
lives and breathes in this village.)

1057
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:21,620
We're seeing the history of that village.

1058
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,420
(The history of the Nakhi people
lives and breathes in this village.)

1059
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:27,590
A long time ago,

1060
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:30,630
this village used to be a rest stop
of the Tea Horse Road.

1061
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:34,300
It was where muleteers rested.

1062
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:37,370
Lijiang is also known as a rest stop
for muleteers,

1063
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:40,770
but the life of the locals
is embedded in this village.

1064
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:43,910
The road was paved
only around a decade ago.

1065
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:45,470
- Really?
- Yes.

1066
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:48,810
It hasn't been that long
since civilization reached this village.

1067
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:54,650
Before there was a road,

1068
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:57,050
it took around a month to return
once someone left the village.

1069
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:58,250
- I bet.
- A month?

1070
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:02,460
- The altitude is around 4,000m.
- That's right.

1071
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:05,560
How did they walk along this tough road?

1072
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,830
It must've been hard to breathe.

1073
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:13,070
(He takes in the view silently.)

1074
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:15,600
(Thinking)

1075
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:17,810
Why do you work and live here...

1076
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:20,480
instead of moving to a city?

1077
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:21,940
I know.

1078
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:27,020
We have to help our parents
with the farming.

1079
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,450
I see. They farm.

1080
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:31,790
They stay here
because they have to help their parents.

1081
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:34,320
(The sisters settled down in the village
for their family.)

1082
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,360
Let's go.

1083
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,790
They're nice.

1084
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:40,430
Many young people move to the city,

1085
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:43,570
but they stayed here
to help their parents.

1086
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:45,030
- In farming?
- Yes.

1087
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:47,200
This must be where they work.

1088
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,970
(Yes, it is.)

1089
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,070
- Wheat.
- I see. Wheat?

1090
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,210
(The vast wheat field
where the sisters work)

1091
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:56,880
Then do you have no days off?

1092
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:59,350
(No, we don't.)

1093
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:01,220
(You work every day?)

1094
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:02,280
Unbelievable.

1095
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:05,190
They're very mature.

1096
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,060
(A neighbor greets
the hard-working sisters.)

1097
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,760
(Hello.)

1098
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:13,130
People are getting off work.

1099
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,100
Look.

1100
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:19,770
- Gosh.
- Is she taking a video?

1101
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:21,840
- She's doing a live broadcast.
- Wait.

1102
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:22,870
It's a live video.

1103
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:25,640
She's even doing a live broadcast
while going up that hill.

1104
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:27,780
(Hello.)

1105
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:29,080
It's a live broadcast of the Nakhi people.

1106
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,550
(An interesting collaboration between
the Nakhi people and live broadcast)

1107
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:31,810
This is amazing.

1108
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:33,950
The internet is surprisingly fast here.

1109
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:35,450
It's very fast.

1110
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:36,790
(The internet is very fast
at the traditional houses.)

1111
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:40,990
Look.

1112
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:43,690
- Several people are streaming here.
- What's that?

1113
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:45,030
There's another person
streaming a live video here.

1114
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,030
There are so many people
streaming live videos here.

1115
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:50,600
They're promoting our village.

1116
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,670
They're promoting your village?

1117
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:53,900
(The unofficial ambassadors
who go around the village)

1118
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:56,270
Several people do live broadcasts...

1119
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:58,240
to share their traditions with others.

1120
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:00,680
Not even the Chinese
know about this village that well.

1121
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:03,050
They leave comments
saying that it's fascinating.

1122
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:05,480
That's why people watch the videos
like they would watch TV.

1123
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,580
(Leaders in raising awareness
of this mysterious village)

1124
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:08,850
(Interesting.)

1125
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:12,290
Would you like to see the Dongba now?

1126
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:13,990
- Dongba?
- Dongba?

1127
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:15,820
- We don't know what that is.
- Dongba?

1128
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:16,830
What is it?

1129
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:18,560
It's the most well-known tradition
of the Nakhi people.

1130
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:23,270
They said it was very important
and wanted to show us.

1131
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:26,040
Kian84 showed enthusiasm.

1132
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,400
So they wanted to show that to us.

1133
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,470
They must've been excited
and felt proud to share it with you.

1134
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:31,870
Are they showing us the Dongba?

1135
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:33,410
They said we will learn about Dongba.

1136
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:34,480
(His mouth is watering.)

1137
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:36,710
Dongba is the religion of this area.

1138
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:40,080
They believe in Dongbaism,
and the shamans are called Dongba.

1139
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,450
I looked it up on the internet.
It wasn't something I knew about.

1140
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:45,650
Are we going to a shaman
to have our fortune read?

1141
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:47,660
No, we don't get our fortune read.

1142
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:51,430
- They'll introduce their religion to us.
- I think it might be a temple.

1143
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,560
- This looks like a hideout.
- We're here?

1144
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,030
It isn't a lodging.

1145
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:01,140
It's the Dongba script.

1146
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:04,170
- This is the Dongba script.
- Hello.

1147
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:06,680
So this is the Dongba script.

1148
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:08,940
A traditional script.

1149
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:11,110
(The Dongba script
is the Nakhi people's traditional script.)

1150
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:14,850
(They first came across the script
on the streets of Lijiang.)

1151
00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:19,720
(They spotted the glyphs
throughout the town.)

1152
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:21,220
Do Yeon!

1153
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:24,090
He sounded like Sha Wujing.

1154
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,330
(His nasal voice rivaled
that of Sha Wujing.)

1155
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:28,930
That was great.

1156
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:30,470
Please give us an explanation.

1157
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:31,870
(Do Yeon!)

1158
00:45:31,870 --> 00:45:34,370
Apart from Chinese characters,
the Dongba script is...

1159
00:45:34,370 --> 00:45:36,570
the only hieroglyph that's still in use.

1160
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:39,340
- It goes back 1,000 years.
- No way.

1161
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:41,640
Dongba script.

1162
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:42,910
What's this?

1163
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,950
She's writing the Dongba script.

1164
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:47,120
This is the Chinese zodiac.

1165
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,680
- You're right.
- They look like...

1166
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,190
the Adventure by Accident numbers
you drew.

1167
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:51,850
- They look like Kian84's drawings.
- You're right.

1168
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:54,420
- The Kian84 script.
- They're similar to our characters.

1169
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:57,190
(While they enjoy
the characters of the Nakhi people)

1170
00:45:57,190 --> 00:45:58,660
The characters are very cute.

1171
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,000
(Si Eon gets introduced to someone.)

1172
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Who is that?

1173
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:04,330
I see.

1174
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:05,870
Kian84, Pani Bottle.

1175
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:08,800
In this village,

1176
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,410
he's the most respected person.

1177
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:12,510
- Really?
- An elder.

1178
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:14,840
He studies the Dongba script.

1179
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,910
- He's like a human cultural asset.
- An intangible cultural asset.

1180
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:20,480
The Dongba is in charge
of religious ceremonies.

1181
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,180
He's the spiritual leader.

1182
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:25,150
But he studies the script as well.

1183
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:27,490
He protects the village and its culture.

1184
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,360
That's right.

1185
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,830
The Dongba can do a fortune reading.

1186
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:34,000
He knows how to do a fortune reading.

1187
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:35,660
- A fortune reading?
- Yes.

1188
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:38,000
- I'm curious.
- In that case,

1189
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,740
do you have any personal questions?

1190
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,300
Let's have our fortunes read lightly.

1191
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:44,910
Shall I ask a light question
about my love life?

1192
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:45,970
- Okay.
- Okay.

1193
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:48,740
Ask him what kind of woman
you should date.

1194
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:50,650
Okay. What kind of woman I should date.

1195
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:52,710
- Won't the answer be obvious?
- Here is what I think, Pani Bottle.

1196
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:54,280
Ask him when you'll get married.

1197
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:56,550
Ask him if you'll be able to get married.

1198
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:58,490
- Just swear at me.
- Seriously.

1199
00:46:58,490 --> 00:47:01,860
The most important question is,
"What kind of woman should I marry?"

1200
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,030
- That's right.
- Yes.

1201
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:05,490
(Turning on the translator)

1202
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:10,830
(The Dongba gives a serious answer.)

1203
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:12,230
Please interpret what he said.

1204
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,240
"I can't give you an answer..."

1205
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,310
"because everyone's idea
on the matter is different."

1206
00:47:16,310 --> 00:47:17,840
- That's right.
- That's right.

1207
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:18,840
What should I ask then?

1208
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,640
He's very reasonable.

1209
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,140
He evaded the question
with a reasonable answer.

1210
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:24,580
When will I be able to get married?

1211
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:27,120
- Pick one.
- Pick from this book.

1212
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,180
You need to pick one.

1213
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:30,050
(Twisting the strings)

1214
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,990
(Twists the strings
as you think about your wish...)

1215
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:35,260
(and pick one.)

1216
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:40,460
(He'll give a fortune reading
based on the script on the page.)

1217
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:41,900
- Okay.
- Okay.

1218
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:45,130
It's like a rope I'm hanging on
to get married.

1219
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:47,240
- Focus.
- Hold on a second.

1220
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:50,140
What is it?

1221
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:51,940
(Pani Bottle, let's get married!)

1222
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:53,310
(Pani Bottle is channeling a spirit.)

1223
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:57,550
What are they doing?

1224
00:47:57,550 --> 00:47:58,710
(Do Yeon doubts her eyes.)

1225
00:47:58,710 --> 00:47:59,980
(Pani Bottle?)

1226
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:01,780
He channels a spirit now.

1227
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:03,720
- You did it during the rope workout.
- Yes.

1228
00:48:04,290 --> 00:48:06,260
(Just like the older member,)

1229
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:07,490
(he channels a spirit.)

1230
00:48:07,490 --> 00:48:08,490
What's this?

1231
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:11,130
(Utmost desperation)

1232
00:48:11,490 --> 00:48:13,060
They're good brothers.

1233
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:14,330
- I know.
- They're desperate.

1234
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:15,800
Pani Bottle.

1235
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:19,100
All right.

1236
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:20,340
(Amid everyone's wishes, he picks one.)

1237
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:25,310
Please let it be a good one.

1238
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,680
- Look at his facial expression.
- Please.

1239
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:34,220
(He becomes nervous for no reason.)

1240
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:38,390
You already have a girlfriend.

1241
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:45,760
(A girlfriend?)

1242
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,130
(Getting up)

1243
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:48,330
- No way!
- Unbelievable!

1244
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:49,970
- You...
- What?

1245
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:52,100
- You're a scary man!
- I can't believe you!

1246
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,170
- What's scarier is...
- Please sit down.

1247
00:48:55,770 --> 00:48:56,840
- We're...
- You know...

1248
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,440
- We're tall.
- You guys are too tall.

1249
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:00,440
- When two tall people stood up,
- I agree.

1250
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:01,910
- it was like a total eclipse.
- I...

1251
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:06,110
(In front of the surprised Seung Hoon,)

1252
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:08,150
(an even more surprising
astronomical phenomenon occurred.)

1253
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:09,180
(Lee Seung Hoon)

1254
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,750
- The light disappeared.
- I'm sorry.

1255
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:14,360
Let's keep watching for now.

1256
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:15,820
- Okay.
- There must be more.

1257
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:17,430
- This is fun.
- What's going on?

1258
00:49:17,490 --> 00:49:18,930
It's exciting.

1259
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:21,900
You already have a girlfriend.

1260
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:26,440
Oh, my gosh.

1261
00:49:27,370 --> 00:49:29,470
Your relationship with her...

1262
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:31,310
is pretty serious.

1263
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,980
- What?
- What did he say?

1264
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:35,580
(Chuckling)

1265
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:37,810
(It's the Dongba's personal opinion.)

1266
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:39,180
What should I do?

1267
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:42,280
(The older members are impressed.)

1268
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:43,820
- He's good.
- I don't know what to do.

1269
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:45,150
What should I do?

1270
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:46,360
(Pani Bottle is flustered for real.)

1271
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:48,460
To be honest...

1272
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:50,190
Well,

1273
00:49:50,990 --> 00:49:52,990
I've never talked about it on TV.

1274
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,030
No way.

1275
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:55,860
I have a girlfriend.

1276
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:57,330
- Oh, my!
- What?

1277
00:49:57,970 --> 00:49:59,300
(He confesses that
he's in a relationship.)

1278
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:00,740
- It's true!
- What?

1279
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:01,900
What?

1280
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:03,440
When he got it right,

1281
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:05,670
I became so flustered.

1282
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:07,840
I looked at the production crew...

1283
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,710
and went, "What should I do?"

1284
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:12,150
My eyes shifted.

1285
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:14,650
I'm curious about
the facial expression I made then.

1286
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:15,720
I'm so curious.

1287
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:20,560
(The man in a relationship,
Pani Bottle, is flustered.)

1288
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,290
The Dongba was good.

1289
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:23,690
He was really good.

1290
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:26,190
Have you talked about
having a girlfriend anywhere else?

1291
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:27,900
- No. Never.
- Is this the first time?

1292
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,430
I've never done it on TV.

1293
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:31,100
- I've never done it anywhere.
- It's so...

1294
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:33,300
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1295
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:37,340
The way he admitted it in a cool way...

1296
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:38,940
- was awesome.
- It was cool.

1297
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:40,080
My heart fluttered.

1298
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,210
Did you ask your girlfriend about it?

1299
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:43,810
- Yes, I did.
- "It might get aired."

1300
00:50:43,810 --> 00:50:44,980
I asked her if she'd be okay
if it got aired.

1301
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:46,180
- What did she say?
- She said that she didn't care.

1302
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:48,980
I should've known
because Pani Bottle had become...

1303
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:50,420
- very cool.
- That's right.

1304
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:52,590
- There was a reason.
- It was because of his relationship.

1305
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:55,390
(Love gave Pani Bottle back...)

1306
00:50:55,390 --> 00:50:58,030
(his heyday.)

1307
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:01,400
Pani Bottle is insanely handsome
these days.

1308
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:06,200
(They're still shocked
by the Dongba's reading.)

1309
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:09,440
I'm too scared to ask anything.

1310
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,710
My heart sank just now.

1311
00:51:12,210 --> 00:51:14,380
(The heart of the man
who is in a relationship)

1312
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:19,310
- Seriously.
- I've done this study for 30 years.

1313
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:21,720
- Thirty years. That's incredible.
- Gosh.

1314
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,820
Is it hard to get there?

1315
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:25,790
(Startled)

1316
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:27,860
By the time you get there,
you'll look like us.

1317
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:29,960
- There's no direct flight.
- You'll need to rent a car.

1318
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,430
It'll take two days.

1319
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:34,060
Please give me the latitude
and longitude on Google Maps.

1320
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:35,300
(She's persistent.)

1321
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:39,130
- Guru.
- Guru.

1322
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:40,840
(Embarrassed)

1323
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,870
Thank you, Guru.

1324
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:46,010
Bless you. Stay healthy.

1325
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:49,280
Thank you.

1326
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:50,710
(They shake hands as a goodbye.)

1327
00:51:51,410 --> 00:51:52,980
(Bowing)

1328
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:57,050
(The meeting with the Dongba
was very mysterious.)

1329
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,120
The hour is late,

1330
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,020
so let's walk them home.

1331
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:02,160
We need to eat.

1332
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,090
I'll tell them.

1333
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:05,930
Thank you so much for today.

1334
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:08,700
The younger ones will walk you guys home.

1335
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:11,100
I need to poop.

1336
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:13,000
May I go inside first?

1337
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:17,570
They burst out laughing.

1338
00:52:17,870 --> 00:52:19,040
I couldn't help it.

1339
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,340
- I needed to poop.
- He is our representative.

1340
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:23,410
(We hope that you'll poop well!)

1341
00:52:23,410 --> 00:52:25,050
We'll walk them home.

1342
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:26,110
- Okay.
- Go ahead and poop.

1343
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:27,850
I'm sorry.

1344
00:52:27,850 --> 00:52:28,950
(I'm sorry about leaving first.)

1345
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:30,090
Go.

1346
00:52:31,790 --> 00:52:33,890
We should walk them to the uphill road,
right?

1347
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:35,420
We should walk them
to the front of their house.

1348
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:36,530
- It's dark.
- Okay.

1349
00:52:36,530 --> 00:52:38,590
(Despite being tourists,
they walk the locals to their house.)

1350
00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:40,430
Which way should I go, Kian84?

1351
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,800
- The lodging is that way.
- It's that way.

1352
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,100
Hold on.

1353
00:52:44,770 --> 00:52:48,070
- Bye.
- Bye.

1354
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:52,470
(My goodness)

1355
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:54,510
- Are you okay?
- Did he twist his ankle?

1356
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:55,810
- Oh, no.
- Are you okay?

1357
00:52:55,810 --> 00:52:56,850
Did he fall down?

1358
00:52:57,050 --> 00:52:58,280
(He grabs his shin and cries.)

1359
00:52:58,280 --> 00:52:59,450
Did you break a bone?

1360
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:00,980
- What's going on?
- I mean...

1361
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:04,120
(After saying goodbye
to the younger ones in a cool way,)

1362
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:06,490
(he ran to poop.)

1363
00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:08,860
(Then he fell down.)

1364
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:12,390
Did you poop your pants? Hurry up and go.

1365
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,600
I think he pooped his pants a bit.

1366
00:53:14,930 --> 00:53:16,200
He's a lot of work.

1367
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:17,330
- You didn't break a bone, did you?
- No.

1368
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:19,300
Oh, no.

1369
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:21,070
I guess he really needed to poop.

1370
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:22,470
(It hurts.)

1371
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:23,570
Gosh, the camera.

1372
00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:24,670
Hold on to it.

1373
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:26,040
- He told me to film it.
- All right.

1374
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,380
He shoved the camera in my hands.

1375
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,010
We'll get going now. Let's go.

1376
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:30,910
- Let's go.
- They left me like that.

1377
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:32,110
(He says goodbye in a cool way.)

1378
00:53:32,110 --> 00:53:33,720
Come on!

1379
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:36,350
- I'm sorry. I had lost my humanity.
- My goodness.

1380
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:38,550
Si Eon, the wash place is down the stairs.

1381
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:39,650
Let's go.

1382
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,890
- The younger members left.
- I can't believe it.

1383
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:45,230
My first master was leaving,
so I had to follow him.

1384
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:46,860
(Come here, Pani Bottle.)

1385
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:48,630
- You were like a mule.
- Yes.

1386
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:51,400
- You followed like a mule.
- Mule Bottle.

1387
00:53:51,870 --> 00:53:53,770
- He'll poop his pants.
- Let's go.

1388
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,640
(Are you okay?)

1389
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:59,270
- You're quite heartless.
- What?

1390
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:00,510
You're quite heartless.

1391
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:01,510
(Unlike the younger members
who left in a heartless way,)

1392
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:02,810
(the sisters talk to him.)

1393
00:54:02,810 --> 00:54:04,610
They're so nice.

1394
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:06,280
- Oh, my.
- My goodness.

1395
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:08,080
The conversation is dragging on.
What a hassle.

1396
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:11,590
- He's totally heartless.
- "What a hassle."

1397
00:54:11,650 --> 00:54:12,720
It's okay.

1398
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,490
Kian84, take your friends.

1399
00:54:15,490 --> 00:54:16,760
Let's go.

1400
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:17,990
- Let's go.
- "Let's go."

1401
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:19,230
(Hesitant)

1402
00:54:19,430 --> 00:54:20,560
It's okay.

1403
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:22,800
- They're warmhearted.
- Yes.

1404
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:24,900
We're more heartless.

1405
00:54:25,070 --> 00:54:27,040
Si Eon let me take
some photos of the alpacas.

1406
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,300
I feel bad.

1407
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:31,770
We're hungry.

1408
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:32,910
Shall we eat here?

1409
00:54:33,310 --> 00:54:35,580
It looks like the restaurants are closing.

1410
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:39,280
It's pitch black.

1411
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:40,420
It gets so dark.

1412
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,050
Will there be a restaurant
that's open at such a late hour?

1413
00:54:43,490 --> 00:54:44,890
I think all the restaurants are closed.

1414
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:47,160
(Let's see.)

1415
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,020
Let's ask them...

1416
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:50,430
if there's a restaurant.

1417
00:54:51,090 --> 00:54:54,660
Is there a restaurant we can go to nearby?

1418
00:54:56,830 --> 00:54:58,770
Well, a restaurant...

1419
00:54:59,330 --> 00:55:01,940
It looks like there are no restaurants.

1420
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,010
(Glancing over)

1421
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:05,440
If you're very hungry,

1422
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:07,910
come to our house.

1423
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:10,350
What? To your house?

1424
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:12,550
They're worried.

1425
00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:14,320
She said that we could eat at their place
if we were hungry.

1426
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:17,320
- But their parents must be there.
- Yes.

1427
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:20,660
What would their parents think?
It feels like it'd be a hassle.

1428
00:55:21,090 --> 00:55:22,220
Let's ask.

1429
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:24,630
If they're okay with us eating there,

1430
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:26,290
shall we offer...

1431
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:28,000
to help them with their work
tomorrow morning?

1432
00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:30,130
- The farmwork?
- It's a good idea.

1433
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:31,570
Even if it isn't much...

1434
00:55:32,170 --> 00:55:33,330
(They enter the alley with a plan.)

1435
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:34,340
It's a cricket.

1436
00:55:36,570 --> 00:55:39,310
(It doesn't matter if it's day or night.)

1437
00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:42,210
(The staircase continues to be steep.)

1438
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:44,780
(My goodness)

1439
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:46,250
Do they live on top of the hill?

1440
00:55:47,850 --> 00:55:49,350
What should we do about Si Eon?

1441
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:50,850
- Si Eon?
- Yes.

1442
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:53,050
If Si Eon can't find the place,
I'll go and pick him up.

1443
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,290
(He's heartless at times.)

1444
00:55:56,290 --> 00:55:57,590
I'll take care of Si Eon.

1445
00:55:57,890 --> 00:55:59,690
That's right. Kian84 feels bad.

1446
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:03,030
(Meanwhile,
Si Eon needs someone to look after him.)

1447
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:04,870
- Hello?
- Ji Seung.

1448
00:56:05,330 --> 00:56:07,500
- What is it?
- I fell down.

1449
00:56:07,970 --> 00:56:08,970
How?

1450
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:10,270
He's sad.

1451
00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:11,340
(Look at my wound.)

1452
00:56:12,110 --> 00:56:14,340
How did you fall down
to get hurt so badly?

1453
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:18,010
I ran because I wanted to poop.
And I fell into a drain.

1454
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:20,220
"I fell into a drain."

1455
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:22,250
(It hurts.)

1456
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:23,990
Kian84 left without me.

1457
00:56:23,990 --> 00:56:25,850
"Kian84 left without me."

1458
00:56:25,850 --> 00:56:28,720
You should put some bandage on it.

1459
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,430
- Okay.
- I almost cried. I'm serious.

1460
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:31,630
- Oh, no.
- My goodness.

1461
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:33,760
Okay, Ji Seung. I'll call you later.

1462
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:35,560
(Bye.)

1463
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,370
- Is that a heart?
- A heart.

1464
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,100
But your parents...

1465
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:43,640
Wouldn't it be too much trouble
since your family is home?

1466
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:46,910
I'll ask Mom if there's food.

1467
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:48,580
You should come inside and eat
if there is.

1468
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:49,910
(I see.)

1469
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:51,080
She'll go and ask her mom.

1470
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:52,280
(I see. Okay.)

1471
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:55,020
We'll wait.

1472
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,320
We'll wait here while you ask.

1473
00:56:58,690 --> 00:56:59,990
(Excuse me.)

1474
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:03,090
Is your injured friend okay?

1475
00:57:03,930 --> 00:57:05,590
I'll go and bring him.

1476
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:07,830
The sisters have a great personality.

1477
00:57:08,430 --> 00:57:09,430
They have a lot of compassion.

1478
00:57:10,170 --> 00:57:11,170
Okay.

1479
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:13,200
- Come inside.
- Shall we go inside?

1480
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:14,200
Thank goodness.

1481
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:16,500
To be honest,
I was the most curious about the house.

1482
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:17,770
- I wanted to see how they lived.
- I see.

1483
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:19,040
Please excuse me.

1484
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,380
The house is very big.

1485
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,480
It's so spacious.

1486
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:25,510
(They're surprised by the spacious house.)

1487
00:57:25,710 --> 00:57:27,180
What? My goodness.

1488
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:30,390
- Pig.
- Pig.

1489
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:31,720
There's an assortment of meat.

1490
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:33,560
(In the hidden space,)

1491
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:34,660
(there's an array of dried pork.)

1492
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:36,890
I guess the weather is dry.

1493
00:57:36,890 --> 00:57:38,030
Yes. I guess it doesn't go bad.

1494
00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:40,330
(After enjoying the unique sight,)

1495
00:57:40,830 --> 00:57:43,060
(they go deeper into the house.)

1496
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:45,200
- Hello.
- Hello.

1497
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,900
(They say hello to the parents first.)

1498
00:57:48,270 --> 00:57:50,100
Thank you for having us.

1499
00:57:50,770 --> 00:57:52,040
(Welcome.)

1500
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:53,940
You don't need to thank me.

1501
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:56,780
(It's nice to meet you.)

1502
00:57:56,780 --> 00:57:58,180
(Enjoy yourself.)

1503
00:57:58,650 --> 00:58:00,350
- Thank you.
- How thankful.

1504
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:04,890
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1505
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:08,020
- These are oranges.
- Mandarin oranges.

1506
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:09,360
I had them at the hotel in Lijiang.

1507
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:11,190
Mandarin oranges are tasty.

1508
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:13,190
They're tasty.

1509
00:58:13,390 --> 00:58:14,830
- Are they sweet?
- They're very sweet.

1510
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:17,470
Coke.

1511
00:58:17,470 --> 00:58:19,370
(They get Coke
as soon as they eat mandarin oranges.)

1512
00:58:19,570 --> 00:58:21,770
(Drinking)

1513
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,740
They're treating us so nicely.

1514
00:58:24,470 --> 00:58:28,640
Since they're treating us so nicely,
we should help them with work tomorrow.

1515
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:29,680
I think that's a good idea.

1516
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:31,610
When I was in the Amazon,

1517
00:58:31,610 --> 00:58:33,210
they gave me food
and a place to spend the night.

1518
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,620
I helped them with farmwork
in the morning,

1519
00:58:37,190 --> 00:58:38,220
so I felt much better.

1520
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:40,260
We shouldn't say,
"We'll help you with work."

1521
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:41,990
We should say, "We want to try working.'

1522
00:58:41,990 --> 00:58:43,460
- That's right.
- We're here anyway.

1523
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:44,760
That way, they won't feel bad.

1524
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:47,000
- They can go, "Try it if you want."
- He doesn't disappoint.

1525
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,960
Gosh, the mule is so considerate.

1526
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,770
(Gosh, the mule is so considerate.)

1527
00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:53,740
You have a way with words.
Your wording is similar, but different.

1528
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:54,940
- That's right.
- It's nice.

1529
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,370
I'll go and pick Si Eon up.

1530
00:58:58,370 --> 00:59:00,010
(Okay.)

1531
00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:01,480
I'll go and bring my friend.

1532
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:04,210
- My friend.
- Kian84 is the one who takes care of him.

1533
00:59:04,650 --> 00:59:06,110
- Will you go to the lodging?
- I'll call him.

1534
00:59:06,610 --> 00:59:07,750
Did he break his leg?

1535
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:09,650
He's calling me.

1536
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:10,750
Si Eon.

1537
00:59:11,550 --> 00:59:12,650
- Kian84.
- Yes?

1538
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:14,990
May I go there as well?

1539
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:17,030
I'm a bit hungry.

1540
00:59:18,030 --> 00:59:19,960
Of course, he's hungry.

1541
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:23,530
The parents will cook for us.

1542
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:26,900
Si Eon, stand in front of the uphill road.
I'll go there.

1543
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,100
- Okay.
- All right.

1544
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:31,810
Where in Korea are you from?

1545
00:59:32,370 --> 00:59:34,080
I'm from the capital, Seoul.

1546
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:37,150
- Seoul?
- Seoul.

1547
00:59:38,010 --> 00:59:39,880
Say hello to the parents first.

1548
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:41,420
- Okay.
- We're here.

1549
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:42,750
Hello.

1550
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:44,490
(Bowing)

1551
00:59:45,550 --> 00:59:48,290
- Si Eon brought a gift.
- Did he bring a gift?

1552
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:49,760
Snacks.

1553
00:59:49,990 --> 00:59:51,830
- Good.
- Bravo. That's good.

1554
00:59:51,930 --> 00:59:54,200
- Good.
- We bought them earlier at the market.

1555
00:59:54,630 --> 00:59:56,300
- Go inside.
- I...

1556
01:00:00,270 --> 01:00:01,340
What's that?

1557
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:04,040
(As a repayment for the gift,
she brings a mysterious liquid.)

1558
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:06,240
It's ointment.

1559
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:07,380
She's so nice.

1560
01:00:07,910 --> 01:00:09,410
(Being a crybaby)

1561
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:11,580
I wasn't being a crybaby!
I can't believe these people.

1562
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:13,650
(Hurry up and apply it here.)

1563
01:00:13,650 --> 01:00:15,680
Let's see. I'll apply it.

1564
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:18,220
- Gosh.
- Oh, no. There's a wound.

1565
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:19,850
- My goodness.
- Oh, no.

1566
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:22,820
- It's swollen here.
- It's a bit swollen.

1567
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:24,330
It's a deep wound.

1568
01:00:25,090 --> 01:00:27,130
- Okay.
- Okay.

1569
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:30,030
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1570
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:31,430
(Don't mention it.)

1571
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,240
I feel so uncomfortable.

1572
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:36,700
- Really? Do you feel uncomfortable?
- I feel so bad.

1573
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:38,110
- I feel so uncomfortable.
- I feel so bad.

1574
01:00:38,110 --> 01:00:39,710
Really? I feel fine.

1575
01:00:40,910 --> 01:00:41,910
He's used to such situations.
(The experienced man is relaxed.)

1576
01:00:42,910 --> 01:00:44,880
- You and I...
- You get free food everywhere you go.

1577
01:00:45,050 --> 01:00:47,020
That's what makes you different from us.

1578
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:48,250
They offered to do this for us.

1579
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:51,290
- But...
- Being uncomfortable isn't polite.

1580
01:00:51,290 --> 01:00:53,520
We should enjoy the food
as much as possible.

1581
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:56,120
When I was in elementary school,
I practically lived at my friend's house.

1582
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:58,060
You're obsessed
with other people's houses.

1583
01:00:58,490 --> 01:01:02,100
When you spend a long time there,
you become a family member.

1584
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:05,100
(He did it in South America.)

1585
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:07,470
(He did it in India.)

1586
01:01:07,470 --> 01:01:09,670
(He did it in Madagascar as well.)

1587
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:12,270
(Staying at other people's houses
by accident)

1588
01:01:12,270 --> 01:01:13,270
(Good.)

1589
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:15,410
When I was in elementary school,
I didn't stay at my house.

1590
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:17,750
I always went to my friend's place
and slept there.

1591
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:20,310
I complained to his mom
since she always made me ramyeon.

1592
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:21,620
I asked her to grill some meat.

1593
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:25,350
You were shameless.

1594
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:27,660
I liked that house better than mine.

1595
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:28,660
(Other people's houses are the best.)

1596
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:31,230
Making yourself at home is polite.

1597
01:01:31,230 --> 01:01:32,490
(Make yourself at home
at someone else's house.)

1598
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:34,630
I'll peel a mandarin orange for you.

1599
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:38,830
(He peels it with care.)

1600
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:41,500
(Eating)

1601
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:43,300
Weren't you peeling it for Si Eon?

1602
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:46,010
Weren't you peeling it for me?
Why are you eating it?

1603
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:48,380
I forgot that I said that.

1604
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:49,710
I didn't think that you'd eat it.

1605
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:51,380
(I can't believe him.)

1606
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:54,080
"I'll peel it for you. You should eat it."
Then he ate it.

1607
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:55,180
He forgot as he peeled it.

1608
01:01:55,180 --> 01:01:56,520
(Kian84 forgot what he said
as he peeled it.)

1609
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:57,950
I can't believe him.

1610
01:01:58,050 --> 01:02:01,020
I'm sorry. My memory doesn't last
more than three seconds.

1611
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:03,120
(Forget it.)

1612
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:04,560
I feel bad.

1613
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:06,360
(Pani Bottle still feels uncomfortable.)

1614
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:09,860
My friend wants to try doing...

1615
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:11,570
some farmwork tomorrow.

1616
01:02:11,670 --> 01:02:12,670
Really?

1617
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:15,000
We'll help.

1618
01:02:15,170 --> 01:02:17,410
It'll be very strenuous. Will you be okay?

1619
01:02:17,710 --> 01:02:19,040
(How strenuous will it be?)

1620
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:22,240
Have you done farmwork before?

1621
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:23,780
(Picking apples)

1622
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:25,480
Potatoes.

1623
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:28,120
Then you'll do well.

1624
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:30,490
If there's strenuous work, give it to me.

1625
01:02:31,150 --> 01:02:32,550
(I see.)

1626
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:34,720
(You're dependable.)

1627
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:35,920
(Leave it to me.)

1628
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:36,920
Nice.

1629
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:39,660
(Walking over)

1630
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:41,200
Someone came.

1631
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:44,770
She's our mom.

1632
01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:47,400
- Is she their mom?
- Mom?

1633
01:02:48,670 --> 01:02:51,810
Wasn't the first woman you guys saw
their mom?

1634
01:02:52,370 --> 01:02:54,610
(Earlier, they said hello...)

1635
01:02:54,610 --> 01:02:56,240
I thought she was their mom.

1636
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:57,250
(to this woman.)

1637
01:02:58,450 --> 01:03:02,350
(Why are there two moms?)

1638
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:05,320
(Walking over)

1639
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:06,520
(Who is he?)

1640
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:08,390
He's our dad.

1641
01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:10,760
Is he their dad?

1642
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:12,260
- What?
- He isn't the one we saw earlier.

1643
01:03:13,330 --> 01:03:14,730
To whom did you guys say hello earlier?

1644
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:18,230
(Next to the dad they greeted earlier)

1645
01:03:18,230 --> 01:03:19,470
Why are there so many dads?

1646
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:22,270
What?

1647
01:03:22,270 --> 01:03:24,240
(Who is this?)

1648
01:03:24,470 --> 01:03:26,540
(Confused)

1649
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:28,410
- She's our mom.
- There's another mom.

1650
01:03:28,410 --> 01:03:30,810
The third mom is the last one.

1651
01:03:31,150 --> 01:03:32,150
The third mom?

1652
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:34,480
(Looking around)

1653
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:35,480
What's going on?

1654
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:37,820
The third mom?

1655
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:38,850
(So who is your mom?)

1656
01:03:39,050 --> 01:03:41,060
We have three moms.

1657
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:42,090
- What?
- What?

1658
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:44,160
(Three moms in the household?)

1659
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:45,330
- Do they have three moms?
- What?

1660
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:46,530
No way.

1661
01:03:47,330 --> 01:03:49,160
Yes, we have three moms.

1662
01:03:50,530 --> 01:03:51,530
Three moms?

1663
01:03:51,530 --> 01:03:52,600
They have three mothers?

1664
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:54,370
(All kinds of thoughts
suddenly cross their mind.)

1665
01:03:54,370 --> 01:03:55,900
(You really have 3 mothers?)

1666
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:57,670
- Why?
- How is that possible?

1667
01:03:58,510 --> 01:03:59,670
My brain suddenly stopped functioning.

1668
01:04:00,070 --> 01:04:01,780
At first,
I couldn't understand what was going on.

1669
01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:05,610
They introduced us to their parents.
So I thought it was just the four of them.

1670
01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:07,050
I was really shocked.

1671
01:04:07,950 --> 01:04:11,550
If I were to say the wrong thing
about their family,

1672
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:14,190
it could come across as rude.
So I didn't ask them.

1673
01:04:14,190 --> 01:04:17,790
But after hearing that,
I had a lot on my mind.

1674
01:04:18,890 --> 01:04:21,460
The 3 of them married 3 brothers.

1675
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:25,000
I see. I get it now.
Two families must've married each other.

1676
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,000
The 3 sisters must have married
the 3 brothers. Isn't that it?

1677
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,500
(To put it simply,
they married each other's in-laws.)

1678
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:31,770
So there are three pairs of parents?

1679
01:04:31,770 --> 01:04:33,870
I've seen that happening
with two siblings,

1680
01:04:34,210 --> 01:04:36,610
- but never with 3 siblings from 1 family.
- Gosh, 3 siblings.

1681
01:04:36,610 --> 01:04:38,350
- This actually happened.
- This is amazing.

1682
01:04:38,780 --> 01:04:40,780
Then are you guys relatives?

1683
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:43,920
I guess you can say that.
We're very close.

1684
01:04:44,150 --> 01:04:46,290
- I guess they're cousins.
- Aren't they cousins then?

1685
01:04:46,290 --> 01:04:48,790
- Right. They're not real sisters.
- They're cousins.

1686
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:52,190
- Now, everything makes sense. I see.
- They're cousins.

1687
01:04:52,790 --> 01:04:53,790
But... Right.

1688
01:04:54,130 --> 01:04:57,030
I have a question about the way
you address them. They're your aunts.

1689
01:04:57,030 --> 01:04:58,330
How come you address them as your mothers?

1690
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:02,070
We all live in the same house.

1691
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:06,270
We've become very close.
So we address them as Mom and Dad.

1692
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:07,640
That's similar to our culture.

1693
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:09,510
- We do that too.
- Right.

1694
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:12,050
Then did they have a love marriage?

1695
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:13,250
(Did all three of them
have a love marriage?)

1696
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:15,920
Our oldest mother and oldest father
started dating first.

1697
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:19,190
After they got married,
our grandfather found out that...

1698
01:05:19,390 --> 01:05:21,960
our oldest mother had two sisters.

1699
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:24,590
Our oldest father also had
two younger brothers.

1700
01:05:24,830 --> 01:05:27,300
Since they were all unmarried, he arranged
the sisters to meet the brothers.

1701
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:28,560
That's how they ended up getting married.

1702
01:05:29,030 --> 01:05:31,530
(The 3 consecutive love marriages
make his jaw drop.)

1703
01:05:31,770 --> 01:05:33,000
Even though their brother and sister
got married,

1704
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,640
there was nothing wrong
with their brothers and sisters...

1705
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:35,840
- wanting to marry each other.
- Right.

1706
01:05:36,070 --> 01:05:38,040
Maybe, that's the biggest joy.

1707
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:39,240
(Finding love
may be the biggest joy in life.)

1708
01:05:39,570 --> 01:05:40,570
It's fascinating...

1709
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:41,810
- how everything worked out.
- Right.

1710
01:05:41,810 --> 01:05:43,440
That must be fate too.

1711
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:44,780
Meeting each other's family
would have been simpler too.

1712
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:48,080
I guess they played matchmaker
for their siblings.

1713
01:05:49,050 --> 01:05:50,790
It was an interesting family.

1714
01:05:51,050 --> 01:05:54,590
Three brothers from one family
and three sisters from another family...

1715
01:05:54,860 --> 01:05:57,830
met each other and got married.
And now, they live together.

1716
01:05:58,130 --> 01:05:59,890
I thought this would be the perfect setup
for a family drama...

1717
01:05:59,890 --> 01:06:01,860
which could potentially score
viewer ratings of over 30 percent.

1718
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:03,730
There was an old drama...

1719
01:06:03,730 --> 01:06:05,200
- where the in-laws got married.
- Right.

1720
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,970
- "See and See Again."
- Right. It's an MBC drama.

1721
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:09,840
- Really?
- It is.

1722
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:15,810
(There were some double in-law marriages
in old dramas.)

1723
01:06:16,310 --> 01:06:18,480
(This family,
layered with familial harmony,)

1724
01:06:19,180 --> 01:06:22,150
(is the real-life example
of "See and See Again.")

1725
01:06:22,850 --> 01:06:23,850
More family members keep on coming.

1726
01:06:23,850 --> 01:06:24,890
(Other family members
come down for a meal.)

1727
01:06:24,890 --> 01:06:26,450
Everyone is gathering around at this hour.

1728
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:29,860
I thought it was just a family of four,
but it was a huge family.

1729
01:06:30,730 --> 01:06:34,030
- That's our 3rd-oldest brother.
- Our 3rd-oldest brother.

1730
01:06:34,330 --> 01:06:38,830
- That's our sister-in-law.
- They have...

1731
01:06:39,070 --> 01:06:40,070
two kids.

1732
01:06:41,070 --> 01:06:44,770
- A total of 15 people live in our house.
- Gosh.

1733
01:06:44,770 --> 01:06:46,140
That's a big family.

1734
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:49,910
Shouldn't we say hello to the family?

1735
01:06:49,910 --> 01:06:54,080
- Hello.
- Hello.

1736
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:56,820
- Hello. Where are you from?
- Hello.

1737
01:06:57,390 --> 01:06:59,290
- We're from Korea.
- Korea.

1738
01:06:59,450 --> 01:07:00,620
(Welcome!)

1739
01:07:00,620 --> 01:07:02,060
- How cute.
- Look at the baby's cheek.

1740
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:04,830
- The cheek...
- They stamped something on it. How cute.

1741
01:07:05,790 --> 01:07:07,290
Back in the day, there used to be...

1742
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:09,930
many big families in our country too,
although they weren't...

1743
01:07:09,930 --> 01:07:11,400
- double in-law marriages.
- Right.

1744
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:14,170
I can say that
this place is just like Yeoju.

1745
01:07:14,770 --> 01:07:15,770
He's mentioning Yeoju again.

1746
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:17,270
Everything ends with Yeoju.

1747
01:07:18,140 --> 01:07:19,370
(The friendly atmosphere
that reminds him of Yeoju...)

1748
01:07:19,370 --> 01:07:21,240
You can't see
that kind of big family anywhere.

1749
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:23,480
Seriously. It's such a rare sight now.

1750
01:07:24,410 --> 01:07:25,750
Gosh, look at the size of the pot.

1751
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:27,110
(The size of the pot is indeed large
for this large family.)

1752
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:28,980
It's big enough to feed a class.

1753
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:32,990
I recognize this.
It's the dried pork from earlier.

1754
01:07:32,990 --> 01:07:34,560
(It's made with dried pork.)

1755
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:36,960
(A dish with a clear broth)

1756
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:39,430
It's the same dish
you had before in the village.

1757
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:41,660
- Yes, that's right.
- Right. We had that in Lijiang.

1758
01:07:42,630 --> 01:07:44,430
- Is that mala?
- Mala?

1759
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:47,640
- Thank you for the food.
- Okay. Eat a lot.

1760
01:07:47,970 --> 01:07:50,070
Gosh, it's a home-cooked meal
of the Nakhi people.

1761
01:07:50,070 --> 01:07:52,010
(Taking a bite
of the Nakhi home-cooked meal)

1762
01:07:55,110 --> 01:07:57,780
(Everyone tastes the meat.)

1763
01:07:57,780 --> 01:07:59,610
- It's the same dish we had yesterday.
- Yes.

1764
01:07:59,610 --> 01:08:00,680
Does it taste the same?

1765
01:08:01,180 --> 01:08:02,250
This is tastier.

1766
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:04,820
(Smiling)

1767
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:09,360
Since it was dried meat,

1768
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:11,360
- the texture was a bit tough.
- Right.

1769
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:13,790
I really liked the sentimental vibe
of getting a home-cooked meal.

1770
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:16,400
- The mala sauce.
- It's tasty.

1771
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:19,200
(Captivated by the food)

1772
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,100
(Exhaling)

1773
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:22,170
(Inhaling sharply)

1774
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:24,110
My gosh. The mala sauce is quite spicy.

1775
01:08:24,870 --> 01:08:27,170
- This is spicy.
- Hey, the sauce is spicy.

1776
01:08:27,580 --> 01:08:30,010
(Adding a generous ladleful
of the mala sauce)

1777
01:08:30,010 --> 01:08:31,050
That much?

1778
01:08:31,510 --> 01:08:33,210
(This is nothing.)

1779
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:34,750
(She seems at peace,
even after having the spicy mala sauce.)

1780
01:08:34,750 --> 01:08:37,120
The spiciness here is different
from the one we're used to.

1781
01:08:37,620 --> 01:08:41,820
(The child has the clear soup
without the mala sauce.)

1782
01:08:43,260 --> 01:08:44,860
(I'm having some too.)

1783
01:08:44,860 --> 01:08:45,860
How cute.

1784
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:49,030
(Everyone enjoys the meal
in their own way.)

1785
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,230
(Bringing out another big bowl of rice)

1786
01:08:53,230 --> 01:08:54,240
That's way too much food.

1787
01:08:56,940 --> 01:08:58,240
(Munching)

1788
01:08:58,710 --> 01:08:59,770
Eat a lot.

1789
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:01,980
They eat a lot of food, indeed.

1790
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:04,350
They had slender builds.
But their portion was huge.

1791
01:09:05,050 --> 01:09:06,680
(Xiaomi gets more rice.)

1792
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:08,320
(And she gets some more.)

1793
01:09:08,980 --> 01:09:12,550
(She eagerly eats up the food.)

1794
01:09:12,820 --> 01:09:14,920
(She cleans the bowl.)

1795
01:09:15,190 --> 01:09:16,820
(They're eating a lot.)

1796
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:18,790
You're bound to eat a lot
in the countryside.

1797
01:09:19,090 --> 01:09:20,590
They farm rice.

1798
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:22,960
Back in Korea,
there would be big stainless bowls.

1799
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:27,230
And there would be mountains of rice
in the stainless bowls.

1800
01:09:27,570 --> 01:09:29,840
Farmers don't gain weight
even if they eat that much rice...

1801
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:31,140
because farming is a tough job.

1802
01:09:31,410 --> 01:09:33,540
The amount of labor that goes into farming
is just crazy.

1803
01:09:33,740 --> 01:09:36,910
I hear that this is a matriarchal society.

1804
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:39,050
Is that outdated information?

1805
01:09:39,210 --> 01:09:44,390
Mothers still play a central role
in the household.

1806
01:09:45,350 --> 01:09:47,050
Men and women work just the same.

1807
01:09:47,150 --> 01:09:49,760
But women are primary decision makers.

1808
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:52,390
When you look at dads' facial expressions,
they seem dispirited.

1809
01:09:53,490 --> 01:09:55,600
- They are intimidated.
- They are a bit intimidated.

1810
01:09:56,700 --> 01:10:00,370
Back in the day,
women used to be the heads of the family.

1811
01:10:00,570 --> 01:10:02,870
Gosh, raising kids
after a full day of work outside...

1812
01:10:02,870 --> 01:10:04,440
- must've been tough for them.
- That must've been tough.

1813
01:10:04,740 --> 01:10:07,370
Back in the day,
grandmothers used to hold the most power.

1814
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:11,580
(The women of the Nakhi people made
decisions for the family, big and small.)

1815
01:10:11,850 --> 01:10:15,620
(They were an independent group of women.)

1816
01:10:16,180 --> 01:10:18,520
Work never ends for farmers.

1817
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:21,920
We should eat more food.
This isn't polite.

1818
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:25,460
(As they appreciate the mothers
who must've worked hard for the food,)

1819
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:29,760
(they have one more bite.)

1820
01:10:30,530 --> 01:10:31,600
They're sleepy and tired...

1821
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:32,870
- now that they've had some food.
- They must feel sleepy after a meal.

1822
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:34,940
I'm so full, and the food is so spicy.

1823
01:10:38,270 --> 01:10:40,110
- They kept giving us rice.
- My gosh.

1824
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:41,140
That's how generous people are
in the countryside.
She took it nonchalantly.

1825
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:43,910
(She takes the heap of rice
just like any other day.)

1826
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:47,580
(I'm full.)

1827
01:10:47,580 --> 01:10:48,650
We're in trouble.
We must finish all the rice.

1828
01:10:49,380 --> 01:10:50,990
(Feeling down)

1829
01:10:52,620 --> 01:10:53,890
Gosh, she gave them more food.

1830
01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:55,960
- Gosh, there...
- She gave us more food.

1831
01:10:56,420 --> 01:10:57,560
That's too much meat.

1832
01:10:57,930 --> 01:10:59,290
- Eat a lot.
- Please eat more.

1833
01:11:00,090 --> 01:11:02,000
I'm really stuffed.

1834
01:11:02,330 --> 01:11:05,100
(The sisters with big appetites
want them to eat more.)

1835
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:08,140
(Giving him more rice)

1836
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,440
(Their generous affection
makes him dizzy.)

1837
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:14,610
(She gives a generous portion of rice
to the next guy.)

1838
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:15,880
I'm full...

1839
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:17,040
(Gosh, I'm full.)

1840
01:11:17,850 --> 01:11:19,210
I already got two scoops of rice.

1841
01:11:19,210 --> 01:11:21,220
No. Then I would be having
three bowls of rice.

1842
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:23,880
- That would be my third bowl then.
- I'm trying to lose weight.

1843
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:24,920
(Are they enjoying the food?)

1844
01:11:25,150 --> 01:11:26,590
It's like I'm at my grandmother's house.

1845
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:30,690
I had more than enough food,
but they kept giving us more food.

1846
01:11:31,130 --> 01:11:33,560
I didn't need more food.
I really had a good meal.

1847
01:11:33,730 --> 01:11:36,200
I was like the grandson
visiting his grandma in the countryside.

1848
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:38,730
They kept giving us food
like any grandma would do.

1849
01:11:38,730 --> 01:11:40,900
That wasn't easy to deal with.

1850
01:11:41,170 --> 01:11:43,000
I was so grateful.
And I wanted to eat more...

1851
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,840
to show my appreciation
for their generosity.

1852
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:47,410
But I was already full.
That was the tough part of the meal.

1853
01:11:47,410 --> 01:11:48,780
It's all about love.

1854
01:11:49,210 --> 01:11:51,750
When do you usually wake up
in the morning?

1855
01:11:52,010 --> 01:11:53,310
We wake up at 7 a.m.

1856
01:11:53,710 --> 01:11:55,020
Then we head over to the mountain...

1857
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:57,120
- around 8 a.m.
- Did she say 7 a.m.?

1858
01:11:57,790 --> 01:12:00,720
This is a tough job.
They said they didn't have any days off.

1859
01:12:00,820 --> 01:12:02,960
Then should we come here tomorrow morning?

1860
01:12:03,620 --> 01:12:04,860
- Yes.
- Yes.

1861
01:12:07,230 --> 01:12:09,900
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you.

1862
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:11,330
- What was that?
- Charging Bottle.

1863
01:12:13,730 --> 01:12:15,800
- What should we do tomorrow then?
- Tomorrow,

1864
01:12:16,140 --> 01:12:18,910
let's head over to Shangri-La
after we help out.

1865
01:12:19,610 --> 01:12:22,080
What did you want to do
in Shangri-La originally?

1866
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:24,280
- Seeing the five-point prostration...
- The five-point prostration?

1867
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:25,410
was first on my list.

1868
01:12:25,580 --> 01:12:28,380
- We're nearing the end of our trip.
- Oh, my gosh.

1869
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:30,580
I wanted to see people
do the five-point prostration.

1870
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:31,990
And I also wanted us to try it...

1871
01:12:31,990 --> 01:12:34,590
if we were lucky enough
to have that chance.

1872
01:12:35,060 --> 01:12:36,890
I wanted to end our trip
with that experience.

1873
01:12:36,890 --> 01:12:38,660
The last activity
on Kian84's bucket list...

1874
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:40,060
- remained.
- Right.

1875
01:12:40,430 --> 01:12:41,530
We'll get to see that?

1876
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:44,700
No matter what time we leave tomorrow,

1877
01:12:44,930 --> 01:12:46,830
it's better to leave when it's bright out
because we have to drive.

1878
01:12:47,070 --> 01:12:49,440
"We should leave when it's bright outside
because Pani Bottle has to drive."

1879
01:12:51,670 --> 01:12:52,710
You ate a lot of food, right?

1880
01:12:53,270 --> 01:12:54,310
I'm sorry.

1881
01:12:54,310 --> 01:12:55,940
(I'm sorry that I'm a bad master.)

1882
01:12:56,310 --> 01:12:57,540
Let's try to get there...

1883
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:59,580
- before 6 p.m. Before the sun goes down.
- A drunk interview.

1884
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:01,180
Let's try to arrive in Shangri-La by then.

1885
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:02,750
- Okay.
- Okay.

1886
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:05,250
- Si Eon. I'll turn off the light.
- Okay.

1887
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:07,490
(They go to sleep
after planning a packed day for tomorrow.)

1888
01:13:14,330 --> 01:13:17,600
(Morning slowly breaks
in the village of the Nakhi people.)

1889
01:13:18,230 --> 01:13:23,240
(Just like any other day, the livestock
diligently climbs up the mountain.)

1890
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:28,480
(Everyone begins a day of their own.)

1891
01:13:33,980 --> 01:13:36,150
(The 3 Brothers wake up at 7 a.m.)

1892
01:13:38,390 --> 01:13:39,890
Pani Bottle, you snored a lot yesterday.

1893
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:42,160
- I did?
- Yes.

1894
01:13:42,490 --> 01:13:44,160
I thought I was going to die
stuck between the two of you.

1895
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:46,260
Seriously.
Both of them snored a lot on my sides.

1896
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:47,330
Really?

1897
01:13:47,660 --> 01:13:50,600
(Last night)

1898
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:52,830
(Gentle snoring)

1899
01:13:52,830 --> 01:13:54,700
(Loud snoring)

1900
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:57,240
My gosh. He had to put up
with their snoring from both sides.

1901
01:13:57,240 --> 01:13:59,670
- My gosh. Oh, no.
- They didn't give him a break at all.

1902
01:13:59,670 --> 01:14:01,110
- Oh, no.
- My gosh.

1903
01:14:01,410 --> 01:14:02,510
Our tempo was good.

1904
01:14:02,510 --> 01:14:04,580
- I feel so bad for Si Eon.
- The snoring duo.

1905
01:14:04,580 --> 01:14:05,780
Oh, no.

1906
01:14:05,780 --> 01:14:07,180
He hurt his leg, and...

1907
01:14:08,450 --> 01:14:10,420
- You wouldn't stop snoring.
- Okay.

1908
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:13,350
Was my snoring louder? Really?

1909
01:14:13,490 --> 01:14:14,690
It was no joke.

1910
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:18,260
(He blows his nose rather late.)

1911
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:22,300
(He trudges out
in his fatigued condition.)

1912
01:14:22,530 --> 01:14:25,200
- Let's go.
- We didn't know where we'd be working.

1913
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:28,740
So we planned to meet the sisters
in front of their house.

1914
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:31,840
These people are amazing, by the way.

1915
01:14:32,110 --> 01:14:33,110
They do this every day.

1916
01:14:33,310 --> 01:14:35,210
It's crazy
how they don't take any days off.

1917
01:14:35,210 --> 01:14:37,410
They go back and forth
without a day of rest.

1918
01:14:38,310 --> 01:14:40,250
Gosh, my lower body...

1919
01:14:40,950 --> 01:14:42,020
Oh, my legs.

1920
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:45,150
That must be a really nice hip exercise.

1921
01:14:45,150 --> 01:14:47,220
Their bottoms might come up
all the way to their necks.

1922
01:14:47,620 --> 01:14:48,760
(A bottom lift)

1923
01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:52,530
I remember it now.
I think I can find their house.

1924
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:54,760
- It's this house.
- I remember now.

1925
01:14:55,260 --> 01:14:56,460
Kao Jie!

1926
01:14:59,170 --> 01:15:00,500
(He calls out her name like he did
at his friend's house during childhood.)

1927
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:01,770
We used to do that back in the day.

1928
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:04,370
- Kao Jie.
- Kao Jie!

1929
01:15:05,010 --> 01:15:06,170
Kao Jie!

1930
01:15:06,370 --> 01:15:08,110
- Xiaomi.
- She's responding.

1931
01:15:08,780 --> 01:15:10,510
- Hello.
- Hello.

1932
01:15:10,580 --> 01:15:12,380
- Hello.
- Hello.

1933
01:15:14,410 --> 01:15:16,020
- Let's go.
- Yes.

1934
01:15:16,020 --> 01:15:17,120
(They set out to work right away.)

1935
01:15:18,350 --> 01:15:20,520
Is that it? Is that their donkey?
Is it a mule?

1936
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:22,490
- This must be it.
- Gosh. Yes, it is.

1937
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:26,830
(Mule, let's have fun while we're young)

1938
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:28,430
It might kick you with its rear leg.
So be careful.

1939
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:31,130
- In the back...
- The rear leg.

1940
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:32,770
My gosh.

1941
01:15:32,770 --> 01:15:34,270
Do they grind its hooves too?

1942
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:38,570
It took about 30 minutes
to go to the field on the other side.

1943
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:42,410
(Glancing up)

1944
01:15:42,610 --> 01:15:44,110
The weather's improved.

1945
01:15:45,610 --> 01:15:46,610
(Under the bright sun...)

1946
01:15:46,610 --> 01:15:47,750
It's a clear day.

1947
01:15:49,150 --> 01:15:51,620
They started working early in the morning.

1948
01:15:51,620 --> 01:15:53,750
By the way,
they really don't take any days off...

1949
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:54,960
all year round.

1950
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:57,090
That... What's that?

1951
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:58,390
Fava beans.

1952
01:15:58,390 --> 01:15:59,630
- Fava beans?
- Fava beans?

1953
01:15:59,830 --> 01:16:01,300
I guess it's some kind of bean.

1954
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:02,500
(The green field of fava beans
fills a corner of the street.)

1955
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:03,500
(It's a type of bean.)

1956
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:04,530
Fava beans.

1957
01:16:04,530 --> 01:16:07,000
Kian84. Look at the chickens.
They can go wherever they want.

1958
01:16:07,670 --> 01:16:09,940
(The chickens are freely roaming around.)

1959
01:16:10,270 --> 01:16:11,270
Pigs.

1960
01:16:11,270 --> 01:16:13,140
(The pigs are satiating
their hunger from overnight.)

1961
01:16:13,340 --> 01:16:15,080
This is the land of the Nakhi people.

1962
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:16,710
(The land of the Nakhi people
is brimming with lively energy.)

1963
01:16:17,540 --> 01:16:18,750
Let's keep walking.

1964
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:20,750
(The Three Brothers
stride into their land.)

1965
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:22,820
Do we go straight up?

1966
01:16:23,020 --> 01:16:24,080
We're climbing up pretty high.

1967
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:28,090
But now that we're here, it feels like
we're walking on the Tea Horse Road.

1968
01:16:28,090 --> 01:16:29,090
Is that so?

1969
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:30,490
This is...

1970
01:16:31,090 --> 01:16:33,430
- Look. We're already tired by this walk.
- Yes.

1971
01:16:33,890 --> 01:16:35,260
How did people manage to walk...

1972
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:37,700
- the Tea Horse Road all those years ago?
- Right.

1973
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:39,770
How did they do this all year round?

1974
01:16:40,570 --> 01:16:41,840
I can't even do this for ten minutes.

1975
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:44,470
People from all those years ago
were really fit.

1976
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:46,610
People living in the modern world...

1977
01:16:47,540 --> 01:16:49,040
are in awful shape.

1978
01:16:49,810 --> 01:16:51,450
So this is
where they used to load the stuff.

1979
01:16:51,610 --> 01:16:54,010
- Then they'd go back and forth.
- Then they'd go back and forth.

1980
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:55,750
- Wait.
- Look at that.

1981
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:57,580
- Wait.
- Is this the place?

1982
01:16:57,580 --> 01:17:00,020
(They stop for a moment
halfway up on the mountain.)

1983
01:17:00,290 --> 01:17:01,620
Gosh, check out the view.

1984
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:04,960
(The elevation gives them
a panoramic view of the village.)

1985
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:06,330
- They've come far.
- Seriously.

1986
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:08,100
What should we do now?

1987
01:17:08,430 --> 01:17:11,670
We're going to feed the cows
in the cattle shed.

1988
01:17:11,930 --> 01:17:13,500
- The cows.
- We'll feed the cows?

1989
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:16,500
There really are cows here.

1990
01:17:16,770 --> 01:17:17,800
My gosh.

1991
01:17:18,310 --> 01:17:19,910
- Oh, my.
- They're calves.

1992
01:17:19,910 --> 01:17:21,640
(The calves are waiting for their food.)

1993
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:24,510
I see. They are dried cornstalks.

1994
01:17:25,910 --> 01:17:27,380
- The dried cornstalks.
- They said...

1995
01:17:27,380 --> 01:17:29,120
they had to feed their livestock first.

1996
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:31,820
That's how it is with farmers.
They make sure they feed the livestock...

1997
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:34,290
- even if they have to skip their meal.
- Right.

1998
01:17:34,820 --> 01:17:38,130
And we'll take
the rest of the cornstalks...

1999
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:42,600
- and feed them to the mule.
- We feed them to the mule.

2000
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:44,130
- The mule.
- Yes.

2001
01:17:44,930 --> 01:17:46,370
There must be more mules up there.

2002
01:17:46,370 --> 01:17:47,370
(They take the cornstalks for the mule.)

2003
01:17:47,370 --> 01:17:48,440
That much?

2004
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:50,170
(Lifting a pile of cornstalks)

2005
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:52,610
(Kian84 takes a pile of cornstalks
just like her.)

2006
01:17:53,610 --> 01:17:55,440
Because I hurt my leg the night before,

2007
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:56,780
they were considerate
and gave me an easy task.

2008
01:17:57,510 --> 01:17:58,580
Donkey.

2009
01:17:59,450 --> 01:18:03,480
(One at a time,)

2010
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:06,490
(they make their way up
to the higher land.)

2011
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:09,390
The hike is already making me sweaty.

2012
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:11,090
It must've been hard to walk up.

2013
01:18:11,090 --> 01:18:12,630
Carrying the cornstalks wasn't a problem.

2014
01:18:12,630 --> 01:18:14,060
- We had to walk up constantly.
- My gosh.

2015
01:18:14,060 --> 01:18:15,160
That was the tough part.

2016
01:18:16,660 --> 01:18:18,000
(On the other hand,
the sisters don't seem tired at all.)

2017
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,070
- They have no problem lifting that.
- The girls are so strong.

2018
01:18:20,070 --> 01:18:21,130
Yes.

2019
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:23,200
I'm sweating a lot.

2020
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:24,740
(When they go up a little higher
with loads of cornstalks,)

2021
01:18:25,610 --> 01:18:27,170
- Stop.
- Is this the place?

2022
01:18:27,170 --> 01:18:28,180
(they arrive at a stable
where the mule is.)

2023
01:18:28,180 --> 01:18:29,280
This must be the mule.

2024
01:18:29,510 --> 01:18:30,910
- This one has nice fur.
- Yes.

2025
01:18:30,910 --> 01:18:32,550
- Beautiful.
- It must've gotten good food.

2026
01:18:33,510 --> 01:18:34,710
I see. This is where they feed the mules.

2027
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:35,720
- Yes.
- They release the mules here.

2028
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:37,050
- So they can eat together.
- I see.

2029
01:18:37,450 --> 01:18:40,450
This one gets to eat
before it has to work.

2030
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:43,620
- They're eating.
- They seem to like it.

2031
01:18:43,820 --> 01:18:45,390
- Gosh.
- They must've been hungry.

2032
01:18:45,390 --> 01:18:46,690
(They gobble it up
as if they've been waiting for it.)

2033
01:18:47,260 --> 01:18:49,200
- That's tastier than regular grass.
- Right.

2034
01:18:50,130 --> 01:18:52,170
- Watching them eat makes me feel good.
- Yes.

2035
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:55,970
(Once they venture farther
into the stable...)

2036
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:59,110
This must be where they work.

2037
01:19:00,910 --> 01:19:04,710
(the Three Brothers arrive...)

2038
01:19:04,710 --> 01:19:08,550
(at an area near the rice terraces
where they will help the sisters.)

2039
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:12,620
(They also feed their livestock here.)

2040
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:15,060
- What's that?
- The pigs are so cute.

2041
01:19:15,060 --> 01:19:16,290
Is that the pig feed?

2042
01:19:16,290 --> 01:19:17,490
Look at the piglets.

2043
01:19:18,130 --> 01:19:19,160
The piglets.

2044
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:21,190
- Gosh. Oh, my.
- My goodness. They are so cute.

2045
01:19:21,190 --> 01:19:22,930
- Gosh.
- Oh, my.

2046
01:19:26,130 --> 01:19:27,500
Let's start working now.

2047
01:19:27,770 --> 01:19:28,900
What are we going to do?

2048
01:19:29,070 --> 01:19:33,410
We're going to cut down...

2049
01:19:33,740 --> 01:19:37,810
the beanstalks
and wheat straws in our field.

2050
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:38,880
I see.

2051
01:19:38,950 --> 01:19:41,310
All right.
You guys have to earn your keep.

2052
01:19:41,620 --> 01:19:42,880
I'm going to pull out the wheat straws.

2053
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:44,150
And Xiaomi will feed the livestock.

2054
01:19:44,150 --> 01:19:45,250
She said two of us need to come down.

2055
01:19:45,250 --> 01:19:46,590
Then I'll go.

2056
01:19:46,590 --> 01:19:48,660
- We'll cut down the wheat straws.
- We'll do that.

2057
01:19:48,990 --> 01:19:50,020
(Eon who hurt his leg
will feed the livestock.)

2058
01:19:50,020 --> 01:19:52,130
- Pigs.
- Okay.

2059
01:19:52,530 --> 01:19:55,360
Go.

2060
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:56,760
(Team Wheat Straw Cutter heads out.)

2061
01:19:57,460 --> 01:19:59,470
My gosh. How beautiful.

2062
01:19:59,930 --> 01:20:01,130
I can smell the grass.

2063
01:20:02,740 --> 01:20:03,740
I like the smell of grass.

2064
01:20:05,370 --> 01:20:08,780
(As the smell of grass
tingles the tip of their nose,)

2065
01:20:09,410 --> 01:20:12,950
(they set out to the field
while walking in a straight line.)

2066
01:20:14,580 --> 01:20:15,650
This is the wheat?

2067
01:20:17,380 --> 01:20:18,890
- That's wheat.
- It's wheat.

2068
01:20:18,890 --> 01:20:20,450
Wheat must have shorter stalks
than barley.

2069
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:22,490
- Yes. They have shorter stalks.
- Right?

2070
01:20:22,490 --> 01:20:24,290
I bet barley stalks grow this tall.

2071
01:20:24,290 --> 01:20:26,460
Rice stalks would reach this height
once they're ripe.

2072
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:28,090
(Densely packed wheat straws)

2073
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:31,230
What do we do now?
Should we cut down all of them?

2074
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:35,840
Do you see the pea shoots
on the edge of the field?

2075
01:20:35,940 --> 01:20:39,740
We have to cut them down
as well as all the wheat straws here.

2076
01:20:39,910 --> 01:20:41,740
- Okay. So cut them down?
- Okay.

2077
01:20:42,110 --> 01:20:43,480
Do I just cut them down?

2078
01:20:44,140 --> 01:20:45,710
- Is there a specific method?
- Just do it?

2079
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:47,680
(The novice farmer)

2080
01:20:48,180 --> 01:20:49,880
This is how you do it.

2081
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:51,150
(Snipping)

2082
01:20:51,150 --> 01:20:52,950
- Okay.
- Yes. It's just like cutting rice stalks.

2083
01:20:52,950 --> 01:20:53,950
(They fully understand the method.)

2084
01:20:54,290 --> 01:20:55,760
Have you guys done this before?

2085
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:56,760
Have I done this before?

2086
01:20:56,760 --> 01:21:00,290
My family used to grow rice.
So I've cut down plenty of rice stalks.

2087
01:21:02,730 --> 01:21:05,030
(He has rice farming experience
from back in the day.)

2088
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:08,540
- You need to have specific skills...
- Right.

2089
01:21:08,540 --> 01:21:09,670
to do a good job.

2090
01:21:09,700 --> 01:21:11,710
I've harvested peanuts before,
but not wheat.

2091
01:21:11,710 --> 01:21:12,840
(This is Pani Bottle's
first farming experience.)

2092
01:21:13,210 --> 01:21:15,740
We're cutting them down
to feed them to the pigs.

2093
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:17,940
I see. Kian84, pigs are going to eat them.

2094
01:21:18,210 --> 01:21:19,610
- Pigs?
- Yes.

2095
01:21:20,380 --> 01:21:23,920
There are many empty wheat grains
that aren't fit for people to eat.

2096
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:26,820
So we're cutting down the wheat straws,
which would be the pig feed.

2097
01:21:27,290 --> 01:21:29,120
It's not easy to feed the pigs.

2098
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:33,530
(They squat down around each other
and focus on their task.)

2099
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,100
Make sure not to cut your hands.

2100
01:21:37,460 --> 01:21:38,800
(Thank you.)

2101
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,430
There aren't any snakes here, right?

2102
01:21:40,870 --> 01:21:41,900
There are.

2103
01:21:42,070 --> 01:21:44,000
- There are snakes here.
- There are snakes?

2104
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:46,510
She should've told us that first.
Why did she tell us now?

2105
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:47,710
(Chuckling)

2106
01:21:47,710 --> 01:21:48,880
People always tell us that later.

2107
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:50,810
But there aren't a lot of them here.

2108
01:21:50,810 --> 01:21:51,850
Okay.

2109
01:21:52,850 --> 01:21:55,150
I'll protect you if snakes show up.

2110
01:21:55,350 --> 01:21:56,650
(Just trust me.)

2111
01:21:56,650 --> 01:21:58,290
- She sounds reliable.
- Okay.

2112
01:21:58,290 --> 01:21:59,790
(Impressed)

2113
01:22:00,190 --> 01:22:05,390
I saw a snake a few days ago.

2114
01:22:06,260 --> 01:22:07,330
But I killed it right away.

2115
01:22:07,330 --> 01:22:09,000
- My gosh.
- Well done.

2116
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:12,070
Nakhi women definitely give off
the vibe of female warriors.

2117
01:22:12,370 --> 01:22:15,270
Jie. Were you born and raised here?

2118
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:16,670
Yes.

2119
01:22:17,370 --> 01:22:20,570
I was only away from the village
when I went to school for my studies.

2120
01:22:20,940 --> 01:22:22,040
For your studies?

2121
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:24,840
Then did you graduate from high school?

2122
01:22:25,180 --> 01:22:26,810
I graduated from a university too.

2123
01:22:26,810 --> 01:22:30,120
- She had a strong educational background.
- Really?

2124
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:32,190
What was your major?

2125
01:22:32,790 --> 01:22:34,220
Hotel Management.

2126
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:36,260
- Hotel Management?
- Hotel Management.

2127
01:22:36,490 --> 01:22:38,460
Then don't you want to do something
related to your major?

2128
01:22:38,660 --> 01:22:39,760
Yes, I do.

2129
01:22:39,860 --> 01:22:40,990
Then why...

2130
01:22:41,390 --> 01:22:42,800
Are you here to help your parents?

2131
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:44,360
Yes, I am.

2132
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:47,600
It's okay
because I'm here temporarily to help them.

2133
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:49,070
- I see.
- She's helping them only temporarily.

2134
01:22:49,070 --> 01:22:50,140
(A cool daughter
who studies and helps her parents)

2135
01:22:50,140 --> 01:22:51,570
- This wasn't her primary job.
- Right.

2136
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:54,640
If you think about it, given her age...
She's only 23.

2137
01:22:54,640 --> 01:22:56,580
- Right.
- She must want to dress up...

2138
01:22:56,580 --> 01:22:58,380
- and hit up a popular town.
- She's so young.

2139
01:22:58,380 --> 01:22:59,980
- Kids her age want to have fun.
- Kids her age want to have fun.

2140
01:22:59,980 --> 01:23:02,650
But she's helping her parents on the farm
when she's so young.

2141
01:23:02,650 --> 01:23:04,820
- Right.
- She's such a good daughter.

2142
01:23:05,450 --> 01:23:07,220
What kind of job will you get later?

2143
01:23:08,590 --> 01:23:12,090
I want to do something related to my major
and get a job in the hotel industry.

2144
01:23:12,660 --> 01:23:14,990
What's your dream hotel
you want to work at?

2145
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:17,460
Hilton? Marriott?

2146
01:23:18,530 --> 01:23:20,770
I'm not sure yet.

2147
01:23:20,770 --> 01:23:24,440
But most people move to Chengdu.

2148
01:23:25,310 --> 01:23:27,810
- Chengdu is a big city.
- Right.

2149
01:23:27,810 --> 01:23:29,080
When you were in college...

2150
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:31,440
(Hesitant)

2151
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:34,510
When you were in college,
did you date anyone from your school?

2152
01:23:34,510 --> 01:23:35,550
That was random.

2153
01:23:37,950 --> 01:23:40,450
No, I didn't.

2154
01:23:40,450 --> 01:23:41,490
Why not?

2155
01:23:41,490 --> 01:23:45,560
Now that you're helping on the farm,
you must see that...

2156
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:48,860
- I just don't have time to date.
- Of course.

2157
01:23:49,430 --> 01:23:51,260
So you really didn't date anyone
when you were in college?

2158
01:23:51,260 --> 01:23:53,530
Did you not date anyone back in college?

2159
01:23:53,770 --> 01:23:55,800
No. I swear I didn't.

2160
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:58,440
- She swears she didn't.
- I didn't.

2161
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:00,170
- She didn't.
- Did she only work every day?

2162
01:24:01,210 --> 01:24:03,040
Pani Bottle. You didn't date anyone
in school either, right?

2163
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:05,150
Me? I've never dated anyone,
let alone on campus.

2164
01:24:05,150 --> 01:24:06,280
- So you've always been single?
- Yes.

2165
01:24:07,380 --> 01:24:08,820
I never dated anyone until I was 34.

2166
01:24:08,950 --> 01:24:10,750
- Who cares? You're in love now.
- Yes.

2167
01:24:10,750 --> 01:24:11,920
(But he's in love now.)

2168
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:15,460
People go to college
in order to date people.

2169
01:24:15,820 --> 01:24:18,120
It's not like I studied harder
because I wasn't dating.

2170
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:20,090
- Right?
- I only played games.

2171
01:24:21,190 --> 01:24:22,730
- That's true.
- Yes.

2172
01:24:22,860 --> 01:24:25,130
(Amid the bitter issue
about dating in college,)

2173
01:24:25,730 --> 01:24:28,330
(Jie is focused alone.)

2174
01:24:29,070 --> 01:24:30,870
(Glancing)

2175
01:24:30,870 --> 01:24:33,310
- About Jie.
- Yes?

2176
01:24:33,740 --> 01:24:37,610
How does she farm with such a small build?

2177
01:24:37,710 --> 01:24:39,310
But she's better at it than us.

2178
01:24:39,310 --> 01:24:41,110
Jie is really quick with her hands.

2179
01:24:41,110 --> 01:24:42,120
Totally.

2180
01:24:42,150 --> 01:24:43,750
She's a real workaholic.

2181
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:46,990
Ever since we met,
she's only talked about work and family.

2182
01:24:46,990 --> 01:24:48,050
- Exactly.
- He's right.

2183
01:24:48,050 --> 01:24:49,260
She hasn't even mentioned her ideal type.

2184
01:24:49,820 --> 01:24:52,260
I don't think she's all that interested
in that topic.

2185
01:24:52,260 --> 01:24:53,630
Did we even ask her about her ideal type?

2186
01:24:54,330 --> 01:24:55,460
What's your ideal type?

2187
01:24:56,330 --> 01:24:58,300
(My ideal type?)

2188
01:24:58,300 --> 01:25:00,770
I like someone energetic and bright.

2189
01:25:03,070 --> 01:25:05,240
An energetic and bright guy means
he must be good at work.

2190
01:25:06,310 --> 01:25:08,110
Everything points to being good at work.

2191
01:25:08,510 --> 01:25:11,380
Wait. Should I introduce you
to a bright Korean guy...

2192
01:25:11,380 --> 01:25:12,980
who is good at work and fluent in Chinese?

2193
01:25:13,380 --> 01:25:15,250
Yes. I'd love that.

2194
01:25:15,350 --> 01:25:16,580
She'd love that, Kian84.

2195
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:18,180
But that man refuses to work.

2196
01:25:19,950 --> 01:25:21,750
He's bright and energetic, but won't work.

2197
01:25:22,190 --> 01:25:23,920
That's okay.

2198
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:26,060
I'll turn him into a guy
who can work well.

2199
01:25:26,930 --> 01:25:28,960
- What a girl crush. She's tough.
- Is that so?

2200
01:25:29,060 --> 01:25:30,300
She'll remodel him.

2201
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:31,360
Remodeling a human.

2202
01:25:32,330 --> 01:25:34,500
She'll fix the guy's rotten mindset.

2203
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:36,370
I'll try to find one in Korea.

2204
01:25:36,770 --> 01:25:38,740
Really?

2205
01:25:38,740 --> 01:25:39,840
I will...

2206
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:42,310
Please find someone bright
and good at work.

2207
01:25:42,410 --> 01:25:43,940
Tell her we'll find one later.

2208
01:25:44,110 --> 01:25:45,510
And a guy fluent in Chinese.

2209
01:25:46,180 --> 01:25:48,720
He doesn't have to be fluent in Chinese.

2210
01:25:48,820 --> 01:25:51,120
I can always teach him.

2211
01:25:51,620 --> 01:25:52,620
Chinese is not a requirement.

2212
01:25:52,620 --> 01:25:53,890
- She's full of spirit.
- Right?

2213
01:25:54,790 --> 01:25:56,490
But I might not be able to find one.

2214
01:25:57,390 --> 01:25:58,590
Don't rely on me completely.

2215
01:25:58,590 --> 01:25:59,960
Should I put it like that or what?

2216
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:01,630
You need to be careful,
or she'll wait for real.

2217
01:26:01,630 --> 01:26:02,630
- Really?
- I know, right?

2218
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,830
Check your phone later.

2219
01:26:06,070 --> 01:26:08,740
(Just before the international blind date
is set up)

2220
01:26:08,970 --> 01:26:10,440
- What?
- What's with that angle?

2221
01:26:11,470 --> 01:26:12,570
What's this?

2222
01:26:13,370 --> 01:26:14,540
Chicken rice?

2223
01:26:15,540 --> 01:26:18,040
(Chicken feed made with cornmeal)

2224
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:19,750
There are chickens over there.

2225
01:26:20,010 --> 01:26:21,950
We were giving the animals their feed.

2226
01:26:24,950 --> 01:26:25,950
So they had chickens.
Chicken.

2227
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:30,120
(Putting the cornmeal in the feedbox)

2228
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:33,790
(Placing it back)

2229
01:26:34,190 --> 01:26:36,530
(It's food!)

2230
01:26:36,530 --> 01:26:38,060
(Dig in, chickens.)

2231
01:26:38,570 --> 01:26:40,700
(Thanks for the food.)

2232
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:42,700
We'll now cut the grass for the pig feed.

2233
01:26:42,700 --> 01:26:44,640
There is endless work.

2234
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:46,940
(Next is to cut the grass for the pigs.)

2235
01:26:47,540 --> 01:26:49,380
Si Eon is good at cooking.

2236
01:26:49,480 --> 01:26:50,640
Among us, he's the chef.

2237
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:51,640
(The chef and eldest)

2238
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:54,310
(Cutting)

2239
01:26:56,350 --> 01:26:57,650
It wasn't as easy as I thought.

2240
01:26:57,650 --> 01:26:59,990
(The grass won't cut.)

2241
01:26:59,990 --> 01:27:01,920
You have to cut it in one go.

2242
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:04,220
(Feeling awkward)

2243
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:06,230
(Shouting)

2244
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:07,560
(Shouting)

2245
01:27:09,130 --> 01:27:10,500
Simply going hard won't cut it.

2246
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:11,530
It's not about using strength.

2247
01:27:11,930 --> 01:27:12,930
It's not?

2248
01:27:13,330 --> 01:27:15,300
(Move.)

2249
01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:17,140
(Staring blankly)

2250
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:19,340
(It chops well, right?)

2251
01:27:19,340 --> 01:27:20,570
She's really good at it.

2252
01:27:20,970 --> 01:27:23,810
Okay. I'll try again.

2253
01:27:26,310 --> 01:27:28,980
(She's off to do another task alone.)

2254
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:32,120
(Adding water to the pig feed)

2255
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:35,360
I didn't know you added water to it.

2256
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:37,120
That's interesting.

2257
01:27:38,260 --> 01:27:39,260
(Give me food!)
They're even wagging their tails.

2258
01:27:41,390 --> 01:27:43,960
(Here's your food.)

2259
01:27:44,230 --> 01:27:45,930
(Me too.)

2260
01:27:45,930 --> 01:27:47,300
The pigs are digging in.

2261
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:48,400
Look at the baby.
(The food's smell drew the piglet in.)

2262
01:27:50,100 --> 01:27:51,900
(And...)

2263
01:27:52,740 --> 01:27:56,040
(the novice farmer pulls the grass.)

2264
01:27:56,340 --> 01:27:57,780
You're fast, Pani Bottle.

2265
01:27:57,780 --> 01:27:58,810
- Me?
- Yes.

2266
01:27:58,810 --> 01:27:59,810
But this is...

2267
01:28:00,650 --> 01:28:02,420
- You need to get the hang of it.
- True.

2268
01:28:02,420 --> 01:28:03,580
(They're doing well.)

2269
01:28:04,550 --> 01:28:07,750
(The experienced Farmer84...)

2270
01:28:07,750 --> 01:28:10,360
(and the novice farmer...)

2271
01:28:11,020 --> 01:28:13,390
(are both focused on farmwork.)

2272
01:28:13,390 --> 01:28:14,390
We're almost done.

2273
01:28:14,490 --> 01:28:16,030
- There are some over here.
- I found some here.

2274
01:28:16,030 --> 01:28:17,030
Okay.

2275
01:28:17,030 --> 01:28:18,670
Gosh, you worked a lot.

2276
01:28:19,270 --> 01:28:20,730
But you two work really fast.

2277
01:28:20,730 --> 01:28:21,870
She acknowledged them.

2278
01:28:22,070 --> 01:28:23,670
My family lives in the countryside.

2279
01:28:24,070 --> 01:28:26,740
If you two wish to work here,
I'm sure they'll accept you.

2280
01:28:27,110 --> 01:28:29,280
Probably... Right.

2281
01:28:30,380 --> 01:28:31,940
"Right?" He can't answer.

2282
01:28:32,350 --> 01:28:34,350
- The city is nice.
- Is the city nice?

2283
01:28:34,580 --> 01:28:35,720
How about a break?

2284
01:28:35,820 --> 01:28:37,480
- No.
- No.

2285
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:39,150
You don't have to ask if we're okay.

2286
01:28:39,590 --> 01:28:40,590
We'll take a break if needed.

2287
01:28:40,890 --> 01:28:42,190
(Okay.)

2288
01:28:42,190 --> 01:28:44,390
But won't you get tired easily
working in the sun?

2289
01:28:44,790 --> 01:28:46,460
We're fine so far.

2290
01:28:46,460 --> 01:28:47,460
(She's worried about the foreigners.)

2291
01:28:47,690 --> 01:28:50,830
You're very thoughtful.

2292
01:28:52,330 --> 01:28:53,500
But I didn't say anything.

2293
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:54,900
(Laughing)

2294
01:28:54,900 --> 01:28:56,500
Doing this alone must be tough.

2295
01:28:56,700 --> 01:28:58,140
- Jie is kind.
- Right?

2296
01:28:58,540 --> 01:28:59,540
She's pure.

2297
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:02,340
Jie was very considerate.

2298
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:05,210
We told her to order us around more.

2299
01:29:05,580 --> 01:29:08,550
We told her to make the most of us
while we were around...

2300
01:29:08,750 --> 01:29:10,550
since we had to leave around lunchtime.

2301
01:29:11,180 --> 01:29:13,990
But she kept asking,
"Are you okay? Are you not tired?"

2302
01:29:14,650 --> 01:29:15,860
"I'll do it."

2303
01:29:15,860 --> 01:29:16,890
(She cared about the brothers.)

2304
01:29:16,890 --> 01:29:19,760
I wanted to help her with the farmwork
as much as possible,

2305
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:22,700
but I couldn't. It was a shame.

2306
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:26,170
(But they have to leave again.)

2307
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:29,040
You worked a lot.

2308
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:31,570
The three of us got it done in no time.

2309
01:29:31,570 --> 01:29:32,940
(The brothers work with all their might.)

2310
01:29:32,940 --> 01:29:35,340
I'm sure she felt your sincerity.

2311
01:29:35,910 --> 01:29:37,880
- We're almost done.
- There are some over here.

2312
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:38,880
- Over here.
- I found some here.
Okay.

2313
01:29:40,580 --> 01:29:41,580
(Working hard until the end)

2314
01:29:41,580 --> 01:29:44,150
I couldn't just pretend.
I had to be of help.

2315
01:29:44,150 --> 01:29:46,890
Pani Bottle. Are you okay?

2316
01:29:46,990 --> 01:29:49,690
- Yes. Are you done?
- No.

2317
01:29:49,690 --> 01:29:50,990
(Passing by)

2318
01:29:50,990 --> 01:29:52,660
What is this?

2319
01:29:54,030 --> 01:29:55,860
- Lemon?
- How is a lemon that big?

2320
01:29:56,300 --> 01:29:57,560
Can I eat one of them?

2321
01:29:57,930 --> 01:29:58,930
(Yes, you can.)

2322
01:29:58,930 --> 01:30:02,070
To pick one,
you have to hit it with a rock.

2323
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:03,870
With a rock?

2324
01:30:03,870 --> 01:30:07,340
(They throw rocks at the lemon.)

2325
01:30:08,270 --> 01:30:10,080
- How do you pick it?
- Must you throw a rock at it?

2326
01:30:10,980 --> 01:30:12,750
(Look, foreigner.)

2327
01:30:18,150 --> 01:30:19,490
(Running)

2328
01:30:19,690 --> 01:30:20,690
(Cheering)

2329
01:30:21,390 --> 01:30:23,190
(He's forgotten about falling down.)

2330
01:30:23,190 --> 01:30:24,190
(Cheering)

2331
01:30:25,020 --> 01:30:27,390
(Rushing over to the lemons)

2332
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:29,200
(Ta-da)

2333
01:30:29,200 --> 01:30:30,230
Where did she go?

2334
01:30:30,230 --> 01:30:32,200
(I'm right here.)

2335
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:33,200
(Cheering)

2336
01:30:34,070 --> 01:30:36,170
(After picking up a lemon each,)

2337
01:30:36,170 --> 01:30:37,200
Those are fresh.

2338
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:38,700
(they're happy.)

2339
01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:39,710
Let's wrap it up.

2340
01:30:40,470 --> 01:30:42,580
(The three harvesting wheat
are almost done.)

2341
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:44,510
- Carry them up there?
- Okay.

2342
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:45,850
Carry them.

2343
01:30:47,550 --> 01:30:49,150
So you must carry the wheat.

2344
01:30:49,750 --> 01:30:50,750
Is this enough?

2345
01:30:50,750 --> 01:30:52,120
(Carrying an armful of harvested wheat)

2346
01:30:53,290 --> 01:30:55,490
(They walk up.)

2347
01:30:55,490 --> 01:30:58,120
All I could think of was
how this was a one-time experience for us,

2348
01:30:58,120 --> 01:30:59,860
- True.
- but it was a daily task for them.

2349
01:30:59,860 --> 01:31:00,860
(Transferring them to the workplace)

2350
01:31:00,860 --> 01:31:02,630
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2351
01:31:02,630 --> 01:31:04,130
(Going back again)

2352
01:31:04,660 --> 01:31:05,870
(Shocked)

2353
01:31:07,700 --> 01:31:08,730
What a big load.

2354
01:31:08,730 --> 01:31:12,100
They're carrying at least 3 to 4 times
more than we did.

2355
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:14,340
These people are workers.

2356
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:15,710
(The people carry a load.)

2357
01:31:15,940 --> 01:31:19,450
The weight is one thing,
but finding the balance must be tough.

2358
01:31:19,450 --> 01:31:20,480
(Staring)

2359
01:31:21,150 --> 01:31:22,620
She's on YouTube while working.

2360
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:25,480
- While working?
- While working?

2361
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:26,750
- Really?
- What?

2362
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:28,390
That's cool.

2363
01:31:28,390 --> 01:31:30,260
(Even the YouTuber
with 2 million subscribers is surprised.)

2364
01:31:30,690 --> 01:31:32,730
- Goodness.
- That's practically a stunt.

2365
01:31:33,990 --> 01:31:34,990
It's a talent show.

2366
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:39,670
(Wrapping up after seeing a rare sight)

2367
01:31:40,370 --> 01:31:42,540
- I'll do it.
- What?

2368
01:31:42,700 --> 01:31:44,440
- Put them in here.
- We'll help.

2369
01:31:45,340 --> 01:31:46,710
Jie. I'll do it.

2370
01:31:47,270 --> 01:31:49,840
I'll do it. Why won't you let us help?

2371
01:31:51,610 --> 01:31:53,410
- Brother.
- Yes?

2372
01:31:53,410 --> 01:31:55,110
Yes. Give them to me.

2373
01:31:55,110 --> 01:31:56,980
Yes, Kian84.

2374
01:31:56,980 --> 01:31:58,120
(Working hard)

2375
01:31:58,120 --> 01:32:01,220
It might fall. Give some to me.

2376
01:32:01,750 --> 01:32:02,790
She must've warmed up to them.

2377
01:32:02,790 --> 01:32:04,490
- Yes.
- Right? She even joked around.

2378
01:32:04,590 --> 01:32:05,790
You're amazing.

2379
01:32:06,790 --> 01:32:09,300
(Off he goes.)

2380
01:32:09,930 --> 01:32:13,070
(The little brother is leaving first.)

2381
01:32:13,370 --> 01:32:15,870
She felt bad about asking us for help.

2382
01:32:16,170 --> 01:32:18,800
(I'll help too.)

2383
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:19,870
Okay.

2384
01:32:19,870 --> 01:32:21,540
(They work together and fill a basket.)

2385
01:32:21,540 --> 01:32:22,640
This is not much.

2386
01:32:23,710 --> 01:32:26,410
Jie felt bad and wanted to carry it.

2387
01:32:26,410 --> 01:32:27,410
(Following the big brother)

2388
01:32:27,410 --> 01:32:30,650
Jie. I'll carry it.

2389
01:32:31,180 --> 01:32:32,180
Okay.

2390
01:32:33,320 --> 01:32:35,150
(She calls her brother,)

2391
01:32:35,150 --> 01:32:37,690
(but she might remember him as a worker.)

2392
01:32:37,990 --> 01:32:39,660
(Leave it to us.)

2393
01:32:39,660 --> 01:32:40,660
(Reliable)

2394
01:32:40,660 --> 01:32:41,830
In the scorching sun?

2395
01:32:41,830 --> 01:32:43,760
- Right? They had it tough.
- For real.

2396
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:45,630
You guys are the best brothers.

2397
01:32:47,300 --> 01:32:49,100
(Thanks to the brothers, work has ended.)

2398
01:32:49,100 --> 01:32:50,100
Really?

2399
01:32:50,570 --> 01:32:52,840
- Are we off to lunch now?
- Yes.

2400
01:32:55,410 --> 01:32:57,580
I wanted to help a bit more.

2401
01:32:58,980 --> 01:33:00,610
(This brother is bummed out.)

2402
01:33:00,610 --> 01:33:01,610
What a bummer.

2403
01:33:02,210 --> 01:33:04,650
It would've taken some time alone.

2404
01:33:04,980 --> 01:33:06,750
- It ended early because we helped.
- Right?

2405
01:33:06,850 --> 01:33:08,650
- You were of great help.
- Exactly.

2406
01:33:08,920 --> 01:33:10,920
While we were working,

2407
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:14,690
Jie kindly mentioned that
the work ended early, thanks to our help.

2408
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,530
It's that.

2409
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:20,130
- The cafeteria.
- You're right.

2410
01:33:20,130 --> 01:33:21,430
- Where you eat snacks.
- Where?

2411
01:33:21,630 --> 01:33:22,870
Over there, where the pavilion is.

2412
01:33:22,870 --> 01:33:24,670
- The rest area?
- What amazing scenery.

2413
01:33:25,940 --> 01:33:26,940
Look at the view.

2414
01:33:26,940 --> 01:33:28,870
The camera isn't doing any justice.

2415
01:33:29,710 --> 01:33:31,580
Do the mothers bring lunch over?

2416
01:33:32,410 --> 01:33:34,250
They must make lunch here. Right?

2417
01:33:35,210 --> 01:33:37,280
(They arrive at the pavilion for lunch.)

2418
01:33:38,380 --> 01:33:40,820
Everything tastes better after working.

2419
01:33:41,850 --> 01:33:43,290
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2420
01:33:43,490 --> 01:33:44,590
(No problem.)

2421
01:33:44,590 --> 01:33:45,860
Thank you for the food, ma'am.

2422
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:47,860
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

2423
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:52,500
We make this dish when guests come over.

2424
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:55,530
It's fermented fish soup.

2425
01:33:55,530 --> 01:33:56,940
It's a traditional dish.

2426
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:58,600
It smells like sundae soup.

2427
01:33:59,240 --> 01:34:00,870
(Drinking)

2428
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:03,040
(Amazed)

2429
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:05,140
- It tastes like seonji soup.
- Why do I smell salted seafood?

2430
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:06,750
Try this.

2431
01:34:07,980 --> 01:34:10,120
It's dried meat, so it's very chewy.

2432
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:12,520
(Eating a bite-sized piece)

2433
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:13,520
Isn't it fat?

2434
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:14,550
(It's great.)

2435
01:34:14,650 --> 01:34:15,720
Is it good?

2436
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:16,720
It's good.

2437
01:34:17,490 --> 01:34:19,390
You must eat a lot
after all that hard work.

2438
01:34:19,830 --> 01:34:21,560
The energy comes from food.

2439
01:34:22,060 --> 01:34:23,200
How is this dish?

2440
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:26,770
(Plump Chinese sausages)

2441
01:34:27,130 --> 01:34:30,500
There's a similar Korean dish
called sundae.

2442
01:34:30,500 --> 01:34:31,500
So it's good.

2443
01:34:32,100 --> 01:34:33,310
It's full of fat.

2444
01:34:33,410 --> 01:34:35,810
When does work end today? At 6 p.m.?

2445
01:34:35,940 --> 01:34:39,180
We're going to head down the mountain
at 6 p.m.

2446
01:34:39,410 --> 01:34:41,950
We're going to finish what we couldn't
in the afternoon.

2447
01:34:42,420 --> 01:34:43,920
(Amazed)

2448
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:45,380
It must be tough every day.

2449
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:48,320
How long do you farm a year?

2450
01:34:48,790 --> 01:34:53,090
We farm for about six months.

2451
01:34:53,460 --> 01:34:54,530
What do you do for the other six months?

2452
01:34:55,430 --> 01:34:59,230
We do other tasks like today.

2453
01:34:59,230 --> 01:35:00,300
So work never ends.

2454
01:35:01,730 --> 01:35:03,570
By the way, this is our last meal here.

2455
01:35:04,340 --> 01:35:06,770
We would've stayed to help
into the evening...

2456
01:35:06,770 --> 01:35:08,310
if it weren't for our next plans.

2457
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:10,140
Where are you going?

2458
01:35:10,680 --> 01:35:13,580
We're heading to Shangri-La after lunch.

2459
01:35:13,910 --> 01:35:15,480
It's to pray to Buddha.

2460
01:35:16,120 --> 01:35:17,550
(I see.)

2461
01:35:17,550 --> 01:35:18,620
I'll also pray...

2462
01:35:19,220 --> 01:35:20,890
for your well-being.

2463
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:24,520
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2464
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:27,630
I wonder if we'll be able to meet again.

2465
01:35:28,190 --> 01:35:30,860
You can visit again.

2466
01:35:30,860 --> 01:35:31,960
Are you not coming back?

2467
01:35:31,960 --> 01:35:34,470
- How about you visit us?
- Us? You should visit us.

2468
01:35:34,870 --> 01:35:35,940
Us?

2469
01:35:36,470 --> 01:35:38,500
To Korea.

2470
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:41,910
If I get the chance,
I'd love to visit Korea.

2471
01:35:42,140 --> 01:35:43,640
Are you on social media?

2472
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:45,850
- I am.
- Nice.

2473
01:35:46,710 --> 01:35:49,350
- Your ID.
- ID?

2474
01:35:49,650 --> 01:35:50,920
Here's what I find interesting.

2475
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:53,350
You met Porpi for a day, right?

2476
01:35:53,650 --> 01:35:55,590
I found it strange...

2477
01:35:55,820 --> 01:35:58,060
how you acted like besties with Porpi.

2478
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:00,960
- I felt something with Porpi.
- Kian84.

2479
01:36:01,660 --> 01:36:04,530
I've never had such an experience before.

2480
01:36:04,530 --> 01:36:05,630
- It's my first time.
- Right.

2481
01:36:05,970 --> 01:36:08,570
- But now, I get it.
- Right?

2482
01:36:08,900 --> 01:36:12,170
I feel sad having to say goodbye.
It was the same with the Gurkhas.

2483
01:36:12,170 --> 01:36:14,470
We have to leave
just when we're about to become friends.

2484
01:36:15,510 --> 01:36:18,510
It would've hit me even harder
if we had stayed another day.

2485
01:36:20,780 --> 01:36:22,410
It was quite a shame.

2486
01:36:23,180 --> 01:36:25,280
You can't help but feel that way
when you meet...

2487
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:26,820
- good people while traveling.
- Right?

2488
01:36:26,820 --> 01:36:29,390
- "Will we ever meet again?"
- Even by coincidence.

2489
01:36:29,390 --> 01:36:30,420
Always at the end.

2490
01:36:31,120 --> 01:36:34,030
These two are the definition
of kind people.

2491
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:38,060
Actually, this is a secret.

2492
01:36:38,430 --> 01:36:39,530
(Hesitating)

2493
01:36:39,530 --> 01:36:40,600
What is it?

2494
01:36:40,730 --> 01:36:41,770
Do you know BTS?

2495
01:36:42,100 --> 01:36:44,400
- Seriously?
- He's going to bring up Jin.

2496
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:46,910
- Well, they are young girls.
- Right.

2497
01:36:48,470 --> 01:36:49,480
Do you know BTS?

2498
01:36:49,610 --> 01:36:50,680
BTS?

2499
01:36:51,010 --> 01:36:53,810
- BTS?
- So they don't know.

2500
01:36:53,810 --> 01:36:54,880
They don't.

2501
01:36:55,810 --> 01:36:57,320
Do you know G-DRAGON?

2502
01:36:58,050 --> 01:36:59,720
I really like him.

2503
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:02,020
- Really?
- He's friends with G-DRAGON.

2504
01:37:02,150 --> 01:37:03,160
He's friends with G-DRAGON.

2505
01:37:03,160 --> 01:37:04,760
(Really?)

2506
01:37:04,760 --> 01:37:06,330
That's right. I'm friends with G-DRAGON.

2507
01:37:06,330 --> 01:37:07,760
- Really?
- Of course.

2508
01:37:09,660 --> 01:37:11,260
Shall I prove it?

2509
01:37:12,570 --> 01:37:14,730
- They're excited. Show them.
- Let's see.

2510
01:37:15,030 --> 01:37:16,070
Give me a second.

2511
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:19,140
(Hesitating)

2512
01:37:19,140 --> 01:37:22,640
I'm sorry, G-DRAGON.
I know we're not that close yet.

2513
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:24,510
But...

2514
01:37:25,480 --> 01:37:27,750
I'm using you. I'm sorry.

2515
01:37:28,310 --> 01:37:29,880
- Where is he?
- Do you have a photo together?

2516
01:37:30,180 --> 01:37:32,080
- They were on the same show.
- This is....

2517
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:33,350
(Kian84 wants to know
everything about G-DRAGON.)

2518
01:37:33,350 --> 01:37:35,490
- What is that?
- It's not a photo taken together?

2519
01:37:35,850 --> 01:37:37,320
I don't have a photo
of just the two of us.

2520
01:37:38,920 --> 01:37:40,390
- Look at the article.
- "I'll be on my way."

2521
01:37:40,390 --> 01:37:42,260
"One call, and I'll be on my way."

2522
01:37:42,630 --> 01:37:44,630
It says "true fan spirit" at the end.

2523
01:37:45,700 --> 01:37:47,570
That means you two aren't friends.

2524
01:37:47,570 --> 01:37:49,240
He is, if I think of him as a friend.

2525
01:37:51,140 --> 01:37:52,200
(That's amazing.)

2526
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:53,910
It must still be fascinating to them.

2527
01:37:54,570 --> 01:37:56,240
- Give him a call.
- A call?

2528
01:37:56,410 --> 01:37:58,410
- Give G-DRAGON a call.
- He's busy.

2529
01:37:58,840 --> 01:38:00,150
Come on. Give G-DRAGON a call.

2530
01:38:00,310 --> 01:38:01,380
(Grabbing)

2531
01:38:01,380 --> 01:38:02,410
G-DRAGON?

2532
01:38:02,780 --> 01:38:03,980
(Excited)

2533
01:38:05,080 --> 01:38:06,090
(Putting down)

2534
01:38:06,490 --> 01:38:07,620
I don't have his number.

2535
01:38:09,860 --> 01:38:12,120
- Then you two aren't friends.
- Are you serious?

2536
01:38:12,120 --> 01:38:13,230
It's a true fan spirit.

2537
01:38:14,290 --> 01:38:15,960
I'm something like a mule.

2538
01:38:17,560 --> 01:38:18,730
Is he your owner?

2539
01:38:18,730 --> 01:38:19,770
(Laughing)

2540
01:38:20,130 --> 01:38:21,200
Owner G-DRAGON.

2541
01:38:21,470 --> 01:38:23,640
(Are you well, master?)

2542
01:38:23,640 --> 01:38:26,070
You know real besties
don't call each other, right?

2543
01:38:26,770 --> 01:38:28,910
So you are friends with G-DRAGON?

2544
01:38:28,910 --> 01:38:30,610
You must really like him.

2545
01:38:30,980 --> 01:38:32,650
(You caught me.)

2546
01:38:32,650 --> 01:38:34,050
- Really?
- I've never seen this expression before.

2547
01:38:34,050 --> 01:38:36,580
For real, this is the first time
I've seen her smile.

2548
01:38:36,580 --> 01:38:38,250
- She’s the brightest I’ve seen today.
- Right?

2549
01:38:38,650 --> 01:38:41,620
You never once smiled yesterday or today
when we helped.

2550
01:38:42,020 --> 01:38:43,720
- She was all smiles.
- I can tell.

2551
01:38:43,720 --> 01:38:45,060
She never smiled while we were helping.

2552
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:48,260
My self-esteem hits rock bottom
whenever I do this.

2553
01:38:48,430 --> 01:38:50,000
- Why do you keep doing it?
- What?

2554
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,800
Because I have nothing to show off.

2555
01:38:52,060 --> 01:38:53,330
Why are you trying to show off?

2556
01:38:53,330 --> 01:38:54,730
(Feeling bitter)

2557
01:38:54,730 --> 01:38:56,300
We'll get going now.

2558
01:38:56,570 --> 01:38:57,570
Are you leaving now?

2559
01:38:57,570 --> 01:38:58,640
We should.

2560
01:38:58,640 --> 01:39:00,840
Guys. As the big uncle,

2561
01:39:01,240 --> 01:39:02,410
I'd like to give this to you.

2562
01:39:02,410 --> 01:39:04,440
- The bracelet?
- The silver bracelet?

2563
01:39:04,940 --> 01:39:06,950
- No.
- No.

2564
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:08,650
(We're okay, Big Uncle.)

2565
01:39:09,750 --> 01:39:12,350
It's like, "It's not my style."

2566
01:39:12,890 --> 01:39:15,050
- Their expressions look so real.
- They don't need it.

2567
01:39:15,050 --> 01:39:16,720
But they looked so happy
talking about G-DRAGON.

2568
01:39:17,490 --> 01:39:18,820
(Feeling embarrassed)

2569
01:39:19,430 --> 01:39:21,330
(I'd like to give this bracelet to you.)

2570
01:39:21,730 --> 01:39:23,630
(Gesture of refusal)

2571
01:39:23,630 --> 01:39:25,630
Can we take a photo
instead of receiving that gift?

2572
01:39:25,630 --> 01:39:27,830
- Sure.
- All they want is a photo.

2573
01:39:28,730 --> 01:39:30,540
- How pure-hearted.
- I better go here.

2574
01:39:30,640 --> 01:39:32,870
- Okay.
- G-DRAGON!

2575
01:39:32,870 --> 01:39:34,170
- What?
- "G-DRAGON?"

2576
01:39:34,170 --> 01:39:35,240
(My owner)

2577
01:39:35,240 --> 01:39:37,010
(Together with the Xiaomi sisters)

2578
01:39:37,010 --> 01:39:38,380
That's a nice memory right there.

2579
01:39:39,380 --> 01:39:40,450
Take a photo with the two.

2580
01:39:40,710 --> 01:39:41,950
Okay. One, two.

2581
01:39:43,950 --> 01:39:46,590
Will they ever meet again?

2582
01:39:47,390 --> 01:39:49,250
How about... Here.

2583
01:39:50,590 --> 01:39:52,930
These are power banks.
I think they'll need it.

2584
01:39:53,390 --> 01:39:54,430
That's a great idea.

2585
01:39:54,430 --> 01:39:56,830
- I made them.
- They work outside all day long.

2586
01:39:57,560 --> 01:39:58,860
(It's okay.)

2587
01:39:58,860 --> 01:40:00,530
- I've got more.
- No.

2588
01:40:00,530 --> 01:40:02,770
- I've got more.
- He makes them.

2589
01:40:02,770 --> 01:40:04,740
I made them. I'm the CEO.

2590
01:40:04,900 --> 01:40:07,410
- He's got tons of them at home.
- Thank you.

2591
01:40:07,410 --> 01:40:08,470
Even though they refused the bracelet.

2592
01:40:09,270 --> 01:40:10,410
- Leave them here.
- Thank you.

2593
01:40:12,410 --> 01:40:13,480
Then...

2594
01:40:13,480 --> 01:40:15,250
(This too?)

2595
01:40:16,010 --> 01:40:17,050
No.

2596
01:40:19,150 --> 01:40:20,150
Give it to me. I'll take it.

2597
01:40:20,950 --> 01:40:22,320
She appreciates the gesture.

2598
01:40:23,360 --> 01:40:25,920
I wanted to give them the bracelet
since yesterday.

2599
01:40:27,460 --> 01:40:28,560
(He tried since yesterday.)

2600
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:30,060
How warmhearted of him.

2601
01:40:31,430 --> 01:40:32,930
(Turning down flatly)

2602
01:40:33,270 --> 01:40:35,130
Why won't they accept mine?

2603
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,440
They accepted the power bank right away.

2604
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:38,600
(Thank you.)

2605
01:40:39,470 --> 01:40:41,710
(How upsetting.)

2606
01:40:41,710 --> 01:40:44,310
I thought they were a minority group
that didn't accept gifts.

2607
01:40:44,710 --> 01:40:47,050
How can there be a minority group
that doesn't accept gifts?

2608
01:40:47,610 --> 01:40:49,920
(No gifts!)

2609
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:50,920
They were like that.

2610
01:40:51,550 --> 01:40:53,350
I thought it was their culture.

2611
01:40:53,790 --> 01:40:55,090
"Thank you for the power banks."

2612
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:57,720
Si Eon wanted to gift them something.

2613
01:40:57,920 --> 01:40:59,660
(Warmhearted)

2614
01:41:00,060 --> 01:41:01,090
Their desire to help...

2615
01:41:01,590 --> 01:41:04,230
their parents at such a young age...

2616
01:41:04,660 --> 01:41:07,930
and to preserve
their village's traditions...

2617
01:41:08,370 --> 01:41:09,940
was truly admirable.

2618
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:12,440
They reminded me of myself at their age.

2619
01:41:13,270 --> 01:41:14,940
I started drinking at 5 p.m.

2620
01:41:15,540 --> 01:41:17,810
I drank until 1 p.m. the next day.

2621
01:41:17,810 --> 01:41:18,810
(The young Eon who used to drink)

2622
01:41:18,940 --> 01:41:20,880
(Laughing)

2623
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:21,910
They're admirable.

2624
01:41:22,550 --> 01:41:24,180
They're amazing people.

2625
01:41:24,950 --> 01:41:28,290
It was a bummer that
we only stayed overnight.

2626
01:41:28,790 --> 01:41:30,790
Experiencing a different culture...

2627
01:41:30,790 --> 01:41:32,890
that exceeded my expectations...

2628
01:41:33,060 --> 01:41:35,190
for any country...

2629
01:41:35,530 --> 01:41:36,630
was truly fascinating.

2630
01:41:37,900 --> 01:41:39,830
There are things you can enjoy
only at that age.

2631
01:41:40,370 --> 01:41:41,600
But all they do is work.

2632
01:41:42,770 --> 01:41:45,070
They go to work at 7:30 a.m.,

2633
01:41:45,070 --> 01:41:47,210
farm until 6 p.m.,

2634
01:41:47,570 --> 01:41:48,710
and then return to rest.

2635
01:41:48,710 --> 01:41:50,280
(The Xiaomi sisters kept smiling.)

2636
01:41:50,280 --> 01:41:52,850
Living in that village
while doing such demanding work...

2637
01:41:52,850 --> 01:41:54,210
without a break...

2638
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:55,950
is both praiseworthy...

2639
01:41:56,820 --> 01:41:57,880
and admirable.

2640
01:41:58,320 --> 01:41:59,490
They made me reflect a lot.

2641
01:42:00,350 --> 01:42:01,690
I enjoyed my time here.

2642
01:42:02,020 --> 01:42:06,530
Thank you for helping us with our work.

2643
01:42:06,530 --> 01:42:11,330
It's a shame you have to leave so early.

2644
01:42:11,560 --> 01:42:12,630
Exactly.

2645
01:42:13,670 --> 01:42:15,930
Since we're heading to Shangri-La,

2646
01:42:15,930 --> 01:42:18,100
we'll also pray for your well-being.

2647
01:42:18,970 --> 01:42:21,570
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2648
01:42:21,570 --> 01:42:24,640
- Be happy. Take care.
- Bye.

2649
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:26,280
- Meet a nice guy.
- Bye.

2650
01:42:27,180 --> 01:42:31,880
- Bye.
- Bye.

2651
01:42:32,150 --> 01:42:33,790
(Bye.)

2652
01:42:34,020 --> 01:42:36,860
I didn't know I'd feel such emotions
during that brief encounter.

2653
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:39,790
It ended just as I was starting
to get the hang of the job.

2654
01:42:39,890 --> 01:42:41,930
Had we worked together...

2655
01:42:42,460 --> 01:42:44,930
a few more days,
we'd have gotten used to it.

2656
01:42:44,930 --> 01:42:47,000
She wants us to stay. I feel bad.

2657
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,470
- Right? They look sad.
- Yes.

2658
01:42:49,470 --> 01:42:51,140
- I was sad too.
- Even yesterday.

2659
01:42:52,540 --> 01:42:56,440
(To keep the momentary encounter forever,)

2660
01:42:57,110 --> 01:43:00,880
(the precious people
welcomed them warmly.)

2661
01:43:01,450 --> 01:43:02,610
(They realized
what they didn't know before.)

2662
01:43:02,610 --> 01:43:03,680
Pani Bottle's love.

2663
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:05,920
(People showed affection
without ignoring.)

2664
01:43:06,220 --> 01:43:11,220
(And today,
they became friends by sweating together.)

2665
01:43:12,320 --> 01:43:13,790
(Although they have to say goodbye...)

2666
01:43:13,790 --> 01:43:15,060
Take care.

2667
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:16,160
Bye.

2668
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:18,200
Be happy. Take care.

2669
01:43:18,200 --> 01:43:19,260
(It'll be remembered for a long time.)

2670
01:43:19,260 --> 01:43:20,270
That's heartwarming.

2671
01:43:20,500 --> 01:43:22,630
I always went to meet the locals alone.

2672
01:43:22,630 --> 01:43:24,100
It was nice to go there together.

2673
01:43:24,540 --> 01:43:28,010
After the journey,
I kept in touch with her...

2674
01:43:28,010 --> 01:43:29,010
via social media.
Really?

2675
01:43:30,010 --> 01:43:31,380
She kept asking me...

2676
01:43:31,380 --> 01:43:32,740
if I was going to visit again.

2677
01:43:32,740 --> 01:43:33,810
(Your life is amazing. My respect.)

2678
01:43:33,810 --> 01:43:34,850
(Thank you. Come again.)

2679
01:43:34,850 --> 01:43:36,110
(Can I work more next time?)

2680
01:43:36,110 --> 01:43:37,480
(Do you want to work a lot?)

2681
01:43:37,480 --> 01:43:38,850
(Yes. It was fun.)

2682
01:43:38,850 --> 01:43:41,520
If I get a chance to visit China again,

2683
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:44,360
- I want to help them.
- Yes.

2684
01:43:44,890 --> 01:43:46,290
We'll set off now.

2685
01:43:46,530 --> 01:43:47,690
Hey, Pani Bottle.

2686
01:43:48,130 --> 01:43:51,000
You were farming all day,
and now you're driving.

2687
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:52,330
It's one job after another.

2688
01:43:52,330 --> 01:43:53,570
It's time to be a mule.

2689
01:43:53,570 --> 01:43:55,700
Our last destination is Shangri-La.

2690
01:43:55,700 --> 01:43:57,040
To the last destination.

2691
01:43:57,040 --> 01:43:58,340
Shangri-La.

2692
01:43:58,500 --> 01:43:59,970
I can't wait.

2693
01:44:00,210 --> 01:44:01,240
The weather is nice.

2694
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:04,940
- The weather is so nice.
- Nice.

2695
01:44:04,940 --> 01:44:06,910
(Off to Shangri-La with expectations)

2696
01:44:07,250 --> 01:44:08,810
(Looking around)

2697
01:44:09,820 --> 01:44:10,820
What is this?

2698
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:17,660
What's wrong?

2699
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:19,730
- What's going on?
- I know.

2700
01:44:19,860 --> 01:44:21,790
It seems the road is blocked.

2701
01:44:21,790 --> 01:44:22,790
(Getting out of the car
to check the situation)

2702
01:44:22,790 --> 01:44:24,300
They didn't move...

2703
01:44:24,300 --> 01:44:26,230
- for about 20 minutes.
- They just stopped there.

2704
01:44:26,230 --> 01:44:27,370
We decided to get out of the car.

2705
01:44:29,330 --> 01:44:30,940
- What? Is there an accident?
- What's going on?

2706
01:44:30,940 --> 01:44:33,970
(The road is congested.)

2707
01:44:35,940 --> 01:44:37,580
(On the other side)

2708
01:44:37,580 --> 01:44:38,640
What's going on?

2709
01:44:38,640 --> 01:44:40,280
(On the other side)

2710
01:44:41,580 --> 01:44:42,680
(Two cars have stopped
in the middle of the road.)

2711
01:44:42,680 --> 01:44:44,120
Because the road isn't very good.

2712
01:44:44,120 --> 01:44:45,450
What are you going to do?

2713
01:44:45,450 --> 01:44:47,050
(Two cars have stopped
in the middle of the road.)

2714
01:44:48,120 --> 01:44:49,320
Something wrong?

2715
01:44:49,450 --> 01:44:50,490
Yes.

2716
01:44:50,760 --> 01:44:53,090
The car broke down while coming up.

2717
01:44:53,830 --> 01:44:56,730
That blue car went down to pull the car.

2718
01:44:56,730 --> 01:44:57,730
(The broken car)

2719
01:44:58,260 --> 01:45:00,730
There are cars lined up. What now?

2720
01:45:00,730 --> 01:45:02,230
Because I was driving,

2721
01:45:02,230 --> 01:45:04,100
the other guys said
they'd go check on the situation.

2722
01:45:04,100 --> 01:45:05,870
- I was waiting in the car.
- I see.

2723
01:45:07,140 --> 01:45:09,110
(Trying to pull the car from behind)

2724
01:45:11,740 --> 01:45:12,980
Oh, no. It's spinning with no traction.

2725
01:45:12,980 --> 01:45:13,980
(The wheels are spinning
with no traction.)

2726
01:45:14,480 --> 01:45:16,720
- Let's push the car.
- Push the car together. Yes.

2727
01:45:16,720 --> 01:45:18,920
If the car moves back,
make sure to get out.

2728
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:21,820
- Go.
- One, two...

2729
01:45:21,820 --> 01:45:24,120
One, two, three!

2730
01:45:26,120 --> 01:45:28,430
It happened to be uphill.

2731
01:45:28,430 --> 01:45:29,460
I know.

2732
01:45:29,460 --> 01:45:30,530
Gosh.

2733
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:32,000
Push the car.

2734
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:33,470
(They push the car
with all their might again.)

2735
01:45:39,300 --> 01:45:40,410
It's not working.

2736
01:45:45,240 --> 01:45:46,410
What do we do?

2737
01:45:48,710 --> 01:45:50,920
It's not easy until the last journey.

2738
01:45:52,450 --> 01:45:54,820
(The road to Shangri-La is blocked.)

2739
01:45:54,820 --> 01:45:56,390
What if you can't go?

2740
01:45:57,520 --> 01:46:02,390
(Will they be able to reach
their last destination?)

2741
01:46:10,100 --> 01:46:11,640
(The last destination
in the Tea Horse Road trip)

2742
01:46:12,400 --> 01:46:14,040
(Shangri-La)

2743
01:46:14,240 --> 01:46:16,210
(With his passion
for the five-point prostration,)

2744
01:46:16,440 --> 01:46:18,880
(the Three Brothers kept asking around.)

2745
01:46:19,480 --> 01:46:23,380
(They got to the monk village by asking.)

2746
01:46:23,380 --> 01:46:24,380
Wait. What is that?

2747
01:46:24,380 --> 01:46:25,920
(Isn't that the five-point prostration?)

2748
01:46:26,180 --> 01:46:29,250
(Just walking itself is
already tough enough.)

2749
01:46:29,590 --> 01:46:31,390
(The oldest does his best
because he knows how tough it is.)

2750
01:46:31,590 --> 01:46:32,590
(So I'm going to do it in a suit.)

2751
01:46:32,590 --> 01:46:34,690
(I should wear washed clothes tomorrow.)

2752
01:46:35,030 --> 01:46:36,090
(How about taking a shower?)

2753
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:38,430
(They visit the natural hot spring
to take a bath.)

2754
01:46:38,430 --> 01:46:39,870
(I love it.)

2755
01:46:39,870 --> 01:46:41,970
(There are cigarette butts
in the changing room.)

2756
01:46:42,270 --> 01:46:44,900
(Is sulfur supposed to be this soft?)

2757
01:46:45,140 --> 01:46:46,470
(Does that matter?)

2758
01:46:46,740 --> 01:46:48,710
(As long as we have fun.)

2759
01:46:49,210 --> 01:46:51,880
(They set off for the five-point
prostration in a clean state.)

2760
01:46:51,880 --> 01:46:53,880
(With a wish in mind,)

2761
01:46:54,410 --> 01:46:56,580
(they get prepared thoroughly.)

2762
01:46:57,350 --> 01:46:59,120
(I was immersed.)

2763
01:46:59,680 --> 01:47:01,520
(When the five-point prostration is over,)

2764
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:03,190
(Adventure by Accident is also over.)

2765
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:06,830
(The end of the trip is getting near.)

2766
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:11,060
(They get it off their chests
because it's the end.)

2767
01:47:11,430 --> 01:47:15,130
(The end of the laborious story)

2768
01:47:16,270 --> 01:47:18,400
(On the last line of the fifth page,)

2769
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:22,910
(what kind of story will be written?)

2770
01:47:22,910 --> 01:47:25,180
(Adventure by Accident 4)
