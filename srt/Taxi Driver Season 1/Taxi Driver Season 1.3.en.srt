I recently heard that you forgave murderer
Oh Chul Young and contacted you.

3
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:55,710
That's not an easy thing to do.

4
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,760
How did you let go of the hatred
and come to forgive him?

5
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,400
I'd like to put that process into our program.

6
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,980
I think your story will be
comforting to people.

7

It will be tough for you, but

8
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,350
may I ask you what happened at the time?

9
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,180
Yes.

10
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:16,260
That day was...

11
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,350
[December 2001]
a Saturday. Yes.

12
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,590
I called my parents all afternoon, but

13
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,280
they didn't answer the phone. So...

14
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,760
I stopped by in the evening.

15
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,640
I rang the bell in front of the house.

16
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,090
But no matter how many times I rang,
they wouldn't answer.

17
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,430
The lights were all off in the house.

18
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,410
So I climbed over the wall.

19
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,200
And I came in...

20
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,460
and when I turned on the light...

21
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,280

23
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,830
My parents aren't the types of
people who'd harm others.

24
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:58,350
They wouldn't have any grudges
against them, either.

25
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,960
So I don't know why he'd do that to them...

26
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,830
I was so frustrated...

27
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,790
Those fish were here then, too.

28
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,040
I asked those fish.

29
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,750
"Didn't you see what happened?"

30
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,710
"Who and why did he do that?"

31
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:16,790
The murderer Oh Chul Young was
arrested after ten months.

32
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:17,710
Yes.

33
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,940
How did you feel when
you heard the news...

34
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,240
I wanted to kill him.

35
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,700
I wanted to grind him up and eat him.

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,310
But I can't do anything.

37
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:31,410
I was dying because of that powerlessness.

38
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,570
So I decided to die.

39
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,200
I was getting rid of things, so I can die.

40
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,060
But I just couldn't get over him.

41
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,540
So I thought, "If I can't kill him,
let me forgive him."

42
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,590
But I don't know if it's God's will or what.

44
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:59,400
the death in my heart started to dissipate.

45
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:06,140
I started thinking that I should
go on living, shamelessly.

Excuse me. Let me ask you something.

The first thing you
should've done was...

to park it inside the lines properly
