And finally, I get to meet the prosecutor on the case.

328
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:12,480
When will you press charges?

329
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,900
Team Leader Park Dong Pil.

330
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,410
Nice to meet you. I'm Kang Ha Na.

331
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:19,910
I won't press charges without a body.

332
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:22,820
Goo Young Tae is the killer.

333
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:25,820
I'll find the evidence somehow.

334
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:28,130
Do you think a trial is a gamble?

335
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:29,840
What if you don't find evidence?

336
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,920
Don't you know things get tougher if he gets a not guilty verdict?

337
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,720
Are you that afraid of it?

338
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,070
What did you say?

339
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:37,250
I'm sure prosecutors want to take on a case they can win.

340
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:39,310
That's how you'll be labeled a capable prosecutor.

341
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:42,080
That's why you're not pressing charges. Am I wrong?

342
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,400
A person who can't find evidence shouldn't be lecturing me.

343
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,990
I don't need anything else.

344
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:51,040
We just have to figure out how he destroyed the body.

345
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,900
Then it would be solved.

346
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:55,160
I will not change stand.

347
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,950
I'll never press charges without a body.

348
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:59,760
If you want to get Goo Young Tae, find the victim somehow.

349
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,250
Don't you consider the victim's family?

350
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:05,430
We couldn't even press charges, yet we let him go.

351
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:07,980
How would they feel?

352
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:12,250
I'll speak to them.

353

354
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:18,410

- Let's go and grab some coffee.
- Inspector...

- But still...

357
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,940
we have a process here. Let's not do this and

358
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,990
- to press charges-
- How could we work this way?

359
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:29,660
Geez, let's go out and talk openly outside over coffee.

360
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,980
How can I help you?

We're from Seoul Northern District Prosecutors' Office.

No, that's not it.

He's out right now.

If you tell me your story, I'll listen.

369
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:45,950
I have a son.

370
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:49,400
I'm not saying this because he's my son, but

371
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:53,810
he is such a kind-hearted kid.

372

- Are you finished?
- Yes.

373

You're early.

Aren't you eating?

- I'll help you.
- Why did you come?

376
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:11,600
- It's okay.
- I'll do it. Sit down.

377
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,360
Perhaps that is why...

378
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:18,060
He met a girl who is just as kind as he is.

379
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:23,350
- Stay seated.
- Okay.

They look so good together.

My son works in architecture.

385
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:56,200
I heard Hae Eun knows a lot of people, so she helped him a lot.

386
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,700
Oh, you said you're meeting Hae Eun's friend today, right?

387
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,110
Yes, she said it would help my work.

388
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:05,050
Dong Hee, are you having dinner out?

389
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:07,750
Yes, I think I'll have a drink, too. So I'll be late.

Oh, okay.

That day, he went out saying that he'll meet Hae Eun's friend to discuss work.

396
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:25,720
That was the last time I saw my son.

Who did it?

398

You shouldn't be sitting there.

I wanted to meet you tonight because

404
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:08,250
I don't have much to give you even though you're marrying Hae Eun.

405
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,820
Just consider this a gift from me.

00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,840
Take this project on.

All right. I'll do my best.

Think of it as my gift. Shall we drink?

- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

410
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:41,610
The police say...

411
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:44,740
that he added sleeping pills to the drink.

412
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:07,010
We confirmed that he took our Dong Hee to his office.

413
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,600
But as to what happened in there...

414
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,650
He's the only one who knows.

415
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:15,430
Was there any witness?

416
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:17,220
There's one person.

417
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,170
He said that two of them were fighting when he arrived.

418
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:38,280
So he said they left, leaving only Dong Hee behind.

419
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,630
But when they went back to the office the next day,

420
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:42,650
Dong Hee wasn't there.

421
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:47,700
That's a total lie.

422

I looked through all the CCTVs in the area, but

423
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,900
I didn't see my Dong Hee leaving the place.

424
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:59,350
Dong Hee couldn't come out from there.

Where did my son disappear to?

428
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:19,140
It was jealousy.

429
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:22,990
I heard that bastard had feelings for Hae Eun.

430
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:26,290
How could he kill someone over that?

431
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:30,690
And does it make sense that you can't punish the killer because there is no body?

Goo Young Tae, last March 21st...

after giving sleeping pills to victim Go Dong Hee,

499

you took him to your office in Wolgokdong, right?

Geez, I didn't give him sleeping pills!

I didn't kill him.

He went hiding all on his own. What do you want me to do about it?

505
00:39:01,042 --> 00:39:02,842
Why would Go Dong Hee go into hiding?

506
00:39:02,842 --> 00:39:06,262
It's obvious why a man would go into hiding before his wedding.

507
00:39:06,272 --> 00:39:08,872
You know, like saying, "I can't marry you."

He must've gotten cold feet.

509

Is that what you want Lee Hae Eun to believe?

- Goo Young Tae.

On March 4th,

512

you heard from Lee Hae Eun that she's getting married

513
00:39:27,772 --> 00:39:29,522
and on the following day, March 5th,

514
00:39:29,522 --> 00:39:32,902
you rented out an office in Wolgokdong, the crime scene.

515
00:39:32,902 --> 00:39:35,762
The cause for your crime was Lee Hae Eun, wasn't it?

No.

Why were you not happy about that marriage?

- Did you like Lee Hae Eun?
- No, I didn't.

Stay put, man. Where do you think you are!

Why did you kill Go Dong Hee?

525
00:40:00,752 --> 00:40:02,792
The way he looked at me annoyed me.

526
00:40:02,792 --> 00:40:04,482
That's why I killed him. So what?

527

How did you get rid of the body?

528

Did I burn it?

00:49:43,632 --> 00:49:44,942
Jo Do Cheol's body?

658
00:49:44,942 --> 00:49:47,472
Why do you ask for details out of the blue?

659
00:49:47,472 --> 00:49:49,252
Is something the matter?

660

Or are you more afraid after getting stabbed?

The Prosecutors' Office...

662

is investigating a murder case without a body.

663
00:49:59,492 --> 00:50:04,652
But inadvertently, there is Jo Do Cheol's body.

664
00:50:04,652 --> 00:50:06,982
I was wondering what it was.

665
00:50:06,982 --> 00:50:10,442
- There are lots of cases like that.
- The suspect is one of your guys.

00:50:10,442 --> 00:50:12,102
What?

667
00:50:12,102 --> 00:50:13,722
Didn't you know?

668
00:50:14,552 --> 00:50:17,722
I don't know where they got such a ridiculous idea,

669
00:50:17,722 --> 00:50:19,932
but there's no such a thing. So don't worry about it.

Is it your first time meeting Mr. Goo?

Say hi. This is Director Goo Young Tae for Nakwon.

676

So did you cause trouble?

I deserve to die, Dame!

678
00:50:53,212 --> 00:50:56,292
I was released because I'm innocent. That's why I came to you straight.

679
00:50:56,292 --> 00:50:58,002
Please believe me.

680
00:51:01,732 --> 00:51:04,612
What did you do as my secretary?

681
00:51:04,612 --> 00:51:06,562
Letting me hear of our business from an outsider.

682

I know my guys well.

They're not gutsy enough to cause trouble without my knowledge.

685
00:51:20,612 --> 00:51:25,792
I had no idea you trusted people so much.

686

You and I don't suit each other much.

687
00:51:30,972 --> 00:51:35,242
Do you know why we didn't clash all this time?

688
00:51:38,222 --> 00:51:40,982
It's because we kept our boundaries.

689
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:44,402
Let's keep the boundary.

690
00:51:45,392 --> 00:51:47,912
I hope that keeping the boundary with you

691
00:51:47,912 --> 00:51:51,442
don't force us to cross our boundary.

692

She won't tell me what they did with Jo Do Cheol's body.

694

It's another murder without a body.

695
00:52:24,312 --> 00:52:28,822
I thought Jo Do Cheol's death was an unavoidable accident.

696
00:52:28,822 --> 00:52:31,942
As you said, I had overlooked it.

697
00:52:31,942 --> 00:52:37,272
But now that we know about the Go Dong Hee case, we can't ignore it, right?

698
00:52:37,272 --> 00:52:40,972
I'll have to look into what they're up to.

01:04:22,392 --> 01:04:24,732
Woo Sub, come here!

816
01:04:27,492 --> 01:04:30,782
Woo Sub, come here!

817
01:05:13,732 --> 01:05:15,772
Woo Sub...

818
01:05:18,162 --> 01:05:20,322
Woo Sub.

819
01:05:20,322 --> 01:05:22,682
I know you're in here.

820
01:05:22,682 --> 01:05:25,162
If you come out now, I'll let you live.

821
01:05:25,162 --> 01:05:29,372
If I find you, you're dead meat.

822
01:05:29,372 --> 01:05:31,782
Come out.

823
01:05:31,782 --> 01:05:33,952
Woo Sub...

824
01:05:35,272 --> 01:05:37,452
Woo Sub...

825
01:05:37,452 --> 01:05:40,472
I know you're in here.

826
01:05:47,172 --> 01:05:49,572
Woo Sub...

827
01:06:11,362 --> 01:06:13,542
Where are you going, a**hole! Come here!

828
01:06:13,542 --> 01:06:14,972
Hey, you!

829
01:06:16,422 --> 01:06:19,912
Hey, man. I told you you're dead if I catch you!

830
01:06:22,152 --> 01:06:24,802
You mouse!

831
01:06:35,782 --> 01:06:37,272
You can't go in.

832
01:06:37,272 --> 01:06:39,852
There's been an incident.

833
01:06:39,852 --> 01:06:41,882
Prosecutor, this way.

834
01:06:41,882 --> 01:06:43,002
Did you find Shim Woo Sub?

835
01:06:43,002 --> 01:06:45,782
A body was found here. The body hasn't been identified yet.

836
01:06:45,872 --> 01:06:48,072
- What?
- That way.

837
01:06:50,482 --> 01:06:52,112
Good evening.

838
01:06:52,112 --> 01:06:53,862
We'll check the body.

839
01:07:23,652 --> 01:07:26,162
Inspector...

840
01:07:31,352 --> 01:07:33,132
Inspector!

841
01:07:33,132 --> 01:07:35,972
Wake up...

842
01:07:39,682 --> 01:07:41,752
Inspector...

843
01:07:41,752 --> 01:07:43,082
What happened?

844
01:07:43,082 --> 01:07:45,492
He was found in a warehouse.

845
01:07:45,492 --> 01:07:46,742
A warehouse?

846
01:07:46,742 --> 01:07:48,472
Yes, it looks like there was a fight.

847
01:07:48,472 --> 01:07:51,192
By the time we arrived, he was already dead.

848
01:07:51,192 --> 01:07:52,722
Do you know him?

849
01:07:52,722 --> 01:07:54,912
He's an inspector from the Prosecutors' Office.

850
01:07:54,912 --> 01:07:59,322
Wake up, Inspector...

851
01:08:19,922 --> 01:08:21,772
What's going on/

852
01:08:23,382 --> 01:08:28,672
♫ As you look at me, you have tears in your eyes ♫

853
01:08:28,672 --> 01:08:29,982
Is he dead?

854
01:08:29,982 --> 01:08:31,842
He seems young.

855
01:08:31,842 --> 01:08:40,152
♫ With the tears in our eyes as we look at each other ♫

[Epilogue]

858
01:08:58,562 --> 01:09:00,392
You held yourself back pretty well.

859
01:09:00,392 --> 01:09:03,002
Don't waste your anger on a guy like that.

860
01:09:03,002 --> 01:09:05,622
How could he say he's been forgiven?

861
01:09:05,622 --> 01:09:07,812
Is it something that could be forgiven?

862
01:09:07,812 --> 01:09:10,682
If I were a victim's family, I'd rip his mouth open.

863
01:09:10,682 --> 01:09:14,032
Prosecutor, please watch what you say with your pretty mouth.

864
01:09:14,032 --> 01:09:16,292
Isn't the prison too good for a guy like him?

865
01:09:16,292 --> 01:09:18,502
They get food, clothes, housing.

866
01:09:18,502 --> 01:09:21,062
Is there a need to be humane for someone who is not?

867
01:09:21,062 --> 01:09:25,452
But if we behave inhumanely, we'd be the same.

868
01:09:25,452 --> 01:09:29,622
I'm a prosecutor, but I think a fist is better than law sometimes.

869
01:09:29,622 --> 01:09:32,892
Gosh, you can't change a habit of using physical strength.

870
01:09:32,892 --> 01:09:35,142
I used to be a tough guy in my past.

871
01:09:35,972 --> 01:09:38,912
I guess you don't regret quitting wrestling?

872
01:09:38,912 --> 01:09:40,582
I like the law.

873
01:09:40,582 --> 01:09:42,452
Especially the law of being innocent until proven guilty.

874
01:09:42,452 --> 01:09:44,612
Although you may let go of 100 criminals,

875
01:09:44,612 --> 01:09:47,972
don't punish one innocent person.

876
01:09:47,972 --> 01:09:49,472
What about it?

877
01:09:49,472 --> 01:09:51,772
It's so humane.

878
01:09:51,772 --> 01:09:54,572
Not even one person.

879

[Taxi Driver]

883
01:10:26,592 --> 01:10:27,992
Do you think he was in pain?

884
01:10:27,992 --> 01:10:30,262
- Please catch the killer.
- I'm sorry.

885
01:10:30,262 --> 01:10:32,852
- Die! Just die!
- Prosecutor...

886
01:10:32,852 --> 01:10:34,582
I told you that's not true!

887
01:10:34,582 --> 01:10:36,102
Go Young Tae killed someone.

888
01:10:36,102 --> 01:10:37,862
I'll kill him then.

889
01:10:37,862 --> 01:10:39,972
I killed him. You have evidence, though?

890
01:10:39,972 --> 01:10:42,612
Goo Young Tae will try to kill Shim Woo Sub.

891
01:10:42,612 --> 01:10:44,262
Let's get into the murder case without a body.

892
01:10:44,262 --> 01:10:46,782
- I've never seen you before.
- We have lots of workers.

893
01:10:50,122 --> 01:10:52,582
Does it hurt? I haven't even started.

894
01:10:52,582 --> 01:10:54,762
I'll catch Goo Young Tae and turn him over to the Prosecutors' Office.

895
01:10:54,762 --> 01:10:55,672
You can't do that.

896
01:10:55,672 --> 01:10:58,842
Do you still believe your way is right?
