- Wow.
- I'll become dust and fly away.

00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:56,410
Look how pretty my Maria looks.

3
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:59,190
You look much prettier through this.

4
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,010
Like a TV star.

5
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:03,590
Oh, my! You're the best.

6
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:06,630
Aigoo, much better than the girl next to you.

- Maria.
- Unni.

00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,510
Are you awake?

10
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:24,010
- What happened?
- Hey, Ahn Jung Eun's sister.

11
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,390
Move.

12
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:28,600
Don't touch it, man.

13
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,960
You...

14
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,890
Are you awake now?

15
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,120
Wow, I had no idea Jung Eun had a sister like you.

16
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,900
Had I known, I would've been nicer to her.

17
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,430
Don't mention my sister's name with that filthy mouth of yours.

18
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,100
Unless you want to die.

19
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,060
The sister is kind of rough.

20
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,770
My Jung Eun was gentle.

21
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,740
Wait just a moment.

22
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,800
Play rough with me.

23
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,620
Geez, that parasite. I told him not to touch it.

24
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,050
Ahjussi.

25
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:05,620
Come on! Stop touching it.

26
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:08,150
Can't be that expensive. I only touched it a little.

27
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,530
Stop taking it out on me.

28
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,430
- You know what you're doing?
- I know enough!

29
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,710
Forget it. Whatever.

30
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,050
How much longer do I have to wait?

31
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,640
I've waited long enough.

32
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,280
Maria.

33
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,390
We have to get out of here.

34
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,830
How?

35
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,340
This isn't for me.

36
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,680
Maria, let's get it on.

37
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,290
Come on.

38
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,130
Where are my friends?

39
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,570
I'll tell you.

40
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,810
On your way to the afterlife.

41
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:55,490
Tell me. Hurry.

42
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:00,230
I don't know, man!

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,150
You'd better be good.

[Blocked ID]

45
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,290
Where are you?

46
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,880
We're...

47
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,760
We're still inside their hangout.

48
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,360
How about Kim Do Ki?

49
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,210
As you said, he's barely alive.

50
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,730
Then bring him over.

51
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,670
And that punk Choi Min.

52
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:40,480
I think he took off with the girl.

53
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,190
His phone is turned off, too.

54
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,610
Do you know where he's at?

55
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:44,770
I don't know.

56
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:47,930
Anyway, bring over Kim Do Ki and go find Choi Min.

57
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,400
Then I'll pay you double.

58
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,120
Yes, got it.

59
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,930
By the way...

60
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:55,160
why do you keep speaking in honorifics?

61
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,410
Stay out of it, man!

62
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,980
Geez!

63
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,210
- Mr. Choi.
- Hyung!

64
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,570
No, no, no!

65
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,490
Baek Sung Mi, are you crazy?

66
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,270
What the hell are you doing?

67
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,230
Stop this.

68
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,500
I was getting bored.

69
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,280
You know where this is, right?

70
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,520
One finger every five minutes.

71
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:37,890
Take your time.

72
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:40,530
We still have many fingers left. Okay?

73
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,370
Where is Choi Min right now?

74
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,390
I don't know, a**hole.

75
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,380
I'll hit you for real this time.

76
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,580
The warehouse! The warehouse!

77
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,700
The warehouse where he used to film...

78
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,740
That warehouse...

79
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,890
The warehouse... why there...

80
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:24,220
It will take too long if we rescue Go Eun first.

81
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,300
You go and rescue Go Eun.

82
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,640
I'll go to Chairwoman Baek.

83
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,150
What are you going to do?

84
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:35,590
I have to earn time somehow.

85
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,320
No. That's too dangerous.

86
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,070
I ran away by myself.

87
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:43,860
Even after seeing Hyungnim and CEO being held hostage.

88
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,020
To save myself.

89
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:51,370
At least, let me do this. I ask you.

90
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,610
By chance...

91
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,290
did you let him go?

92
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:06,580
Goo Young Tae revealed who the accomplice is.

93
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:10,600
It's not Kim Do Ki.

94
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,210
Then who is it?

95
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:14,730
His twin brother, Goo Seok Tae.

96
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,590
Shim Woo Sub's stab wounds on his back.

97
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:18,460
You did that, right?

98
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,270
There's no use denying it.

99
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,510
We found your DNA there.

100
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,280
You a**hole!

101
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,490
Here comes a knife!

102
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:30,610
Geez...

103
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:33,270
You probably cut your hand while stabbing him.

104
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:37,500
From that stab wound, another DNA was discovered.

105
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,270
Inspector Wang Min Ho's, who was murdered at the scene.

106
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,600
My hyung kidnapped Woo Sub.

107
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,910
My brother was in charge of the organ trafficking deal.

108
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:50,220
All I did was stab him once. That's all.

109
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,920
Where is that weapon?

110
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,710
That's not mine.

111
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,040
Hyung made it.

112
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,730
He said I can stab deeper if you make the knife end sharp.

113
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,990
That rat is out.

114
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,500
Crush him.

115
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,760
No.

116
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,430
Kill him off.

117
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,800
Kill him?

118
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,050
You said to capture him alive.

119
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,660
It doesn't matter.

120
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,770
Right. That's how it should be.

121
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,980
Go Eun, wait a little longer.

122
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,280
Gosh, I'm so bored.

123
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,280
Did five minutes pass?

124
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:41,960
If you get hit wrong, you'll be crippled for life.

125
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:46,070
You don't die just because your hand is broken.

126
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,430
Stop!

127
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,350
Hit my hand instead.

128
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,610

129
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,500
Dear.

130
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,630
Fingers won't be enough for you, honey.

131

You know what? Your eyes...

132
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:28,370
They're so clear yet so cold.

133
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:31,280
Like a wolf that found its prey in the snow...

134
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,360
they're full of charisma.

135
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:37,860
Give me that.

136
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,090
Then I won't mess with him.

137
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,720
- Take it.
- No, CEO...

138
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:48,390
Gosh, this is getting interesting.

139
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,910
No need to get scared. It'll be over quick.

140
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,600
If I poke you with this,

141
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,260
your clear eye will get cloudy.

142
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:26,110
I love seeing that.

143
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:29,210
I get odd pleasure out of it.

144
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,250
I'll hold him for you.

145
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,470
How should I put it...

146
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:37,070
As if throwing a rock...

147
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:41,950
into a clear lake?

148
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,050
We've arrived at the scene now.

149
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:05,390
Let's go.

150
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:23,220
[Come out right now if you want to save your colleagues!]

151
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,590
By "colleagues," could it be...

152
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,350
Jang Sung Cheol, Choi Kyung Koo, Ahn Go Eun.

153
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,860
I can't reach any of them.

154
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:34,040
As Kim Do Ki said, it's possible that they have been kidnapped.

155

[Sung Cheol]

156
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,040
The phone is turned off. You'll be connected to the voicemail.

157
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,500
Who'd do such a thing?

158
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,810
Kim Do Ki mentioned Chairwoman Baek Sung Mi.

159
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,260
- Why would she?
- We can't investigate her anyway.

160
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,010
There's no proof that Baek Sung Mi gave him this note.

161
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,680
So what are you going to do now?

162
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,340
While arresting Goo Seok Tae,

163
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,530
we'll conduct a search and seizure on Nakwon Credit.

164
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,480
Of course, there's no guarantee that they're there,

165
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,420
and I know that...

166
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,120
a search and seizure are impossible at this hour.

167
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,190
Do it.

168
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,600
Don't worry about the aftermath.

169
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,110
Okay.

170
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,940
It's Prosecutor Kang.

171
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,950
What brings you here at this hour?

172
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,930
- Where is Goo Seok Tae?
- Director Goo...

173
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:27,200
He's on vacation for a few days.

174
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,160
What is this about?

175
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,480
There's an emergency arrest for Goo Seok Tae.

176
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,900
For the murder of Shim Woo Sub and Wang Min Ho.

177
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:37,490
- Please search.
- Go inside!

178
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:47,560
We'll arrest everyone for obstruction of justice.

179
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,440
Do you have a warrant?

180
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,000
An advance warrant issuance isn't mandatory for an emergency arrest.

181
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,480
Please step aside.

182
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,570
Open up.

183
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:08,630
Please open the door.

184
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,790
What is Prosecutor Kang doing here?

185
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,760
Anyway, we have some time.

186
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,530
Our primary goal is to find Goo Seok Tae and the weapon.

187
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:27,800
Look in places where there might be people.

188
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,560
Perhaps Rainbow Transportation people might've been kidnapped.

189
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,510
The knife that Goo Seok Tae used to stab Shim Woo Sub and Wang Min Ho...

190
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,760
Find that knife.

191
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,110
Now, look through the cabinet, safe, everywhere!

192
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,630
Where was that...

193
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,610
I found it. Hey!

194
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:55,350
Hey!

195
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,790
Get ready to record.

196
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,490
I don't just do it?

197
00:13:58,490 --> 00:13:59,930
How are we going to film when they're tied up like that?

198
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:02,400
- Untie them.
- Yeah, right.

199
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:06,570
Maria, you've waited so long.

200
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,880
I'll untie this for you.

201
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,430
Wait. Wait a minute. Stay still. It's okay.

202
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,850
Gosh, Maria smells so good.

203
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,330
All done.

204
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:19,650
There.

205
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,760
Maria, you know...

206
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,310
I came up with a plan.

207
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:25,790
In a big house with a big yard,

208
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:29,530
we can have two pretty daughters who look like you and a boy who-

209
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:31,180
Maria, run!

210
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,710
Hey, Maria!

211
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,140
Maria, go!

212
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,420
Hey! Maria!

213
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:46,000
Move! Maria! Move!

214
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,260
- Maria!
- You like it rough, huh?

215
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,380
Do you like this?

216
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,990
Come.

217
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:58,580
Maria!

218
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,800
Hey, Maria, wait!

219
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,620
Hey, let's talk for a minute.

220
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,720
Let's talk, Maria. Wait!

221
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:07,330
Hey, Maria, hey...

222
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:09,240
Why do you keep running away?

223
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,030
- Let me live...
- Let you live? What? Hey.

224
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:14,780
Do you know how much I thought of you in that hell?

225
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,210
But you seemed to live such a happy life there.

226
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:18,440
Hey, tell me.

227
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,430
Is it a sin that I love you?

228
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:22,640
Is that so wrong?

229
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,970
I said I love you. I'm saying I love you.

230
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,550
Okay, let's play wildly.

231
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:59,270
You ruined a perfectly fine person's life

232
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,700
and you can't run away alone.

233
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,740
Why did you do that to me?

234
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,810
What did I do so wrong?

235
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,890
Because of Jung Eun?

236
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:21,130
Why are you so sensitive?

237
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,690
Do you miss your sister?

238
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:29,220
Should I show her to you?

239
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,700
What?

240
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,220
Look.

241
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,260
Isn't she pretty?

242
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,070
How could this...

243
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,940
Look carefully.

244
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:58,240
Isn't it nice to see your sister?

245
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:01,630
Even though she's dead, your sister isn't really dead.

246
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,550
I'll make sure she's remembered forever.

247
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:05,570
She'll never be forgotten.

248
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,470
Don't cry.

249
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:10,950
I'll do that for you, too.

250
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,510
I'll film you nicely.

251
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:17,230
"The video of babe Ahn Jung Eun's sister."

252
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:21,580
It will be a big hit if I post it like that.

253
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,050
Okay.

254
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,470
Go Eun.

255
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:41,280
Are you okay?

256
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,490
Go Eun.

257
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,850
Long time no see.

258
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:52,310
It's quite refreshing seeing you here again.

259
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:55,270
- What did you do to Go Eun?
- Nothing much...

260
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:57,230
compared to what you guys did to me.

261
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:33,500
Unni, are you okay?

262
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:39,060
Oh, no...

263
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:46,160
What did I do wrong?

264
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,930
For you...

265
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,920
this isn't the problem.

266
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,180
I'm sorry. I'm sorry...

267
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,640
This is the problem.

268
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,140
You might kill him.

269
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,130
His cell phone...

270
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,420
♫ I’ll show you all, I’ll shine even brighter ♫

271
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:19,810
♫ My dreams that have gotten far away ♫

272
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:23,960
♫ Even if they fall in this endless place ♫

273
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:28,380
♫ I will overcome again ♫

274
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:37,630
♫ The place I want, all the things I want ♫

275
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,880
♫ I will find again ♫

276
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:45,900
♫ All of my small dreams that were so precious ♫

277
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,110
♫ All day ♫

278
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,430
It's okay.

279
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:57,730
It's okay now.

280
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,200
The police will arrive soon.

281
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:19,630
Then let us go free.

282
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:21,780
We'll never show up ever again.

283
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,300
Yeah, do you think you'll be fine when the police show up?

284
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,750
Let's wrap this up nicely.

285
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,060
You did wrong by kidnapping us, too.

286
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,840
If I don't put you guys away in jail,

287
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,610
I might just kill one of you.

288
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:18,850
It's taking longer than I expected.

289
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:21,120
To speed things up, why don't you open this for us?

290
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,480
Oh, that?

291
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,280
I'll open it for you if you're curious.

292
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,250
- Open it.
- Yes, ma'am.

293
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:29,930
Dear.

294
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,050
You're too rough with things.

295
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,800
Please handle with care.

296
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,890
Open this also.

297
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:56,100
Oh...

298
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,650
That's Mr. Goo's personal safe.

299
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:01,000
If you don't know the combo, we'll take the entire safe.

300
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,800
Gosh, give me a freaking break.

301
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:08,980
Shouldn't you be able to open something like this yourselves?

302
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:17,280
Oppa, handle with care when you go through other people's things.

303
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:30,830
Go Eun, are you okay? Are you hurt?

304
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,720
I'm fine. Thanks to you two.

305
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:37,020
I didn't do anything.

306
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:42,400
Prosecutor Kang came by with a bunch of cops.

307
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,920
Good going.

308
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:59,210
I see you over there, Mr. Park.

309
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:01,350
Oh, where?

310
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:32,910
- No...
- Mr. Park...

311
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,390
No!

312
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:46,730
I finally got him. You little rat.

313
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,850
Hey, you rat...

314
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:52,830
Did you think I'd never get you?

315
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:55,630
Who the hell?

316
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,020
You!

317
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:04,530
Mr. Park, wake up.

318
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:06,370
Mr. Park!

319
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:09,930
Go Eun, call 911.

320
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:11,700
Hurry!

321
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,560
A man is hurt! Please hurry!

322
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,610
Mr. Park...

323
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:28,240
Wake up. Mr. Park...

324
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,790
Mr. Park...

325
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,650
Die!

326
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,330
Die!

327
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:45,440
Are you okay?

328
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:49,000
Mr. Park, wake up.

329
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,400
Mr. Park...

330
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,890
Mr. Park...

331
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,540
Open your eyes. Please?

332
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,000
I'm okay...

333
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,190
Hurry up and...

334
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:15,690
go to Hyung and CEO.

335
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:17,670
I beg you.

336
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,470
Don't worry.

337
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:22,570
I'll... I'll get them both.

338
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:24,050
Please...

339
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:26,040
Please pull it together...

340
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,930
I'm sorry that all I do is ask you to do stuff.

341
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:31,960
Mr. Kim...

342
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,400
Go Eun...

343
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:39,740
Thank you.

344
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:49,730
Mr. Park.

345
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:51,130
Mr. Park.

346
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,830
Mr. Park.

347
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:55,420
Mr. Park.

348
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,150
Mr. Park!

349
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:04,530
Mr. Park...

350
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,930
Please wake up...

351
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:09,860
Mr. Park, wake up!

352
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,790
Mr. Park...

353
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:14,800
Please wake up...

354
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:33,790
What the hell? Those rats.

355
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,440
A**hole!

356
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:04,740
Die, you f***er!

357
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,630
Die, you f***er!

358
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:19,080
How dare you mess around with me!

359
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,510
What the?

360
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,910
That rat!

361
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,610
You want to die!

362
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:30,990
You and I both die, you f***er!

363
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:34,930
You little rat!

364
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,920
Where will you go in your condition?

365
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:41,610
Go Eun, stay by Mr. Park's side.

366
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:45,450
I'll bring the CEO and Mr. Choi with me.

367
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,580
No.

368
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:50,640
I promised...

369
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:53,210
to Mr. Park.

370
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:19,890
Locking you up in here...

371
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:23,340
It was the revenge that the prisoners wanted.

372
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:26,260
Who knew it would turn out this way?

373
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:30,480
So how does it feel being locked up in there?

374
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,690
I'm thinking.

375
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:36,440
Where and how did it go wrong?

376
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:40,080
I guess things went wrong the very moment

377
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:45,460
I held a hand of a monster like you to go up against other monsters.

378
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,460
I'm regretting it.

379
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:50,690
Enough to want to kill the fool that I was back then.

380
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:53,970
That hurts a little bit.

381
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:56,450
I liked you.

382
00:33:56,450 --> 00:34:00,480
What you did as well as the method you used to show your fury.

383
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,330
I liked all that.

384
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:06,290
I could turn things back.

385
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:08,060
I'll give you a chance.

386
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,030
Hold my hand once again.

387
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:15,330
You can capture bad guys and lock them up.

388
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:18,130
And I'll save people using their organs.

389
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:22,430
You said your duty is to isolate monsters from society.

390
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:25,530
Let's do it together.

391
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:27,780
Why?

392
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:33,080
You don't like it because I'm a monster?

393
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:37,890
Be reasonable, CEO Jang.

394
00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:40,270
If you tolerate one monster,

395
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:42,960
you can take care of the rest of the monsters.

396
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:49,310
Can you promise me that you won't hurt innocent people?

397
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:50,920
CEO...

398
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,650
You'll bring me all the bad guys.

399
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:57,270
Why would I hurt civilians?

400
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:58,730
Here.

401
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,650
Hold my hand.

402
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:07,570
Then I'll gift you a new cornea.

403
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:09,930
Okay?

404
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,880
Why...

405
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:32,520
Did you think I'd fall for a sham like that?

406
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:35,280
Look.

407
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,460
I may be foolish, but

408
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,640
I'm not a monster.

409
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:43,390
You sure you won't regret this?

410
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:44,760
Regret?

411
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:49,740
She still doesn't know what kind of people we are.

412
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:58,790
[Operating Center]

413
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:10,040
We lost our family due to crimes.

414
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,790
Do you know what that means?

415
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,700
I'm okay.

416
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:23,220
Hurry up and go to Hyung and CEO.

417
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,410
I beg you.

418
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:30,270
I'm sorry that all I do is ask you to do stuff.

419
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:32,350
Mr. Kim...

420
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,220
Don't worry.

421
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,530
I'll...

422
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:45,200
I'll rescue them both.

423
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,710
Please...

424
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:48,650
Please wake up.

425
00:36:56,070 --> 00:37:00,400
It means we have to live in flames of fury all our lives.

426
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:17,920
Inside cold flames of fury, as cold as ice.

427
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:22,330
We started this to live like humans somehow.

428
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,850
But...

429
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:28,880
you want me to sell people off?

430
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:31,980
Just kill me.

431
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,380
Fine then.

432
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,450
Then...

433
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:43,310
you die.

434
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:17,200
- Mr. Kim!
- Do Ki!

435
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,570
Your eyes...

436
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:52,800
I'm a little confused.

437
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,500
Is he here to rescue or to kill?

438
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,710
Take one more step...

439
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:01,240
if you want to see their heads get cut off.

440
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:09,590
Kneel.

441
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,190
Do Ki.

442
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:16,690
- Don't you dare kneel.
- That's right.

443
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:19,970
No need to change what you need to do. We're okay.

444
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:29,540
You're okay, my foot.

445
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:34,680
I promised Mr. Park.

446
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,810
That I'd...

447
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:40,610
get CEO and Mr. Choi out of here.

448
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:49,170
No! No!

449
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,080
I lose.

450
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:00,140
I'm done.

451
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:05,500
Do Ki.

452
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:16,130
Stop it, a**hole!

453
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,890
Do Ki!

454
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:21,850
- Mr. Kim!
- Do Ki!

455
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:24,170
- Do Ki!
- Mr. Kim!

456
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:25,560
Mr. Kim.

457
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,660
Can you hear me? Mr. Kim.

458
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:31,630
Please say something if you can hear me!

459
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:35,750
I beg you.

460
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:39,460
I'm sorry that all I do is ask you to do stuff.

461
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:06,930
How boring.

462
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:09,060
This is boring.

463
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:12,160
Get rid of him.

464
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,480
It's not over yet.

465
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,730
- What?
- I said it's not over yet.

466
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:29,230
Let those people go.

467
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:32,400
You can't kill me anyway.

468
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,740
Hey!

469
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:36,620
Hang onto those f***ers, got that?

470
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:43,530
You crazy nut!

471
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:46,440
If I have to be the one to say let them go,

472
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,630
I'll make them slice your face.

473
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:49,910
Should I repeat that for you?

474
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:51,840
Hurry up... and let them go...

475
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:54,330
Let them go, you f***ers!

476
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:58,790
Hurry up and go!

477
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:01,530
How about you? You have to come with us!

478
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:03,330
I'll be right behind you.

479
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:05,190
Hurry!

480
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:16,200
What a coward you are...

481
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,020
to use a woman as your hostage?

482
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:21,710
Hey, aren't you embarrassed, a**hole?

483
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:24,390
I am embarrassed, but...

484
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:27,130
I'm kind of outnumbered right now.

485
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:31,370
- Move!
- Dame!

486
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:32,940
Kill him!

487
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:43,150
Kim Do Ki, that crazy bastard!

488
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:45,730
What the hell were you doing? Can't take care of a guy like that?

489
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:48,130
The car! The car, car, car!

490
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:54,630
You go ahead.

491
00:43:56,790 --> 00:43:59,320
Get lost, you crazy bastard!

492
00:44:09,490 --> 00:44:11,350
Hey!

493
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:16,410
S***!

494
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:18,810
S***, that Kim Do Ki!

495
00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:22,060
Kim Do Ki, you son of a b****!

496
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:25,090
I'll get you. I'll kill you!

497
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:27,730
What the hell?

498
00:44:27,730 --> 00:44:29,980
Geez, that son of a b****!

499
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:32,590
Kim Do Ki, you son of a b****!

500
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:32,450
I think it's over now.

501
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:34,310
Right?

502
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:36,100
Give up.

503
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,710
I'll finish you off as painless as I can.

504
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,880
I'll never forgive you.

505
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:45,960
For the sake of Mr. Park.

506
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:51,940
I see. I wondered why you were jumping around like a lunatic.

507
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:54,070
He must be dead.

508
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,690
I'm sure that was revenge, too.

509
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:02,240
It must've been one of the prisoners.

510
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:05,480
Why do you think only your revenge is just?

511
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:09,710
You're just another target for the prisoners' revenge.

512
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:11,050
Shut up!

513
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:14,700
The world is so simple.

514
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:16,860
If you're just an SOB to me,

515
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:20,210
that's enough of a reason for revenge.

516
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:22,850
That's why!

517
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:25,260

522
00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:03,540

539
00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:19,800
Put it down.

540
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:24,310
If you take my gun like that,

541
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:26,470
I'll really have to write up a report.
