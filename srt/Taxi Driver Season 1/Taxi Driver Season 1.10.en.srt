00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,260
But it's my first time getting a call from a taxi company, though.

170
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,990
Yes. I'm in a rush.

171
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,970
- Let's go.
- Okay.

172
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:56,030
Hey, come over here.

173
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,410
Why?

174
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:00,710
The last digits of your account number are?

175
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:03,560
4625. 4625, yes.

176
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,410
Did you make the deposit?

177
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,820
Then we'll call you back as soon as our investigation is over.

178
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,420
Thank you. And...

179
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:13,070
you can't tell anyone about this investigation.

180
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,900
Wow! Pretty good!

181
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,510
He seems experienced as much as his face does.

182
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:22,160
Hello? Is this Jung Joo Yoon?

183
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,070
I'm Prosecutor Kim Min Soo from Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

184
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:28,200
My gosh. Prosecutor Kim Min Soo.

185
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,230
If you give me your account number, I'll send it over right away.

186
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:33,280
Hello, is this Jang Doo Bong?

187
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,300
Yes, got it.

188
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:49,120
How did you train new recruits?

189
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,640
[Lee Ja Sung: 50,000 won/110,000 won/24,000 won...]

190
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,850
50,000 won, 110,000 won...

191
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,620
24,000 won-

192
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,670
What was the total again?

193
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:06,290
He brought in 650,000 won with 17 cases today.

194
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,100
It can't even pay for unverified phones.

195
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,620
Making money as puny as a snot!

196
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,050
Don't you get scared.

197
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:21,630
It's all because of this guy's half-a**ed job.

198
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,710
Give me a cell phone.

199
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,700
Here you go.

200
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,060
If I go now, how much do I have to pay for the unverified phones?

201
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,500
Are you kidding me?

202
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:37,580
If next week, should we be sucking on our thumbs until then?

203
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,800
Noonim, please let me live this once.

204
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:47,550
I'll... I'll teach... him properly.

205
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,450
Madam.

206
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:52,940
You know the guy with the phones who caught the cheater last time?

207
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,550
That son of a b****.

208
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:57,000
He's eating in the restaurant right now.

209
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,700
I didn't order this...

210
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,570
Are you giving it to me? On the house?

211
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:31,350
Thank you.

212
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,100
From what town did you come from?

213
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,040
I ran a business in Heilongjiang.

214
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,780
My father's hometown is Tonghe in Harbin.

215
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,600
[Tonghe]
I grew up there, too.

216
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,140
How do you read this?

217
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,290
- Huh... gang... soo...
- We're from the same hometown.

218
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,280
I was in Suibin County.

219
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,500
The beef noodle soup place in front of the train station is especially good.

220
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,080
Do you know the place?

221
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,690
Where is she talking about?

222
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:13,480
I can't see anything because it's all under construction.

223
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,550
You don't know?

224
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:23,120
I just noticed what a young face you have.

225
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,300
The beef noodle soup place at the station has been gone

226
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,910
for more than 20 years already.

227
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,750
If you know of that place, you must be

228
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:35,050
at least in your early to mid-forties.

229
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:37,560
Wow, you don't look it at all!

230
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,500
I'm just so shocked at finding out your age.

231
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:47,320
Oh, my. Wow...

232
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,600
What's your name?

233
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,370
Just call me Madam Lim.

234
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,340
That's what they all call me around here.

235
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,690
I'm Mr. Wang. Good to meet you.

236
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:05,770
Sell me the goods you have.

237
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,260
I can't do that.

238
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,030
What do you mean?

239
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:14,410
I decided to sell it to the person who is interested before you.

240
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,450
How much is he paying you?

241
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:22,510
I'll pay you 10% more per phone.

242
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:26,450
A man shouldn't speak from two sides of his mouth.

243
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:27,790
I'm sorry.

244
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:33,780
We're from the same town. Just hand the goods over to me.

245
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,960
What kind of bulls*** is that?

246
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,500
Geez, s***...

247
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,960
Sit down.

248
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:47,710
What does the past school or regional connection have to do with business?

249
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,050
Oh, right.

250
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:50,740
You don't have any school connections.

251
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,690
Didn't you say you were a beggar?

252
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:55,070
How dare you barge in like that?

253
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:57,750
I don't want to come into a place like this, either...

254
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,240
but I have to make a deal with this guy...

255
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,080
and get medical bills paid for my guys.

256
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,440
Why don't you order something to eat?

257
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,350
- I'll buy.
- I'm hungry, but...

258
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,070
- it's not appetizing.
- That crazy a**hole.

259
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:24,010
I won't say this twice.

260
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:25,840
Walk out of here yourself.

261
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,320
How dare you order me around?

262
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:31,560
What the hell?

263
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:36,960
There are three things you shouldn't show a woman.

264
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,290
Violent glare.

265
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,000
Violent language.

266
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,460
And...

267
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,790
violent fist.

268
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:53,970
You just did all those things simultaneously.

269
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,800
Geez...

270
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:58,220
It's okay.

271
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:02,220
Geez, what the hell is this phone sales guy saying?

272
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,480
Look over there.

273
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:07,420
Hyungnim!

274
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,320
Wait a minute...

275
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:13,830
You...

276
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:16,880
I'm very disappointed in you.

277
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,300
Let's forget about our deal.

278
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:23,230
Hey...

279
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,800
Hurry, hurry, go.

280
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:32,410
Don't mind words from a petty guy like that.

281
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:35,580
And as for my goods...

282
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:40,010
I'll sell them to you, Madam Lim.

283
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,700
You took care of Jo Do Cheol, right?

284
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:56,770
Yes, we wrapped up just fine.

285
00:17:56,770 --> 00:18:00,850
You shouldn't leave behind anything questionable.

286
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:03,370
- Yes.
- If you make mistakes three times,

287
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:05,120
that tells me your skill.

288
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,050
- You know what I mean, right?
- Yes, ma'am.

289
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:13,380
How are the responses from the VIPs?

290
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,400
At first, they were doubtful, but

291
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,000
after hearing the rumor that Chairman Choi received a cornea transplant,

292
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,590
I'm getting calls from secretaries' offices.

293
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,840
Why didn't I think of that before?

294
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,440
All I had to do was connect the supply and demand. Right?

295
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,020
My goodness...

296
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:35,240
Are you sure you don't have to worry about CEO Jang?

297
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,080
What's he going to do when he finds out?

298
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,250
Is he going to take all of them out of here?

299
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,100
That would be fun. Right?

300
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:57,470
I will get to get out of here soon, right?

301
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:01,930
Of course. Kim Do Ki said we're very close.

302
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:03,550
All right.

303
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:08,460
This horrible life will be over.

304
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,150
What's over?

305
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,370
Oh, my God!

306
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:13,600
Geez!

307
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:19,730
We have trouble! Mr. Park got caught!

308
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,700
What should we do?

309
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,710
Shouldn't we cancel all our plans and rescue Mr. Park?

310
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:27,050
It might as well happened this way.

311
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:29,020
Let's have him quit his job.

312
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,280
What?

313
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,500
Didn't you hear me? They caught Mr. Park.

314
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:36,050
- How do we get him to quit?
- Let's just kill him off.

315
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,210
What?

316
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,790
Swoosh, swoosh.

317
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,690
Who were you talking to so sweetly?

318
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:54,650
Well, I just...

319
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,860
I just tend to talk to myself.

320
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:28,350
Tell me.

321
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:30,030
Who are you?

322
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,930
Please let me live.

323
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:41,330
You'll die either way.

324
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:44,680
If you tell me, we'll kill you without pain.

325
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,130
If you don't tell me, we'll kill you very painfully.

326
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,500
You choose.

327
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:54,690
How would you like to die?

328
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:01,570
If you do such a thing yourself, your hands will get rough.

329
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:06,520
I brought the phones you've waiting for.

330
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,370
But no one was in the restaurant.

331
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:11,760
Why don't you talk to me alone?

332
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,240
It's okay.

333
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,880
I heard everything from outside.

334
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,040
Just pretend like I'm not here.

335
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,180
Wait a minute.

336
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,600
Hey, you...

337
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,400
- You!
- Do you know him?

338
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,890
Of course, I do.

339
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:30,580
This punk is a cop!

340
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,800
A cop?

341
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,210
- Police?
- A cop...

342
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,920
You a**hole!

343
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,100
Hello?

344
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,590
Mr. Choi, you heard about Mr. Park, right?

345
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,780
Yeah, I heard.

346
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,800
Then why aren't you here? Where are you?

347
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,000
- I'm fishing.
- Fishing?

348
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,680
- This is urgent!
- I can't go over there.

349
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:12,100
I'm not here alone. I'm here with her.

350
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:24,900
You should've lost her. How can you be there with her?

351
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,750
What do we do?

352
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:29,020
Mr. Park will die soon.

353
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,470
Tell Jin Eon that I'm sorry.

354
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:35,540
- This is nuts!
- Bye.

355
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,790
Isn't it lovely weather?

356
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,880
I guess so.

357
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:21,560
It's a nice day to die.

358
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:26,380
If it's okay, could I have a sip of water?

359
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,200
Even if I die,

360
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,000
you could give me a sip of water, can't you?

361
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:42,060
I'll put you deep underwater.

362
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,960
Go ahead and...

363
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,100
drink your heart out.

364
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,250
Get started.

365
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,410
Now, be gentle.

366
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:03,220
- Be gentle.
- Forget it, man.

367
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,630
Okay, go in there.

368
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:09,010
Hey, I'm a cop!

369
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:10,640
Hey! Hey!

370
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,920
When I ran my business back home,

371
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:17,940
my account was completely wiped without any warning.

372
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:22,390
That day, all my guys got arrested,

373
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:25,300
and I was the only one who got away.

374
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,290
I found out later.

375
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:30,230
He was...

376
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:33,400
behind everything.

377
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,540
- Go in!
- I'm sorry!

378
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,950
- Put your head in!
- I'm sorry!

379
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:39,470
I'm sorry!

380
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:40,820
Done.

381
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:50,800
The cops these days are very quick and vicious.

382
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,330
Come on!

383
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,860
Okay. It's sealed.

384
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:23,120
It's not good to look at terrible things like this with those pretty eyes.

385
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,770
This is wrong...

386
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:46,680
This is so wrong...

387
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,620
You went through so much, Mr. Park.

388
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:51,230
It took us too long because of the breakwater.

389
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,650
Go Eun...

390
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:54,510
I asked for a sip of water.

391
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:57,310
But they threw me into the ocean.

392
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:59,330
Gosh, they didn't even give you water. Those bastards.

393
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,600
Gosh...

394
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,100
Sorry, sorry.

395
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,150
I'm the fool! The fool!

396
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:05,910
Oh, no. Here, here.

397
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:08,900
Aigoo!

398
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,580
I'm okay.

399
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,730
This is it.

400
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:16,400
Send me back as Mr. Park from Rainbow Transportation.

401
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,310
Oh, my. What are you saying?

402
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,600
When this operation is wrapped up,

403
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,310
you'll be Chief Park of Rainbow Transportation.

404
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:24,030
That'd be a speedy promotion.

405
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,660
You'll advance fastest among your colleagues.

406
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,640
Are you kidding me?

407
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,460
I almost died, Hyungnim!

408
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,590
I save you!

409
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,630
I'm a Busan person!

410
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:36,510
A Haewoondae dolphin!

411
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:39,150
You'd be dead if it weren't for me. Dead.

412
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:40,890
So, give me 5 million won.

413
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,520
S***!

414
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,220
Gosh, he's doing it again.

415
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,820
Nothing more is coming out.

416
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:55,710
If you stuffed yourself, get to work!

417
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,300
Okay. Thank you.

418
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,650
Let's earn your keep!

419
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:10,440
Shall I get started, too?

420
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:16,400
Yes, sir. If you transfer it to our bank right now,

421
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:18,890
you can lower your interest.

422
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,190
How about zzampong for lunch?

423
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:23,950
Get me an extra-large.

424
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:25,260
You eat zzampong every day!

425
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,970
Line two is Fruit Fly.

426
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:28,590
Line eight is Vinegar Fly.

427
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,240
Line eight is Vinegar Fly.

428
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,580
Line two is Fruit Fly?

429
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,910
What's wrong with their names?

430
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:37,480
Are those their real name?

431
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,680
Sir, I'll help you with your banking.

432
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,520
You know your passcode for your account? Your passcode.

433
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,080
Yes. Please give me that number.

434
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,070
Aigoo, my passcode for my account is-

435
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,830
You can't fall for it, grandpa.

436
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,120
Hello?

437
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,700
Hello, sir? S***!

438
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:00,220
Line 11 is the boss.

439
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,720
- Line two is Fruit Fly.
- Yes, yes.

440
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,120
Then, to the federally insured account that I told you about...

441
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,450
if you transfer-

442
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:07,690
Me-rong.

443
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:09,020
Did you hang up?

444
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,100
You son of a b****!

445
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,120
Geez! What's with this?

446
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,800
Line eight, 11...

447
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,620
Vinegar Fly is calling the boss.

448
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:22,050
Hello, Bok Ja noona.

449
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:24,010
This is Vinegar Fly.

450
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:26,730
I switched my phone, and everything got erased.

451
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:28,000
Send me your account number again.

452
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,380
You a**hole!

453
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,320
Memorize important info!

454
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,110
What an idiot...

455
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,440
Geez, I thought I had it memorized.

456
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,920
Okay, I got the account number.

457
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:44,630
Gosh, my mission is completed if I find out the password.

458
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:47,490
Kim Do Ki, did you hear me?

459
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:50,220
Why don't you answer me?

460
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,910
Oh, are you on a date, by chance?

461
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:56,060
Okay! Got it.

462
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,040
Eat this one, Madam Lim.

463
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,790
It's a big one, so the shell is pretty hard.

464
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:10,030
Don't behave frivolously in front of other people.

465
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:13,060
I don't trust you, Mr. Wang.

466
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:20,710
I feel the same way.

467
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:26,300
That's how I didn't get killed and managed to survive up to this point.

468
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:30,350
You don't have to trust me, either, Madam Lim.

469
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,990
Just...

470
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,570
eat this king crab for me.

471
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,840
The shell is hard...

472
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,910
so it was hard to peel.

473
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:45,560
You must enjoy this.

474
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:08,580
Yes, Prosecutor. Aren't you coming in today?

475
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,300
I'm too far away at the moment.

476
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,760
Where are you?

477
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,200
I came to where Kim Do Ki is vacationing, but I don't see him.

478
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,550
Prosecutor.

479
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:18,880
I trust you, but...

480
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,850
I will say this.

481
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:22,790
You said this before.

482
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:25,990
If a prosecutor investigates with a perpetrator in mind without any evidence,

483
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:27,300
he has no choice but to be a perpetrator.

484
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,600
That's why confirmation bias is so scary.

485
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,370
My apologies.

486
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:33,280
I've overstepped the boundary.

487
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,350
No. You're right, Inspector.

488
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:39,550
But right now, I'm...

489
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,020
I'll call you later.

490
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,210
All right. Good evening.

491
00:33:07,643 --> 00:33:10,863
Am I obsessed or something?

492
00:33:11,743 --> 00:33:15,013
I guess they all took time off together again.

493
00:33:17,323 --> 00:33:19,513
Take time off together?

494
00:33:19,513 --> 00:33:21,623
[Phone Records]
The day Jo Do Cheol was released.

495
00:33:21,623 --> 00:33:25,563
The day Choi Jong Sook, Jo Jong Geun, and Park Joo Chan disappeared.

496
00:33:25,563 --> 00:33:28,023
The day Park Yang Jin's villa blew up.

497
00:33:28,023 --> 00:33:30,153
They all line up exactly.

498
00:33:32,473 --> 00:33:34,233
