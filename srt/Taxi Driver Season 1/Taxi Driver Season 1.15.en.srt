00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,320
According to the Los Angeles Times, this tragedy was

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,740
a result of a backlash against the pride that comes from

11
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:28,900
the economic boom after the Cold War as a result of capitalism in the US.

12
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,060
Also, New York Times stated that the US should consider

170
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:09,110
You just pretend you did.

171
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,240
Should I take care of him for you?

172
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,150
Killing a person in here is not even a problem.

173
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:22,310
I don't care what you do in there.

174
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:25,710
Just don't think about coming out to the world.

175
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:32,210
Hey, Jang Sung Cheol.

176
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:38,980
The day you and Kim Do Ki come in here,

177
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:42,200
know that it will be your funeral day.

178
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,890
It's my turn, right?

179
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,770
Try to stop it.

180
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,470
We'll probably get subpoenaed one of these days.

181
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,740
Now that Chairwoman Baek's people are caught,

182
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,070
I'm sure we can't hide our work much longer.

183
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:14,110
I think it's strange that they haven't arrested us yet.

184
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:17,400
Since it's taking long, I hope they come after Mr. Park wakes up.

185
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:26,880
You all went through something you didn't have to because of me.

186
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,820
It's all my fault.

187
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,250
I'm sorry.

188
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,580
I'm really sorry.

189
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,880
What are you saying?

190
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:37,870
If it weren't for you, all ten fingers would've turned out like this.

191
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,380
Geez!

192
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:43,210
Why are you apologizing when there are real culprits?

193
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,580
I think...

194
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,910
it's time we wrap this up.

195
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,270
Are you saying we're breaking up the group?

196
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:59,110
No matter what we intended,

197
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,420
violence brings more violence

198
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:04,070
and revenge brings more revenge.

199
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:05,650
We all witnessed it.

200
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,610
Things wrapped up this time around, but

201
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:11,510
no one knows what would happen next time.

202
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:14,260
All the things that happened thus far...

203
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,060
I'll take it all on as the CEO

204
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,170
and be responsible.

205
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:27,600
I have no reason to stop you if you want to take all the blame.

206
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:31,550
But would people believe you if you said you kidnapped Park Joo Chan?

207
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,660
Huh?

208
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,740
That's what I'm saying.

209
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,700
And you're computer illiterate.

210
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,920
How will you explain getting through the U-Data server?

211
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,230
Hey, hey.

212
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,780
With computers, you can pretend to type on a keyboard.

213
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:52,020
CEO, do you even know where the engine is if I open up the hood?

214
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,580
You guys...

215
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:58,100
This is no time for jokes.

216
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,390
We're not kids.

217
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:03,520
Let's all be responsible for what each of us did.

218
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,810
That's what I mean.

219
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:11,350
Wait, let's think realistically.

220
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,490
What if all of us are arrested?

221
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:18,180
Then who'll take care of Mr. Park? Jin Eon?

222
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,270
I'm sure Jin Eon would understand.

223
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,530
That's how he is.

224
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:24,210
Gosh, say something that makes sense.

225
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:26,220
Stop rambling nonsense.

226
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,320
Yes, I'm Park Jin Eon's guardian.

227
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:36,440
What?

228
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:40,310
Jin Eon, are you awake?

229
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,820
Who am I?

230
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,510
Your hand...

231
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,740
CEO's eye...

232
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,830
You recognize us.

233
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:56,610
This is nothing. It doesn't hurt at all.

234
00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:00,110
Mr. Park, I'm so glad!

235
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,670
You've endured well.

236

Thanks.

- Do you know me?
- I've been looking for you.

You know that you're on a Wanted List, right?

Where were you hiding all this time?

244
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,030
I've been imprisoned.

By whom?

246
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:53,270
Baek Sung Mi.

So according to you...

250
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:03,680
they're all accomplices?

251
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,940
You know that what you're saying makes no sense, right?

252
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:13,350
You plotted a kidnap with Baek Sung Mi, who imprisoned you.

253
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,590
Because Kim Do Ki...

254
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,420
is the one who imprisoned us.

255
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:23,040
Imprisoned you?

256
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:27,340
You couldn't even stand...

257
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:31,270
nor lie down with your legs straight.

258
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:34,220
It was like an animal cage.

and always cold...

261
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:42,130
We were always starving.

262
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,520
They only gave us a few crackers...

263
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,960
and a few vitamin pills.

264
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,270
In there...

265
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:56,370
we weren't human.

I don't even know.

268
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:08,930
You want me to believe that there's a prison that doesn't even exist?

269
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:11,020
Why don't you ask Kim Do Ki?

270
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,680
Or Chairwoman Baek.

271
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,760
Did you leave the hospital already?

272
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:31,330
By chance, are you free?

273
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,980
I have to tell you something.

At a nursing home in Gyeonggido.

I guess they couldn't identify her.

Her fingerprints were all worn down.

282

She's gotten a lot better.

Strangers...

285

Especially, she was extremely wary of middle-aged men.

Yes, go ahead.

I was worried because you disappeared all of a sudden.

I did?

300
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:45,310
I never disappeared.

Oh, I'm the best insurance saleswoman.

I can remember what I ate...

311
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,820
and the room, but...

312
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,760
I don't really remember the location.

313
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:29,390
Then have you seen that man before?

314
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:35,330
No.

Please stand up.

322
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,410
We have to pray.

323

So that we won't go to hell.

I'm sorry. I'll be good...

Please. I'll be good from now on...

The organ removal must've been the purpose.

329

When the people on the Wanted List disappear,

330
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,930
people would think they ran away, not kidnapped.

331
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:24,440
But still, this is too extreme.

332
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,800
One person says it was a prison, and another person says it was a hotel.

333
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,020
Did I misunderstand you all this time?

334
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:35,040
About what?

335
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,830
You were hired to get back at the wanted criminals.

At the time of the teenage girl's murder,

515
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:17,770
there was an identified DNA on the victim's body.

With the technology back then, we couldn't determine it due to the potential to damage.

For the statute of limitations for the police or the investigative units' inhumane crime,

995
01:08:25,670 --> 01:08:28,820
I believe it's necessary to extend or eliminate it.

996
01:08:28,820 --> 01:08:31,790
Without accepting her daughter's death,

997
01:08:31,790 --> 01:08:33,790
his wife passed away two years ago.

998
01:08:33,790 --> 01:08:36,170
And his last promise to her.

999
01:08:36,170 --> 01:08:38,460
Living like this isn't truly living.

1000
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:40,760
I want to take revenge.

1001
01:08:42,290 --> 01:08:43,940
I'll fight to the end.

1002
01:08:43,940 --> 01:08:47,400
I'll fight to the end, so even after I die...

1003
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:50,790
I think I can talk to her without shame.

1004
01:08:50,790 --> 01:08:53,810
The daughter who was murdered by Lee Choon Jae once...

1005
01:08:53,810 --> 01:08:57,790
Murdered once again by the assault committed by the government.

1006
01:08:57,790 --> 01:09:00,060
The name of that child was...

1007
01:09:00,850 --> 01:09:02,970
Kim Hyun Jung.

1008
01:09:02,970 --> 01:09:08,800
[Late Kim Hyun Jung (1981 - 1989)]
