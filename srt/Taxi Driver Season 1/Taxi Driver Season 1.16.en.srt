00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:04,140
Gosh, you don't have to.

171
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,210
I'm so grateful.

172
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,150
- Soju.
- Okay.

173
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,240
I'll pour you a glass.

174
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,480
Okay.

175
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,630
Running a business is tough, huh?

176
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:22,760
My mom used to run the food stall.

177
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,010
I have helped her a lot since my childhood.

178
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,350
So I'm used to it.

179
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:29,330
I'm an experienced part-timer.

180
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:33,010
Gosh, my mother used to run a similar business.

181
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:35,830
My father passed away early on.

182
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:38,060
So my mother was the head of the household.

183
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,100
For us, too.

184
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,590
If my father was around,

185
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:46,420
she would've had it easier.

186
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,960
Then...

187
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,470
did your father also pass away...

188
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:59,120
I thought he did.

189
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,940
But I found out by accident.

190
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:06,130
I think he's alive.

191
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,860
Hyun Soo.

192
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:16,050
Don't look for your father.

193
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:17,960
Never. Okay?

194
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,060
Is Father...

195
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,400
still alive?

196
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,520
I'm hungry.

197
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,440
Give me food. Hurry.

198
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:33,140
I don't know why he left us, but...

199
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,920
he has to have his reasons.

200
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,700
My father was an amazing man.

201
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,430
- This man...
- He was capable, too.

202
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,410
has no idea.

203
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:46,190
He was a very warm person.

204
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:48,200
Every Sunday morning,

205
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,320
I remember that he used to make ramen for me.

206
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,330
I don't know what he put in it, but

207
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:57,220
I can never get it to taste like that, no matter how hard I try.

208
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:10,680
Do you resent him?

209
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,680
I'd be lying if I didn't.

210
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:19,870
But I still miss him.

211
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:25,140
Should I find him for you?

212
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,020
I'll find him for you if you want.

213
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:33,110
What do you do for a living?

214
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:35,110
I'm a taxi driver.

215
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:40,350
I see.

216
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,620
- I'll come again.
- Okay.

217
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:47,280
What are you going to do?

218
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,340
I don't think he knows who caused him so much grief.

219
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:54,140
Han Dong Chan's life is plenty tough as is.

220
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:57,720
I'll let Han Dong Chan make that choice.

221
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,510
- Hyung!
- See you later.

222
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,810
Dong Chan.

223
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,200
Oh, I work here.

224
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,590
I see...

225
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,160
But what brings you here?

226
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,290
I'm here to visit someone.

227
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,650
- Who...
- Oh Cheol Young.

228
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:29,250
Do you know Oh Cheol Young, Hyungnim?

229
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,970
Do you know him, too?

230
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:34,050
Of course, I do. He's the most vicious one in our prison.

231
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:35,690
He's rowdy and...

232
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:38,230
he tortures all the prison guards.

233
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,680
But how do you know him?

234
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,050
A friend of mine asked me a favor.

235
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:48,540
Oh, the person who finds people for you?

236
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:51,990
Is there someone looking for someone like Oh Cheol Young?

237
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,350
How do you think you'd feel?

238
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:02,710
What if your father...

239
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:05,460
wasn't as great a person as you thought?

240
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,960
What if he's the opposite?

241
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,890
I'd be disappointed, but...

242
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,700
he'd still be my father.

243
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:21,440
Are you free later on, by chance?

244
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,110
I have to tell you something.

245
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,390
Sure...

246
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,320
I'll get going.

247
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,530
Do you feel better now?

248
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:47,720
I felt sorry for you last time.

249
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,900
Take care of yourself.

250
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,620
Your mother went through so much to protect you.

251
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,800
Do you know what I do for a living?

252
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,900
A taxi driver.

253
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,020
Didn't she say you were a soldier then?

254
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,540
Oh...

255
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,640
I guess the military didn't really suit you.

256
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,680
I drive special customers in my taxi.

257
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,100
People who want revenge.

258
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:13,730
How interesting.

259
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:16,220
But this time, I'll take my own revenge.

260
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,230
Not someone else's.

261
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:20,000
Toward me?

262
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,480
How are you going to take revenge?

263
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:26,660
Are you going to kill me or something?

264
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,980
What's the use in killing you?

265
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,630
Perhaps your son will do.

266
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,000
Oh Hyun Soo.

267
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,990
I met him.

268
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,490
Don't lie to me.

269
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:45,710
How would you find him?

270
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,660
I guess you make great ramen?

271
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:51,850
He said the ramen his father made for him every weekend was so delicious.

272
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:55,970
- What's your secret?
- You a**hole!

273
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:04,450
He didn't do anything wrong. Don't mess with him.

274
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:10,530
It's not like you killed my mom because she did anything wrong.

275
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,990
Hyun Soo misses his dad a lot.

276
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:22,500
So...

277
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,770
- I'll tell him.
- No!

278
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,840
When should I tell him?

279
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,610
Right this minute?

280
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:30,870
Or should I wait a bit...

281
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:33,140
and if he gets married at some point...

282
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,210
should I expose it then?

283
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,650
What do you think?

284
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,640
I'm sorry about everything.

285
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,220
What is it you want? Just say it.

286
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,960
Those people you killed...

287
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,670
They begged you like you're doing, huh?

288
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,710
How does it feel?

289
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:04,450
I'll tell you what my conditions are in time.

290
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,280
First, request a transfer.

291
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,230
Why transfer?

292
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,750
They wouldn't accept it even if I requested it.

293
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,840
You said you'd do whatever I say.

294
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:16,630
All right. I'll do that.

295
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:20,430
You won't mess with my Hyun Soo, will you?

296
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,450
By chance...

297
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,880
could you get me Hyun Soo's photo?

298
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,510
I beg you.

299
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,750
Did you wait long?

300
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,990
Did your visit go well?

301
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:02,240
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

302
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,620
A civil servant can't have two jobs.

303
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:07,350
Don't worry. I won't let it on.

304
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:11,960
- Let's walk.
- Okay.

305
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:25,840
What is it that you wanted to tell me?

306
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:34,460
You said your mother is in a nursing hospital, right?

307
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:39,320
There's a hospital that is affiliated with a foundation I work for.

308
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,390
There happens to be an opening.

309
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:44,150
The facility is quite nice.

310
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:47,640
And the foundation will take care of the cost.

311
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,750
Would you be interested in moving her?

312
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,640
Why are you...

313
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,070
offering it to me?

314
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,640
You just got lucky, Dong Chan.

315
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,470
Dong Chan...

316
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:10,390
It's my first time hearing that.

317
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,560
I couldn't find your father.

318
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,820
I'm sorry.

319
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,390
It's okay...

320
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:22,480
It's okay. This is more than enough for me.

321
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,480
Thank you so much.

322
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,530
Thank you.

323
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:40,970
Thank you...

324
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,970
Thank you...

325
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:00,510
How could this happen?

326
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:03,210
I can't believe Oh Cheol Young's son is a prison guard where he's at.

327
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:05,450
I have a favor to ask you.

328
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:08,100
When Oh Cheol Young requests a transfer...

329
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,050
I understand what you're saying.

330
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:12,650
- I'll see what I can do.
- Thank you.

331
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,270
So you'll never tell Oh Cheol Young?

332
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,880
Yes.

333
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:23,740
Even if he misses him,

334
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:28,130
I don't want him to have a face to miss in his mind.

[Seoul Northern District Prosecutors' Office]
Oh, my God! What in the world!

336

I saw the underground prison in your building.

337
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,830
I heard about the usage as well.

338
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,240
Prosecutor...

339
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,240
Gosh, Prosecutor!

340
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,950
I heard it's Oh Cheol Young.

341
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:57,300
I heard Oh Cheol Young killed Kim Do Ki's mom!

342
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,450
Gosh! Seriously!

343
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:02,120
Park Joo Chan, Jo Jong Geun, Choi Jong Sook and others...

344
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,510
You imprisoned them there. Do you admit that?

345
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:06,260
I just rented out the place.

346
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:09,830
It's up to the renter how he used it.

347
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:13,500
But there's no rental contract that Jang Sung Cheol signed.

348
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,810
No record of monetary transactions, either.

349
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,570
As for that, you could check the CCTV

350
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:19,440
and get the evidence you so desire.

351
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,200
There weren't any.

352
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,480
We looked through all of the CCTV footages,

353
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,860
but there weren't any with Jang Sung Cheol in it.

354
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:38,800
It must be one of the two, then.

355
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,520
Either someone destroyed the evidence or is lying.

356
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,860
You have lots of witnesses.

357
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,700
I'm sure those fools must've told you,

358
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,330
who locked them up in there in the first place.

359
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:51,920
How would I trust what the criminals say?

360
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,760
What if they're in it with you to entrap him?

361
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:05,630
Look, Prosecutor Kang.

362
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:08,990
If you conduct such a biased investigation,

363
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:12,580
this isn't looking good.

364
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:16,780
Why do you think I'm being biased?

365
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:36,440
I'm sorry for all the trouble I caused you.

366
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,070
Live in peace when you go there. Don't cause trouble.

367
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,530
Okay.

368
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:44,320
I will.

369
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:53,830
Sorry for troubling you all this time.

370
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,520
No worries.

371
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:02,220
What are you talking about?

372
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:05,250
Ms. Han Mi Ae who was supposed to get transferred to our nursing hospital.

373
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:07,190
She passed away.

374
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,470
[Visitation Room]

375
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:09,530
It's more inconvenient for you to come here from Seoul, huh?

376
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:11,560
Don't even mention it.

377
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,710
A real prick is in charge of me.

378
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:15,090
It doesn't matter.

379
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:17,750
I won't be coming back here.

380
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:21,700
I'm the one...

381
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,260
who sent you here.

382
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:26,010
You did?

383
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:29,380
That was the last act of tolerance toward you.

384
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,170
What kind of bulls*** are you spewing?

385
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:33,960
I heard you hurt someone again before you came here.

386
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,510
Oh, that f***er?

387
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:40,980
I messed him up a little. He tattled already?

388
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:44,580
You transferred me here because of that f***er, right?

389
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,790
Did you think I wouldn't know?

390
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,120
Get him!

391
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,460
Stop him!

392
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:04,000
Get down!

393
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:09,700
Geez...

394
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,460
Because of you, that prison guard

395
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:17,500
received injuries that kept him hospitalized for four weeks.

396
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:24,360
Because of that, he couldn't visit his mother who had dementia.

397
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,670
When she didn't see her son who used to visit her often,

398
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:31,790
prison guard Han Dong Chan's mother...

399
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:39,870
Hyun Soo...

400
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:42,500
My Hyun Soo...

401
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,450
I heard she wished that her son would become a civil servant.

402
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:11,460
She believed that to be the only way he could lead a decent life.

403
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:15,380
I heard she used to say that all the time.

404
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,810
Despite his tough circumstances, Han Dong Chan

405
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:19,430
passed the examination.

406
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:21,980
I'm starting to get bored here.

407
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,990
How much longer do I have to listen to this?

408
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:27,160
If she hadn't gotten dementia,

409
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,930
she wouldn't have...

410
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:33,350
sent her son to the prison where his father was.

411
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:37,650
Prison guard Han Dong Chan...

412
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:42,370
He's your son, Hyun Soo.

413
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,490
Are you kidding me?

414
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,440
I heard you wanted this.

415
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,980
You're lying, right?

416
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,880
You made all this up, right?

417
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,220
In the end, your son...

418
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:12,010
also lost one and only family because of you.

419
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:18,260
Your ugly lunacy...

420
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,880
even stabbed your son.

421
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,790
No...

422
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:25,460
No, that can't be.

423
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,860
Hyun Soo...

424
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,870
Wait. Wait!

425
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:31,380
Tell me this isn't true!

426
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,270
Come on!

427
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:38,490
Geez...

428
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:40,110
I can't even believe...

429
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:42,930
that you're treating me to an eel meal.

430
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:44,890
With this, I'm paying off my debt.

431
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:45,920
What debt?

432
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,310
The eel you bought me that day.

433
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:49,120
Ah, that search and seizure?

434
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,970
Geez!

435
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:54,670
Why do you bring that up again? How embarrassing.

436
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:59,160
You shouldn't be embarrassed about it.

437
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:02,080
I was wrong, yet I turned on you.

438
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,630
I'm sorry I got angry with you.

439
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,770
Prosecutor Kang is right.

440
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:11,650
I kidnapped criminals using a premium taxi.

441
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:20,180
How could you turn yourself in while eating eel?

442
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,010
You're kidding, right?

443
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:26,840
Ask Prosecutor Kang for details.

444
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,730
She's investigating it right now.

445
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:30,970
Sorry I'm telling you this so late.

446
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:33,170
Hey, is it really true?

447
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,600
Hey, Sung Cheol...

448
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:40,430
Eat up. Won't you eat it up?

449
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:42,660
How can I eat this now?

450
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:46,740
You'll regret this big-time later.

451
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:50,920
This is the first and last eel I'm buying you.

452
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:59,230
You'll come to visit me, right?

453
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:01,170
You make all your hoobaes do all the work.

454
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:03,340
You have nothing to do.

455
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,740
How can you joke now?

456
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:08,280
I guess I could.

457
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:12,660
Gosh, I'm so much at peace strangely.

458
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:15,360
Makes me wonder when was the last time I was so peaceful.

459
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,590
Your glass is empty.

460
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,830
My job is over now.

461
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:38,760
How about you, Prosecutor?

462
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,410
Did you investigate everything thoroughly?

463
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:43,080
Yes.

464
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,280
Did you bring a warrant?

465
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,430
Or am I getting arrested on the spot?

466
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:59,030
Kim Do Ki, I don't think...

467
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,660
I can arrest you.

468
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:15,220
There isn't enough evidence.

469
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:17,820
Why do you think I'm being biased?

470
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,390
Without any evidence,

471
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:21,630
why are you saying you colluded with Jang Sung Cheol

472
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:23,960
and Kim Do Ki for torture, kidnapping, and imprisonment?

473
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:27,250
You can make it simple and go for criminal concealment charges.

474
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:29,680
Discuss it with your attorney.

475
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,690
Which option will be more advantageous to you.

476
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,770
Okay...

477
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:47,590
I'm sure you're not suggesting that for my sake.

478
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,510
With this, someday...

479
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:53,280
I might be able to hold you by the collar big-time.

480
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,830
Rather than get grabbed by the collar,

481
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:59,020
I'd rather quit my job.

482
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:07,370
Baek Sung Mi won't bring up private prison.

483
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:11,770
But you could be in jeopardy then.

484
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:14,460
Are you worried about me right now?

485
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:17,510
I'll protect myself.

486
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:19,750
You saw everything I did.

487
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,970
I'm a lawbreaker.

488
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:24,830
I didn't say you weren't.

489
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:28,650
There are extenuating circumstances.

490
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,240
"Although you may let go of 100 criminals,

491
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,200
don't punish one innocent person."

492
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:39,690
People who were hurt by those 100 criminals...

493
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:43,880
You protected those people.

494
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,510
At the risk of becoming a lawbreaker.

495
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,770
If you don't arrest me,

496
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:55,940
you're neglecting your duty.

497
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:01,110
I'll risk it, too.

498
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:03,220
Kim Do Ki...

499
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:07,440
you're worth that risk.

500
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,830
I know the law isn't perfect.

501
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,290
Thank you for protecting those people...

- Why?

00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:10,010
I'll ask you once again in this place.

667
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:13,710
Are you the real killer...

668
00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:17,060
who killed the victim?

669
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,220
Witness, sit down.

670
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:37,810
Yes...

671
00:45:37,810 --> 00:45:40,200
I'm the real killer.

672
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:01,600
Because of me...

673
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:06,940
you were falsely accused and spent 20 years behind bars, Mr. Kim Chul Jin.

674
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:09,410
I deeply apologize to you.

675
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:12,900
I'm very sorry.

676
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,840
The apology isn't enough!

677
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,680
How could this be!

678
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:19,300
And...

679
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:22,290
I also apologize to the victims

680
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:26,000
whose life I took and their families.

681
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:28,580
I'll...

682
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:31,160
be punished until the day I die.

683
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:33,540
He should die!

684
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:48,610
Mr. Kim Chul Jin.

685
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:50,200
Congratulations.

686
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:52,750
Thank you.

687
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:55,310
You've been through so much.

688
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:56,450
Thank you.

689
00:46:56,450 --> 00:46:58,720
Go on home now.

690
00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:02,630
Good job.

691
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,210
Oh, that Baek Sung Min and the twins.

692
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:07,470
The hearing hasn't happened yet?

693
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:08,810
It's next week.

694
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:11,840
I just hope their sentences aren't shortened.

695
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:14,230
The twins will get a life sentence, but

696
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:15,830
only Baek Sung Mi will get ten years.

697
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:17,520
That's quite impressive.

698
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:21,440
She's the one who got all those criminals off on probation.

699
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,540
She's definitely not someone to underestimate.

700
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:25,370
A big law firm must be representing her.

701
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:27,760
Why not donate that money to me instead?

702
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,920
- Why to you?
- Me?

703
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,990
I do tons of good work.

704
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:34,440
I specialize in retrials.

705
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:36,860
Isn't this your first retrial?

706
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:39,060
I will continue this way.

707
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:40,330
Keep going like this.

708
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:42,490
Let's go.

709
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,920
It's 12,000 won.

710
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:17,610
Please pay with this.

711
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:19,810
Okay, will do.

712
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:47,660
The building on Haeshinro, Paju in Gyeonggido.

713
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:49,350
It's yours, right, Baek Kyung Mi?

714
00:48:49,350 --> 00:48:51,040
Paju?

715
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,390
Did I own a building like that?

716
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:55,780
It's under the ownership of a paper company overseas.

717
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:57,950
A subsidiary of Nakwon C&C.

718
00:48:57,950 --> 00:48:59,690
I see...

719
00:48:59,690 --> 00:49:02,720
I did take over my sister's business.

720
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,610
But I haven't reviewed everything yet.

721
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:05,880
But why do you ask?

722
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,840
You knew that building is being used for prostitution, right?

723
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:13,340
I mean, I just rent out the building as the owner.

724
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:15,460
How would I know about that?

725
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:17,260
It's not like I own one or two buildings.

726
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:18,570
Wow...

727
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:20,780
The blood sure is thicker than water.

728
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:23,660
I heard that same thing from Baek Sung Mi a year ago.

729
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:25,050
From where you're sitting.

730
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:27,220
Gosh, I got it, I got it.

731
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:28,820
I'll get rid of it.

732
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:30,350
No big deal.

733
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:35,750
I'll fully cooperate with you, Prosecutor.

734
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:38,280
Just hang onto my sister.

735
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:42,820
I guess you two don't get along well?

736
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:45,860
How could that be?

737
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:48,780
I totally love my sister.

738
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:51,920
It's just that we do things differently.

739
00:49:55,650 --> 00:49:58,630
Gosh, Baek Sung Mi...

740
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:00,290
F***...

741
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:07,290
So what if I put away one?

742
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:09,120
Exactly the same kind appears again.

743
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:10,930
It's so stressful.

744
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:14,240
Prosecutor, smile.

745
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:18,040
I'd be the only one who gets old by stressing out.

746
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,470
Fine, everyone, come out.

747
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:21,270
I'll catch all of you.

748
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:24,950
Still, your complexion looks great.

749
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:26,700
Looks so moisturized.

750
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:28,180
Really?

751
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:29,920
Keep it.

752
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,500
- Thank you.
- This is Prosecutor Kang Ha Na's office.

753
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:33,900
Just a moment, please.

754
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:36,460
Prosecutor, you know the civilian who caught a gangster running away last night?

755
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:40,010
They identified the license place and comes up as a premium taxi.

756
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:42,020
Did they check the CCTV?

757
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:43,660
I'll check.

758
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:47,010
What is the location?

759
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:49,050
Let me check the CCTV.

760
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:16,060
So simple.

761
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:23,870
Hi, Kim Chul Jin's retrial ended well.

762
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:26,200
I saw the news.

763
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,460
He asked me to tell you that he thanks you

764
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:30,830
for getting his family back.

765
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:33,350
You should get ready to get back to work.

766
00:51:33,350 --> 00:51:35,390
Bluebird Foundation and Rainbow Transportation.

767
00:51:35,390 --> 00:51:38,030
I'm short on help with both organizations.

768
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:40,100
I'm not interested yet.

769
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:42,150
Before you get older, CEO...

770
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:43,580
you should travel more.

771
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:45,060
Should I come over right now?

772
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,850
- No.
- How come?

773
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:52,540
I want to have the spacious and pleasant area all to myself.

774
00:51:52,590 --> 00:51:54,360
I'm hanging up.

775
00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:00,840
Are you set?

776
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:03,530
- Yes. Here you go.
- Okay.

777
00:52:04,810 --> 00:52:07,090
[Prosecution seat]

778
00:52:09,270 --> 00:52:11,090
Here is the verdict.

779
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:17,650
It's a cop.

780
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:20,040
Hey! It's a cop.

781
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:22,910
Hi!

Please stop.

Please pull over.

785
00:52:29,530 --> 00:52:32,470
- We'll get going!
- Please pull over.

You ran the red light.

792
00:52:55,930 --> 00:52:58,090
You're not wearing seat belts, either.

Running the red light, no seat belt for the driver,

no seat belt for the passenger.

796
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,830
I'll be enforcing all of those regulations.

Yes, I'll be enforcing them.

799
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:10,150
Defendant Goo Young Tae's appeal is dismissed
