333
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,350
Put the chicken head along
the sword's way. You know?

334
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,900
Hey, it's easy for you to say.

335
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,780
Hyungnim, can't we just
shoot it with an arrow?

336
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:10,120
Chairman isn't good with his stick.

337
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,580
He can't even use the sword.

We have no weapons.

346
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:47,750
The Gwangsan that you
were talking about.

347
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:50,000
- Are you sure it's here?
- Yes.

348

There's no way it's not here.

here somewhere.

Because we must.

We must find it and tell that prosecutor

00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:09,980
Hey, Chief Kim. Please...

501
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:11,800
Chief Kim...

502
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,810
I get it. I get it. Hey!

503
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:18,700
♫ My dreams that were distant all day ♫

504
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:26,430
Hey, Chief Kim!

505
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:27,850
You're scaring me.

506
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:29,090
Hey, let's talk.

507
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:30,340
Hey, you don't know this.

508
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:32,310
Do you know how much I looked
out for you behind the scenes?

509
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:33,720
It's true!

510
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,960
Yeah. But this is unfair.

511
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,350
To be blunt, do I own U-Data?

512
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:41,420
Am I the chairman?

513
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:43,200
Hey, Kim Do Ki.

514
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,610
I'm just an employee.

515
00:43:45,610 --> 00:43:47,370
A salaryman.

516
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:49,110
Don't come.

517
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:50,340
Hey, Chief Kim.

518
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:51,720
Don't be like this!

519
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,070
I didn't do anything wrong, man!

520
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:00,540
Yes. Hello?

521
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,930
- Are you Choi Kyung Koo?
- Yes, I am.

522
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:06,100
I'm Prosecutor Kim Min Soo from the Supreme
Prosecutors' Office, Organized Crime Division 2.

523
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:08,900
Pro... prosecutor?

524
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:12,620
I'm calling because it's been confirmed
that you're connected to financial crime.

525
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:14,600
Fin... fin... financial crime?

526
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,680
Why are you on the phone now?

527
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,970
Hurry up and come out!

528
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:23,510
Wait, wait.

529
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:25,230
- I'll be right back.
- Wait here?

530
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:26,580
What are you doing?

531
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:27,780
52...

532
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:30,330
What are you doing? Come out! Come!

533
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:32,590
Oh, no...

534
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:34,770
Hello?

535
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:36,810
It hung up.

536
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:40,580
- He said not to hang up.
- What are you doing? Come out!

537
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:42,490
Let's go together. Hurry!

538
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:45,000
D***!

539
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,350
Where is everybody, you a**holes?

540
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:49,710
I'm glad you called.

541
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:52,660
What trouble? Trouble is here!

542
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:54,920
What?

543
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,790
The warrant has been issued?

544
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,190
They're coming here? Geez!

545
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:26,080
Geez! I'm going bonkers!

546
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:28,560
Hey, you! Don't come! Don't come!

547
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:34,100
- Don't come, a**hole!
- Kim Do Ki.

548
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:35,870
What do you see at 10 o'clock direction?

549
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:37,410
Don't come!

550
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:39,760
That's Gwangsan.

551
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:45,970
You a**holes! Where were you?

552
00:45:45,970 --> 00:45:47,090
Kill him! No!

553
00:45:47,090 --> 00:45:50,300
I'll buy an apartment in Gangnam
for whoever catches him!

554
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:51,610
Kill him!

555
00:45:51,610 --> 00:45:53,550
Yes, sir!

556
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,130
Don't come!

557
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:22,000
Stop it! Stop it, you crazy bastard!

558
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:32,930
You think you won, huh?

559
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:34,680
Don't kid yourself!

560
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,710
I told you last time.

561
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:41,290
You guys can't take anything
away from me.

562
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:44,720
Kim Do Ki, you think this
is the only Gwangsan, huh?

563
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,270
The morons and sons of
b****es who pay me

564
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:50,480
50 won, 100 won,
and download videos are

565
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,170
all my Gwangsans
(mine/data center), a**hole!

566
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:54,180
Do you understand?

567
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:56,300
If I go in here and press a button,

568
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:58,330
no matter what you guys try to do,

569
00:46:58,330 --> 00:47:01,200
you'll never get rid of my precious videos,

570
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:06,470
my pile of money, and my
treasure, you moron! Never!

571
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,890
Kim Do Ki, move!

572
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,690
Geez...

573
00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:49,600
Who the hell are you?

574
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,110
Hey!

575
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:53,030
D*** it.

576
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:55,690
Who the hell are you?

577
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:58,150
S***...

578
00:47:58,150 --> 00:47:59,600
That a**hole...

579
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:09,530
Ow! It hurts so much!

580
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:15,550
I'm sorry. Sorry...

581
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:18,200
I'm so sorry... It hurts so bad.

582
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:19,920
I'll do as the law says.

583
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,270
I'll pay for my crime.

584
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:25,620
But the person whom you need to
pay back isn't here anymore.

585
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:27,640
How will you pay for it?

586
00:48:31,790 --> 00:48:34,530
What the hell are they doing?

587
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:36,380
What do you think we're doing?

588
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:38,270
You'll find out soon.

589
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:42,000
All right. Okay, okay.

590
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,420
Okay, for real.

591
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,540
Kim Do Ki, you win.

592
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:50,040
I'll step down from my chairman position.

593
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,570
I'll be good.

594
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:52,910
Chairman.

595
00:48:52,910 --> 00:48:56,380
Please let me live.

596
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:03,090
How much could I
believe you, Chairman?

597
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:04,740
Let me live, let me live...

598
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:06,820
Let me live. Believe me. Believe me...

599
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:08,890
This hurts so much...

600
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,670
Aren't you going to answer the call?

601
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:30,010
It keeps ringing.

602
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:36,300
Since you're a CEO, so many
people are looking for you.

603
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:42,730
But I got you first.

604
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,500
No matter how much I think
about it, I just don't get it.

605
00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:57,280
Why did you do that to me?

606
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,770
I didn't hurt you or your kid.

607
00:50:00,770 --> 00:50:02,530
I really don't get it.

608
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:05,560
You're the CEO for Bluebird, huh?

609
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:27,010
Boy, I'm starving.

610
00:50:27,010 --> 00:50:29,080
Let's go and eat some chicken.

611
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:29,940
Sounds good.

612
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:31,640
- One chicken per person?
- Deal.

613
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:34,040
- Draft beer?
- Cool.

614
00:50:53,970 --> 00:50:55,860
How impressive.

615
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:37,340

617
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,300
What?

618
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:45,970
Over there.

619
00:52:49,310 --> 00:52:51,490
Police squad, this way!

620
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:57,160
S***...

621
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,830
What the hell is all this?

622
00:53:19,290 --> 00:53:23,320
It was so hard to get here! Mommy!

623
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,920
Hey, guys, get those.

624
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,440

But who pays us for this job?

629
00:53:47,270 --> 00:53:48,800
We used quite a lot of explosives.

630
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,560
We should include treatment
cost and hazard pay.

631
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:54,300
But where do we get paid though?

632
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:56,360
Kim Do Ki.

633
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:58,360

Yes.

- No!

641
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:24,100
I'll take it with me!

00:56:48,510 --> 00:56:50,460
I told you to keep your doors locked.

674
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:51,660
Where is Jo Do Cheol?

675
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:53,890
I'll let you get away with it
up to this point.

676
00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:57,470
Park Yang Jin and three core
executives are currently missing.

677
00:56:57,470 --> 00:56:58,990
They're on the run.

678
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:00,770
The guy who just left.
He's Kim Do Ki, right?

679
00:57:00,770 --> 00:57:02,250
This was at the scene?

680
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:03,900
So? Did you come to arrest me?

681
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:08,030
There have been 192,752 voice phishing
cases for the last three years.

Hit me just once.

683
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:10,800
- I can do it.
- Louder.

684
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,720
- "I can do it!"
- Did you guys come for part-time jobs?

685
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,410
- What?
- Born in 2002.

686
00:57:14,410 --> 00:57:15,360
I got goosebumps.

687
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,630
I heard voice phishing is good
at cutting off its tail.

688
00:57:17,630 --> 00:57:19,630
Then we should catch
what's above the tail.

689
