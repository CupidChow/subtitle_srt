Why?

16
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,260
You don't like it?

17
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,740
No, Chairman. That's not it...

18
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,480
I know now that I'm here.

19
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,050
Someone like me doesn't suit you, Chairman.

20
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,290
You know what kind of woman I am.

21
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:07,880
Don't say such a thing.

22
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,690
You're someone I adore.

23
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,460
From now on, live comfortably under my wings.

24

- But Chairman-
- Song Mi.

25

How much longer would I live?

26
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,570
For that short while,

27
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:38,470
couldn't you stay by this old man?

28
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,420
Don't say stuff like that, Chairman.

29
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,510
You're a lifesaver to me, Chairman.

30
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:47,330
To me, you're a lifesaver.

31
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,250
Am I qualified to do that?

32
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:56,490
To be loved by someone like you?

The doctor we're seeing today. He's the top ophthalmologist in the country.

34

Would I be able to get better?

35
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,510
Don't worry.

36
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,500
I won't leave you to be sick, dear.

37

You know that I get things done when I set my mind to it.

38

How could a beautiful person like you be in my life?

39

How could a woman have such a terrible destiny?

Hey, how dare you come here, you b****!

You, crazy b****!

42
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,520
You killed him!

43
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,170
Bring him back, b****!

44
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:48,490
How dare you!

45
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,880

It's pretty creepy in here.

49
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:23,590
I might go crazy in here if I had to stay here.

Hey, you punks...

Please give me some food. I'm sorry.

00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,570
I'm sorry...

Hey...

70
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,630
Please let me see Maria just once.

71
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:20,400
My Maria can't sleep well without me.

72

I'm sure Maria misses me a lot.

Any place would be better than here. Don't you think?

Get me out, you rat.

80
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,110
Mr. Choi, are you okay?

81
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:08,240
- What happened?
- They took them all.

82
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,700
- CEO Jang.
- What the hell are you doing?

83
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,960
Don't worry about your prisoners.

84
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,150
I'll take good care of them.

85
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,360
Just think of it as leaving your goods with me. Like you did before.

86
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,810
Why are you taking it this far?

87
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:37,210
What are those brothers to you?

88
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:40,400
Do you think I'm doing this just to save Director Goo?

89
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,990
I planned this entire thing.

90
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,300
What?

91
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,100
I have a huge loss, thanks to you.

92
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,920
I plan on getting compensation for damages.

93
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,830
Look forward to it, CEO Jang.

94
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,590

I'm okay.

- No, more than that...

what do we do about the prisoners?

100
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,410
Let's go to the hospital first.

101
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,140
Stand up.

102
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52,770
I'm ready.

103
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,060
Don't worry.

104
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,950
This is safe only for you.

105
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:29,300
It's all my fault.

106
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,990
I'm sorry.

107
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,920
You said that...

108
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,670
Chairwoman Baek would treat the prisoners as they deserve.

109
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,500
I had agreed to what you said.

110
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:43,000
It's not only your fault.

111
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,160
I was mulling over this before.

112
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,690
What would I do if we get a client

113
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:53,340
to get Chairwoman Baek?

114
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:58,180
So what did you decide?

115
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,590
That's not important.

116
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:03,690
The fact that I even thought about that is the problem.

117
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,560
Let's find the prisoners first.

118
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,650
And what do we do after that?

119
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:11,970
We don't have cells any longer.

120
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:30,500
Mr. Park, are you all right?

121
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,300
Yes, I just have a fracture.

122
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,510
But they said you should be careful for a few weeks.

123
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,410
I'm more worried about Go Eun than me.

124
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:40,040
She's been doing that all this time.

125
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,860
She must be so upset right now.

126
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,660
Choi Min ran away.

127
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,730
Do you think you can find them?

128
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,240
I still haven't gotten an apology from that punk.

129
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,260
I'll find them for sure.

130
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:38,580
When did you see Goo Young Tae last?

131
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:41,380
Gosh, my back...

132
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,820
Sorry, I couldn't hear that. What did you say?

133
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,180
When was the last time you saw Goo Young Tae?

134
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,750
When was it?

135
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,590
The day he came out of the detention.

136
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:59,160
He came to me saying it's unfair.

137
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,330
That you're giving him a hard time.

138
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:02,820
He asked me to teach you a lesson.

139
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,020
But I was able to calm him down.

140
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,390
You owe me one, Prosecutor.

141

[Background Information]
You say such a thing with so much pride.

142
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,990
I'd be too embarrassed to say that.

143
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,540
You know where Goo Young Tae is, don't you?

144
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,450
Then would I be just sitting here doing nothing?

145
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:24,910
I'd do everything in my power to find him and send him out of the country.

146
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,300
What did you say?

147
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,880
He made me so much money besides the healthcare business.

148
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,300
Me?

149
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,900
I'd take care of him in prison if I have to.

150
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,650
I'm sure you do.

151
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:39,190
Because Goo Young Tae is your tail.

152
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:43,280
The organ trafficking business belongs to you.

153
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,040
You can't act as well as I expected.

154
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,540
For spending a few dollars on wrong things,

155
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:58,260
I can't believe I'm being accused like this.

156
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,500
I've given up my precious time

157
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,160
to comply to be a material witness.

158
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,990
How dare you treat me like this?

159
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:07,670
I know.

160
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:11,040
Why would you give up your precious time?

161
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,020
For someone who hates to lose out.

162
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,740
You must've been curious as to what I'd ask you.

163
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,350
Wanting to check how much I know.

164
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:23,630
You shouldn't have come in here.

165
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,420
But since you're here, talk to me.

166
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,380
Did you make some money?

167
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,380
It was pretty profitable.

00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,200
Move it!

337
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,700
Are you okay?

338
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,390
When is the fire truck arriving?

339
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:26,980
It's here.

340
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,090
Get out!

341
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,830
What's that?

342
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,300
An ambulance.

343
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:44,530
- Detective.
- Yes?

344
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:46,290
We have to chase him!

345
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,400
It's Kim Do Ki.

346
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,490
- Chase him.
- Yes.

347
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:00,030
Don't lose that ambulance.

348
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:03,140
It's the cops.

349
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:06,440
- Seok Tae.
- Yes, ma'am.

350
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,040
Give me an ashtray.

351
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:12,520
That way!

352
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,590
Move!1

353
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,940
What?

354
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,100
Hey!

355
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,160
Prosecutor.

356
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,340
- Why-
- Let me borrow your car.

357
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,420
What did you say?

358
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:03,850
Prosecutor! What are you...

359
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:06,420
Prosecutor! Pro-

360
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:08,270
Prosecutor!

361
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,730
You got ballsy.

362
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:17,820
Even starting a fire at the embassy.

363
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,440
Young Tae...

364
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,040
Give him back.

365
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:24,230
I'd like to exchange Goo Young Tae and the prisoners.

366
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:27,880
Tomorrow night at 8 p.m. On the World Cup Bridge.

367
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,990
- We'll decide the trade method.
- Right now...

368
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:34,060
I can't do that right now.

369
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,460
If you try to deceive us,

370
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:39,830
it will be cumbersome to see Goo Young Tae in the future.

371
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:42,960
It's like that if you have to visit him in prison.

372
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:59,670
I'll give you an update.

373
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,700
The batter is up. Park Jae San.

374
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,620
This game will be a crucial one.

375
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,600
He swings.

376
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:13,620
Out!

377
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,530
No hit.

378
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:18,630
That was a fast pitch, but...

379
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:20,720
It was tough for the batter.

380
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,090
He was a little slow.

381
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:24,130
Here comes Lee Jung Soo.

382
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:26,150
He still has one more chance.

383
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:28,500
Here are his stats.

384
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,650
Strike!

385
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:31,950
Two outs.

386
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,480
That was a foul.

387
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:40,580
Stay still, punk!

388
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,060
Hey, drive straight!

389
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:49,680
Let's drop them off.

390
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:55,350
Joo Chan, untie me.

391
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:57,660
- Joo Chan.
- You do it!

392
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,000
Wake up.

393
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,060
Hey, pull over.

394
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:12,370
Stop, man! Stop, stop, stop!

395
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:13,660
Open it.

396
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,460
Be free!

397
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,120
Go!

398
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,820
- Let's go.
- Okay.

399
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,110
Let's go!

400
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,780
Hey, hold it. My arm hurts.

401
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,320
Joo Chan.

402
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:49,700
Where are we going right now?

403
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,320
To cut off the head of that little rat.

404
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:07,210
Oppa, can we eat first?

405
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:09,060
I'm starving. I'm about to croak.

406
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:11,270
No, Maria first. Maria first...

407
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:13,930
[Big hyungnim]
Be quiet, everyone.

408
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:16,740
Where are you?

409
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,700
Where are you taking us?

410
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,700
Any place would be better than here. Don't you think?

411
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:25,180
You were right.

412
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:27,720
This is heaven all right.

413
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,620
You punk...

414
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,380
Why are you answering the phone?

415
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,770
What's up?

416
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:35,210
Well...

417
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:40,480
Hand it over.

418
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:45,610
Speaking.

419
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:48,050
You're the one who locked us up

420
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:49,800
all this time, right?

421
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:52,000
How disappointing.

422
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,070
I rescued you, yet being accused like that.

423
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:56,180
Who'd believe bulls*** like that?

424
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:59,430
It's good that you don't believe everything you hear.

425
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:02,220
I'll give you time. Check.

426
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,300
Whether I'm your friend or foe.

427
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:07,300
How would I know who the hell you are?

428
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:11,290
I'm sure there's something you're more curious about.

429
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:14,040
Kim Do Ki of Rainbow Transportation.

430
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:18,290
Look for Chairwoman Baek Sung Mi of Nakwon Credit after you confirm.

431
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:32,000
I have no words...

432
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:41,920
Get them when they show up at Rainbow Transportation.

433
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,270
Yes, ma'am.

434
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,170
Get me more tea.

435
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:04,500
Let's talk.

436
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:17,370
He'll be okay, right?

437
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:19,400
Geez, I'm scared for some reason.

438
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,060
Let's go.

439
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,200
Give me Goo Young Tae.

440
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,230
You told me to get him. So why-

441
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,390
I have to do something before that.

442
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:55,680
What is that?

443
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,740
I don't have to answer you, do I?

444
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:01,190
I guess it's not something you're proud of.

445
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:03,840
You can turn things back.

446
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,420
If you give me Goo Young Tae,

447
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,440
I'll forget what happened today.

448
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,970
Goo Young Tae isn't the end of it all.

449
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:15,890
There's someone else behind this.

450
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:18,570
I need Goo Young Tae to reveal everything.

451
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:21,810
My answer is the same.

452
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:23,800
Please leave.

453
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:27,590
Back to square one.

454
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:33,390
So you choose revenge ultimately, right?

455
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,160
Not me.

456
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,780
I won't avenge anymore.

457
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,190
I'll cancel the case I requested.

458
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:46,460
I'll find Goo Young Tae wherever you hid him.

459
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:48,140
That's my job.

460
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,180
I'll keep the promise.

461
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,790
I will.

462
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:58,590
For sure.

463
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,410
Oppa, I have to go to the restroom.

464
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:41,440
This is it!

465
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,390
I'm sorry.

466
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:56,100
Geez...

467
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:00,600
I'll pay for the dry cleaning and
sign up for the insurance right away.

468
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,100
Thank you.

469
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,340
I'm not a bad person.

470
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,900
Save me!

471
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,750
F***!

472
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,060
What the f***!

473
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:11,490
Geez, so annoying!

474
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:17,190
Maria is waiting for me.

475
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:19,060
She's not waiting for me.

476
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:22,100
I'll crush him with a hammer when I find him.

477
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,640
We have to find his weakness.

478
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:27,760
What the heck? You eat by yourselves?

479
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,730
- Where is mine?
- I got one, man.

480
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,340
That guy is a driver at Rainbow Transportation.

481
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:36,140
That twerp.

482
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,040
I confirmed it.

483
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,300
You jerk, who did you bring with you?

484
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,420
Bastards...

485
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,820
So you were hiding here.

486
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:54,360
Let's go quietly.

487
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,590
Hey! Hey, hey!

488
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:05,930
How about me?

489
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:08,780
How about me? Take me with you!

490
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,370
How about me?

491
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:12,450
Geez, this is nuts!

492
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,140
Stop, stop, stop!

493
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,370
Police!

494
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:20,490
Wait a minute! Wait!

495
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:23,000
- What's going on?
- Stop!

496
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,730
Geez! Open it!

497
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:29,570
Geez!

498
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:31,330
Hurry up and go!

499
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:33,700
- Hurry up and go!
- Calm down.

500
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,420
- What's this about?
- Just go!

501
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:37,590
Please... seriously!

502
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:39,770
Go! Please!

503
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:45,670
I'm sure you've figured things out by now.

504
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:48,120
And I'm sure you know your place as well.

505
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,880
So, what's your next step?

506
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,370
Turn yourself in? Or take revenge?

507
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:55,870
Do we even have a choice?

508
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,930
Of course. It's your life.

509
00:40:57,930 --> 00:41:00,460
Then why did you drag us here?

510
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:03,710
I'm willing to support one of your choices.

511
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:05,730
How about it?

512
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:09,360
Would you like to take revenge the right way?

513
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:05,820
- Prisoners?
- Young Tae first.

514
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,540
You kept your promise.

515
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:18,930
It's your turn.

516
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,870
Open up the goods.

517
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:41,160
What are you doing?

518
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,540
Sorry.

519
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:44,980
I couldn't trust you.

520
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:47,260
Don't worry. I brought them all.

521
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,570
Go.

522
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,260
Are you ready?

523
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:55,940
Kim Do Ki.

524
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,600
That s***ty rat.

525
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,520
That twerp.

526
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:37,090
Good to see you, f***er.

527
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:02,120
It's the police. You better leave.

528
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,560
CEO Jang, you...

529
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,300
Open the door!

530
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:06,810
What the hell?

531
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:11,120
Back up, back up!

532
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,440
Bastard...

533
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:30,880
Go Eun.

534
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:45,480
Kim Do Ki.

535
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:49,510
We'll take Goo Young Tae.

536
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:51,680
You need to go with us. Arrest him.

537
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:56,880
You're under arrest for aiding and abetting a suspect.

538
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,360
- You have the right to an attorney...
- No, that's not it.

539
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,200
- We're-
- It's okay.

540
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,360
I'm sure I'll be released if I didn't do anything wrong.

541
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:07,310
- What are you doing?
- Yes, sir.

542
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:09,390
Step aside.

543
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:22,010
[Statement Recording Room]

544
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:23,710
Wait.

545
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:26,250
Why don't you question Goo Young Tae, Prosecutor?

546
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:27,930
I'll take Kim Do Ki.

547
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:30,500
How did you know where Goo Young Tae was?

548
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:33,510
Did you follow me?

549
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:36,840
I'll cancel the case I requested.

550
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:39,680
I'll find Goo Young Tae wherever you hid him.

551
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,570
That's my job.

552
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:54,780
Yes, it's Goo Young Tae.

553
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:57,100
Kim Do Ki has him in his car, and they're going somewhere.

554
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:58,710
Okay. Got it.

555
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:04,500
They found Goo Young Tae. Would you like to go with us?

556
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:07,380
Is that important?

557
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:08,980
Detective Park.

558
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:11,400
Kim Do Ki isn't an accomplice. He's an informant.

559
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,390
He's even more suspicious then.

560
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:16,210
How would he give out info the cops don't even know?

561
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:18,170
Just trust me and let him go.

562
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:20,440
What do you mean let him go?

563
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:23,500
Sunbaenim.

564
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,920
Didn't you jump on suspects when you had your doubts?

565
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,440
Kim Do Ki again this time. How many times is this?

566
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,810
Investigate him thoroughly while you're at it.

567
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:38,670
Why?

568
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:41,160
- Is there a problem?
- No, sir.

569
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:47,040
All right...

570
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,550
You know this place, right? You've been there.

571
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:58,180
I heard you told Prosecutor Kang where the crime scene is.

572
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:01,330
Is that a crime?

573
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:03,880
Usually, parties involved know intel like that.

574
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:05,490
And that's what I want to check.

575
00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:08,610
How did you know to go there?

576
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:16,590
Why were you there with Goo Young Tae?

577
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:29,490
Keeping your mouth shut right now

578
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:32,670
won't help you too much, Kim Do Ki.

579
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:39,350
I'm hungry.

580
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:53,510
I said let's go to the beach.

581
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:55,010
- We should.
- Really?

582
00:47:55,010 --> 00:47:56,800
This is so good.

583
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:59,130
Eat a lot.

584
00:47:59,130 --> 00:48:00,510
Right?

585
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:01,690
So delicious.

586
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:04,600
Why aren't they working and just kicking back?

587
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,550
Where is Maria...

588
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:12,550
Oh, it's Maria.

589
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:34,060
Maria, long time no see. How have you been?

590
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:35,940
Yes, Unni...

591
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:37,590
You know...

592
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:41,190
did Mr. Jo finish his punishment?

593
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:42,930
What do you mean by that?

594
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:45,020
You told me that...

595
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:47,180
Mr. Jo...

596
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:51,070
Mr. Jo can't come here until he serves his time.

597
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:52,570
But...

598
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:55,720
I think I just saw Mr. Jo.

599
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:07,860
Maria, wait a little longer.

600
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:09,280
Let's hurry.

601
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:12,850
I need to go to the fermentation factory.

602
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:14,670
I'm worried about Maria and...

603
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:17,990
I have to check if Jo Jong Geun showed up.

604
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:19,820
I'll go to U-Data.

605
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:22,160
To Park Yang Jin's villa and the prisoners' homes.

606
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,810
Go Eun, I'll go with you.

607
00:49:23,810 --> 00:49:25,780
How can you go in your condition?

608
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:29,890
Go Eun, will you be okay by yourself?

609
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:32,680
I'll call you if anything comes up.

610
00:51:04,990 --> 00:51:06,620
Choi Jong Sook.

611
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:08,510
Don't come!

612
00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:10,700
Don't come in! You're all dead if you come in!

613
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,050
Hey!

614
00:51:12,050 --> 00:51:14,080
Hey! Please send me to jail.

615
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:16,890
Hey! So those punks can't come after me.

616
00:51:16,890 --> 00:51:18,670
Go! Don't come!

617
00:51:18,670 --> 00:51:20,490
Let me live!

618
00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:22,700
Geez! Please save me!

619
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:25,050
Save me!

620
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:27,980
I'm sorry.

621
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:30,890
I've been reflecting a lot in here.

622
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:32,660
I'll change.

623
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:34,650
I'll live a good life.

624
00:51:34,650 --> 00:51:35,950
Please...

625
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:39,700
- Please let me go...
- Is she truly regretting?

626
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:41,500
Or are they just crocodile tears?

627
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:43,130
Are you being truthful?

628
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:44,730
Of course.

629
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:46,700
I can promise you.

630
00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:51,670
Yes, I'm sure there will be a day you get to leave here.

631
00:51:52,850 --> 00:51:54,340
Really?

632
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:56,890
If you would let me...

633
00:51:56,890 --> 00:51:59,520
But don't think that's the end.

634
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:02,230
We'll always watch you...

635
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:04,720
and the day you break your promise,

636
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,720
we'll come for you again.

637
00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:13,990
Perhaps reform is...

638
00:52:13,990 --> 00:52:18,250
only possible because of the fear that comes from

639
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:23,300
the inhumane treatment you receive after committing a crime.

640
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:27,100
However...

641
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:31,180
could you say that is a true reform?

642
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:54,750
Maria!

643
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:01,210
Long time no see.

644
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:04,460
I've been watching you at the factory earlier.

645
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:06,460
The atmosphere at the factory changed a lot.

646
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:07,900
So lively...

647
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:10,410
You're dressed so nicely.

648
00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:13,570
I really missed you a lot.

649
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:15,390
I thought of you every night

650
00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:17,390
and you came in my dream.

651
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:19,580
Didn't you miss me?

652
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:21,470
Let me give you a hug.

653
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:26,430
Maria, hop on!

654
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:28,730
Maria!

655
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,510
Geez, Maria, wait a minute...

656
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:41,130
Oh, no. Maria, wake up.

657
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:47,200
Maria, open your eyes.

658
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,700
Maria. You, son of a b****, who the hell-

659
00:53:51,790 --> 00:53:53,630
Hey, why are you here?

660
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:57,580
To get my things.

661
00:53:57,580 --> 00:54:01,080
You crazy nut. How can you hit people like that?

662
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:02,250
Let's see.

663
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:05,220
Oh, no. She can't have a scar on her face...

664
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:07,120
Maria, wait. Open your eyes.

665
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:09,320
Oh, no... blood...

666
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:10,530
Her face...

667
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:13,070
Maria. Maria...

668
00:54:13,070 --> 00:54:15,470
The customer can't answer the call right now. You'll be...

669
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,600
Go Eun, please answer.

670
00:54:24,490 --> 00:54:26,740
The customer can't answer the call right now.

671
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:34,280
Open it.

672
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,510
What are you doing?

673
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:21,470
