Shim Woo Sub? I heard he was transferred to the Prosecutors' Office already.

Already?

I heard he went to the Northern District Prosecutors' Office.

he tips well as long I refill ice for his drinks.

So I always check up on him every 15 minutes.

- Every 15 minutes?
- Yes.

And he was in the room every time

84
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,390
Yes. You saw the CCTV at the entrance.

- All right. Thank you.
- Sure.

There is no evidence.

00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,000
And he has an alibi at the room salon.

117
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,600
He has a definite motive, and the circumstances are clear.

118

But you release him for lack of evidence?

How can I do that?

133
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:07,520
The cause of death is the loss of blood from stab wounds to his chest and abdomen.

134
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,500
Seeing how there are lots of bruises all over his body,

135
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,060
it looks like the physical altercation was quite severe.

136
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,370

173
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,490
Are you struggling over something?

174
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:16,610
What would I have done if I had
gone through something like that?

175
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:18,260
Would I have been able to endure it?

176
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,140
Something like that should never happen.

A bamboo is too straight that
it breaks easily in the strong wind.

But no matter how strong the wind,
the grass stands back up.

You may behave like bamboo, but

Please avenge my brother, Prosecutor.

Please, for my brother, this once...

You know who the criminal is, and the circumstances are clear.

190
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:48,200
He has a definite motive, and the circumstances are clear.

191
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,950
You let go because of a lack of evidence. I know that is your reality.

192
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,630
But you release him for lack of evidence?

193
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,920
The people we couldn't catch...

194
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,220
We're only trying not to accuse an innocent.

195
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,670
Even if we have to release 100 criminals.

196
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:05,000
How about those people who got hurt by those 100 people?

197
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,920
For people who got hurt by those 100...

198
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:13,320
What can you do for those people?

199
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,630
Revenge.

200
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:54,370
There's a case I used to investigate.

201
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:56,720
Our office...

202
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:00,680
called it "A murder case without a body."

203
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:06,150
Literally, the circumstances point to the fact that a victim was murdered

204
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,410
but there is no corpse.

205
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,310
So we can't even press a murder charge.

206
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,520
And...

207
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,710
Prosecutor, save me...

208
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:20,640
Shim Woo Sub got kidnapped while cooperating with me.

209
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,300
And my colleague...

210
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,840
died in his hands.

211
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:44,160
But there is nothing I can do.

212
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,970
If my way doesn't work,

Thank you for coming to

While we're working on your case,

the taxi meter will be left turned on.

00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:10,990
As for the taxi fare, after the case is closed,

226
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:12,500
it will be settled at a later time.

there may be extra charge.

How could this be?

243
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:18,030
The case that the pastor was going to ask us to do is coming through the prosecutor.

244
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:21,000
The murder case without a body where Go Dong Hee was killed.

245
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,740
The murder of Wang Min Ho.

246
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,810
Including the kidnap of Shim Woo Sub.

247
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:27,280
It was all done by one person.

248
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,560
Wow, he's evil.

249
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:33,130
I'm sure Goo Young Tae will try to kill Shim Woo Sub.

250
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:34,730
We must prevent that.

251
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,550
What do you all think?

252
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:39,850
I feel a little uneasy since it's coming from a prosecutor, but oh well...

253
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:41,520
We should rescue the person first.

254
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,910
I'm in, too.

255
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:47,850
Then it's unanimous.

256
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:50,420
So how would we find Shim Woo Sub?

257
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,970
At this rate, Shim Woo Sub

258
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:55,020
will likely become the next victim of murder without a body.

259
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:58,190
If we find out the secret behind the disappearance of the body,

260
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:00,160
we may be able to find Shim Woo Sub.

261
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,690
If that happens, we can arrest Goo Young Tae, too.

262
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:06,740
Then let's dig into the murder case without a body first.

263
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:08,920
Okay.

5283 in operation.

265
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:31,430
There are three CCTVs at the crime scene.

266
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:33,740
There are no blind spots.

267
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:38,000
If Go Dong Hee left that office, one of the cameras would've captured it.

268
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:39,530
But there was nothing...

269
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:43,000
It means there's no way that Go Dong Hee would've

270
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,500
left that place just fine.

271
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,350
Unfortunately, yes.

272
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:47,130
That's why the Prosecutors' Office was

273
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:49,350
certain that it was a murder case even without his body.

Didn't you investigate everything last time?

295
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,830
I was wondering if you've thought of anything else.

What's this?

What did they put in here instead of water?

306
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:46,050
Probably liquid like this.

307
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:50,270
Something that needs a lot of water while disposing of the body.

308
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:53,640
- One that vaporizes water.
- By chance, sulfuric acid?

309
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,100
Sulfuric acid?

310
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,860
When sulfuric acid absorbs water, it generates a lot of heat.

311
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:01,150
What if they dispose of the body with sulfuric acid

312
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:02,820
and clean the site with water...

313
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,600
that explains the vaporization.

314
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,350
But not anyone could obtain sulfuric acid.

315
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:09,530
Especially one that's strong enough to melt a body.

316
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:23,890
Sulfuric acid?

317
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:25,500
This is still a guess.

318
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:29,030
But there's no trace of Goo Young Tae obtaining sulfuric acid.

319
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:31,660
That means he got it through illegal means.

something is off.

330
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:09,500
If you take a look at their transaction record,

331

they're primarily for meals or company dinners.

Nice shot!

500
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,000
Nice shot?

501
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:12,580
So...

502
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,100
does it hurt?

503
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:16,430
I haven't even started.

504
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:23,950
Follow me if you can.

505
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,000
S***...

506
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,160
What?

507
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,300
Goo Young Tae ran away?

508
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,200
He didn't come outside. Is there another door?

509
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:51,100
That little rat. Where did he go?

510
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,340
- Prosecutor Kang Ha Na.
- Kim Do Ki?

511
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,880
Send an ambulance to Gopyeongdong, Icheon, number 12.

512
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,570
- Hurry!
- What?

513
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:20,210
You're here.

514
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:22,210
Where is Shim Woo Sub?

515
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:31,920
All his organs have been removed.

516
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:38,500
Team Leader, you need to come out here.

517
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,490
What is it?

518
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:54,180
Is it true that a huge organ trafficking ring was arrested?

519
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:55,800
How many victims are there?

520
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:06,150
A large organ trafficking ring in the country

521
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,300
has been arrested by the police, shocking everyone.

522
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:13,600
They had kidnapped and murdered ordinary citizens by extracting organs

523
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:16,460
and brutally disposing of the bodies.

524
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:20,060
They're having difficulty identifying the victims.

525
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:23,260
The police is doing everything possible

526
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:26,130
to capture the prime suspect Goo. Reporter Lee?

527
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:33,450
By chance, you didn't know about this from the get-go, did you?

528
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:35,410
Did I know about it?

529
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:39,220
I started the organ trafficking business.

530
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:40,020
What?

531
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:42,220
The organs from the people you imprisoned...

532
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:43,790
I sold them.

533
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:47,020
- Hey, Baek Sung Mi!
- I only gave away a cornea or a liver.

534
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:48,930
I made sure they weren't life-threatening.

535
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:50,880
How can you say that?

536
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,760
How can you sell human beings?

537
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,660
You were punishing them already anyway.

538
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:56,180
I was doing the same thing.

539
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:59,380
Taking something from the bad guys and help the good guys.

540
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:01,930
What's wrong with that?

541
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:03,880
I only killed Jo Do Cheol.

542
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,230
I couldn't help that.

543
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:08,040
You know that better than me.

544
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:11,660
I'm the one who's stunned here.

545
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:14,440
I didn't hurt any ordinary citizens.

546
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:18,280
I had no idea he would do this behind my back.

547
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:22,190
Goo Young Tae, that son of a b****...

548
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:25,490
Wait.

549
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:28,680
Director Goo is the only one who knows about this.

550
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:33,850
- No way...
- When Shim Woo Sub got kidnapped,

551
00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:36,590
Director Goo was at the scene.

552
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:42,440
Those two morons plotted...

553
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:44,900
and deceived me?

554
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:48,680
We'll take care of both Goo Young Tae and Director Goo.

555
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:49,630
No.

556
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,720
I'll get Director Goo.

557
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,300
What?

558
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:21,200
Serial murders and organ trafficking.

559
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:25,200
We won't be able to wrap up this case like the previous cases.

560
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:29,150
I'll catch Goo Young Tae and turn him over to the Prosecutors' Office.

561
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:30,520
You can't do that.

562
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,300
They might find out about our private cells.

563
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:35,670
But still, we can't put him in a private cell.

564
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:40,100
That's like sending him home after jumping through the hoops to capture him.

565
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:43,430
We have to find Goo Young Tae's victims, too.

566
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:47,430
Let's think this through.

567
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:49,680
There has to be a way. Okay?

568
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:55,790
Do you still think that your way is right?

569
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:01,410
[Do not be overcome by evil,
but overcome evil with good.]

570
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:07,820
Mr. Kim!

571
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:09,590
Do Ki!

572
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:43,790
Did you take Goo Young Tae?

573
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:46,780
The Regional Investigation Team is on this case.

574
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:51,840
If you're holding onto Goo Young Tae, you might be in trouble, too.

575
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:55,260
No, I'm not.

576
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,200
Fine then.

577
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:05,230
You saw what Goo Young Tae did, right?

578
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:07,510
I've been mulling over...

579
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:11,268
how the judicial department

580
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:13,070
of this country could...

581
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:15,850
appropriately punish a guy like that.

582
00:47:15,850 --> 00:47:17,940
And your conclusion is?

583
00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:26,930
You still called me.

584
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:31,360
You need me in order to identify the victims.

585
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,160
Isn't that right?

586
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:39,410
Aren't you taking revenge for others instead of your own?

587
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:41,620
Don't jump to conclusions.

588
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:47,860
But why does it look like you're taking out your anger on them?

589
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,580
I apologize for what I said last time.

590
00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:58,420
You're more considerate of the victims.

591
00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:01,580
How the law could condemn...

592
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:04,010
and punishment that everyone could accept.

593
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:07,910
I'll show you.

594
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:35,510
Gosh, what beautiful weather.

595
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:39,000
It's a wonderful day to take care of business.

596
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:41,940
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

597
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:43,990
I even bought a new car.

598
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:46,570
Just trust me.

599
00:48:59,090 --> 00:49:01,260
They're keys to the cells.

600
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:03,620
You keep them from now on.

601
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:06,980
Are you serious?

602
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:09,170
I don't have anyone to manage them anyway.

603
00:49:09,170 --> 00:49:11,030
Just pay the rent on time.

604
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:15,890
I'll give sleeping pills to Director Goo and put him to sleep.

605
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:21,490
Take him then.

606
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:15,320
Hi.

607
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:18,110
- Sit.
- Yes, ma'am.

608
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:24,760
We'll go in after Chairwoman Baek gives Goo the sleeping pills.

609
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:29,190
Could we trust Chairwoman Baek?

610
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:32,130
She moves solely based on her own interest.

611
00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:36,270
It wouldn't benefit her at all to choose Director Goo now.

612
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:41,750
But still, we should be thoroughly prepared.

613
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:44,500
That's why I installed a camera.

614
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,060
You're okay, right?

615
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:47,580
Yes, ma'am.

616
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:57,910
It's pretty creepy in here.

617
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:01,870
I might go crazy in here if I had to stay here.

618
00:51:01,870 --> 00:51:03,460
I know.

619
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,760
Hey, you punks...

620
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:10,830
You should've lived as decent people, to begin with.

621
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:17,470
- Seok Tae.
- Yes, yes?

622
00:51:17,470 --> 00:51:20,020
No one has ever stayed by my side before like you.

623
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:21,650
Do you know why?

624
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:25,180
When you work by my side, you could get greedy.

625
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:28,560
Why wouldn't you when you're working with so much money?

626
00:51:28,570 --> 00:51:32,970
I have entrusted you with all that since you know your place.

627
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:34,860
You're too kind.

628
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:37,490
Only for you...

629
00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:41,880
I'm willing to forgive once, no matter how huge of a mistake you made.

630
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:45,230
Young Tae's deeds...

631
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:48,880
You really didn't know?

632
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:52,170
No. I'm sorry.

633
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:56,010
No need.

634
00:51:56,010 --> 00:51:58,690
It's not like you did it.

635
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,280
Let's drink.

636
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:03,680
Yes, ma'am.

637
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:21,260
Forgiveness is all about timing, Goo Seok Tae.

638
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:25,480
I just gave you a chance...

639
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:28,400
and you missed that chance.

640
00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:32,070
Get some deep sleep for the last time.

641
00:52:32,070 --> 00:52:37,110
Going forward, you'll flip out every single day thinking of the chance you just missed.

642
00:52:38,010 --> 00:52:40,820
This is my revenge, Seok Tae.

643
00:52:48,350 --> 00:52:49,880
Did you see that?

644
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:05,070
What's wrong?

645
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:08,640
I should fall over right about now, but...

646
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:11,580
I'm not. So are you stunned?

647
00:53:18,430 --> 00:53:21,340
- Seok Tae.
- Baek Sung Mi!

648
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:23,510
How dare you turn me over to those punks?

649
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:26,050
- Seok Tae...
- After all I did for you?

650
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:27,970
- Sorry, Seok Tae.
- Come here!

651
00:53:27,970 --> 00:53:29,370
Let go of me, you a**hole!

652
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:31,140
Help me!

653
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,190
What...

654
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:55,130
What's with him?

655
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:08,010
- What happened?
- She got us.

656
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:10,160
It was pre-recorded?

657
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:14,440
Did they lead us to this location because...

658
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:16,050
The cells!

659
00:54:39,470 --> 00:54:42,270
Mr. Choi, are you okay?

660
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:46,550
- What happened?
- They took them all.

661
00:55:01,970 --> 00:55:05,370
- CEO Jang.
- What the hell are you doing?

662
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:08,870
Don't worry about your prisoners.

663
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:11,050
I'll take good care of them.

664
00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:14,370
Just think of it as leaving your goods with me. Like you did before.

665
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:17,430
Why are you taking it this far?

666
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:19,650
What are those brothers to you?

667
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:23,160
Do you think I'm doing this just to save Director Goo?

668
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:26,630
I planned this entire thing.

669
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:33,020
What?

670
00:55:38,290 --> 00:55:42,330
Timing and Subtitles

671
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:50,470
♫ The moonlight in the exhasting darkness ♫

672
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:55,590
♫ He doesn't even want to take me along ♫

673
00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:57,580
♫ Across the rainbow ♫

674
00:55:57,580 --> 00:56:00,550
[The presumption of innocence until proven guilty. Even though you let go of 100 criminals, don't punish one innocent person. It's so humane. Not even one person.]

675
00:56:00,550 --> 00:56:03,680
[In Korea, call 112 for emergencies/Korean Crime Victims Support Association]

676
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:08,920
[Taxi Driver]

677
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:11,790
I plan to receive plenty of compensation for damages.

678
00:56:11,790 --> 00:56:13,170
Look forward to it, CEO Jang.

679
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:14,720
Let's find the prisoners first.

680
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,300
What will you do after that? We don't have cells anymore.

681
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:18,550
I found them.

682
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:19,830
I can't reach Go Eun.

683
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,300
Where are the prisoners?

684
00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:24,270
Turn over Goo Young Tae. You told me to get him.

685
00:56:24,330 --> 00:56:25,540
- But why...
- I must do something before that.

686
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:26,260
What is that?

687
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:28,330
Do you want to take proper revenge?

688
00:56:28,330 --> 00:56:30,410
You've got quite an interesting setup here.

689
00:56:30,410 --> 00:56:31,750
What are you trying to do?

690
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:32,730
Revenge, of course.

691
00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:34,600
Escore Mr. Kim!

692
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:37,050
Come out right now if you want to save your colleagues.

693
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:39,800
♫ Standing alone in the path ♫
