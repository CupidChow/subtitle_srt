Hello.

332
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,390
- Mr. Kim, this time...
- So they made money by posting those videos...

333
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:30,100
and they made more money as they deleted those videos?

334
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:33,230
They'd stop uploading them for the duration that the female victim requested

335
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:35,820
and when that duration expired, they'd repost them.

336
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,830
That's how they maximized their profit.

337
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:42,370
The female victim probably couldn't get out

338
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:48,320
of this evil cartel until she lost everything.

339
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,240
So this prosecution team will review the ledgers that were confiscated,

340
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,050
statements made by the relevant parties, and statements by the witnesses,

341
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:58,210
we'll press charges against all U-Data employees in the strategic planning team.

342
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:01,390
As for Chairman Park Yang Jin who commanded all these crimes

343
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,420
will be investigated for charges against producing illegal pornography, extortion, assault,

344
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,810
violating the animal protection law, the possession of firearms,

345
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:09,440
and instigating murder, in addition.

346
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:14,210
On the list of the accused, there's a lawyer who was a former prosecutor.

347
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,840
For violation of the Attorney-at-law Act,

348

What is the cause?

I can't discuss it yet since it's still under investigation.

They're on the run.

I'm sorry, but it hasn't been resolved yet.

359
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,140
By the sheer size of the charges, you've cracked a major porn ring.

00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:48,470
What was one difficult aspect of the investigation?

361

I'll conclude the briefing here. Thank you.

Congratulations.

The reporters speak so well of you, Prosecutor.

364
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:07,240
Do you think so, too? That we did a good job?

365
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:09,850
Is it because we couldn't catch Park Yang Jin?

366

It's not unusual that the big honcho runs away after things are exposed.

the situation was already wrapped up by someone else.

369

To destroy the evidence, he blew up the entire structure,

370
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:24,560
and someone keeps intercepting the perpetrators we should catch.

371
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,200
He's screwing us over this way.

372
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,450
But we don't even know what's going on.

373
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:33,210
So why should we be complimented?

374

The explosion is one thing, but

656
00:43:48,645 --> 00:43:51,245
What are your thoughts, Mr. Kim?

657
00:43:51,245 --> 00:43:53,655
- I'm not sure.
- You're not sure?

658
00:43:53,655 --> 00:43:55,475
You have to be clear where you stand.

659
00:43:55,475 --> 00:43:57,465
Yes, make yourself clear.

660
00:43:57,465 --> 00:43:58,755
Let's do it.

661
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:03,175
I'm for the operation.

662
00:44:03,175 --> 00:44:05,105
CEO!

663
00:44:05,105 --> 00:44:06,355
Look.

664
00:44:06,355 --> 00:44:09,685
Despite the fact that there are so many victims,

665
00:44:09,685 --> 00:44:13,015
the cases that don't request any help from Bluebird

666
00:44:13,015 --> 00:44:14,705
is voice phishing cases.

667
00:44:14,705 --> 00:44:16,075
It's so weird.

668
00:44:16,075 --> 00:44:17,535
With other crimes,

669
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:19,735
people comfort the victims

670
00:44:19,735 --> 00:44:21,285
and encourage them.

671
00:44:21,285 --> 00:44:24,745
But for voice phishing, they scold victims.

672
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:26,635
They didn't do anything wrong.

673
00:44:27,495 --> 00:44:28,985
Hey, woman!

674
00:44:28,985 --> 00:44:30,635
Are you out of your mind that

675
00:44:30,635 --> 00:44:33,535
you lost our rental deposit over a few phone calls?

676
00:44:33,535 --> 00:44:36,515
Logically speaking, who wires 5 million won over a phone call?

677
00:44:36,515 --> 00:44:38,565
You got scammed on a whim...

678
00:44:38,565 --> 00:44:40,265
Did you lose more money?

679
00:44:40,265 --> 00:44:44,845
Well, I wasn't trying to scold Hyungnim.

680
00:44:45,955 --> 00:44:49,295
Ordinary people who are furthest from breaking the law.

681
00:44:49,295 --> 00:44:51,865
Good people who could live without the rule of law.

682
00:44:51,865 --> 00:44:54,465
Ironically, these people are

683
00:44:54,465 --> 00:44:57,015
becoming victims of voice phishing.

684
00:44:57,015 --> 00:45:00,725
When a prosecutor calls you up out of the blue citing legalese,

685
00:45:00,725 --> 00:45:02,705
of course, you're intimidated.

686
00:45:02,705 --> 00:45:06,515
When that happens, it's not important that the person is a real prosecutor or not.

687
00:45:06,515 --> 00:45:10,155
It becomes more crucial to proving yourself innocent.

688
00:45:11,545 --> 00:45:14,065
I think this is our job.

689
00:45:14,915 --> 00:45:19,025
I give my vote to CEO's opinion.

690
00:45:23,225 --> 00:45:25,195
As for me, well...

691
00:45:25,195 --> 00:45:28,915
You can't pass out flyers and stuff next time.

692
00:45:28,915 --> 00:45:30,885
All right.

693
00:45:30,885 --> 00:45:32,875
Actually...

694
00:45:32,875 --> 00:45:35,455
I wanted to agree from the get-go.

695
00:45:35,455 --> 00:45:37,565
Don't lie.

696
00:45:37,565 --> 00:45:39,955
You scolded me the most.

697
00:45:39,955 --> 00:45:41,895
But thanks.

698
00:45:41,895 --> 00:45:43,595
Aigoo...

699
00:45:43,595 --> 00:45:44,875
Now, now, now.

700
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:48,275
I'd like Mr. Kim to lead this case.

701

As you know, I'm in this condition.

- Sorry.
- Don't worry.

703

I'll call you if anything comes up.

All right. Let's move.

[Call Records]
Oh, you know, Kim Do Ki drives a taxi.

710
00:46:11,365 --> 00:46:13,465
It's probably because he has his call app open.

711

When I'm able to speak like a prosecutor later,

I'll tell you in detail then.

718
00:46:31,355 --> 00:46:33,255
Yes, Prosecutor.

719
00:46:33,255 --> 00:46:35,065
What are these blanks for?

720
00:46:35,065 --> 00:46:36,985
That means there was no signal.

721
00:46:36,985 --> 00:46:39,255
- No signal?
- It means there was no sign of life.

722
00:46:39,255 --> 00:46:40,965
It doesn't have any call records.

723
00:46:40,965 --> 00:46:43,265
It means he turned off his cell phone and didn't use it.

724
00:46:47,715 --> 00:46:50,075
Then all these blanks mean...

there was no sign of life...

Oh, my!

What do I need to do, prosecutor?

728
00:47:04,725 --> 00:47:06,655
For your bank account,

729
00:47:06,655 --> 00:47:09,295
before the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) and us prosecution can start investigating,

730
00:47:09,295 --> 00:47:12,855
you have to move your current balance to the location that we designate.

731
00:47:12,855 --> 00:47:14,555
I'll do that.

732
00:47:14,555 --> 00:47:16,425
Should I do that right away?

733
00:47:22,115 --> 00:47:24,775
Yes, I put it where you told me to.

734
00:47:26,455 --> 00:47:29,365
Then we'll conduct an investigation on that account.

735
00:47:29,365 --> 00:47:30,945
We'll need about two days.

736
00:47:30,945 --> 00:47:33,375
After that, it will be redeposited to your account safely.

737
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:35,495
- Do you understand?
- Yes, prosecutor.

738
00:47:35,495 --> 00:47:37,525
Go back to your residence now

739
00:47:37,525 --> 00:47:39,395
and wait. I'll give you a call.

740

Thank you!

741
00:47:55,595 --> 00:47:57,505
- Good day.
- Thank you.

742
00:48:32,225 --> 00:48:33,745
Why don't you catch him?

743
00:48:33,745 --> 00:48:35,565
What if he runs away while you're watching him?

744
00:48:35,565 --> 00:48:38,605
I heard voice phishing is good
at cutting off its tail.

745
00:48:43,985 --> 00:48:46,765
Then we should catch
what's above the tail.

746
00:49:27,145 --> 00:49:29,425
I told you not to leave onions on the ground.

747
00:49:29,425 --> 00:49:31,325
Put the onions on the counter.

What did you do with my money?

After I received the money,

753
00:50:04,225 --> 00:50:06,925
I forgot and left it in the restroom.

754
00:50:06,925 --> 00:50:08,315
So I went back right away.

755
00:50:08,315 --> 00:50:10,405
But the money disappeared.

756
00:50:10,405 --> 00:50:12,535
Did you get greedy when you saw that money?

757
00:50:12,535 --> 00:50:14,065
No. No, I didn't.

758

I really left it in the restroom.
