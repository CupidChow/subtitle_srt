Don't you remember?

164
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,390
You jumped off from the third
floor while running away.

165
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,180
You've been in a coma for
almost two weeks.

166
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,550
- Your legs are okay, right?
- Yeah.

167
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,550
Okay. You can walk just fine.

168
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,240
Hey, hey, hey.

169
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,890
Don't mess around. Tell her the truth.

170
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:22,740
The way I see it, she'll chase
you until you die.

171
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,580
She's been watching you every night.
She didn't sleep at all.

172
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:27,010
She's been watching me every night?

173
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:28,900
Yeah! With her eyes wide open!

174
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:36,460
I wasn't your caregiver,
so no need to feel bad for me.

175
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,350
See you later.

176
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,230
Let's turn him over to the trial
prosecution before lunch,

177
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,160
and go onto the next case.

178
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,330
I wish you'd take a break.

179
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,890
I don't need to rest.

180
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:53,760
I rested here more than enough.

181
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,280
- And it's boring to rest.
- Excuse me.

182
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,900
Oh, no, Maria. The bleeding
won't stop. Doctor...

183
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,680
Can you stop the bleeding?

184
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,530
Geez, what do I do?

185
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,990
Is there something on my face?

186
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:08,980
Look at the dark circles
on your pretty face.

187
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,040
It means you should rest.

188
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,560
- You heard the news on Jo Do Cheol, right?
- Which one?

189
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,270
That he went missing?

190
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:18,540
That an incident occurred.

191
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:27,350
Geez!

192
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:30,370
If you're going to barge in like that,
don't bother knocking.

193
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,520
It's more offensive!

194
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,950
I'll take Jo Do Cheol's case.

195
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,100
Why would you?

196
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,060
I heard he's missing. We should find him.

197
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:40,070
So why would you do that?
The police are investigating.

198
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:41,850
Jo Do Cheol recently...

199
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,490
Don't mind me.

200
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:47,980
I was focusing on making coffee.
I didn't hear a word.

201
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,680
Have a seat.

202
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,210
Should I step outside for a moment?

203
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:54,550
Where do you think you're going?

204
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,160
Sit down over here, too.

205
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,580
Sure.

206
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,230
Oh, thank you.

207
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,980

208
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,820
You know Bluebird Foundation, right?

209
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,060
- Yes, it's a victim advocacy group.
- Right.

210
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,700
He's the CEO of the Bluebird Foundation.

211

Nice to meet you. I'm Jang Sung Cheol.

212

Yes, nice to meet you.

213
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,140
And she's the hands-on staff for
Bluebird that I mentioned before.

214
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,590
Prosecutor Kang Ha Na.

215
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,630
Out of the blue? What do you mean?

216
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:28,030
He needs someone with tenacity.

217
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,480
I recommended you.

218
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,720
You're known for your tenacity.

219
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,020
You don't like it?

220
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,530
No, it's not that I don't like this.

221
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,710
You never mentioned it. I'm hearing
this for the first time.

222
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:43,940
You represent the Prosecutors' Office,
Prosecutor Kang. Do a good job.

223
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,090
Don't worry about that
Jo Do Cheol or whatever.

224
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,300
I'm not sure if now is the
right time to say this, but

225
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,170
I look forward to working with you.

226
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,310
No, I'm the one looking forward to it.

227
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:59,290
Prosecutor Jo told me a lot about you.

228
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:00,950
I heard you're pretty famous
in the Prosecutors' Office.

229
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:02,950
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

230

- What did he tell you?
- Nut...

Nut?

232
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,010
That you're a brainiac.

233
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,720
That you're a brainy prosecutor.

234

There's no way Sunbaenim
would say that, though...

The police aren't able to pinpoint
Jo Do Cheol's whereabouts yet.

239

What is this world coming to that punks
like that are walking around free?

Well, I guess he's kind of like a swordsman.

Why do you drive the longest, but

00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:24,330
why do you make the least?

304
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:26,930
I'm not sure.

Do you go driving around

307

Mister, that's embezzlement.

Em... embezzlement?

309
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,760
If you fill up and drive around with
company money, that's embezzling.

I think this is a conspiracy.

That's why she could be the perfect person.

just an object we asked her to keep.

I have a question.

Couldn't she have tried
to run away somehow?

I agree. She could've called the police, too.
