If you look at the scratched imprint,

it looks like he was hit by a steel frame.

have something like this.

Even if they run away, they leave
circumstantial evidence.

It's like they were hunted down.

331
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,720
Hunted down?

332
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,750
Yes, I just sense it.

333
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,970
If the bad guys are being hunted down,
isn't that good for society?

334
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:35,480
It's good if they disappear
within the boundary of the law.

335
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:38,130
If not, it's just another crime.

00:34:16,473 --> 00:34:18,373
Please save us...

492
00:34:18,413 --> 00:34:20,543
Please...

493
00:34:22,213 --> 00:34:24,453
Please let us go...

494
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,513
You know Park Jung Min, right?

495
00:34:44,003 --> 00:34:46,103
We...

496
00:34:48,793 --> 00:34:51,203
did all these things to our friends.

497
00:34:51,203 --> 00:34:53,763
We did this, too.

498
00:34:53,763 --> 00:34:56,783
Oh, we did all these on
the same day, Detective.

499
00:34:56,783 --> 00:34:58,693
I asked the school to transfer me.

500
00:34:58,693 --> 00:35:01,153
- We deserve to be expelled.
- Please punish us.

501
00:35:01,153 --> 00:35:04,163
Yes, we should go to jail.
We deserve to go to jail.

502
00:35:11,793 --> 00:35:14,723
Did you find Seung Tae's body?

503
00:35:14,773 --> 00:35:19,273
There should be blood all over
the place, falling off from so high.

504
00:35:19,303 --> 00:35:21,893
But everything was cleaned up
when we went down.

505
00:35:21,893 --> 00:35:23,813
Mr. Hwang said so.

506
00:35:23,813 --> 00:35:25,823
Our friend's body...

507
00:35:25,823 --> 00:35:29,243
won't be found anywhere in the world.

508
00:35:30,813 --> 00:35:32,903
Please let us pay for our sins.

509
00:35:32,903 --> 00:35:35,343
- Or else, we'll die!
- We'll die.

510
00:35:35,343 --> 00:35:37,463
- I want to live!
- Please punish us.

511
00:35:45,173 --> 00:35:47,573
Detective, please...

512
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:49,793
We're turning ourselves in. Please...

513
00:35:49,793 --> 00:35:51,343
I want to live...

514
00:35:52,663 --> 00:35:54,743
[Angel Bakery]

515
00:35:56,263 --> 00:35:58,383
- Why did you tell them that?
- About what?

516
00:35:58,383 --> 00:36:01,333
You said they'll never find their
friend's body anywhere.

517
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:03,043
It's true, though.

518
00:36:03,043 --> 00:36:07,233
How can they find a body
when he's alive and well?

519
00:36:24,163 --> 00:36:27,363
You're the uncles who keep changing.

520
00:36:27,363 --> 00:36:29,573
Geez, this isn't the picture I had in mind.

521
00:36:29,573 --> 00:36:31,143
Should I get ready?

522
00:36:31,143 --> 00:36:32,783
Uh-huh.

523
00:36:58,303 --> 00:37:00,133
Remember this.

524
00:37:00,133 --> 00:37:04,273
What I'm about to do is tough love.

525
00:37:11,483 --> 00:37:13,763
- Bring him.
- You do it!

526
00:37:13,763 --> 00:37:15,553
Bring him over!

527
00:37:15,553 --> 00:37:17,873
You always make me do hard work.

528
00:37:20,073 --> 00:37:24,973
The uncle you brought to the
rooftop wants to talk to you.

529
00:37:33,883 --> 00:37:36,073
Seung Tae, you son of a b****!

530
00:37:36,073 --> 00:37:37,813
Don't ever call me again.

531
00:37:37,813 --> 00:37:40,393
If you call me again, I'll kill you.
Got that?

532
00:37:40,393 --> 00:37:42,213
And listen to your teacher well.

533
00:37:42,213 --> 00:37:43,453
No matter what.

534
00:37:43,453 --> 00:37:46,273
If you want to live, listen to him
no matter what. Got that?

535
00:37:52,063 --> 00:37:54,373
You must be hungry. Let's eat.

536
00:37:54,373 --> 00:37:55,963
You like bread, right?

537
00:37:55,963 --> 00:37:59,363
Eat everything you see here.

538
00:38:01,193 --> 00:38:03,923
All this?

539
00:38:03,923 --> 00:38:05,963
How can you eat all this?

540
00:38:05,963 --> 00:38:08,653
Eat as much as you can.

541
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:11,093
It's Jung Min's treat.

542
00:38:13,023 --> 00:38:14,603
Jung Min...

543
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,053
Park Jung Min?

544
00:38:17,053 --> 00:38:20,703
Jung Min is buying you as
much bread as you can eat.

545
00:38:20,703 --> 00:38:25,133
You'll have to pay for
the bread you can't finish.

546
00:38:25,133 --> 00:38:28,643
- Well...
- You've eaten off of Jung Min all this time.

547
00:38:28,643 --> 00:38:31,083
This is the last time
Jung Min is treating you.

548
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:32,633
Hurry up and eat.

549
00:38:39,093 --> 00:38:40,933
Eat.

550
00:38:41,813 --> 00:38:44,723
Jung Min also saved you.

551
00:38:46,343 --> 00:38:48,973
I didn't want that to happen.

552
00:38:53,953 --> 00:38:56,273
For each bread you don't finish...

553
00:38:56,273 --> 00:38:59,343
you'll have to pay back Jung Min for

554
00:38:59,343 --> 00:39:03,023
all the financial and psychological
damages done to him.

555
00:39:03,023 --> 00:39:07,193
Each bread will be worth...

556
00:39:07,193 --> 00:39:08,923
Oh...

557
00:39:08,923 --> 00:39:10,663
It's quite a bit.

558
00:39:16,743 --> 00:39:18,333
I'm... I'm sorry.

559
00:39:18,333 --> 00:39:20,313
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

560
00:39:20,313 --> 00:39:23,283
I'll tell Jung Min that you apologized.

561
00:39:23,283 --> 00:39:24,643
Eat.

562
00:39:24,643 --> 00:39:26,843
I'll never do that again. Never.

563
00:39:26,843 --> 00:39:30,493
It's rewarding for me as a teacher to
hear that you'll never do that again.

564
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:31,913
Eat.

565
00:39:31,913 --> 00:39:33,973
I don't have any money.

566
00:39:33,973 --> 00:39:35,463
Geez...

567
00:39:36,473 --> 00:39:39,833
Seung Tae, you're so lucky.

568
00:39:39,833 --> 00:39:43,183
I came prepared, just in case.

569
00:39:46,613 --> 00:39:48,313
What's this?

570
00:39:48,313 --> 00:39:50,053
The place you're going to work.

571
00:39:51,753 --> 00:39:54,573
It won't limit your daily routine.

572
00:39:54,573 --> 00:39:56,823
Go work here after school.

573
00:39:56,823 --> 00:39:58,443
If you work hard,

574
00:39:58,443 --> 00:40:01,463
you'll be able to pay back before
you serve in the military.

575
00:40:03,863 --> 00:40:06,353
If you don't want to, you can run away.

576
00:40:06,353 --> 00:40:08,553
But the minute I catch you,

577
00:40:08,553 --> 00:40:11,603
you'll have to make up ten times
the hours you missed.

578
00:40:11,603 --> 00:40:15,363
You probably won't have
much of daily life left then.

579
00:40:15,363 --> 00:40:18,633
But this doesn't make any sense.

580
00:40:20,403 --> 00:40:25,343
Did any of your actions toward
Jung Min make sense?

581
00:40:29,063 --> 00:40:32,883
If you don't understand
why this is happening,

582
00:40:32,883 --> 00:40:35,653
and you're so angry that you could cry,

583
00:40:35,653 --> 00:40:39,073
think of all the friends you tortured.

584
00:40:39,073 --> 00:40:42,253
That's what you've been
doing to your friends.

Weren't you helping me for free?

You'll learn a lot of things in the future.

599

Remember this one thing.

600
00:42:09,563 --> 00:42:12,193
There's no such a thing as
a free taxi ride in life.

601
00:42:12,193 --> 00:42:14,463
Especially not premium taxi.

602
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:19,393
Pay it off little by little every month.

603
00:42:19,393 --> 00:42:22,133
As much as you feel the
monthly payment is a waste,

Hello!

609
00:43:05,153 --> 00:43:08,233
You're Jung Min's mother, right?

610
00:43:10,403 --> 00:43:11,753
Here you go.

611
00:43:15,473 --> 00:43:21,073
Our foundation started
a scholarship program.

612
00:43:21,073 --> 00:43:24,083
You understand what I'm saying, right?

613
00:43:28,033 --> 00:43:30,063
[Scholarship Certificate]

614
00:43:30,063 --> 00:43:35,223
Jung Min has been chosen for
the scholarship from our foundation.

615
00:43:35,223 --> 00:43:37,783
When he enters college after
graduating from high school,

616
00:43:37,783 --> 00:43:41,953
our foundation will pay
for the entire tuition.

617
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:44,563

No, no.

I'm grateful to you instead.

621
00:43:52,523 --> 00:43:54,063
Here. Take this.

622
00:43:57,613 --> 00:44:01,013
Wait a minute. I should buy some fish.

623
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:02,883
What should I do?
[Salted fish, from Korea, 3,000 won]

624
00:44:02,883 --> 00:44:06,753
Please give me two of each kind.

625
00:44:07,803 --> 00:44:12,053
Aigoo, the fish look so fresh.

626
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:20,413
Did all three of them transfer?

627
00:44:20,413 --> 00:44:21,553
- Not transfer. They got expelled.
- Hey.

628
00:44:21,553 --> 00:44:24,103
Then we won't have to see
those douchebags anymore.

629
00:44:24,103 --> 00:44:25,733
That's great.

630
00:44:25,733 --> 00:44:27,433
Jung Min!

631
00:44:27,433 --> 00:44:29,303
You're back, right?

632
00:44:29,303 --> 00:44:30,443
Yeah.

633
00:44:30,443 --> 00:44:31,973
You've been well, right?

634
00:44:31,973 --> 00:44:33,403
Of course.

635
00:44:33,403 --> 00:44:35,053
I'm glad you're back.

636
00:44:35,053 --> 00:44:37,573
We have exams next week.

637
00:44:37,573 --> 00:44:41,013
This is what the exam entails.
I'll text it to you.

638
00:44:53,053 --> 00:44:54,893
Good job, everyone.

639
00:44:54,893 --> 00:44:56,653
I'll sign off.

640
00:44:56,653 --> 00:44:58,273
Let's go out to eat.

641
00:44:58,273 --> 00:45:01,103
Gopchang, gamjatang, pork belly.
Go Eun, you choose.

642
00:45:01,103 --> 00:45:02,703
I want a hamburger.

643
00:45:03,573 --> 00:45:06,253
Hamburgers for team dinner?
We're not little kids.

644
00:45:06,253 --> 00:45:08,773
I think she means
she doesn't like your choices.

645
00:45:08,773 --> 00:45:11,993
Really? Okay. Then let's eat whatever
Go Eun chooses, except hamburgers.

646
00:45:11,993 --> 00:45:13,373
Ramen?

647
00:45:14,103 --> 00:45:15,943
I don't think she wants to eat with you.

648
00:45:15,943 --> 00:45:18,333
Don't interpret for me!
I don't like you for doing that.

649
00:45:18,333 --> 00:45:21,173
I'm sorry, but let's go out
to dinner next time.

650
00:45:21,173 --> 00:45:23,883
Mr. Kim, you need to go with me tonight.

651
00:45:23,883 --> 00:45:26,393
It's a dinner I'm obligated to attend.

652
00:45:26,393 --> 00:45:28,523
They'll be helpful to get to know.

653
00:45:28,523 --> 00:45:30,093
Let's meet in the front
and walk in together.

654
00:45:30,093 --> 00:45:31,433
What's this, CEO?

655
00:45:31,433 --> 00:45:35,573
When this project is over,
you said we'll be stylin'.

656
00:45:35,573 --> 00:45:37,403
Let's go somewhere fancy
and eat something yummy.

657
00:45:37,403 --> 00:45:40,283
I don't think he wants to
buy you anything fancy.

658
00:45:41,753 --> 00:45:44,983
- Geez!
- Hyungnim!

659
00:45:44,983 --> 00:45:47,813
I like tuna sashimi.

660
00:45:48,983 --> 00:45:50,943
How many rooms are available?

661
00:45:50,943 --> 00:45:52,863
We still have some room.

662
00:45:52,863 --> 00:45:54,873
That's not good.

663
00:45:54,873 --> 00:45:58,383
We have to manage vacancies well
when it comes to the rental business.

664
00:45:59,593 --> 00:46:03,703
CEO Jang will probably get angry
if I told him to hustle, huh?

665
00:46:04,943 --> 00:46:07,033
How is it going with
what I asked you to do?

666
00:46:07,033 --> 00:46:08,823
I'm getting ready, but...

667
00:46:08,823 --> 00:46:11,603
I don't think CEO Jang will
stay put when he finds out.

668
00:46:11,603 --> 00:46:13,683
We're not his subcontractor.

669
00:46:13,683 --> 00:46:15,923
We're partners.

670
00:46:15,923 --> 00:46:18,983
If the storage keeper says no,
what would they say?

671
00:46:18,983 --> 00:46:20,983
Tell me as soon as you're ready.

672
00:46:20,983 --> 00:46:22,043
Yes, ma'am.

673
00:46:22,043 --> 00:46:24,313
I'm going to the garden with Ms. Lee.

674
00:46:24,313 --> 00:46:27,333
We'll have a big deal soon.

675
00:46:27,333 --> 00:46:29,433
Prepare well with a live one.

676
00:46:29,433 --> 00:46:32,883
Dame, I'll take you if you need me.

677
00:46:32,883 --> 00:46:34,353
Seok Tae.

678
00:46:34,373 --> 00:46:37,873
You do what you're good at. Okay?

679
00:46:38,873 --> 00:46:40,233
Yes, ma'am.

680
00:46:42,773 --> 00:46:44,773
Geez!

681
00:46:44,813 --> 00:46:47,463
Geez...

682
00:47:01,753 --> 00:47:05,003
I've been meaning to get together
with you all this time.

683
00:47:05,003 --> 00:47:07,153
We finally gathered the Bluebird staff.

684
00:47:07,153 --> 00:47:08,823
Stop rambling.

685
00:47:08,823 --> 00:47:11,093
You were dragging your feet, man.

686
00:47:11,093 --> 00:47:13,153
I'm meeting you for the first time.

687
00:47:13,153 --> 00:47:14,763
I'm Jo Jin Woo.

688
00:47:14,763 --> 00:47:16,403
I'm Kim Do Ki.

689
00:47:16,403 --> 00:47:18,693
I work at CEO Jang's company.

690
00:47:18,693 --> 00:47:23,063
I see. How did you meet Sung Cheol?

691
00:47:23,063 --> 00:47:25,283
We met through Bluebird.

692
00:47:27,373 --> 00:47:29,273
He helps out at work...

693
00:47:29,273 --> 00:47:31,593
and helps me with Bluebird
when necessary.

694
00:47:31,593 --> 00:47:33,953
I rely on him a lot.

695
00:47:34,923 --> 00:47:37,543
All right. We were destined
to work together.

696
00:47:37,543 --> 00:47:40,503
- Let's raise a glass.
- Yes, let's drink.

697
00:47:42,543 --> 00:47:44,553
Here. Take a glass.

698
00:47:49,073 --> 00:47:50,543
Thank you.

699
00:47:50,543 --> 00:47:52,683
All right, all right. Let's toast.

700
00:47:52,683 --> 00:47:54,523
Now, now.

701
00:47:54,523 --> 00:47:56,913
- What should we say?
- Gosh, Sunbaenim.

702
00:47:56,913 --> 00:47:59,923
Just say what your team says.
It's fun.

703
00:47:59,923 --> 00:48:01,263
Really?

704
00:48:01,263 --> 00:48:03,093
Then I'll lead.

705
00:48:03,093 --> 00:48:06,563
- Okay. Follow!
- The law!

706
00:48:11,933 --> 00:48:13,843
Pour one more glass.

707
00:48:13,843 --> 00:48:15,583
Let's drink.

708
00:48:15,583 --> 00:48:18,363
- Should I open up hard liquor?
- Sounds good.

709
00:48:30,873 --> 00:48:36,843
♫ While strolling on a peaceful evening ♫

710
00:48:36,843 --> 00:48:42,973
♫ The face I remember always ♫

711
00:48:42,973 --> 00:48:54,873
♫ The person who gathers
sparkling stars ♫

712
00:48:54,953 --> 00:49:00,723
♫ Filling up the narrow path with scents ♫

713
00:49:00,723 --> 00:49:06,943
♫ Flowers colored under
the street lights ♫

714
00:49:06,973 --> 00:49:18,473
♫ It would be so nice to smell
this scent with him ♫

715
00:49:18,513 --> 00:49:25,073
♫ I miss you, the face that I miss ♫

716
00:49:25,073 --> 00:49:27,263
How was your day?

717
00:49:27,263 --> 00:49:31,573
I'm eating well, and
I'm living courageously.

718
00:49:31,573 --> 00:49:34,123
You have to stay healthy.

719
00:49:34,173 --> 00:49:42,973
♫ I stroll again today as I think of him ♫

720
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:48,913
♫ I stroll again today ♫

721
00:49:48,913 --> 00:49:56,973
♫ I stroll again today ♫

722
00:49:59,523 --> 00:50:01,393
Friends, listen up.

723
00:50:01,393 --> 00:50:06,023
Starting now, you have no memory
or thoughts of being here.

724
00:50:06,023 --> 00:50:09,683
And when you go into the room,
don't ask the host what he does

725
00:50:09,683 --> 00:50:13,113
or ask any personal questions,
like you've seen him somewhere.

726
00:50:13,113 --> 00:50:14,813
Keep that in mind.

727
00:50:14,813 --> 00:50:16,663
Never.

728
00:50:18,143 --> 00:50:21,083
Starting this moment,
all this never happened in your life.

729
00:50:21,083 --> 00:50:22,093
Understand?

730
00:50:22,093 --> 00:50:23,213
- Ms. Lee.
- Yes.

731
00:50:23,213 --> 00:50:25,203
- Collect their cell phones.
- Yes, Chairwoman.

732
00:50:27,553 --> 00:50:29,313
Act clever.

733
00:50:29,313 --> 00:50:33,093
Depending on how you behave,
your life could change.

734
00:50:37,833 --> 00:50:41,353
Sir, it's me. Sung Mi.

735
00:50:50,273 --> 00:50:52,373
Have you been well, Chairman?

736
00:50:53,543 --> 00:50:56,043
You look good.

737
00:50:56,973 --> 00:51:00,373
They'll be keeping you
company, Chairman.

738
00:51:00,463 --> 00:51:03,373
They're all very talented. They all
attend universities in Seoul.

739
00:51:03,373 --> 00:51:05,123
They're originally from
different provinces.

740
00:51:05,123 --> 00:51:10,273
Of course, Sung Mi.
You have good eyes.

741
00:51:10,273 --> 00:51:13,573
Even when you prepare food,
you know how to do it well.

742
00:51:13,573 --> 00:51:17,963
How did you know that
I like fish more than meat?

743
00:51:25,613 --> 00:51:27,923
It feels different, you know.

744
00:51:27,923 --> 00:51:29,543
It's alive.

745
00:51:29,573 --> 00:51:31,973
Look. The eyes.

746
00:51:31,983 --> 00:51:34,223
Don't overdo it tonight.

747
00:51:34,223 --> 00:51:36,443
Take your time and enjoy.

748
00:51:36,443 --> 00:51:38,133
I'll be back later, Chairman.

749
00:51:38,133 --> 00:51:41,083
- Okay. See you later.
- All right.

750
00:53:04,243 --> 00:53:06,153
Aigoo...

751
00:53:06,153 --> 00:53:09,593
Can you not lock our arms?
It's so embarrassing.

752
00:53:09,593 --> 00:53:11,133
What's wrong?

753
00:53:11,133 --> 00:53:13,323
I'll drive you two home.

754
00:53:13,323 --> 00:53:14,873
Oh, no, no.

755
00:53:14,873 --> 00:53:16,503
We have to go for one more drink.

756
00:53:16,503 --> 00:53:18,203
You know the food stall
at the five-way street?

757
00:53:18,203 --> 00:53:19,993
- Five-way...
- Let's have one more makgeolli.

758
00:53:19,993 --> 00:53:22,403
- You talked too much. Stop. Let's go.
- I brought you a taxi.

759
00:53:22,403 --> 00:53:24,703
Yes, thank you.

760
00:53:24,703 --> 00:53:25,743
Please look after the prosecutor.

761
00:53:25,743 --> 00:53:27,663
Bye, Prosecutor. Drive her home, okay?

762
00:53:27,663 --> 00:53:29,303
Bye, Prosecutor.

763
00:53:29,303 --> 00:53:31,263
- Thank you.
- Good night.

764
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:32,623
You know the food stall
at the five-way street, right?

765
00:53:32,623 --> 00:53:34,153
Shut up! Stop it now!

766
00:53:34,153 --> 00:53:35,543
- All right.
- Get in.

767
00:53:35,543 --> 00:53:37,063
- Bye!
- Five-way street food stall.

768
00:53:37,063 --> 00:53:38,743
You're so noisy.

769
00:53:38,743 --> 00:53:40,313
- Five-way street food stall.
- Hey!

770
00:53:50,613 --> 00:53:53,943
I'll drive you home.

771
00:53:59,773 --> 00:54:01,213
Okay.

772
00:54:09,223 --> 00:54:10,853
You can't come this way!

773
00:54:12,383 --> 00:54:14,233
Turn right!

774
00:54:36,683 --> 00:54:39,103
Oh, my gosh! Hey!

775
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:40,823
Are you okay?

776
00:54:42,923 --> 00:54:44,693
Hello!

777
00:54:45,733 --> 00:54:47,533
Are you okay?

778
00:54:52,973 --> 00:54:55,073
His BP and heart rate is normal.

779
00:54:55,073 --> 00:54:57,653
I'll inject nitro and check EKG.

780
00:55:04,263 --> 00:55:07,313
They look like bullet wounds.

781
00:55:07,313 --> 00:55:10,023
- Is he a military officer?
- Excuse me?

782
00:55:10,023 --> 00:55:13,593
Even if he is, how can he have
so many bullet wounds?

783
00:55:13,593 --> 00:55:15,293
It's weird.

784

Reappeared? What do you mean?

812

He had a rough day, and you made
