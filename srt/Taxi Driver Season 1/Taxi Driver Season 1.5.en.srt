1
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:50,770
- Pretty noona over there.
- Yes?

2
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:52,560
- Check, please.
- Okay.

3
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,470
I'll ring you up.

4
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,450
Tofu kimchi and three soju.
That will be 20,000 won.

5
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,230
I can work alone.

6
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,260
It's interrupting your studies.

7
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,340
Geez...

8
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,320
You have a great son.

9
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,230
Thank you! Come again!

10
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,720
Good night!

11
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,430
It's interrupting your studies.

12
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:18,910
There's a table and a chair.

13
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:20,830
I don't have to pay
for the seat at the library.

14
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:24,070
If you have a rush crowd,
I can help with serving.

15
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,920
You don't have to hire a part-timer.

16
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,160
- You kill two birds with one stone.
- Gosh, listen to you.

17
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,070
Oh, yeah. I got a call from your teacher.

18
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,460
He said you have to decide
which college to attend.

19
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,430
I already decided what career I'll pursue.

20
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,220
You know how I wanted
to pursue theater and film?

21
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,110
I decided to go here.

22
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,480
Military Academy?

23
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,430
I guess I have a bigger
ambition than I thought.

24
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:01,960
Are you sure you want to go here?

25
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,310
Of course. It's cool!

26
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,790
If you're doing this because of the tuition,

27
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,210
- I can get the money!
- No.

28
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:12,250
I really want to become
a commanding officer.

29
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:16,000
I heard you get a huge and expensive
military vehicle when I get a star.

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,740
I shouldn't, but when I get that vehicle,

31
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:22,170
I'll take you for a drive in secret, Mom.

32
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,920
Okay?

Timing and Subtitles

34

- Mom!
- Gosh, you're so helpful.

39

Do you think this is my first time?

40

My son, I love you.

I don't know if you'll get to have a turn.

No matter what...

44

I'll kill you with my own hands.

[Episode 5]
Oh, you're awake. Are you okay?

52
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,250
Oh, take medicine first.

53
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,250
The doctor said you should take this first.

54
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,410
Drink water. Water.

55
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,780
Drink water. You'll damage your stomach.

56
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,170
Nitro is no good if I drink water with it.

57
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,370
Really?

58
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,640
There's a medicine
you take without water?

59
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,320
So what happened?

60
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:57,120
Oh, Prosecutor Kang Ha Na
called me at work.

61
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,410
She has to go to work,
but you have no family here.

62
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:04,140
She said you fainted
in the middle of the street.

63
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,920
You can't come this way! Turn right!

64
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,960
- Go around!
- Hey!

65
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,440
Since you're in the hospital already,

66
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,020
get some rest. Get checked out, too.

67
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,220
It's okay.

68
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,650
Or get some nutritional supplement IV.

69
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,440
I'll be fine when I eat food.

70
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,470
Aigoo...

71
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:31,160
All right then. Should we grab
some food by the office then?

72
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,590
- Yes.
- Okay.

73
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,750
I heard he fainted in the streets.

74
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,150
Oh...

75
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:40,590
Well, I fell asleep because I was tired.

76
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:41,800
Nothing to worry about.

77
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,720
You sleep in the streets
because you're tired?

78
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,660
Are you homeless or something?

79
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,940
Aigoo, Go Eun sure worried
about Mr. Kim.

80
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,780
You came running here.

81
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,610
They said he's okay. He's fine.

82
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:56,440
Since we're all together, let's go eat.

83
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,580
I'll start the discharge procedure.

84
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,820
Is that something you
should say to Mr. Kim?

85
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,870
Huh?

86
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:04,600
Is it tough to say stay at the hospital for
a few days, even if you don't mean it?

87
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,770
I did say that.

88
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,710
But Mr. Kim says he's okay to go...

89
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:10,330
He had a rough day, and you made
him go to dinner and not rest.

90
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,550
You got him drunk and got him to
faint in the middle of the street.

91
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,090
- I didn't get him drunk.
- That's not it...

92
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:16,550
That's called a power trip.
What else do you call it?

93
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,630
- Power...
- Please lower your voice.

94
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,910
I'm sorry.

95
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:25,400
- Sorry.
- Please apologize to Mr. Kim right now.

96
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,570
What did I do wrong to apologize?

97
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:41,360
Mr. Kim Do Ki, you should've rested more.

98
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,410
I guess I threw my weight around.

99
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,610
I'm sorry.

100
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,000
No, CEO.

101
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,470
I'll work even harder.

102
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:51,870
Yes.

103
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,510
Don't do everything he tells you to do.

104
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,820
Take care of your health. Seriously.

105
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,310
So annoying.

106
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:10,980
She scares me the most in our company.

107
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,440

- Here.
- Wait. It just passed.

110
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,940
It looks like the same vehicle model.

111
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,380
It is, right?

112
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,970
We should analyze further, but

113
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:39,200
in my opinion,
I think it's that premium taxi.

114
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,970
A mysterious premium taxi had

115
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:43,400
Jo Do Cheol in it and crashed
into a corrupt cop.

116

Stuff like this...

117
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:51,080
This is like Batman!

118
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,250
Did you eat something wrong?

119
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,750
No, well... You know...

120
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,130
He appears in front of the villain and pow!

121
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,920
And he gets rid of them. Could it be?

122
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,690
Just put him on the wanted list.

123
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,420
All this burnt down.

124
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,710
It could be burnt or not.

You're in a rush. It must be a date?

It's much more important than that.

Are you going on a blind date?

130

Who could he be?

He still comes out in my dream...

133
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,760
and says, "Mom, it's me, Seung Woo."

134
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:04,570
He comes toward me as
he clasps his hand in mine.

135
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:07,890
Because I didn't want to wake up,
I'd sleep and get up later.

No need to do that.

I had a brother who was
five years younger than me.

One day, my brother called me up.

He said he found the love of his life.

He apologized that he'll get
to marry before me.

I'm Prosecutor Kang Ha Na.
I had called you earlier.

779
00:47:54,930 --> 00:47:56,550
What happened?

780
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:58,870
They said he fell from a bridge.

781
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:00,960
They think he jumped off.

782
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,030
What? He jumped off?

783
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:04,960
Jump off?

784
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:12,280
Thank you.

785
00:48:17,370 --> 00:48:22,490
While he was working, let's say that
he endured for the sake of money.

786
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:27,310
But how could they beat up
someone who left the company?

787
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:33,440
When he returned after he got beat up
by that Park Yang Jin,

788
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,380
I told him to file a complaint against him.

789
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:38,170
I was by his side when
he wrote out the complaint.

790
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:41,960
Oppa also said this.

791
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:45,200
That he won't live cowardly anymore.

792
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,470
As a husband...

793
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:50,460
he won't behave shamefully.

794
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:55,230
And how could someone like that
drop the charges suddenly

795
00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:58,020
and throw himself over the bridge
after drinking alone?

796
00:48:58,020 --> 00:48:59,770
Does this make sense?

797
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:02,810
There is no way.

798
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:06,440
Never.

799
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,310
I'll put them away.

800
00:49:22,310 --> 00:49:23,720
Thank you.

801
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:26,210
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

802
00:50:41,990 --> 00:50:45,190
It's a little too far for him to jump alone.

803
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:05,900
Okay, let's go.

810
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:44,860

00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,150
Seo Young Min jumped off the bridge?

813
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:51,280
We don't know that yet.

814
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,550
Who knows if he jumped off
or someone threw him over?

815
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:03,030
There was no CCTV
on the bridge inadvertently.

816
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:05,490
There are two key points
we need to find out.

817
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:09,600
First, why did Seo Young Min drop the
charges soon after quitting his job?

818
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:15,230
Second, why was Seo Young Min found
under the bridge after he quit his job?

819
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:20,110
It means the answer is ultimately
inside the company.

820
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:22,870
That's simple, then. There are no CCTVs
that Go Eun can't hack.

821
00:52:22,870 --> 00:52:25,170
There are CCTVs that I can't hack.

822
00:52:25,170 --> 00:52:26,420
What are they?

823
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:28,710
I can't get into CCTVs that are offline
even if I want to hack.

824
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:29,830
Just like that bridge.

825
00:52:29,830 --> 00:52:34,160
But that U-Data is set up just like that.

826
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,080
Then how can we look into it?

827
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:38,950
How would I know? It's not like
I'm an employee there.

828
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:40,560
An employee?

829
00:52:58,330 --> 00:52:59,770
Why?

You worked at VNware in Silicon Valley.

832

Mr. Kim Do Ki.

833
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:14,360
Oh, yes?

834
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:16,230
Ah, I'm sorry.

835
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:19,010
I'm having a hard time adjusting
to the time change.

836
00:53:19,010 --> 00:53:20,790
Wow, with this resume,

837
00:53:20,790 --> 00:53:24,100
you could work for
any corporation of your choice.

838
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:25,370
Why did you apply to our company?

839
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:28,760
Well, that's because I live close by.

840
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:31,480
The US is such a massive land in size

841
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:33,600
that it's too tough to commute.

842
00:53:34,990 --> 00:53:37,410
You were always top of the class
until you finished high school.

843
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:40,700
What? First in your major throughout
four years in the engineering department?

844
00:53:41,650 --> 00:53:42,910
Is this true?

845
00:53:42,910 --> 00:53:45,070
Oh, my. Did I go overboard?

846
00:53:45,070 --> 00:53:47,830
He submitted his transcripts.

847
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:54,060
Mr. Kim Do Ki, you tell us.

848
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:57,560
What's your real reason for
applying to our company?

849
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:59,430
Not that stuff about
how you live close by.

850
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:00,990
Tell us your actual reason.

851
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:02,400
Oh...

852
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,400
that's, well...

853
00:54:15,550 --> 00:54:17,450
Well...

854
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:24,010
I've always been the first in the class
all the way through high school

855
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:27,330
and also first in class in college.

856
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:31,280
If I rank second, I feel uneasy.

857
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:35,020
I have to work for a number one company

858
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:37,230
so I don't feel uncomfortable.

859
00:54:37,230 --> 00:54:40,380
So I looked into it and heard that U-Data

860
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:45,760
is the number one webhard
company in Korea.

861
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:48,090
So I'll work at this company.

862
00:54:48,090 --> 00:54:50,110
No, I'd like to.

863
00:54:50,110 --> 00:54:51,600
No, no.

864
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,680
I'll work here, no matter what.

865
00:54:58,010 --> 00:54:59,770
Great! Great!

00:54:59,770 --> 00:55:01,330
I like your motive for applying.

867
00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:03,480
Yeah. I'm glad you came, Mr. Kim Do Ki.

868
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:05,520
No, no, no...

Yes.

- Do you drink well?
- Drink?

879
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:28,740
A little bit.

880
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:31,280
Do you know how to kill a chicken?

881
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,220
- A chicken?
- A chicken.

882
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:35,440
Well, I've never, but...

883
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:36,930
- I can do it!
- Right on.

884
00:55:36,930 --> 00:55:38,160
I can kill 'em all!

885
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,310
- Yes.
- Great.

886
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:49,890
Gosh, there isn't much I could do.

887
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:54,940
It's not a security company.
Why did they block everything?

888
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:58,560

- I don't know.

Oh, my gosh!

893
00:56:36,870 --> 00:56:39,190
Why is he living in such a remote place?

894
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:40,850
It's not even his hometown.

895
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:45,160
Hello. May I ask a question?

896
00:56:45,190 --> 00:56:47,600
By chance, do you know
someone named Jun Jin Won?

897
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:50,550
Could it be that young man from Seoul?

898
00:56:50,550 --> 00:56:53,430
Go down over there.

I'm Prosecutor Kang Ha Na from Seoul
Northern District Prosecutor's Office.

904
00:57:11,510 --> 00:57:13,270
Excuse me, but let me
ask you some questions.

905
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:15,480
No. I have nothing to tell you.

- We came a long way.

- No.

00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:21,370
You know Chairman Park Yang Jin, right?

909
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:23,860
I'd like to know what happened
between you and him.

910
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:25,600
I... I don't know anything.

911
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:27,220
Okay? Please leave.

912
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:30,290
I... I don't know anything! Just leave!

913
00:57:31,530 --> 00:57:35,780
- Leave! I really didn't commit any crime!
- What do you think you're doing?

914
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:37,460
Hey!

Let's just leave for the day.

916
00:57:47,070 --> 00:57:50,200
I think we should
resume the investigation.

917
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,400
Of course, without
Sunbaenim's knowledge.

918
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:56,020
Deputy Chief said you can't press charges
again for the ones that were dropped.

919
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:58,050
That's true by the book as well.

920
00:57:58,050 --> 00:58:01,120
Did I say I'll press charges on Seo Young Min's
imprisonment and assault again?

921
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:02,160
Then what?

922
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,630
It looks like...

923
00:58:03,630 --> 00:58:06,510
- that company is riddled with problems.
- What problems?

924
00:58:06,510 --> 00:58:08,640
We haven't found out anything yet.

925
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,680
Why do you think they're
so tight on their security?

926
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:12,150
That means they have a lot to hide.

927
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:13,900
That means there are lots of problems.

928
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:15,460
Once you start investigating
those problems,

929
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:18,310
evidence for Seo Young Min's imprisonment
and assault charges could surface.

930
00:58:18,310 --> 00:58:19,900
Well, that could...

931
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:21,300
- happen, but...
- That's right!

932
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:24,100
That's it. We just have to find something.

933

Corruption. Just one. Anything. Whatever.

934
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:28,230
- That's good. That works, you know?
- I mean...

935

Did Kim Do Ki go to work
or to a church revival?

01:01:30,490 --> 01:01:32,960
- What will you do now?

To Strategic Planning Division.

Yay! Yay!

I'd like to work at a core division.

Please tell the chairman that I'm disappointed
to leave without meeting him.

01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:44,570
This happened because of me.

I'm going to do something to this company.

982

Which division did you say you were in?

983
01:01:48,530 --> 01:01:51,060
That nutjob is talking to our employee.

What the hell is this?

985
01:01:52,930 --> 01:01:55,130
I think we're tourists.

someone takes care of campus violence
issues for 5 million won.

You don't have any money, huh?

991
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:15,250
I don't have any.

Yeah, of course, you don't have any.

993
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:29,770
