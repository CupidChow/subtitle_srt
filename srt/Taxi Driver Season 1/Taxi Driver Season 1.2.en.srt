to pay back when they die.

A person dies, but the money
doesn't die with him.

316
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,140
Even if you die,

317
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:38,140
the debt you owe will
go to your family,

318

of blood with you,

320

I chase them down to
the end and get the money.

321
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:49,490
You should know what you're
taking with you, at least.

322

I'll pay you back for sure.

Yes, sure. Go ahead.

What qualifications do you need
to drive a premium taxi?

507

You asked me that last time, too.

I'm just curious.

Well...

511
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:33,040
First, not anyone can drive
a premium taxi.

512
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,960
You have to be an experienced driver.

513

- An experienced driver?
- Yes.

514
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:40,480
You have to have at least ten years
of accident-free driving record.

515
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,960
Ten years. That means the
driver must be older.

516
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,750
I guess at least mid-40's.

517

Well, pretty much.

"premium taxi" sounds suitable.

Oh, if I take one a day,

puts me in a good mood.

He spoke so toughly,
but he must be on edge.

655

He's looking all over
for jeotgal from other places.

one of the disabled who works there.

So it was taken care of easily.

become the company CEOs.

Is that how you ask for information?

820
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,250
Excuse me, but can I ask you a question?

821
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:59,100
No. Just move your car.

822
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:12,850
[Epilogue]
Ms. Maria.

823
00:58:12,850 --> 00:58:13,980
You want some coffee?

824
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:15,780
I'm okay.

825
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:18,160
Are you scared of coffee?

826
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:20,160
That's not it.

827
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,260
If I drink coffee...

828
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:22,900
- Unni!
- Noona!

829
00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:25,080
How did you get here?

830
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:27,030
- We came in a taxi.
- A taxi?

831
00:58:27,030 --> 00:58:28,930
- Taxi ahjussi gave us a ride.
- Really?

832
00:58:28,930 --> 00:58:30,150
He bought us toys, too.

833
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:34,200
Stay right here. Okay?

834
00:58:36,110 --> 00:58:40,080
Timing and Subtitles

835
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,670
Thank you!

836
00:58:43,670 --> 00:58:45,610
Thank you...

837
00:58:45,610 --> 00:58:47,750
Thank you so much for your help!

838
00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:50,830
Thank you!

[Taxi Driver]

841
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:08,920
When I identified the vehicle,
this place came up.

842
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,430
Do you know why he's
working with Bluebird?

843
00:59:11,430 --> 00:59:12,830
It was my fault.

844
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:16,000
Let's forget the past and start
over from the introduction.

845
00:59:16,950 --> 00:59:18,810
The client is young this time.

846
00:59:18,810 --> 00:59:20,340
Let's pay special attention.

847
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:23,260
It doesn't matter who throws
the stone. It still sinks.

848
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:25,410
Would they know how I feel?

849
00:59:25,410 --> 00:59:28,270
I wish they'd feel the same thing I feel.

850
00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:31,650
♫ Because your dream is
still alive and breathing ♫
