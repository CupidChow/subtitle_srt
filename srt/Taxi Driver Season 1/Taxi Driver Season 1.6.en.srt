What would be an appropriate action to take?

00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,520
I think it would be good to
use a brick and rebar.

A brick and rebar?

what is appropriate action
in accordance with the law?

21

How does your answer apply?

22
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,230
I think you're talking about emergency
evacuation, self-reliance,

23
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:43,930
and self-defense that the law stipulates.

24

If the person was able to
evacuate urgently,

25
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,660
he wouldn't have been dragged
to the construction site.

26

If he was able to help himself,

he wouldn't be getting attacked.

00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:21,820
When is Dr. Kim arriving?

329
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,280
Around midnight.

330
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,160
What will you say to CEO Jang?

331
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,400
I don't care.

332
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,690
He has no problem hearing without
eyes. Don't you think so?

333
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:31,190
[Cornea: normal, no cloudiness]

334
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,650
Oh, ahjussi, come here.
Talk to me for a minute.

335
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,730
Hey, come here. Ahjussi, come here.

336
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,040
You're fasting starting today.

337
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,890
I heard intermittent fasting
is good for you.

338
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,650
Really?

339
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,250
I'll remember you guys, too.

340
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,820
He has very nice eyes.

341
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,210
That's why you get them taken away.

342
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,450
Prosecutor, when I look
at last year's sales...

343
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:10,420
the total was 210 billion won,
business profit 5.2 billion won,

344
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,610
25% profit margin.

345
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:15,090
When I look further into sales structure,

346
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:18,660
90% of the profits come
from adult content.

347
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,960
This is...

348
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,560
Prosecutor.

349
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,450
Prosecutor.

350
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,630
Are you listening to me?

351
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:27,360
I'm sorry.

352
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,280
Well, are there other issues...

353
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:34,090
I don't think what we're doing is
the essence of this case.

354
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:36,920
The essence?

355
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:40,080
Yes, the essential nature that
we need to discover.

356
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,740
Oppa also said this.

357
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:51,650
That he won't live cowardly anymore.

358
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:53,740
He won't behave shamefully.

359
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,540
You know Chairman
Park Yang Jin, right?

360
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,950
I... I don't know anything.

361
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:59,250
Leave! I really didn't commit any crime!

362
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,650
I... I don't know anything! Just leave!

363
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:17,430
I'm Prosecutor Kang Ha Na.
I went to see you before.

364
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,760
Please don't hang up and just listen.

365
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:34,760
There's someone who
wants to meet you.

366
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,680
The wires are overly concentrated
in the Strategic Planning Team office.

367
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,940
There are CCTVs in other spots

368
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,820
but nothing in the Strategic
Planning Office.

369
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,750
The entire division is a dead zone.

370
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,370
Mr. Kim Do Ki.

371
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:03,600
Chief Kim Do Ki?

372
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,940
Don't just enjoy your coffee.
Talk to me.

373
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,000
About what?

374
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,180
What are you going to do now?

375
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,800
Before anything, I think I should
change the division.

376
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,010
The division?

377
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,860
To Strategic Planning Team.

378
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,300
Whoa.

379
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,350
Why?

380
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,850
- You'll join the Strategic Planning Team?
- Yup.

381
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:22,110
That's the U-Data's center...

382
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,030
It's like the yoke of the company.

383
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,380
That's right.

384
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:28,130
You just got hired and...

385
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:31,120
you have no recognition nor presence.
How will you go there?

386
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,910
I'll start there then.

387
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:36,130
Let them be aware and
enlarge my presence.

388
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:37,600
And I should go to that division.

389
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,150
So, how?

390
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,730
I have you, Go Eun.

391
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:49,460
For your information, I'm with the
Program Development Team 2.

392
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,890
Whoa.

393
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,660
Am I a kid or something?

394
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:01,060
I'm done polishing them.

395
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,670
You did an excellent job
of polishing them.

396
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,000
Thank you.

397
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,070
Have a good day.

398
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,430
I think we chose the wrong
job for undercover.

399
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:16,770
We can't even eat lunch.
What the heck?

400
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:18,150
Hyungnim.

401
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:21,610
Hurry up. We have to take them
back before lunchtime.

402
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,320
Why don't you take it easy?

403
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,760
More customers are coming
because you do this too well.

404
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,760
But still, how can I stop polishing?

405
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:32,530
Geez...

406
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:37,030
I guess it's not good to
be so pessimistic.

407
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,880
I told you we should be messengers.

408
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:53,080
S***!

409
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,710
What the hell is this?

410
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:56,520
Get over here!

411
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:01,370
Hey, are you crazy?

412
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:02,820
What the hell is that?

413
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,070
- Huh?
- What's up?

414
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,340
Geez!

415
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,850
What's going on here?

416
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:10,850
Our firewall is down due
to a DDoS attack.

417
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:13,330
- We're restoring it.
- How long will that take?

418
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:16,560
- About a week.
- Hey!

419
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,390
Do you know how much
our daily sale is?

420
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:21,130
How dare you say such bulls***!

421
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,440
By when? Make it soon.

422
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,310
Our internal network
switched over to botnet.

423
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,910
It will take about five days
at the earliest.

424
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,720
I think so, too.

425
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,760
Geez! Seriously!

426
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,830
I think I can fix it in ten minutes.

427
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:38,730
Hey.

428
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:39,840
What did you say?

429
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,000
You can kill this virus in ten minutes?

430
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,090
- Yes.
- Hey.

431
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:48,790
Can't you tell what's going on?

432
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:51,220
How can you joke around
in front of the chairman?

433
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:54,200
I'm not joking...

434
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:08,940
When I used to work in the US,

435
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:11,530
this program attacked our company system.

436
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:13,540
I had such a hard time then that

437
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,460
I wrote up a patch program.

438
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,850
Hey, Chief Kim.

439
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:19,190
You can fix this in ten minutes with that?

440
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:22,220
I just have to get the attacker's
PC that triggers DDoS.

441
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,340
It was ten minutes earlier.

442
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:27,440
I think it should be done about now.

443
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:33,140
Done. I released it.

444
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,400
Oh, I got it!

445
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,630
Why don't we reboot?

446
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:37,360
The homepage should launch just fine.

447
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:44,170
This punk. Hey.

448
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:47,250
- Who are you?
- Well, I'm...

449
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:50,670
Chief Kim Do Ki of Program
Development Team 2.

450
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,760
- Mr. Jung.
- Yes, Chairman.

451
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,840
He solved such a huge issue.

452
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,860
I should give him a special bonus.

453
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,710
- Get it in 60 seconds.
- Yes.

454
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,810
Hey, tell Ms. Kim in
the secretary's office

455
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:04,360
to get over here with
a cash gift. Right now.

456
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,420
I'll show my appreciation.

457
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,280
Wow, you punk.

458
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,860
He's no joke.

459
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,100
Here. Take it.

460
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,060
- Well...
- What?

461
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,950
You want more?

462
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:28,130
Instead of a bonus, I'd like
to have it in points.

463
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,420
What points?

464
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,640
Points for my performance review.

465
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,470
Is there a division you want to join?

466
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:37,440
I'd like to work in a core division.

467
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,290
- A core division?
- Yes.

468
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:42,830
I heard that Strategic
Planning Team pays well

469
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,690
and is like a yoke in U-Data.

470
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:48,430
So...

471
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:50,300
- you want to go there?
- Yes, sir!

472
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:53,400
If you send me there, I'll work very hard!

473
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,540
You punk!

474
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,950
You're funny.

475
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:59,900
Take this, a**hole.

476
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,170
What an interesting punk.

477
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:04,910
A yoke. You look like a chick.

478
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:08,370
Gosh, man. That a**hole is killing me.

479
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:10,300
Who the hell is he?

480
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,470
You've raised their awareness
of you and your presence.

481
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:36,690
Why won't he transfer you?

482
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:39,100
You rescued the company
during that crisis.

483
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,740
He won't let you switch the division?

484
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,700
He was acting like he was all that.

485
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,250
I think there's something
we overlooked.

486
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:47,960
We overlooked something?

487
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,990
Go Eun, will you do me a favor?

488
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:53,530
- It's a bit cumbersome.
- Well...

489
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:56,150
Just tell me. I won't do it if
it's too much of a hassle.

490
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:58,990

00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:44,160
he's capable of killing someone so easily.

824
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:48,070
Here's another person
like this. Anti-group.

825
00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:49,500
Just go.

826
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:52,020
If the money wins over, those people
stay and become successful.

827
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:54,570
But if one's conscience wins,
they get kicked out and get payback.

828
00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:57,060
That's how it is here! Wake up!

829
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:00,940
I'm sure Chairman thought
that was appropriate!

830

Wow...

831

It's okay to call me that, but...

836

you can't say that about my chairman!

837

838
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:22,460
Gosh...

839
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:29,130
I don't see any potential for this, but

840
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:31,680
I hope your conscience wins you over.

841
