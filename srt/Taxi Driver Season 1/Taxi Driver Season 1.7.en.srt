That will result in two ways for you.

First, you don't have to
become a criminal.

246
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,910
Second, you can make money.

It's nice if you could make a lot.
You'd look capable.

253

But you shouldn't cross
the line for money.

254

- The law and ethics.

There are things that money
should never win over.

328
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:27,690
I can't stand the sight of you. Get out.

329
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:29,680
Yes, sir.

330
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,110
Sunbaenim, by chance...

331
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,670
are you angry with me?

332
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:39,270
Hey, am I psycho?

333
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:41,180
Why would I get angry for no reason?

334
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:44,140
You said to me, "I can't stand
the sight of you. Get out."

335
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,050
- Did I say that?
- Yes.

336
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,910
With your hand gesture like this.

337
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:50,860
Geez, it's become a habit
because of you.

338
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,910
So you should've done better before!

339
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:56,040
Why did you give me
a habit like this? Why?

340
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:59,530
I can't stand the sight of you.
Get out. Get out.

341
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:01,470
Yes, sir.

342
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,620
Could you really do it?

343
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,280
Don't worry.

344
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,690
I'm getting paid to do that type of work.

345
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,490
By now, I'm sure

346
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:32,960
Park Yang Jin's people already
know that I'm in Seoul.

347
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,670
It could be dangerous for you.

348
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:37,630
You don't have to do this
if you're uneasy.

349
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:38,670
No.

350
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,430
I don't want to have regrets any longer.

351
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:43,930
I'll trust you, Prosecutor.

352
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,940
I'm good at sizing up people.

353
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,960
I'm a bit vague about your mental state.

354
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,150
But your posture is good.

355
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:57,760
Good posture.

356
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,240
Shall we work together and
make some dough?

357
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,370
Sounds great.

358
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:03,400
- Good.
- Home CCTV that are popular overseas.

359
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,650
I'm sorry, Chairman.

360
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:06,410
We're late because of Chief Kim Do Ki.

361
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:08,580
- I'm sorry.
- Good job.

362
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,700
- Come and eat.
- Go, go.

363
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,560
Hey, traitor. Looking good.

364
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,810
But that one, you know.

365
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:17,760
How can you see the bedroom at night?

366
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,710
It's possible if there's
a webcam in the bedroom.

367
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:21,990
Geez! Give me a freaking break.

368
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:24,740
Hey, I changed the division
for you, and now this?

369
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:27,700
How dare you spew a load
of crap, making up stories?

370
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:30,290
Hey, let's all think.

371
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:33,360
How can I be the only one thinking?

372
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,930
Hey, there has to be a bedroom.

373
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:38,330
A bedroom. What's the use
if there's only a camera?

374
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:39,440
What good is it, man?

375
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,730
Pass. And you.

376
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:44,280
Did I tell you to live quietly in
a place with fresh air or not?

377
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,530
I mean, I heard that Young Min
was hospitalized.

378
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:48,750
I just came for a brief time.

379
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,060
Young Min?

380
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:52,220
Why? Do you want to be
as good as dead

381
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,470
and lie down next to him?

382
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:54,990
I'm sorry for causing you to worry.

383
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:57,930
Just live quietly as though you're dead.

384
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,630
Isn't it nice to be alive, man?

385
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:02,420
See? You can move and all.
It's nice, man.

386
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,810
Hey, Jin Won.

387
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:09,690
Let's go outside.

388
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:14,630
Let's stay healthy, okay?

389
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,660
(Foreign language)

390
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,720
(Foreign language)

391
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,300
Hello. (In Thai)

392
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:25,910
A**hole, I told you to come
on time for food.

393
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:29,370
Do you not care about
being on time at all?

394
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:30,960
(Foreign language)

395
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:34,770
Should I just crush your sunglasses?

396
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:36,680
- Take them off, a**hole!
- I'm sorry.

397
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:40,400
Chairman, there are so
many great videos

398
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,960
from Southeast Asia these days.

399
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,900
Since I'm working mainly with those,

400
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,090
my foreign language
automatically comes out.

401
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:48,400
Forget Southeast Asia.
How about made in Korea?

402
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,440
The unit price for "Made in Korea"
is pretty high.

403
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,590
- I'm sure you know.
- Hey!

404
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:54,390
So, do you have them or not?

405
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,610
I do, I do, I do have them.

406
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:59,110
If I don't, would you meet
with someone like me?

407
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:02,460
I'm just kidding.

408
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,100
Stop kidding around.

409
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,820
Well...

410
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,950
You know the one that sold well.

411
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:10,420
The daebak video.

412
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,150
Oh, that...

413
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:15,060
Geez, that hottie from
K-University, Ahn something...

414
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,570
- Ahn Jung Eun?
- Yeah, right.

415
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:17,870
Ahn Jung Eun, that girl.

416
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:20,050
Why don't I see her videos these days?

417
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:21,600
Because there are so many
suicides in the news...

418
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,290
- the videos relevant to that...
- Geez, s***!

419
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:26,710
What a moron.

420
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:27,900
Hey, a**hole!

421
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,540
That means it's high time!

422
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,070
When news like that come up,

423
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,240
you should put the "Deceased" tag and

424
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,820
upload them right away!

425
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,610
That's how they'll become legends.

426
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:38,970
How many times did I tell you that's
how you make legend?

427
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:40,550
Don't you want to get rich, a**hole?

428
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,610
I'm sorry, Chairman.

429
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:43,820
Chairman, calm down. Calm down.

430
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,800
Our chairman was looking for that.

431
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,810
Director Choi Min's work.

432
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,870
K-University beauty, Ahn Jung Eun.

433
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:53,150
That was Director Choi Min's debut video.

434
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:56,090
Min is huge in that genre.

435
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:58,460
If we put everything that Min
filmed in the theater,

436
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:01,310
they'd be director and actress
driving 10 million viewers.

437
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:04,080
I saw that so many times.

438
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,600
Why wouldn't I know him?

439
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:11,320
Because people don't really look
at the guy's face in the video.

440
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,730
Wow. What a twist.

441
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:20,120
[Bluebird, Case File: Suicide due to leaking
of pornographic video, Ahn Jung Eun]

442
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:23,650
That's right. The ones who look
at the guy's face are perverts.

443
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:25,470
I'm not a pervert, at least.

444
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,140
Right? Isn't that right?

445
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,530
You're not, Chairman.

446
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,380
Oh, and...

447
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:34,120
didn't you say you're wrapping
up a project today?

448
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,320
I think the girl caught on.

449
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,720
So I'll wrap up another way.

450
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:41,310
Today?

451
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,610
Today is good.

452
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:44,010
Hey, Ahn.

453
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:45,970
Follow him and get his work.

454
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:47,990
Why don't we launch it tomorrow?

455
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:49,590
Okay? Okay?

456
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,230
- Fighting!
- Okay, okay.

457
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,840
Let's go!

458
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,930
Chairman!

459
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:57,120
I'll do my best night and day.

460
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,260
Bye. (In Thai)

461
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:03,300
We'll get going.

462
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:12,910
Don't lose the guy in blue pants.

463
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,510
Never.

464
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:15,960
Don't worry.

465
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,310
This is my first time.

466
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:20,580
Yes, this is Director Jung from U-Data.

467
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,080
Yes.

468
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,520
Yes.

469
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,750
Chairman, you have a call.

470
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,280
Yes, this is he.

471
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,660
What?

472
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:36,450
Director Choi, who did you work under?

473
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:37,940
- Director Park.
- Oh, Director Park?

474
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,640
No wonder. Nice art direction.
I like Director Bong.

475
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,850
See you later.

476
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:42,390
- See you later.
- Fighting!

477
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:43,580
Let's make something together.

478
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,690
Great.

479
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:46,460
All righty...

480
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,940
Let's go.

481
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:46,500
Put that here and...

482
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,290
Hey, lower the lights.

483
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:50,410
Okay.

484
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:54,660
Okay, let's get ready!

485
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,620
You're today's model, huh?

486
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,190
Whoa, nice.

487
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,330
Come this way.

488
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:02,210
We'll film this today and go to Hollywood.

489
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:05,160
Okay, look. The best art direction
and best staff members.

490

00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:57,730
Hey, Kim.

818
00:49:57,730 --> 00:49:59,470
Hey, a**hole!

819
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:01,800
I aske you. You should answer me.

820
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,110
Can't you hear me, a**hole? Chief Kim!

821
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:05,910
Yes, I'm listening.

823
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,830
Look at this crazy punk! You crazy nut!

824
00:50:09,830 --> 00:50:12,290
How dare you ignore me?

825
00:50:12,290 --> 00:50:15,200
You should answer right away!

826
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,750
What, what? What's up?

827
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:19,190
Huh?

828
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:25,520
What's that? That crazy b****...

830

Hey.

831
00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:30,710
Step outside. I'll deal with you later.

832

There's nothing here.

00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:25,590
How about the server?
He said it's all in the server.

873
00:52:25,590 --> 00:52:27,770

I get to see you often lately.

879
00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:08,560
At this rate, we'll end up
liking each other.

880
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:13,300
What's...

881
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:15,960
What's this?

882
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,950
You're embarrassing me.

883
00:53:17,950 --> 00:53:19,530
I don't know what this is about, but

884
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:22,730
I'll definitely respond
through my lawyer.

885
00:53:22,730 --> 00:53:25,230
Are you kidding me?

886
00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:29,470
What are you doing?

887
00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:33,370
Is she kidding me? Seriously?

888
00:53:33,370 --> 00:53:35,510
Hey, lift up the chairman's mood.

889

Hey, Chief Kim.

890
00:54:03,230 --> 00:54:05,670
Did you know that crazy b****
prosecutor would come?

891
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:07,920
Is that why you deleted the
data from the server?

892
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,670
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you in advance.

893
00:54:10,670 --> 00:54:13,550

Two lessons from today's event.

895
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:16,930
Make sure to keep this in mind.

896
00:54:16,930 --> 00:54:18,030
First.

897
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:22,280
Don't keep a secret from
me on your own whim.

898
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:23,660
And...

899

second.

They can't take anything
from me anyway.

901
00:54:29,110 --> 00:54:31,710
There's no way. Got that?

902
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:34,780
So don't touch the data on your own.

903
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:36,390
Okay?

904
00:54:37,850 --> 00:54:39,140

I'll keep that in mind!

spot if you come now."

send me a text with a photo.

through to get this warrant?

Did Park Yang Jin order you to?

916
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:38,620
Did Park Yang Jin tell you
to screw me over?

917
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:42,950
You asked for information.

918
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:44,690
- What?
- I did...

919
00:55:44,690 --> 00:55:47,090
so pay me lots of money.

920
00:55:47,090 --> 00:55:49,550
You sent me a fake snapshot like this

921
00:55:49,550 --> 00:55:50,710
and you ask for money?

922
00:55:50,710 --> 00:55:53,450
You have no conscience at all, huh?

923

924
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:03,060

925

if I gave you the source.

If the snapshots that
he sent me are real...

932
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:47,710
The server in the Strategic
Planning office is fake.

933
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:50,000
That means the servers
we saw were fake.

934

they don't get deleted.

the original data is stored.

01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:49,990
Yeah, it's just your feeling.

984
01:00:49,990 --> 01:00:52,780
Do they have nothing to do?
Why would they follow us?

985
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:55,620
- It's not us.
- I know, it's not us.

986
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:00,550
They're after the car behind me.

987
01:01:00,550 --> 01:01:02,110
What?

988
01:01:15,150 --> 01:01:16,930
How should we proceed, Chairman?

989
01:01:16,930 --> 01:01:18,900
Our country ranks

990
01:01:18,910 --> 01:01:21,510
first for suicide, first for divorce rates...

991
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:23,560
first in consumption...

992
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:26,300
And I heard we rank first
in car accident mortality, too.

993
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:29,080
As worthy of first places,
take care of her for good.

994
01:01:38,610 --> 01:01:41,280
You go ahead. I'll be right behind you.

995
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:44,220
Okay. We'll go ahead and look out.

996
01:02:21,290 --> 01:02:23,210
We can't lose that car.

997
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:41,450
What? Where did he go?

998
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,450
S***!

999
01:02:53,210 --> 01:02:55,610
What the? Why are you driving like that?

1000
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:05,950
- Something's off about that car, too.
- What's with that punk?

1001
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:18,400
What's with these f***ers?

1002
01:03:24,580 --> 01:03:27,600
Wow. The Jangandong guys
do good work.

1003
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:29,420
Chairman will be so happy.

1004
01:03:34,930 --> 01:03:36,810
Go faster!

1005
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:03,350
What's that?

1006
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:30,250

♫ While strolling on a peaceful evening ♫

1009
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:05,100
♫ The face I remember always ♫

1010
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:15,710
♫ The person who gathers
sparkling stars ♫

1011
01:05:15,790 --> 01:05:17,740
Enjoy your meal.

1012
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:22,880
♫ Filling up the narrow path with scents ♫

1013
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:29,100
♫ Flowers colored under
the street lights ♫

1014
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:36,400
♫ It would be so nice to smell
this scent with him ♫

1015
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,020
Unni?

1016
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:40,200
♫ It would be so nice to smell
this scent with him ♫

1017
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:46,040
♫ I miss you, the face that I miss ♫

1018
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:52,270
♫ It disappears as if I drew it with water ♫

1019
01:05:52,270 --> 01:05:54,970
♫ I miss you ♫

1020
01:05:54,970 --> 01:06:03,570
♫ I stroll again today as I think of him ♫

1021
01:06:03,570 --> 01:06:07,000
[Now I know a little bit what
her behavior meant back then.]

1022
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:10,310
[It was her untimely goodbye.]

1023

[Taxi Driver]

1025
01:06:21,710 --> 01:06:22,990
I have a request.

1026
01:06:22,990 --> 01:06:25,410
If I say don't do it, don't do it.

1027
01:06:25,470 --> 01:06:27,310
Be sure to lock your house tightly.

1028
01:06:27,310 --> 01:06:29,100
We can destroy Park Yang Jin.

1029
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:31,090
We'll have to assume the risks.

1030
01:06:31,090 --> 01:06:32,570
The things are getting twisted again.

1031
01:06:32,570 --> 01:06:34,530
I don't know what you mean.

1032
01:06:34,530 --> 01:06:35,710
The whistleblower is in danger.

1033
01:06:35,710 --> 01:06:37,420
- The warrant?
- No time to figure that out.

1034
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:38,850
I'll be disciplined later.

1035
01:06:38,850 --> 01:06:40,600
Who the hell are you?

1036
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:42,410
A premium taxi driver.

1037
01:06:42,410 --> 01:06:43,500
Where is everyone?

1038
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:45,040
I thought you need to
locate the data center.

1039
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:46,510
How nice to hear your voice.

1040
01:06:46,510 --> 01:06:48,200
Kill them all!

1041
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:49,720
I'll kill them all.

1042
01:06:49,810 --> 01:06:52,210
My precious videos. My treasure!

1043
01:06:52,270 --> 01:06:55,120
It's all your fault, you a**hole!

1044
01:06:55,120 --> 01:07:00,020
♫ I wanna be your fighter
in this broken world ♫
