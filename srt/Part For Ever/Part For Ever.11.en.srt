could you and Miss Wan'er

187
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:12,050
give each other a chance?

188
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,260
The issues between us

189
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,450
run deeper than just this matter.

190
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,170
It's time to put the grudges

191
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:20,690
of the past generation behind you.

192
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,140
Wan'er,

193
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:27,770
you can leave here now.

194
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,450
Come with me to meet Commander Zhao.

195
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,810
Let's go arrest Wang Zhen together.

196
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:31,650
Let's go.

197
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,570
Wang Zhen has been plotting
to seize power for many years.

198
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,260
He won't give up easily.

199
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:40,410
He will seize any opportunity
to make a comeback.

200
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,220
I cannot leave.

201
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:53,220
Wan'er,

202
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:55,500
do you not want

203
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:58,020
to leave Ling Xiao?

204
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,020
Have you fallen for him?

205
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:07,980
No.

206
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:09,690
I don't have any feelings for him.

207
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:10,930
What's the matter?

208
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,980
