63

for so many years.

64

69

73
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,310

74
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,680
Many years ago it was her,

75
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,870
and now it's still because of her.

for me in your heart.

you and her is ill-fated.

108
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,040
I'm just severing the possibility
between you and her,

109
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,480
isn't that good?

110
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:17,120
I don't need you
to make decisions for me.

111
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,750
Even if our relationship is ill-fated,

112
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,720
I'll still get entangled
with her to the end.

113

I forgot to return this to you earlier

117
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,560
because Ling Xiao interrupted us.

118
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,070
How did you get this?

119
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,390
I found it at the Lantern Festival.

120
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,430
Niyue dropped it.

121
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,430

123
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,630
