Mr. Zhao,

46
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,720
what exactly is going on?

47
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,310
My father would never take
his own life, right?

48
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,560
I rushed back as soon as I heard.

49
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,240
I also asked everyone present.

50
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,270
They all said

51
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,800
my sworn brother took his own life.

52
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:31,510
It's impossible.

53
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,830
It must be Ling Xiao playing tricks

54
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:34,920
behind the scenes.

55
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,070
There's more to this.

56
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,510
I'll make plans

57
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,390

58
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,270

59
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,160

61
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,920
Where do you think you are going?

62
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,720

a murderous demon like you?

63

Today is your end.

65
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,480
Are you looking for him?

66
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,630
Ling Xiao!

67
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,680
You'll die miserably!

68
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,070
Calm down.

69
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:23,720
In a while,

70
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,120

75
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:14,510
Ling Xiao,

76
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,160
release Mr. Zhao.

77
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,600
I'll marry you.

78
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:22,390
Who are you to bargain with me?

79
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,360
I am the only daughter of the City Lord,

80
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,360
with incomparable status.

81
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,920
You're marrying me by force

82
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,830
just to stabilize the military's morale

83
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,510
and ascend to the position
of the City Lord rightfully.

84
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,240
Otherwise, despite your power,

85
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,430
you would still be a traitor
without a righteous cause,

86
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,480
despised by all and denounced for life.

87
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,070
If you don't accept my terms,

88
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,630
I will die with Mr. Zhao.

89
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,480
I shall see how you can secure
your position as City Lord.

90
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,120
No one in this world dares

91
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,000
to threaten me.

92
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,040
How long he lives

93
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,360
depends on your behavior.

94
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,390
Let's continue
with the wedding ceremony.

95
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,160
My dear.

96
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,150
For our wedding,

97
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,960
don't we need to follow

98
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,720
the traditional wedding customs
and formalities?

99
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,240
Do you think you're worthy?

100
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,870
Whether worthy or not,
we cannot forgo etiquette.

101
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,030
In Canglong City,

102
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,440
I am the embodiment of etiquette.

103
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,720
Even so,

104
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,000
we should drink the nuptial wine, right?

105
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,390
I'll pour another glass for you.

106
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,270
