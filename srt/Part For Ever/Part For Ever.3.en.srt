[Episode 3]

14
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,870
The person who needs a good wash

15
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,070
is you.

16
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,590
You could've told me

17
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:28,510
if you wanted to bathe with me.

18
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,040
If you try to take advantage
of me again,

19
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,040
I'd bite it off for real.

20
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,070
If you pull any tricks again,

21
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,000
you should know what will happen

22
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:44,120
to Commander Zhao.

23
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:44,710
You...

24
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:45,480
Hanfeng,

25
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,840
have someone tidy up her appearance.

26
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,110
Keep an eye on her.

27
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,840
If she takes one step out
of the room again,

28
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:55,580
I'll hold you accountable.

29
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:56,840
Yes, My Lord.

30
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,910
His Lordship said that

31
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,710
you may not be gentle,

32
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,360
but he always repays grievances
with kindness,

33
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,910
and he sent you a big gift.

34
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,800
Then convey my message to him.

35
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,800
If he wants me to yield,

36
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,030
it'll have to be in the next life.

37
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,860
[Zhao]

38
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,240
Wan'er, it's me.

39
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,310
Mr. Zhao.

40
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,840
Don't touch her!

41
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,430
What should I do?

42
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,630
I failed to escape.

43
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,630
I even implicated Mr. Zhao.

44
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,870
Do you want to escape?

45
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:39,520
Good.

46
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,800
Not bad. Here you go.

47
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,310
But

48
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,030
if we're discovered,

49
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,260
we'd be done for.

50
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,870
Are you willing to sit

51
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,470
and wait to be sold off by them?

52
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,910
My father once said,

53
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,470
"To have a firm resolve and act bravely

54
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,960
is called firmness.

55
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,190
Firmness is the virtue of a newborn."

56
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,430
So we must never give up.

57
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,590
I must rescue Mr. Zhao.

58
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,830
Miss Wan'er,

59
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,240
I've come to apologize to you.

60
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,720
The situation was too chaotic
during the day.

61
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,120
I couldn't tell clearly

62
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,830
and caused a rift between you and Ling.

63
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,720
I'm sure

64
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,360
with your generosity,

65
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,720
you won't blame me, right?

66
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,430
Your Ling is not here.

67
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,870
There's no need to put up an act.

68
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,310
I don't understand
what you meant by that.

69
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,430
I made this chicken soup for you.

70
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:13,190
I wonder if this could express
my sincere apology.

71
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,870
Your thoughtfulness

72
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,630
somehow made me look heartless.

73
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,510
Although I can't kill you right away,

74
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,480
there are countless ways to torture you.

75
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,480
Enjoy this chicken soup

76
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,000
that could disfigure your face.

77
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,070
I'm not stupid enough

78
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,120
to believe your false facade.

79
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,680
Miss Niyue,

80
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,390
thank you for your generous gift.

81
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,950
Go and tell Ling Xiao

82
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,500
that I want to make a deal with him.

83
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,040
Move it.

84
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,160
Let me go.

85
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,240
Ling won't let you off.

86
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,310
Ling.

87
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:23,750
Ling Xiao,

88
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,000
can we negotiate now?

89
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,120
Negotiate?

90
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,800
If you release Commander Zhao,

91
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,560
I'll release your Niyue.

92
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:32,870
Otherwise,

93
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,830
I'll return the favor on Niyue twice

94
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,750
as much as how you treat Commander Zhao.

95
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,360
Are you threatening me?

96
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,070
I'm just giving you

97
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,510
a taste of your own medicine.

98
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,120
Unfortunately,

99
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,680
you're not qualified

100
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,830
to negotiate with me.

101
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,870
Let me go.

102
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,120
I advise you not to try any more tricks.

103
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,160
You should open your eyes.

104
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,000
Don't let Niyue trick you.

105

106
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,720
Always playing tricks.

107
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,120
How should I punish you?

108
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,190
You're cruel

109
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,630
and not discerning.

110
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,750
You're not worthy of being a City Lord.

111
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,750
You and your smart mouth.

112
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,360
Your mouth

113
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,750
should be sealed shut.

114
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,190
[Token]
Let me go!

115
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,070
I need to get the City Lord's seal

116
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,070
to enter the prison and save Mr. Zhao.

117
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:43,070
Fine. Since I'm confined here,

118
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,430
I'll get beaten if I resist

119
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,750
and hindered if I escape.

120
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,040
From now on,

121
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,720
I will submit to you

122
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,600
and be a good City Lord's wife.

123
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,120
Then

124
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,720
