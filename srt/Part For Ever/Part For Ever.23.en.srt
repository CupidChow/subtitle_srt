everything I did with Niyue before

62
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,750
was just an act.

63
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,470
I was tricking her to get the antidote.

64
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,870
Regardless of the truth,

65
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,800
I no longer care.

66
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,080
Wan'er,

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,360
I shouldn't have been presumptuous.

68
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,830
I shouldn't have kept it from you,

69
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,160
and I definitely shouldn't
have broken your heart.

70
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,560

71
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,160

she gave herself to him

116
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,950

She has become thin.

122

Her face

123
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,600
is also as pale as snow.

124
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:04,220
