Wan'er,

40
00:02:59,400 --> 00:02:59,960
it's me.

41
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,430
Jing Tian? What are you doing here?

42
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,030
For you to fall into Ling Xiao's hand

43
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,280
is like a sheep entering a tiger's den.

44
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,240
Of course,
I had to rush over to save you.

45
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,120
Let's get out of here now.

46
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,000
But Commander Zhao is still
in their hands.

47
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,280
I can't just leave him.

48
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,430
Commander Zhao has been captured?

49
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,000
Where is he being held?

50
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:14,960
In the prison.

51
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,030
But it's heavily guarded.

52
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,310
With just the two of us,
we can't break in.

53
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,630
Let me think of a way.

54
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,680
I remember that in Baiyu City,

55
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,520
there is a secret disguise technique.

56
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,590

00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,280

58
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,310

Wan'er, we have no time to lose.

60
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,470
Let's go and rescue Commander Zhao.

61
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,310
Jing Tian,

62
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,870
have you forgotten
that you are now Ling Xiao?

63
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,150
It's hard to adapt

64
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,360
all of a sudden.

65
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,960
I'm not used to it either.

66
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,840
My family had no history with him.

67
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,310
I don't know

68
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,030
why he treated my family like this.

69
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:05,590
Don't you...

70
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,280
Forget it.

71
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,400
It's a gossip I heard from the servants.

72
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,430
They said Mr. Su violated
Ling Xiao's mother

73
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,680
when he was drunk once.

74
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,000
Mrs. Ling took her own life
because she couldn't bear the shame.

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,720
Even Mr. Ling...

76
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,950
He also went along with her.

77
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,040
That's impossible.

78
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,920
My father was virtuous, courteous,
and righteous.

79
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,310
Everyone praised him

80
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,750
for his upright and honorable behavior.

81
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,310
It must have been that Ling Xiao

82
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,600
who falsely accused and slandered
my father to gain power.

83
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,630
I also believe in Mr. Su's character.

84
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,510
We'll find out the truth

85
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,270
after we look into it later.

86
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,430
Greetings, My Lord.

87
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,680
Greetings, My Lady.

88
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,310
Vice City Lord, what brings you here
at this late hour?

89
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,040
His Lordship entrusted
the succession ceremony to me.

90
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,390
I've worked tirelessly,

91
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,360
day and night,

92
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,680
to finalize the entire process.

93
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,630
I came specially to present it to you.

94
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,630
Please review it, My Lord.

95
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,510
Well done.

96
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,270
You can leave now.

97
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,870
Thank you for the compliment, My Lord.

98
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,800
I'm willing to work hard
and sacrifice everything

99
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,950
for Your Lordship.

100
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:33,120
One moment.

101
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,120
Vice City Lord Wang,
what else do you want?

102
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,510
Just a few days ago,

103
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,310
you two were at odds.

104
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,680
Now, you seem inseparable
and unusually affectionate.

105
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,160
It's truly a wonderful thing.

106
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,720
Congratulations

107
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,480
to My Lord and to you, My Lady.

108
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,720
It was all thanks to you

109
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,950
who falsely accused my father

110
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,560
and then stirred up trouble.

111
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,390
But now we have reconciled.

112
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,830
So

113
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,480
how should I repay you for this?

114
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,310
Uh...

115
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,040
You seem to love gossiping.

116
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,000
How about

117
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,310
we have your tongue cut?

118
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,720
I've said too much!

119
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,950
Please spare me, My Lord.
Oh, spare me, My Lord.

120
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,720
Then I'll punish you
to kneel here all night.

121
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,000
His Lordship and I are going
to view the moon.

122
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,310
We don't want to be disturbed.

123
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,510
Are you going to confess or not?

124
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:46,750
Continue with the beating.

125
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,430
My Lord.

126
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:55,600
Go and bring Commander Zhao here.

127
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,190
I want to interrogate him.

128
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:57,750
Yes, My Lord.

129
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,240
You two, bring him out.

130
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,190
Yes, sir.

131
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,430
My Lord, I've brought him here.

132
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,510
Move him to the carriage.

133
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,600
Yes, My Lord.

138
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,920
I won't dare to gossip

139
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,190
about you and Her Ladyship again.

140
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,480
Please spare my life.

141
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,190
What?

142
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,560
You and Her Ladyship went
to view the moon.

143
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,720
You punished me to kneel here all night.

144
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,360
I can't bear this punishment.

145
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:52,830
Please spare me.

146
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,480
My Lord,

147
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,390
I went to the prison
for the usual inspection.

148
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,000
But Commander Zhao was nowhere
to be found.

149
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,310
The warden said
you personally took him away last night.

150
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,240
Such a clever trick.

151
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,800
Looks like I underestimated her.

152
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,870
Seal the city gates immediately.

153
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:06,830
Yes, My Lord.

154
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:12,310
Where are they?

155
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,120
They had already left

156
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,160
when we received the order.

157
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,750
Search the entire city.

158
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,430
Everyone except Su Wan'er

159
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,360
is to be executed without mercy.

160
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:22,830
Yes, My Lord.

161
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,600
Great.

162
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,600
We're finally out of the city.

163
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,200
Wan'er,

164
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,720
we'll treat Commander Zhao's injuries

165
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,440
when we return to Baiyu City.

166
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,320
You actually came back.

167
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,440
I'm the Lady of this city.

168
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,080
Where else can I go

169
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,600
but here?

170
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,000
Interesting.

171
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,510
Everything won't be fine
just because you're back.

172
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,120
I don't understand what you're saying.

173
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,030
I have ordered their deaths.

174
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,080
Pray

175
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:00,390
that their departure isn't too painful.

176
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:04,750
Ling Xiao,

177
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,320
the person you want is me.

178
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,480
I'm already in your hands.

179
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,270
As long as you let Commander Zhao go,

180
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:13,030
I will obey you

181
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:13,960
without any other intentions.

182
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,240
Just Commander Zhao?

183
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,960
I will fulfill

184
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,120
the duties of a City Lord's Lady

185
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,600
and help you ascend
to the position of City Lord

186
