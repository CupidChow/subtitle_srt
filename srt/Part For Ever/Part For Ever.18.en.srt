111
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,680
You are marrying me willingly,

112
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,430
and I really want to marry you.

113
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,480
If you make others think

114
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,000
that this is just a deal,

115
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,070
I may change my mind at any time.

00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,510
I promise you this.

118
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:15,070
This can temporarily delay
the poison's effects and prolong her life.

119
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,830
If you want to cure her completely,

120
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:31,680
Ling, you know what to do, right?

121
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,920

123
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,390

126
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,240
