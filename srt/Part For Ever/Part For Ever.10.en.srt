I knew you were keeping secrets.

What is happening to you?

18
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,000
Your body is icy cold.

So...

69
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,430
I did it out of honor.

70
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,630
I know.

71
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,000
No personal feelings.

You're suffering from
the side effects of the secret art.

82
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:11,830
Is it worth it?

83
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,390
Every goal

84
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,160
comes with a price.

85
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,040
Achieve the goal by any means necessary.

86
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,680
It's who you are.

87
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:24,800
You are just as stubborn yourself.

88
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,720
You never turn back

89
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,600
despite all the obstacles.

90
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,630
When you put it that way,

91
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,390
we have a lot in common.

92
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,670
Had we met
under different circumstances,

93
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,550
it could've changed everything.

94
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,000
We might

95
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,030
become friends.

96
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,960
I'm not the best person
you want as a friend.

97
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,870
What would you be, then?

98
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,790
I'd say

99
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,270
let bygones be bygones.

100
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,720
Look forward

101
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,080
to the future.

102
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,440
The future is full of uncertainties.

103
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,720
It's far from our reach.

104
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,320
How do we look forward to it?

105
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,200
Perhaps it's best to go with the flow.

106
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,670
Does that mean

107
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,840
you've never thought about your future?

108
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,670
I have.

109
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,600
I met a young man once.

110
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,270
I will never forget that memory.

111
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,270
There were moments

112
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,360
when I wanted to brew tea, make wine,

113
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:50,910
play the Guqin, wield the sword,

114
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,510
and admire the flowers
together with him.

115
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:54,840
It seems

116
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,150
you already have someone in mind.

117
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,080
But that was ages ago.

118
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,150
I've moved on

119
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,630
from having unrealistic dreams.

120
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:03,360
Yes.

121
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,000
There's no need to dream

122
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,150
when he's next to you.

123
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,720
He's not around.

124
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,840
Besides,

125
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:14,240
you have Niyue with you.

126
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:15,630
Niyue...

127
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,360
Niyue is special.

128
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,240
When I was young,

129
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,790
I was at the most helpless

130
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,120
and perilous time of my life.

131
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,790
She came into my life.

132
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,320
She was the one firefly
in that darkness.

133
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:36,080
Now I know why you always defend her.

134
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,200
I will give you the justice you deserve.

135
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,750
You want to take responsibility

136
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,150
for her mistake?

137
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:45,200
You know.

138
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,910
I'm not talking about that.

139
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,270
How can I know if you don't say it?

140
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,360
Will you answer

141
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,750
