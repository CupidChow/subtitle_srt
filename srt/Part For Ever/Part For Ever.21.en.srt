If she truly wished to leave,

19
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,070

to make her so heartbroken?

41
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,280
What happened between us

42
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,870

But now it seems

47
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,120
I was gravely mistaken.

48
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,120
Let me tell you,

Give way?
