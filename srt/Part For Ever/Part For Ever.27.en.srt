[Episode 27]

14
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,310
Su Wan'er,

15
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,120
how does it feel like
to be deceived by your enemy?

16
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,560
For the sake
that we served the same husband,

17
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,310
I'll tell you the truth.

18
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,150
The reason your father killed himself

19
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:19,310
was because the incense

20
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:21,480
was no ordinary incense
lit at the banquet.

21
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:22,950
It was a type of incense called

22
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,230
"Illusion Incense",

23
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,310
[Orchid, bluish-purple.]
made from processed orchid flowers.

24
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:28,040
Using blood as a catalyst,

25
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,070
it could lead those
with heart knots

26
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,840
into a hallucinatory state,

27
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,230
causing them to go mad

28
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,950
and take their own lives.

29
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:38,120
Ling Xiao knew your father felt guilty,

30
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,430
so he dripped a drop of his blood

31
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,120
onto Huanmeng Incense

32
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,680
and lit it at the banquet.

33
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,760
He concealed his despicable actions

34
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:49,840
and manipulated the truth
to frame Wang Zhen.

35
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,290
What are you doing?

36
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,640
Ling... Ling Xiao...

37
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,240
What's wrong with you?

38
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:16,840
Is there something
troubling you deep inside?

39
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,470
What is it?

40
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,430
I can't tell you.

41
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,750
It's

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,960
my deepest secret.

43
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,590
Fine.

44
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,200
Then tell me,

45
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,520
did my father

46
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,410
fall victim to the Huanmeng Incense?

47
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,330
Just a little.

48
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,240
What?

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I just sprinkled a little,

50
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,590
and he went mad

51
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,860
and ended his own life.

52
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:06,360
He deserved it.

53
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:11,050
So, it really was you
who added fuel to the fire.

54
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,640
He defiled my mother.
Didn't he deserve to die?

55
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,430
I sought revenge for my mother.

56
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,190
What's wrong with that?

57
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,600
Yes,

58
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,320
you wanted to avenge your mother,

59
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,160
but I have my reasons
to avenge my father too.

60
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,140
That's why we shouldn't have met,

00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,530

not to tell you the truth.

before his death.

128
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:06,820

his mind with poison.

130
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,140
My Lord, you guessed it right.

131
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,620
The poison made by Niyue is extracted

132
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,060
from the essence of the orchid.

133
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,770
It's similar to the Huanmeng Incense

134

she made before,

135
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,770
but with stronger effects.

136
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,820
This poison can control people's minds

137
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,210
and make them do her bidding.

138
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,820

Are you really going to do this?

143
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,820
If I had any other way,

144
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,620

I have already confessed
everything to her.

148
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,020
She will leave me,

149
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,460
