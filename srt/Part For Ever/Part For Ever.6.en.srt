beside the altar.

Seven feet tall with a sturdy build,

59
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,750

Why do you care? It's my body.

85
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,430

86
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,160

He said he would definitely investigate
and find out the truth of the matter.

109

110

of this opportunity?

112

I've made up my mind.

114
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,920
But as long as you are
in Ling Xiao's hands,

115
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,310
I would have trouble sleeping
and eating all day.

the Lord of the City

122

by using various vices
and taking great pains.

123
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,560
I have also heard for a long time
that Mr. Jing has a secret skill:

124
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,070
Good at pretending as
someone else's shadow,

125
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,560
hiding under a mask.

126
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,360
Taking about hiding under a mask,

127
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,360

128
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,160

Remember.

132
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,720
In the future, don't go to places
you shouldn't be at.

133
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,120
Don't touch

134
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,600

136
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,950
Is this how Canglong City

entertains the distinguished guests?

138
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,560
You trespass into my wife's room,

139
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,630

a distinguished guest?

00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,870
Send Mr. Jing to the guest hall.

144
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:16,680
Yes.

145
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,630
Let me go.

146
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,720
You care about him so much.

148
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,750
We are both innocent.

149
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,030
He cares about you, protects you,

150
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,480
and willingly takes risks for you.

151
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,080
The way he looks at you

152
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,720
is not innocent at all.

153

The sound of you calling his name

157
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,390

To be able to disgust Lord Ling

159
