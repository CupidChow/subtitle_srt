15
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,310
I'm willing

16
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,120
to accept any punishment.

17
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,230
I don't understand

18
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,040
why you're doing this.

19
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,590
I'm willing to give up everything.

20
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,480
I only ask you to let them go.

21
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,400
You're overestimating yourself.

22
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:34,310
You...

23
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,710
Taking their lives

24
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,120
is as simple as crushing an ant.

25
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,120
Tomorrow is the succession ceremony.

26
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,590
You better behave

27
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,920
and stop playing tricks.

28
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:48,870
Ling Xiao,

29
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,870
I've arranged a good show

30
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,120
for your succession ceremony tomorrow.

31
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,480
The case of my father's suicide

32
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,640
is still unclear.

33
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,640
I must return to the City Lord's Mansion

34
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:00,870
to find out the truth.

35
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,480
But you're alone.

36
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,870
Don't worry. I have a plan.

37
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,870
I just need

38
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,430
your help.

39
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,520
You should know the consequences

40
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,190
of playing tricks.

41
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,310
The succession ceremony concerns
the reputation of Canglong City.

42
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,080
How could I do anything
to harm Canglong City

43
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,800
just to go against you?

The auspicious time has arrived!

00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:59,360
May His Lordship and Her Ladyship

46
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,360
come forward to pay respects!

47
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,400
Are you deliberately
attracting attention

48
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,680
and inviting criticism?

49
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,120
The ceremony begins now!

50
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,240
May we ask His Lordship and Her Ladyship

51
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,190
to pay respects to the former City Lord!

52
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,270
Where is Ling Xiao?

53

Father, I'm Wan'er.

54
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,240
Were you harmed by traitors?

55
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,630
Now all the people
of Canglong City are here.

56
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,120
You can tell the truth to the world.

57
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,360
I made a huge mistake

58
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,430
and can only end my life to atone.

59
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,310
It's the cycle of heaven's justice.

60
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,480
This is all my retribution.

61
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,120
That's impossible. You're...

62
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:00,040
Ling Xiao, you are decisive

63
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,480
and diligent.

64
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,190
A rare talent.

65
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:07,430
The position of Canglong City's
City Lord belongs to you.

66
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,360
Thank you for your appreciation.

67
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,750
I, Ling Xiao,

68
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:15,190
shall not disappoint you
and your kindness.

69
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:17,920
It was you.

70
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,270
I should thank you

71
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,120

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,040
I didn't expect you

80
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,360
to prepare such a masterpiece for me.

81
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,830

- My Lord!

86
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,680
Run! It's on fire!

87
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,950
The fire is getting bigger.

88
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,070
We can't wait here to die.

The wind is currently blowing
from the east.
