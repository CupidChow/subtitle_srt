189
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,164
Yeah, as hot as you.

190
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,378
You're even better.

191
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:49,132
What are you wearing?

192
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,928
<i>A white bikini brief.</i>

193
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,764
You can almost see my cock through it.

194
00:16:57,015 --> 00:16:58,684
I'm so hard right now.

195
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,811
It's head is sticking out.

196
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,023
Suck it.

197
00:17:08,735 --> 00:17:10,237
Right away?

198
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:15,659
We just started, and you're
already getting heated.

199
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,411
<i>Of course.</i>

200
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,747
<i>I want to taste you.</i>

201
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,461
Undress me first.

202
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:29,590
<i>What are you wearing now?</i>

203
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,592
A bikini.

204
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,513
A two-piece bikini.

205
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,648
<i>Hold me tight.</i>

206
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:50,485
<i>I’ll slowly remove your bra.</i>

207
00:18:00,495 --> 00:18:02,247
<i>Then I'll eat you out.</i>

208
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:05,042
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

209
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:12,049
<i>There, I'm taking off your panties...</i>

210
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:15,260
<i>using my teeth to strip you off.</i>

211
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:24,895
<i>Fuck, you're quite hairy.</i>

212
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:27,147
<i>It feels great on my tongue.</i>

213
00:18:30,108 --> 00:18:31,818
Come on, Bojo.

214
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:36,114
Make that tongue crawl up to my breasts.

215
00:18:36,823 --> 00:18:43,413
Then, circle it around my two hard nipples.

216
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,768
You're so hot, Bojo.

217
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,186
Keep going.

218
00:19:06,853 --> 00:19:08,188
So good.

219
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:33,714
You're so good, Bojo!

220
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,340
Yes, yes.

221
00:19:51,022 --> 00:19:53,400
Thirty-eight minutes.

222
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:15,213
You're Amanda, right?

223
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,425
Can you light this up?

224
00:20:26,057 --> 00:20:27,726
You were great earlier.

225
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,395
You seemed so experienced, huh.

226
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:32,856
By the way, I'm Wendy.

227
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:37,194
I don’t even know
what got into me to do that.

228
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:44,826
Well, they told us that
we also serve fantasies here.

229
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:46,620
I guess I just...

230
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:49,080
fantasized as well.

231
00:20:50,248 --> 00:20:53,168
What did you think about?

232
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,129
You must be a happy wife, right?

233
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:59,841
I've never even moaned like that
from doing it with my husband.

234
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:01,467
Really?

235
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,095
I knew it.

236
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,264
You were thinking of another man, right?

237
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:17,859
Shit.

238
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,862
That's quite something.

239
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,283
Don't you feel like...

240
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:28,620
you're cheating on your husband?

241
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:34,042
It's just a fantasy.

242
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:37,671
I won't act on it.

243
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:45,428
True,

244
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:47,973
if I were to imagine someone...

245
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:50,517
I'd think of...

246
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,770
Wendell Ramos,

247
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:57,399
he looks like my boyfriend.

248
00:21:58,733 --> 00:22:00,902
But actually, did you know,

249
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:02,988
my boyfriend and I

250
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:05,532
haven't done anything yet.

251
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:07,909
Done what?

252
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,370
Done that.

253
00:22:11,454 --> 00:22:12,956
Well,

254
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,042
he says he's Christian,

255
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:21,006
and he wants to get married
first because he respects me.

256
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:22,465
Could he be gay?

257
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:26,678
That's actually the reason

258
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:31,308
why I've been looking for a job.

259
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,853
To save up money for our wedding.

260
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:38,565
Then we’ll go to Canada.

261
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:41,359
We'll get married there...

262
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,778
during winter.

263
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,407
Oh sorry,

264
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:50,327
I think I've shared too much.

265
00:22:51,786 --> 00:22:53,204
By the way,

266
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,875
I have some stuff for sale here.

267
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:04,049
It's just a sideline.

268
00:23:05,508 --> 00:23:06,885
This would suit you.

269
00:23:11,514 --> 00:23:12,891
Next time.

270
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:15,560
I have a lot of bills to pay right now.

271
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,272
Okay, that's fine.

272
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,399
Just tell me if you want them.

273
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:37,248
It wasn't a power outage.

274
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:44,923
You just didn't pay our bill, that's why.

275
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,342
It's the same thing.

276
00:23:56,851 --> 00:23:57,851
Hmm.

277
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:01,064
Just buy a new one.

278
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:04,358
Wow.

279
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:07,903
Goddammit.

280
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:09,948
You seem to be doing well at your job.

281
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,242
What do you do there, anyway?

282
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,248
I told you before, didn’t I?

283
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,166
I do admin staff.

284
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:24,546
Our boss is generous
with bonuses when sales are high.

285
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:29,758
What if...

286
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:31,594
What if I apply there, too?

287
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:33,638
So we're both earning money.

288
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:37,183
No need, Pabs.

289
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:38,685
I can handle this.

290
00:24:47,318 --> 00:24:48,403
What the hell?

291
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:51,448
You're drenched in sweat!

292
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,366
Why don’t you take a shower first?

293
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,035
Shower?

294
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:58,329
I said I’m tired!

295
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:00,707
Goddammit.

296
00:25:01,916 --> 00:25:03,168
Why are you acting like that?

297
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:07,406
You're acting high and mighty
just because you found a job?

298
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:10,717
I told you I'm tired!

299
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,140
What are you watching?

300
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:44,643
Nothing.

301
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:00,160
You just blue-balled me?

302
00:27:01,452 --> 00:27:04,038
Saying no to me, then I find you
watching porn by yourself?

303
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:06,249
What’s your problem, Amanda?

304
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:07,876
I told you, nothing!

305
00:27:08,042 --> 00:27:09,586
Can’t I just be alone?

306
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,297
Are you fucking crazy?

307
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:14,757
You want that?

308
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:16,466
You wanna get railed like that?

309
00:27:16,467 --> 00:27:17,677
I can do that!

310
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:20,888
What?

311
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,435
Is that all you want?

312
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:27,394
No, Pablo.

313
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:28,395
What is it?

314
00:27:30,356 --> 00:27:32,317
Goddammit, why are you acting up?

315
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:34,443
Fuck you!

316
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:37,780
Fuck you!

317
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:42,243
I don’t want to have sex
with you, you got that?

318
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:46,539
Don’t you understand that
when I say no, I mean no!

319
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:47,998
Fuck you!

320
00:27:48,082 --> 00:27:49,292
Well fuck you more!

321
00:27:49,375 --> 00:27:50,418
Fucking diva!

322
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:41,344
<i>Cherry, are you crying?</i>

323
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:51,729
Sir, sir, I’m sorry, sir.

324
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,064
I’m sorry.

325
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,109
<i>Wait, let’s talk some more.</i>

326
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,490
Sir, don’t. It’s just a
waste of your money.

327
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:18,298
Why are you crying?

328
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:23,845
I do all the work.

329
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,472
I give him all he wants.

330
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,990
And it still feels like it's not enough.

331
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:33,229
Do I mean anything to him?

332
00:29:35,189 --> 00:29:36,399
To whom?

333
00:29:36,774 --> 00:29:37,817
Your husband?

334
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:42,613
He's not acting like my husband at all.

335
00:29:47,493 --> 00:29:49,620
He wasn't even like that before.

336
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:54,542
We were happy then.

337
00:29:57,211 --> 00:30:01,007
Everything was fine, for a year or two.

338
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:09,682
But why do I feel happier
talking to you now?

339
00:30:09,932 --> 00:30:12,518
Even though we don’t know each other.

340
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:15,605
<i>Me too.</i>

341
00:30:16,814 --> 00:30:19,901
<i>My whole day feels complete
when I get to talk to you.</i>

342
00:30:21,527 --> 00:30:24,155
<i>I can’t get you out of my mind.</i>

343
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,534
<i>Cherry, kiss me.</i>

344
00:30:30,536 --> 00:30:35,166
Sir, your bill, we're
taking too long already.

345
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:44,842
<i>I told you, I don’t care, right?</i>

346
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:51,473
<i>It's funny how a deeper
connection can be formed,</i>

347
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:54,227
<i>between two people who
barely know each other.</i>

348
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,814
<i>As long as they value each other.</i>

349
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:00,733
<i>That's why...</i>

350
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:04,779
<i>Whatever his shortcomings are, I promise...</i>

351
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,365
<i>I can give to you.</i>

352
00:31:14,997 --> 00:31:16,416
<i>It's true!</i>

353
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:18,876
<i>Go ahead and laugh at me.</i>

354
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:23,297
<i>But I prefer hearing
that than hearing you cry.</i>

355
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:09,844
<i>I’m just here.</i>

356
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:13,848
<i>No matter how many days,
no matter how long,</i>

357
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,350
<i>no matter how much,</i>

358
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:19,187
<i>I will still call you.</i>

359
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,028
Sir, thank you.

360
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:29,238
Just call me Alfred.

361
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:43,336
Hey, Wendy.

362
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:47,715
Amanda...

363
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:50,801
How do I resign here?

364
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,014
You just got hired, right?

365
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:57,600
Why are you leaving all of a sudden.

366
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:02,188
There’s a guy who keeps calling me.

367
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:06,692
I can’t stomach what he wants me to do.

368
00:33:07,818 --> 00:33:09,320
Even if it’s just on the phone...

369
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:12,490
I get goosebumps.

370
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,702
Sometimes I even dream about it.

371
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,710
What is he saying?

372
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:31,133
He wants to see me walking in a dark alley.

373
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:36,514
He said he would follow me from a distance.

374
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:42,770
Then he would chase me, grab me.

375
00:33:45,439 --> 00:33:47,858
He said he would push me against the wall.

376
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:52,238
And there, he would undress me...

377
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:54,782
he would rape me.

378
00:33:57,285 --> 00:34:01,539
Slap me, violate me...

379
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:06,210
over and over.

380
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:13,259
That’s just his fantasy.

381
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:16,095
You know, Wendy...

382
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:21,726
everyone's dirty little secrets bare
their face in their fantasies.

383
00:34:24,061 --> 00:34:26,897
That's where the line is drawn
between people, good and evil.

384
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:30,151
The good ones...

385
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:35,906
they know it's all just make-believe and
that acting on it would bear consequences.

386
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:42,872
And as long as you’re here,

387
00:34:43,789 --> 00:34:46,125
those will remain in their fantasies.

388
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:49,837
They can’t do anything to you.

389
00:34:50,921 --> 00:34:52,256
Just go along with it,

390
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:55,134
it’s a waste of money otherwise.

391
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:01,534
Pabs, what is this?

392
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:07,790
Didn’t I give money to pay the rent?

393
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:10,835
For the electricity.

394
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:17,758
What happened?

395
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:29,478
Pablo, I’m talking to you.

396
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:33,315
Well, I haven't paid yet.

397
00:36:37,611 --> 00:36:39,613
I forgot, I’ll fix it tomorrow.

398
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:41,031
Are we good?

399
00:36:41,907 --> 00:36:42,783
Hey, wait!

400
00:36:42,908 --> 00:36:46,245
What are you so preoccupied
with that you can’t even pay our bills?!

401
00:36:46,912 --> 00:36:48,998
I do all the work, I do everything!

402
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:51,521
This is all I asked, and you can't even
get your ass to do it!

403
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:56,797
You do all the work!

404
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,700
That's what you're so proud about?!

405
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:03,804
You're rubbing it in my face,
that you have a job!

406
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:07,348
Do you have the right to look down on me
and belittle me like that, huh?!

407
00:37:07,349 --> 00:37:08,725
Pablo, I’m not belittling you.

408
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,186
Then shut the hell up!

409
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:28,329
Hey, baby.

410
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:29,747
It's Cherry.

411
00:37:30,372 --> 00:37:31,372
<i>Cherry.</i>

412
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,540
<i>Is it you?</i>

413
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:34,001
<i>It's Alfred.</i>

414
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:37,880
Alfred.

415
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,424
I missed you, baby.

416
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:41,717
<i>I missed you too.</i>

417
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:43,302
<i>I missed you so much.</i>

418
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:46,764
I missed you too, Alfred.

419
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:50,392
<i>Kiss me.</i>

420
00:40:34,431 --> 00:40:38,435
665-1230.

421
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:40,979
Huh?

422
00:40:42,147 --> 00:40:43,565
That's my number.

423
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:46,485
Call me next time.

424
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:49,655
Sir, I can't do that.

425
00:40:50,864 --> 00:40:52,449
Just keep it with you.

426
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:55,160
Do whatever you want with it.

427
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:58,622
You can call me anytime you want.

428
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:08,215
Thank you, Sir.

429
00:41:11,301 --> 00:41:12,803
<i>Just Alfred.</i>

430
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:15,723
Thank you, Alfred.

431
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:17,516
Ouch!

432
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:19,143
It hurts!

433
00:41:19,601 --> 00:41:20,686
No!

434
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:27,359
Wendy, what happened?

435
00:41:27,609 --> 00:41:29,778
They said we were in the grass.

436
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:32,114
He was chasing me.

437
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:35,034
He held a knife to my neck.

438
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:38,912
While he was raping me...

439
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:42,499
While he was raping me over and over...

440
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:45,085
it never ends!

441
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:02,227
19 minutes and 48 seconds.

442
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:18,452
People hide a lot of things, right?

443
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,540
Things they can reveal to people
they don’t even know...

444
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:27,711
to people who can keep their secrets.

445
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,506
Exactly, sis.

446
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:34,009
But thank you, okay?

447
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:36,260
For what?

448
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:40,265
For encouraging me to just go for it,

449
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:42,101
I kind of get it now.

450
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:49,274
Maybe the person calling me
who wants to rape...

451
00:42:49,691 --> 00:42:53,654
maybe, that person is timid in real life.

452
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:56,489
Maybe,

453
00:42:57,449 --> 00:43:01,495
he's always being stepped on by
the people around him.

454
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:06,875
So even just through phone sex, he wants to

455
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:09,419
be the one in control.

456
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:15,342
But you know what's weird, sis?

457
00:43:17,427 --> 00:43:20,681
It's like I'm starting to crave his kink.

458
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:24,268
I think...

459
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:29,565
it must be nice to really experience that.

460
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:38,198
What?

461
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:42,244
Being raped repeatedly before being killed?

462
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:46,999
Let's skip the part where I get killed.

463
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:51,962
You're crazy.

464
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:54,673
I told you, it’s just a fantasy.

465
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,758
As long as it’s on the phone, it’s fine.

466
00:43:57,926 --> 00:44:00,387
It's a different matter
when it’s in real life.

467
00:44:04,641 --> 00:44:06,768
He wants to meet me.

468
00:44:07,352 --> 00:44:08,352
Huh?

469
00:44:09,354 --> 00:44:10,814
Five thousand.

470
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:14,109
He said we should meet some time.

471
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,154
Well, of course, you won’t do it.

472
00:44:19,781 --> 00:44:21,825
I’m actually thinking about it.

473
00:44:22,659 --> 00:44:27,748
He must be different in real life.

474
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,378
Wait, hold on, Wendy.

475
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:38,217
I told you to do well at work.

476
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:40,969
I didn't say to take it seriously.

477
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:42,512
Don't be stupid.

478
00:45:14,419 --> 00:45:16,505
Pabs, hold on.

479
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:18,548
What, you don't feel like it again?

480
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:21,551
- You’re always not in the mood, huh.
- Pablo, stop that!

481
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:28,350
What are you proud of? Huh?

482
00:45:28,725 --> 00:45:31,395
Do you think you’re the
CEO of a company, huh?!

483
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:37,276
Damn it, Pablo.

484
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:40,362
What are you doing?

485
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:41,696
Sssh!

486
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:43,282
Shut up!

487
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:56,753
Pablo, what the fuck!

488
00:46:00,757 --> 00:46:01,425
Ouch!

489
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:02,717
Ouch!

490
00:46:24,489 --> 00:46:26,033
It hurts!

491
00:46:31,496 --> 00:46:33,540
Damn it, stop this!

492
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:36,626
Stop it!

493
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:48,263
Fuck you, Pablo.

494
00:47:13,724 --> 00:47:15,623
<i>[phone ringing]</i>

495
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:17,750
<i>Hello, good evening, police station.</i>

496
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:18,876
I... I...

497
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:20,420
I was raped.

498
00:47:23,151 --> 00:47:24,652
<i>Let's stay calm, Ma'am.</i>

499
00:47:24,677 --> 00:47:25,970
<i>Who raped you?</i>

500
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,805
My husband.

501
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:31,931
<i>Your husband?</i>

502
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:33,140
Yes.

503
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:37,145
<i>Oh ma'am, it might just
be a domestic dispute.</i>

504
00:47:37,687 --> 00:47:39,230
<i>Okay ma'am, here's what we're gonna do..</i>

505
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:41,941
<i>It’s better if you rest for now.</i>

506
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:46,028
<i>- Then tomorrow morning, go to the barangay.</i>
<i>- </i>Hello?

507
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:50,017
<i>So you can talk and
settle things with your</i>

508
00:47:50,041 --> 00:47:54,805
<i>husband about what
happened between you two.</i>

509
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:57,540
<i>Okay ma'am, let’s just
leave it at that for now.</i>

510
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:58,541
<i>Take care.</i>

511
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:22,648
Hello?

512
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:24,734
This is Amanda.

513
00:48:25,976 --> 00:48:27,612
Oh, it's Cherry.

514
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:30,824
<i>I know, I know your voice so well.</i>

515
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:34,327
<i>So your name's Amanda.</i>

516
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:39,457
<i>Come, pay me a visit.</i>

517
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:40,959
<i>Here's my address.</i>

518
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,363
Hello?

519
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:13,700
Alfred.

520
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:16,161
Is anyone home?

521
00:49:57,536 --> 00:49:59,412
You're Alfred?

522
00:50:01,998 --> 00:50:04,709
- Sorry—
- Are you fucking with me?

523
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:07,003
Amanda, listen.

524
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,507
It's true, I'm Alfred.

525
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:12,801
Listen to me.

526
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:16,555
I'm not fooling you.

527
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:21,226
I could never do that to you.

528
00:50:26,022 --> 00:50:27,399
Fuck you!

529
00:50:32,153 --> 00:50:34,364
Amanda please, please, Amanda.

530
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:37,534
Please, just listen to me first.

531
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:39,035
Let me go.

532
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:46,042
Why did you have to pretend?

533
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:52,173
You were a paying customer.

534
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:55,552
I’ll talk to you even if you’re a woman.

535
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:01,891
What if you find out I’m a woman?

536
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:08,231
After your paid time,
will you still talk to me?

537
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:13,194
Amanda.

538
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:17,032
Please.

539
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:32,297
Rina.

540
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:35,050
My name is Rina.

541
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:44,017
You're good, Rina.

542
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:48,897
I'm such an idiot.

543
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:53,443
You made a fool out of me.

544
00:51:56,988 --> 00:51:59,699
It didn’t even cross my mind.

545
00:52:08,249 --> 00:52:09,876
Tell me.

546
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:13,004
How did you do that?

547
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:26,309
I've been doing it since I was a kid.

548
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:31,731
I tried to make my
voice sound like a man's.

549
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:37,862
And I was able to...

550
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:42,992
No, I’m not just able to.

551
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:46,705
I’m good at it.

552
00:52:51,793 --> 00:52:55,714
The radio dramas you hear
on your jeepney rides,

553
00:52:57,048 --> 00:52:59,843
I play at least two characters on those.

554
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:13,314
I become a different person.

555
00:53:18,611 --> 00:53:21,072
And that person...

556
00:53:28,037 --> 00:53:30,665
that’s my truth.

557
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:42,385
The truth we had...

558
00:53:48,516 --> 00:53:51,394
since I met you on the hotline.

559
00:54:07,952 --> 00:54:09,412
Amanda.

560
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:56,740
Amanda?

561
00:58:57,617 --> 00:58:58,743
Amanda, why?

562
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:01,412
Why? What’s happening?

563
00:59:02,955 --> 00:59:04,082
Where are you going?

564
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:07,960
Wait, just talk to me, Amanda.

565
00:59:08,544 --> 00:59:09,629
Come on, Amanda...

566
00:59:10,588 --> 00:59:12,507
Wait, let’s talk about this.

567
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:16,010
What’s happening?

568
00:59:16,427 --> 00:59:17,427
Why?

569
00:59:18,262 --> 00:59:19,263
This is wrong.

570
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:20,598
What’s wrong?

571
00:59:21,015 --> 00:59:22,433
Amanda, wait.

572
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:24,059
- Let’s talk.
- You fooled me.

573
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:26,019
- Let’s talk.
- I’m going home, I’m going home!

574
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:28,189
This is wrong, this is wrong.
I’m going home.

575
00:59:28,773 --> 00:59:29,857
You're wrong.

576
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:31,484
This is wrong.

577
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:33,068
I’m going home.

578
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:34,904
I’ll take you home, okay?

579
00:59:35,696 --> 00:59:36,781
It's alright.

580
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:38,366
I’ll take you home.

581
00:59:40,701 --> 00:59:42,578
- I’ll take you home.
- This is wrong.

582
00:59:42,954 --> 00:59:44,205
I’m going home.

583
00:59:44,372 --> 00:59:46,999
Okay, I’ll take you home.

584

585
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:08,938

586
01:00:09,355 --> 01:00:11,607
<i>After all this time we’ve been together...</i>

587
01:00:12,316 --> 01:00:14,068
<i>I no longer feel happy..</i>

588
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:16,779
<i>I want to be free and feel...</i>

589
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:18,823
<i>real love.</i>

590
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:21,909
<i>I'm leaving you—</i>

591
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:26,539
Just stay here.

592
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:33,004
I have a husband.

593
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:35,464
Take me home.

594
01:01:04,285 --> 01:01:05,285
Pablo?

595
01:01:10,499 --> 01:01:11,500
Pablo?

596
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:29,018
Pablo?

597
01:01:59,173 --> 01:02:00,466
Where have you been?

598
01:02:05,846 --> 01:02:08,224
Somewhere I can cool off.

<i>[Moaning]</i>

600
01:03:19,795 --> 01:03:20,795
<i>Wait.</i>

601
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,131
<i>Why am I the only one moaning?</i>

602
01:03:22,798 --> 01:03:23,798
<i>Dammit.</i>

603
01:03:23,924 --> 01:03:25,718
<i>What a waste of money!</i>

604
01:03:39,815 --> 01:03:40,608
Hello?

605
01:03:40,609 --> 01:03:41,776
Talk to me.

606
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:45,363
<i>Amanda, let’s talk.</i>

607
01:03:47,114 --> 01:03:48,741
Stop it, can you?

608
01:03:49,241 --> 01:03:50,618
I’m already married.

609
01:03:51,702 --> 01:03:54,455
<i>Do you really wanna
stop because you're married?</i>

610
01:03:55,873 --> 01:03:57,875
Or because you can’t accept me?

611
01:04:01,462 --> 01:04:03,881
<i>Let me speak first, Amanda.</i>

612
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:06,217
<i>Just listen.</i>

613
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:09,678
<i>Even if it’s just for your job.</i>

614
01:04:12,431 --> 01:04:15,101
<i>I know you liked what happened between us.</i>

615
01:04:15,893 --> 01:04:19,021
<i>I know because the sound
of your moans didn’t change.</i>

616
01:04:20,773 --> 01:04:23,317
<i>If you don’t want to meet, that’s fine.</i>

617
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:27,613
<i>But don’t cut off what
we’ve started, Amanda.</i>

618
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:30,240
Cherry,

619
01:04:30,991 --> 01:04:32,910
when we talk here...

620
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:34,995
You call me Cherry.

621
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:38,457
<i>I love you, Cherry.</i>

622
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:42,044
<i>In my fantasy,</i>

623
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:44,088
<i>in my world of make-believe...</i>

624
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:49,260
<i>in those I find my truth.</i>

625
01:04:49,593 --> 01:04:52,263
<i>That is the real me, Amanda.</i>

626
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:56,016
<i>What I feel for you is real.</i>

627
01:04:57,184 --> 01:04:59,311
<i>Even when they all end up leaving you,</i>

628
01:05:00,646 --> 01:05:02,231
<i>I won't leave, Cherry.</i>

629
01:05:03,941 --> 01:05:06,026
<i>Please don't leave me Amanda.</i>

630
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:15,911
Grab me!

631
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:18,330
Go on, grab me.

632
01:05:18,497 --> 01:05:19,665
There.

633
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,003
Now slap me.

634
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:25,212
Slap me.

635
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:27,380
There.

636
01:05:27,548 --> 01:05:28,548
Yes!

637
01:05:32,136 --> 01:05:33,136
Spit on me.

638
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:34,262
Spit on me.

639
01:05:38,225 --> 01:05:39,435
Slap me.

640
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:42,604
There.

641
01:05:53,073 --> 01:05:54,073
There.

642
01:06:37,868 --> 01:06:38,868
Did...

643
01:06:38,994 --> 01:06:40,996
Did you see anything, Amanda?

644
01:06:45,084 --> 01:06:46,126
I saw a lot.

645
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:54,426
I got too horny earlier.

646
01:06:56,095 --> 01:06:57,263
She said she was, too.

647
01:06:58,514 --> 01:07:00,432
We weren't able to resist.

648
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:08,065
If you want, some other time...

649
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:10,442
the two of us,

650
01:07:11,819 --> 01:07:13,696
it's okay with me.

652
01:08:55,756 --> 01:08:56,840
Why?

653
01:08:58,342 --> 01:09:01,637
This is only the second time
I've been with you here...

654
01:09:02,012 --> 01:09:05,766
But it feels like such a long time.

656
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:18,111
When I first saw you...

657
01:09:18,112 --> 01:09:22,616
I said, you look just like
I imagined you would.

658
01:09:24,625 --> 01:09:27,590
I thought of something else.

659
01:09:28,706 --> 01:09:29,873
I know.

660
01:09:32,703 --> 01:09:33,995
<i>Is it okay now?</i>

661
01:09:51,395 --> 01:09:52,563
Just stay here for a while.

662
01:09:55,065 --> 01:09:57,818
You don't deserve the kind
of treatment he gives you.

663
01:10:00,904 --> 01:10:03,907
And also, you won't have
any problems here

Thank you, okay?

666
01:10:13,792 --> 01:10:17,379
But I'm not used to it.

667
01:10:19,256 --> 01:10:20,256
Used to what?

668
01:10:23,343 --> 01:10:24,343
Used to this.

669
01:10:24,887 --> 01:10:26,263
Being taken care of.

670
01:10:36,106 --> 01:10:37,106
Hello?

671
01:10:37,733 --> 01:10:38,400
Ahh.

672
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:40,652
Do you know where Amanda is?

673
01:10:41,445 --> 01:10:43,363
She hasn't gone home yet.

674
01:10:44,615 --> 01:10:45,824
Okay, thanks.

675
01:10:52,581 --> 01:10:53,582
Ricandro!

676
01:10:55,167 --> 01:10:57,044
You know it will hurt me!

677
01:11:09,556 --> 01:11:11,016
Is there a problem?

678
01:11:19,817 --> 01:11:21,693
I'm just thinking about Pablo.

679
01:11:23,779 --> 01:11:24,780
What for?

680
01:11:26,657 --> 01:11:28,534
He's still my husband.

681
01:11:31,078 --> 01:11:32,955
He doesn't deserve you, Amanda.

682
01:11:33,831 --> 01:11:34,832
Remember that.

685
01:12:06,613 --> 01:12:08,073
Good, right?!

686
01:12:10,284 --> 01:12:11,743
You're so good!

687
01:12:16,206 --> 01:12:17,206
How do you do that?

688
01:12:17,666 --> 01:12:19,042
Don't expect it...

689
01:12:19,751 --> 01:12:20,961
Ricandro...

690
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:22,504
Louder.

691
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:26,342
Like it feels so good!

692
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:41,565
Wait.

693
01:12:43,609 --> 01:12:44,818
What is that?

694
01:12:45,903 --> 01:12:46,903
Nothing.

695
01:12:47,446 --> 01:12:48,822
I'm anemic.

696
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:51,450
That's why I get bruises.

697
01:12:54,536 --> 01:12:55,787
Let me see.

698
01:13:57,599 --> 01:13:59,559
Hey, didn't you sleep?

699
01:13:59,935 --> 01:14:01,436
I waited for you.

700
01:14:04,189 --> 01:14:06,149
That wasn't necessary.

701
01:14:08,568 --> 01:14:10,570
I have insomnia, remember?

702
01:14:11,738 --> 01:14:13,532
That's exactly the reason why we met.

703
01:14:19,496 --> 01:14:21,373
You help me sleep.

704
01:14:25,752 --> 01:14:27,838
Well this one... helps me sleep.

705
01:14:32,259 --> 01:14:33,301
Thank you.

706
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:53,488
How are you?

707
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:03,874
Just tired.

708
01:15:06,126 --> 01:15:10,589
Since we've dated, I had to talk
to a lot more clients.

709
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:15,802
You can just stop working, you know?

710
01:15:16,553 --> 01:15:17,553
Huh?

711
01:15:17,888 --> 01:15:18,888
Yeah.

712
01:15:19,473 --> 01:15:21,016
I make enough for us.

713
01:15:21,475 --> 01:15:23,769
You don't need to work anymore.

714
01:15:25,312 --> 01:15:27,189
If you just don't want to get bored.

715
01:15:27,981 --> 01:15:29,941
I can get you into my work.

716
01:15:31,485 --> 01:15:34,279
So we can always be together.

717
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:43,663
Think about it, okay?

718
01:15:49,461 --> 01:15:50,712
I love you.

719
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:02,891
Hey,

720
01:16:03,141 --> 01:16:05,310
I said I love you.

721
01:16:15,278 --> 01:16:17,239
<i>Explain it to me, Annabelle.</i>

722
01:16:17,697 --> 01:16:21,784
<i>Why do you seem disgusted
and can't reciprocate the love I offer?</i>

723
01:16:21,785 --> 01:16:24,078
<i>Don't say you want to hear it, Ricandro!</i>

724
01:16:24,079 --> 01:16:27,915
<i>Well then it would be better
if I just died, Annabelle,</i>

725
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:31,669
<i>because there's no point in living
in this world anymore!</i>

726
01:16:31,670 --> 01:16:32,712
<i>Ricandro!</i>

727
01:16:33,004 --> 01:16:34,922
<i>No!</i>

728
01:16:34,923 --> 01:16:36,967
You bastard, what the hell?!

729
01:16:38,093 --> 01:16:40,219
Damn it, call an ambulance!

730
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:42,139

738
01:17:42,574 --> 01:17:44,534
She has a regular caller.

739
01:17:44,868 --> 01:17:45,868
A man.

740
01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:51,041
They engage in rape sex
rolepaly when they talk.

741
01:17:51,958 --> 01:17:53,168
Well, if that's the case,

742
01:17:53,418 --> 01:17:56,796
do you record every call to your operators?

743
01:17:58,381 --> 01:17:59,633
There are recordings.

744
01:18:00,175 --> 01:18:00,926
Wait a moment.

745
01:18:00,927 --> 01:18:01,927
Okay.

746
01:18:19,736 --> 01:18:21,196
<i>You're walking home,</i>

747
01:18:22,322 --> 01:18:23,882
<i>you're about to take a shortcut around,</i>

748
01:18:24,991 --> 01:18:26,868
<i>through the tall grass...</i>

749
01:18:27,869 --> 01:18:29,329
<i>I saw you.</i>

750
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:31,164
<i>Goddammit.</i>

751
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:32,582
<i>You're so sexy.</i>

752
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:34,083
<i>Here I come.</i>

753
01:18:34,501 --> 01:18:38,088
<i>I'm going to grab you by your shoulders.</i>

754
01:18:38,505 --> 01:18:39,714
<i>You're running away.</i>

755
01:18:41,591 --> 01:18:43,260
<i>But I'll catch up to you.</i>

756
01:18:43,593 --> 01:18:45,303
<i>I'm going to grab you.</i>

757
01:18:46,179 --> 01:18:47,514
<i>I've got you.</i>

758
01:18:48,181 --> 01:18:49,349
<i>Goddammit.</i>

759
01:18:49,516 --> 01:18:51,643
<i>Your neck is so soft.</i>

760
01:18:53,853 --> 01:18:54,938
<i>Goddammit.</i>

761
01:18:55,438 --> 01:18:56,773
<i>You're so damn hot.</i>

762
01:19:06,950 --> 01:19:07,950
Pablo!

763
01:19:08,368 --> 01:19:09,368
Pablo!

764
01:19:32,267 --> 01:19:33,267
Pablo!

765
01:19:33,393 --> 01:19:34,644
Where are you?

766
01:19:36,104 --> 01:19:37,397
Why aren't you answering?

767
01:19:37,772 --> 01:19:39,733
Why is the house so messy?

768
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:42,944
Damn it, what did you do to Wendy?

769
01:19:43,361 --> 01:19:44,446
Pablo!

770
01:19:47,782 --> 01:19:49,826
Pablo!

771
01:19:52,162 --> 01:19:54,122
Pablo!

772
01:20:28,782 --> 01:20:30,575
Suicide.

773
01:20:32,619 --> 01:20:35,705
I found him dead hanging in our bathroom.

774
01:20:37,332 --> 01:20:40,168
I think he couldn't live with himself,
after what he did to Wendy.

775
01:20:58,061 --> 01:21:00,855
I don't know if this will help...

776
01:21:01,398 --> 01:21:03,983
But, I'll just give it to you.

777
01:21:07,904 --> 01:21:12,330
These are the duplicate copy
of Wendy's calls and your husband's.

778
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:15,870
If that's really him.

779
01:21:18,039 --> 01:21:19,624
I'm sorry, Amanda.

780
01:21:42,188 --> 01:21:45,150
<i>Welcome to your fantasy phone hotline.</i>

781
01:21:45,859 --> 01:21:48,069
<i>What are we going to do, sir?</i>

782
01:21:48,778 --> 01:21:50,280
<i>Don't move.</i>

783
01:21:51,197 --> 01:21:54,075
<i>My knife is pointed at your throat.</i>

784
01:22:01,958 --> 01:22:05,795
<i>I'll slit your throat
if you don't let me fuck you.</i>

785
01:22:07,547 --> 01:22:08,089
<i>Sir.</i>

786
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:16,090
<i>I'll lick your ear while I slide
the knife down to your pussy.</i>

787
01:22:22,896 --> 01:22:25,273
<i>I'll taste your breasts.</i>

788
01:22:25,940 --> 01:22:28,193
<i>Your perfectly round breasts.</i>

789
01:22:33,948 --> 01:22:37,535
<i>I'll flick your hard nipples.</i>

790
01:22:41,706 --> 01:22:44,501
<i>I'll throw you in the trash.</i>

791
01:22:46,252 --> 01:22:48,505
<i>I'll spread your legs.</i>

792
01:23:03,478 --> 01:23:07,315
<i>I'll put my cock in your
pussy wet with piss...</i>

793
01:23:26,876 --> 01:23:27,919
<i>Sir!</i>

794
01:23:28,503 --> 01:23:30,505
<i>- Sir!
- Are you wet already?</i>

795
01:23:30,797 --> 01:23:32,799
<i>Sir, please don't!</i>

796
01:23:50,859 --> 01:23:52,192
<i>It hurts, sir!</i>

797
01:23:52,193 --> 01:23:57,156
For so long I've been holding on
to our relationship,

798
01:23:58,950 --> 01:24:00,826
<i>I can't take it anymore.</i>

799
01:24:00,827 --> 01:24:04,455
Thinking that one day
karma will get to him.

800
01:24:05,665 --> 01:24:08,166
<i>- Stop moving!
- Please stop, sir.</i>

801
01:24:08,167 --> 01:24:11,963
I've endured being with him for so long.

802
01:24:13,506 --> 01:24:15,383
<i>It really hurts!</i>

803
01:24:17,552 --> 01:24:20,430
But I didn't want what happened to him.

804
01:24:24,475 --> 01:24:29,397
I've never fantasized it happening to him.

805
01:24:38,489 --> 01:24:41,492
Everything happens for a reason, Amanda.

806
01:24:42,994 --> 01:24:44,245
<i>So good.</i>

807
01:24:44,495 --> 01:24:46,330
<i>Were you satisfied, Sir?</i>

808
01:24:46,331 --> 01:24:47,331
<i>Yes.</i>

809
01:24:47,582 --> 01:24:48,666
<i>Thank you.</i>

810
01:24:50,877 --> 01:24:51,877
<i>Sir?</i>

811
01:24:52,003 --> 01:24:53,087
<i>What is it?</i>

812
01:24:54,255 --> 01:24:55,506
<i>I'm okay with it now.</i>

813
01:24:55,757 --> 01:24:56,757
<i>Okay with what?</i>

814
01:24:56,841 --> 01:24:58,134
<i>5000 pesos.</i>

815
01:24:58,259 --> 01:25:00,344
<i>Let's make your fantasy happen.</i>

816
01:25:00,345 --> 01:25:02,638
<i>Just don't kill me, okay?</i>

817
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:04,724
<i>Aren't you scared?</i>

818
01:25:05,892 --> 01:25:09,562
<i>It's all just fantasy, right?</i>

819
01:25:10,063 --> 01:25:11,521
<i>I can feel that...</i>

820
01:25:11,522 --> 01:25:14,567
<i>You're not really like that in real life.</i>

821
01:25:15,068 --> 01:25:16,736
<i>Am I right, Sir?</i>

822
01:25:19,030 --> 01:25:20,323
<i>How much again?</i>

823
01:25:22,408 --> 01:25:23,701
Shh.

824
01:25:24,994 --> 01:25:25,995
That's not Pablo...

825
01:25:26,788 --> 01:25:27,789
Rina.

826
01:25:31,250 --> 01:25:33,544
Rina, that's not Pablo.

827
01:25:44,764 --> 01:25:48,059
I know I can't stop you anymore.

828
01:25:56,359 --> 01:25:58,611
I can't blame you either.

829
01:25:59,946 --> 01:26:03,825
But if you decide to come back,

830
01:26:05,368 --> 01:26:06,661
just moan.

831
01:26:09,372 --> 01:26:11,040
I'm just making you laugh.

832
01:26:14,919 --> 01:26:17,880
Thank you very much
for everything, Miss Margie.

833
01:26:19,424 --> 01:26:21,384
What are your plans now?

834
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:27,432
I will start again.

835
01:26:56,461 --> 01:26:58,504
You're catching your breath.

836
01:26:59,338 --> 01:27:00,338
Rina?

837
01:27:01,466 --> 01:27:02,466
Rina?

838
01:27:02,633 --> 01:27:04,218
I already resigned.

839
01:27:05,136 --> 01:27:08,848
The job you mentioned,
I can do that, right?

840
01:27:09,015 --> 01:27:10,182
Goddammit.

841
01:27:10,183 --> 01:27:13,436
I don't want to just be here
without contributing to you.

842
01:27:14,353 --> 01:27:15,353
Rina?

843
01:27:17,482 --> 01:27:19,233
Why are you listening to that?

844
01:27:19,358 --> 01:27:22,570
- Rina?
- You run fast, but I'll catch up to you.

845
01:27:23,821 --> 01:27:25,239
There you go.

846
01:27:29,035 --> 01:27:30,995
<i>You ran into the tall grass.</i>

847
01:27:31,996 --> 01:27:34,499
<i>You're breathing heavily
as if you're exhausted.</i>

848
01:27:35,583 --> 01:27:38,795
<i>You run fast, but I'll catch you.</i>

849
01:27:40,463 --> 01:27:42,548
<i>Here I am.</i>

850
01:27:44,425 --> 01:27:46,427
Here I am.

851
01:27:47,303 --> 01:27:49,430
I'm going to grab your breasts.

852
01:27:49,972 --> 01:27:53,351
I'm going to kiss your sweaty skin.

853
01:28:01,651 --> 01:28:03,110
Goddammit.

854
01:28:03,611 --> 01:28:05,238
You're so hot.

855
01:28:06,823 --> 01:28:08,199
There you go.

856
01:28:09,242 --> 01:28:11,786
- Goddammit.
- Damn.

857
01:28:12,036 --> 01:28:13,746
You're so hot.

858
01:28:14,121 --> 01:28:15,121
Who are you?

859
01:28:15,832 --> 01:28:16,832
There.

860
01:28:17,166 --> 01:28:18,376
<i>Just keep that up.</i>

861
01:28:19,168 --> 01:28:20,545
<i>You making a fool...</i>

862
01:28:21,212 --> 01:28:22,212
<i>of your wife.</i>

863
01:28:22,421 --> 01:28:23,047
Motherfucker.

864
01:28:23,339 --> 01:28:24,340
Who are you?

865
01:28:24,924 --> 01:28:26,675
I don't care.

866
01:28:26,676 --> 01:28:27,802
Keep going!

867
01:28:30,847 --> 01:28:31,847
Get out of here.

868
01:28:31,973 --> 01:28:33,391
If you don't want me to hurt you.

869
01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:37,186
People like you.

870
01:28:37,353 --> 01:28:39,981
You are the ones that
should be left behind.

871
01:28:40,481 --> 01:28:42,483
And I just don't understand.

872
01:28:43,192 --> 01:28:45,778
Why does she keep going back to you?

873
01:28:49,949 --> 01:28:50,949
You fucker.

874
01:28:54,787 --> 01:28:57,415
Yeah she goes home to you.

875
01:28:58,416 --> 01:29:00,376
But eventually she'll come back to me!

876
01:29:39,999 --> 01:29:42,168
What are we going to do, Sir?

877
01:29:46,286 --> 01:29:47,786
Don't move.

878
01:29:49,216 --> 01:29:51,594
The knife is pointed at your throat.

879
01:29:54,305 --> 01:29:55,640
Goddammit.

880
01:29:56,766 --> 01:29:58,309
You're so hot.

881
01:30:00,019 --> 01:30:03,856
<i>Maybe you want it in real life, sir?</i>

882
01:30:04,732 --> 01:30:07,318
Aren't you scared?

883
01:30:08,778 --> 01:30:12,073
It's only your fantasy we're doing, right?

884
01:30:12,782 --> 01:30:14,324
But I know...

885
01:30:14,325 --> 01:30:17,161
You're not really mean in real life.

886
01:30:18,037 --> 01:30:19,330
I am right, sir?

887
01:30:22,917 --> 01:30:24,835
How much again?

888
01:30:25,336 --> 01:30:26,504
5000 pesos.

889
01:30:26,837 --> 01:30:28,172
Is it alright?

890
01:30:29,298 --> 01:30:30,883
Okay.

891
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:34,762
Let's meet at the alley of San Andres.

892
01:30:35,346 --> 01:30:38,349
I'm going to rape you.

893
01:30:42,436 --> 01:30:45,356
Fuck, Rina, what is that?

894
01:30:46,273 --> 01:30:47,858
Amanda?

895
01:30:49,318 --> 01:30:50,443
Did you hear that?

896
01:30:50,444 --> 01:30:51,946
Did you hear all of that?

897
01:30:52,780 --> 01:30:54,490
What did you do to Wendy?

898
01:30:54,907 --> 01:30:56,617
What did you do to Pablo?

899
01:30:57,076 --> 01:30:57,785
Nothing.

900
01:30:57,910 --> 01:30:59,078
I just got you your revenge.

901
01:31:00,037 --> 01:31:01,205
I fought for you.

902
01:31:01,747 --> 01:31:02,456
I just fought for you.

903
01:31:02,581 --> 01:31:03,708
Didn't I tell you?

904
01:31:03,958 --> 01:31:05,793
I told you, right.

905
01:31:07,294 --> 01:31:08,462
Stay away from me!

906
01:31:10,506 --> 01:31:11,549
Stay away from me!

907
01:31:12,049 --> 01:31:13,217
You killed my friend!

908
01:31:13,634 --> 01:31:15,177
You killed my husband!

909
01:31:15,386 --> 01:31:17,346
He's not your friend, Amanda!

910
01:31:18,055 --> 01:31:19,849
She would've taken him away from you!

911
01:31:20,474 --> 01:31:22,268
And he's not your husband.

912
01:31:22,476 --> 01:31:23,352
He will hurt you.

913
01:31:23,353 --> 01:31:25,104
He is hurting you.

914
01:31:32,039 --> 01:31:32,706
Hello?

915
01:31:32,731 --> 01:31:33,982
Hello, police?

916
01:31:34,530 --> 01:31:36,031
Come here right now!

917
01:31:36,032 --> 01:31:37,699
Help me.

918
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:39,285
Help!

919
01:31:39,618 --> 01:31:40,870
Amanda,

920
01:31:43,456 --> 01:31:45,374
Please do not lie to me.

921
01:31:45,541 --> 01:31:46,834
Please.

922
01:31:49,837 --> 01:31:52,339
Even if it's connected...

923
01:31:53,924 --> 01:31:56,177
You won't report me, right?

924
01:32:06,562 --> 01:32:10,733
When did you ever gather
the courage to fight for yourself?

925
01:32:16,530 --> 01:32:18,574
He was hurting you...

926
01:32:20,159 --> 01:32:22,369
yet you keep going back.

927
01:32:24,246 --> 01:32:26,499
You don't like me?

928
01:32:27,333 --> 01:32:30,377
I can fight for you until the end.

929
01:32:31,712 --> 01:32:35,507
That's enough, please.

930
01:32:35,508 --> 01:32:36,926
Shhh...

931
01:33:48,497 --> 01:33:49,623
Son of a bitch!

932
01:34:50,768 --> 01:34:52,561
<i>Were you satisfied, sir?</i>

933
01:34:53,229 --> 01:34:54,229
<i>Yes.</i>

934
01:34:54,647 --> 01:34:55,647
<i>Thank you.</i>

935
01:34:55,940 --> 01:34:58,776
<i>Maybe you want it in real life, sir?</i>

936
01:34:59,276 --> 01:35:00,276
<i>What?</i>

937
01:35:00,569 --> 01:35:01,862
<i>5000 pesos, sir.</i>

938
01:35:02,196 --> 01:35:04,073
<i>Do what you want with me.</i>

939
01:35:04,365 --> 01:35:07,201
<i>I feel like you won't kill me.</i>

940
01:35:07,576 --> 01:35:09,161
<i>I won't do it either.</i>

941
01:35:09,370 --> 01:35:10,537
<i>I have a wife.</i>

942
01:35:11,121 --> 01:35:12,289
<i>This is just a fantasy.</i>

943
01:35:13,082 --> 01:35:14,291
<i>It ends here.</i>

944
01:35:14,708 --> 01:35:16,293
<i>Are you sure, sir?</i>

945
01:35:16,502 --> 01:35:18,379
<i>I still love my wife.</i>

946
01:35:19,213 --> 01:35:20,464
Ma'am, this is the terminal.

947
01:35:20,673 --> 01:35:22,132
Where are you going?

948
01:35:29,181 --> 01:35:31,558
I don't know anymore.

949
01:35:53,205 --> 01:35:58,150
