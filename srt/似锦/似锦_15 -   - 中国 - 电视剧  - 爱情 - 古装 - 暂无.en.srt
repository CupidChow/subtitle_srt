00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,180
(Earl Dongping's Mansion, Jiang)
I'm so glad

12
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,670
that my grandson

13
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,310
has returned alive.

14
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,670
Only then

15
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,510
can our entire family

16
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,560
sit together.

17
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,920
Our ancestors are protecting us.

18
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,080
Grandmother, sorry

19
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,820
for being unfilial
and having you worried.

20
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,670
It's not just your grandmother.

21
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,150
The whole mansion is

22
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,840
anxious for you.

23
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,680
Si even offended the Grand Princess

24
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,390
because of you.

25
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,830
She's offended the Grand Princess.

26
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,480
Who knows
what the consequences will be?

27
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,710
But when you think about it,

28
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,760
it was fortunate

29
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,440
that Si refused to admit guilt.

30
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,390
Yes, yes.

31
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,320
That's lesser harm done.

32
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,680
Zhan coming back

33
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,870
is the greatest fortune

34
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,230
for our family.

35
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,990
If Zhan is safe,

36
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,710
a bit of risk won't matter.

37
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,110
The reason my grandson is alive today

38
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,990
is thanks to Commandant Yu and Miss Lu.

39
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,990
On behalf of the entire family,

40
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,990
thank you, Commandant Yu, Miss Lu.

41
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,160
Commandant Yu, Miss Lu,

42
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,160
we've faced danger together.

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,080
If you need anything,

44
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,360
I will not

45
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,510
hesitate to risk my life for you.

46
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,600
I heard that Miss Lu took care of my son

47
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:19,320
day and night in the wilderness.

48
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:22,760
If it harms her reputation,

49
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,800
you must take responsibility. Got it?

50
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,640
Sit down.

51
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,600
Father, how can we repay kindness
with enmity?

52
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,920
Please let Miss Chuchu go.

53
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:35,710
Zhan,

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,670
don't cause trouble again.

55
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,200
Look.

56
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,640
Your father is getting older.

57
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,880
His hair has turned
much grayer these days.

58
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,110
Alright, Anmou.

59
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,520
He's just returned.

60
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,710
Stop lecturing him.

61
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,080
Zhan,

62
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,190
from now on,

63
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,320
you can do whatever you want,

64
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,160
as long as you're happy.

65
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:06,750
Grandmother,

66
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,200
Father,

67
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,200
I've been wrong all along,

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,440
making you worry about me.

69
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,150
After this, I finally understood

70
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,010
why Si wanted me
to practice martial arts

71
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,270
and improve my skills.

72
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,120
If I could be

73
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,350
as skilled as Yu,

74
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,710
or have an official position
like Mr. Zhen,

75
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,880
they'd no longer dare to bully me.

76
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,950
They bully me because I'm weak.

77
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:37,760
From now on, I will become stronger.

78
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,310
They bully me because our family

79
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,440
is powerless and declining,

80
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,210
so I will try my best

81
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,490
to bring honor to our family.

82
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,030
In short,

83
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,080
I will no longer slack off.

84
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,390
Please rest assured,
Grandmother and elders.

85
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,320
Good.

86
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,950
It's rare that my grandson
has this awakening.

87
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:02,120
Our family has hope now.

88
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,390
Jiang, if you don't mind,

89
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,920
I'll practice martial arts with you.

90
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,830
That's great.

91
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:07,760
Count me in.

92
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,840
Alright.

93
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,000
He's just back.

94
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,920
There's no rush for things

95
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,240
like striving for better.

96
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,320
Ancheng,

97
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,760
I cannot agree

98
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,800
with what you just said.

99
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,680
Studies

100
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,440
are about persistence day by day.

101
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,800
It accumulates over time.

102
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,320
If Zhan wants to improve,

103
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,680
I'll give you the books
your brother studied

104
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:38,430
when he was preparing for the exams.

105
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,270
Uncle Anmou,

106
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,920
I don't plan to take the imperial exams.

107
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,070
I want to be an Imperial Insignia Guard.

108
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,140
(Morning Drizzle, Haitang Chamber)

109
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,590
This is a small gift

110
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,120
for you.

111
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,760
It's cold and clear, not too sweet.

112
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,840
I like it.

113
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,120
Based on your character,

114
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,440
I specially made it for you.

115
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,880
Thank you.

116
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,840
Chuchu,

117
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,760
thank you for saving my brother.

118
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,030
No need for this.

119
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,110
It seems you still don't know.

120
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,680
These were all arranged by Qi.

121
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,270
Didn't he tell you?

122
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:26,510
No.

123
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,560
Since your brother went missing,

124
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,320
Qi hadn't slept for several nights.

125
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,160
He led his men to search
through the night

126
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,590
and reviewed the river defense map.

127
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:35,630
When he finally deduced

128
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,470
Jiang Zhan's location,
he sent me to find him,

129
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:38,830
so I did.

130
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,270
In that case,

131
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,080
you all knew

132
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,880
my brother was still alive?

133
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,000
Sorry, Jiang Si.

134
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,080
Qi told me repeatedly

135
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,760
that I must not bring him back.

136
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,160
If the Grand Princess had found out,

137
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,030
he'd be dead for sure.

138
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,880
To ensure nothing went wrong,

139
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,910
we didn't even tell you.

140
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,320
I understand now.

141
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,440
Thank you.

142
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,160
(Guangju Restaurant)
After this calamity,

143
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,480
Jiang Zhan changed completely.

144
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,000
He has been waking up early
and working late.

145
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,870
A fallen playboy like him

146
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,830
did endure hard work,

147
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,270
passed the selection,

148
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,800
and became an Imperial Insignia Guard.

149
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:26,950
You hit it!

150
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,390
Young Master, you hit it!

151
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,120
You're truly amazing.

152
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,830
The Cui, Yang, and Zhang families

153
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,200
lost their beloved kids.

154
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,720
Duke An's heir accused
Princess Mingyue in court,

155
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,390
but she feigned illness to avoid him.

156
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,320
How..

157
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,920
- Great.
- Thanks.

158
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:28,280
Will this case end?

159
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,830
Don't keep us in suspense.

160
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,550
Yes. Just tell us.

161
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:36,440
Please be patient and listen to me.

162
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,440
This case shocked Chang'an.

163
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,120
The commoners were talking about it,

164
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,240
and it even reached the Palace.

165
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,840
Upon hearing this,
His Majesty issued an imperial edict

166
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,680
to punish evil

167
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,080
and promote good.

168
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,830
Cui Mingyue, Grand Princess's daughter,

169
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,400
has no morals or manners.

170
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,390
Given that she's still young

171
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,870
and that she was influenced,

172
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,500
she shall be punished as a warning.

173
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,450
She'll be demoted to a County Princess

174
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,680
and relocated to Lingshui
to reflect on her wrongs.

175
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:08,110
Ji Chongyi, son of Duke An,

176
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:11,230
is immoral and unruly.

177
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,950
He seduced Princess Mingyue,

178
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,960
indulged in his desires,
and caused a tragedy.

179
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,320
He shall be forbidden
from being an official.

180
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,630
Duke An didn't teach his son well.

181
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,480
His salary shall be deducted
for three years.

182
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,920
(Graceful and Poised)
Hopefully, he shall follow the rules,

183
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,390
speak cautiously, and act prudently.

184
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,560
The authorities shall carry it out.

185
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:32,190
(Learned and Sophisticated)
The authorities shall carry it out.

186
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,990
Accept the edict.

187
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,440
His Majesty has ordered:

188
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,440
Jiang Zhan from Earl Dongping's Mansion

189
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,800
is a quick-witted and studious fighter.

190
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,240
(Jiang Zhan)
He shall be an Imperial Insignia Guard.

191
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,560
Earl Dongping taught his son well.

192
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:13,080
His title can be inherited
for five generations.

193
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,160
The authorities shall carry it out.

194
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,660
(Virtues Run Far)

195
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,230
Earl Dongping, Mr. Zhan,

196
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,110
accept the edict and thank His Majesty.

197
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,520
Thank His Majesty for the great favor.

198
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,960
Rise.

199
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,680
Sure.

200
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,080
Thank you.

201
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,990
I've worked so hard for all this time,

202
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,440
but with just an imperial edict,

203
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,480
I wouldn't even have

204
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,520
to attend the selection.

205
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,160
This is a good thing.

206
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,710
Zhan, you're so lucky.

207
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,680
Zhan,

208
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:00,560
this is such a great thing.

209
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,080
You've benefited from misfortune.

210
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,200
The Emperor has truly favored

211
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,870
our family.

212
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:08,710
Favored our family?

213
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,200
His Majesty is favoring
the Grand Princess.

214
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,630
He's promoting my brother

215
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,000
to stop us from pursuing it further

216
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,870
so Cui Mingyue wouldn't get hurt.

217
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,320
Don't say that.

218
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,230
If someone hears you,

219
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,710
the consequences would be unimaginable.

220
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,440
This child...

221
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,800
Zhan,

222
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:30,440
I thought that our title

223
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,910
would end

224
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,080
with your father's generation.

225
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,560
But you earned two more generations.

226
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,590
You've made a great contribution

227
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,590
to our family.

228
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,590
Grandmother,

229
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,230
do you think

230
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,830
the beating I took was worth it?

231
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:23,800
Why are you here alone?

232
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:26,630
I...

233
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,440
Your family is looking for you.

234
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,280
They're worried.

235
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,590
I just thought...

236
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,710
How did you know I was here?

237
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,870
I took a chance.

238
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,520
We first met here, didn't we?

239
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,230
The weather was nice,

240
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,270
so I thought you might come here

241
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,280
to enjoy the scenery.

242
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,800
I just wanted to be alone for a while.

243
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,280
Then pretend I'm not here.

244
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,400
No, I mean I want to be alone...

245
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,200
Annoying.

246
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,040
I just didn't expect

247
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,950
that His Majesty would use our title

248
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,200
to silence us.

249
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,470
What's even more ridiculous

250
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,080
is that the most useful thing

251
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,350
I've done for my family

252
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,710
was to get beaten up.

253
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,520
Do you think I'm useless?

254
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:53,630
You know.

255
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,680
Since I was a child,

256
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:57,990
I loved reading storybooks.

257
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,160
I wanted to be a wandering heroine.

258
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,590
But I never stepped out of the house

259
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,230
but only dreamed

260
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,520
of the vast rivers and mountains.

261
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,280
But look.

262
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,440
I'm sitting here today.

263
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,320
So,

264
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,400
no matter how far away a place is,

265
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,280
if we keep it in our hearts,

266
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,830
we will always reach it.

267
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,800
We will always reach it...

268
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,400
We will always reach it.

269
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,400
I've said it. I won't go to Lingshui.

270
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,750
Mother,

271
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,230
I don't want to go to Lingshui.

272
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,800
Regardless, you have to go.

273
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,730
Are you going to defy the edict?

274
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,320
Mother, please ask Uncle to show mercy.

275
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,160
He will listen to whatever you say.

276
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,710
Why don't you understand?

277
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,710
I'm sending you to avoid the storm.

278
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,990
Right now, in the court,

279
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,840
the officials are accusing you,

280
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,800
and commoners are gossiping about you.

281
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,280
Rumors can ruin you.

282
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,180
I went through a lot of trouble

283
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,720
to get this imperial edict

284
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,920
for you.

285
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,350
Your Grace,

286
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,080
Her Highness is doing this for you.

287
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,440
Please go to Lingshui
and avoid the trouble.

288
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,030
Once it passes,

289
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,870
Her Highness will ask His Majesty

290
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,280
to bring you back.

291
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,440
You're her only daughter.

292
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,550
How could she bear

293
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,230
to be separated from you?

294
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:45,870
Well...

295
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,680
How long do I have to stay there?

296
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,800
Stay there until you truly repent

297
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,230
and stop causing trouble.

298
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:56,750
Mother,

299
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,160
I already know my mistake.

300
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,440
Please rest assured.

301
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,160
I will go to Lingshui.

302
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:03,120
I'll go to the ancestral hall every day

303
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,670
to recite scriptures for my cousin.

304
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,190
I'll never cause trouble again.

305
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,480
It's getting cold.

306
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:18,030
Bring some thick clothes for her.

307
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:20,670
She has a weak stomach
and is a picky eater.

308
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:23,390
Send two of our chefs to go with her.

309
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,080
Your Highness, rest assured.

310
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,800
I'll prepare everything for her.

311
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,280
Reflect on yourself properly.

312
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,870
Don't disappoint me again.

313
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,000
Understood, Mother.

314
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,320
Lyu.

315
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,960
What have I done wrong?

316
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,720
It's a pity I wasn't cruel enough.

317
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,110
I should've stuck

318
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:02,190
a dozen or twenty holes into Jiang Zhan

319
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,040
so he'd die thoroughly.

320
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,240
Wait.

321
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:35,910
You just saved me.

322
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,350
Tell me.

323
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,150
What do you want?

324
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,110
Go.

325
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,520
Send a message to Zaoshu Lane,

326
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:49,590
and tell Yu Qi to come

327
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,040
to Wuli Pavilion tomorrow

328
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,430
to see me off.

329
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,830
Tell him

330
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,040
that if he doesn't come,

331
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,670
I'll invite the Jiang family here.

332
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,150
Yes.

333
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,800
Everyone, have some tea.

334
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,920
This time, my brother
narrowly escaped death,

335
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,910
and you were worried about him.

336
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,910
As everything is getting better,

337
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,680
why don't we go on a trip together

338
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,960
and enjoy ourselves for two days?

339
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,800
- Sure!
- Sure!

340
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,390
Where shall we go?

341
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,040
- Let's go...
- Lingshui.

342
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:29,730
Si and I were planning
to pay respects to our ancestors.

343
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,320
After this disaster,

344
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,000
we can also tell Yi we're safe.

345
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,800
You're quite clever,

346
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,280
tricking us

347
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,560
to send you on your business.

348
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,430
It's lively with so many people.

349
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,480
Besides,

350
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,870
the scenery along the way is beautiful.

351
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,430
I guarantee you'll like it.

352
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:49,020
In a few days, I'll have to go
to the Imperial Insignia Guard.

353
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,350
We shouldn't delay.

354
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:52,070
I'll go back and tell Father.

355
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,110
We'll set out tomorrow.

356
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,310
Zhan, before we leave,

357
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,760
let's visit Mr. Zhen.

358
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,110
This is your second withdrawal.

359
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,350
Yes.

360
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,720
The mastermind, Cui Mingyue,

361
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,830
has been recognized as an accomplice.

362
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,000
She's just been demoted one rank.

363
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,590
What kind of punishment is that?

364
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,560
Mr. Zhan, you've suffered a lot.

365
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:19,960
Will you be content to let it go?

366
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,960
Or have you chosen to make peace

367
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,590
because of the rewards you received?

368
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:28,390
Mr. Zhen, are you despising me?

369
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,150
His Majesty's edict

370
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:33,240
is both to appease and to test.

371
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,710
If you refuse the rewards

372
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:37,030
and insist on pursuing the case,

373
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,040
Cui Mingyue

374
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:40,110
will receive the punishment
she deserves.

375
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,150
That's easy for you to say.

376
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,000
If it were you,

377
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,040
what would you do?

378
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,800
If it were me,

379
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:01,190
I would pursue it to the end,

380
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,910
no matter the cost.

381
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,110
Miss Si,

382
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,590
Young Master Zhan,

383
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,060
I'm not one to sit idly

384
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,960
and discuss it without action.

385
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,960
If you two are willing,

386
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,310
I would risk my position

387
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,430
and fight for you

388
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,760
to the end.

389
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,040
If His Majesty

390
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,830
still insists on protecting her,

391
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,760
I will speak out

392
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:34,720
at the risk of my life.

393
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,590
Thank you, Mr. Zhen,

394
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,080
but

395
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,720
there is no need.

396
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,830
Miss Si, don't you trust me?

397
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:47,910
I trust you,

398
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,550
but my family

399
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,390
cannot afford this.

400
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,350
We all know

401
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,080
you're a good official,

402
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:56,110
so you should contribute
to the well-being

403
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,140
of the people of Ling'an.

404
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,880
You shouldn't take such a risk

405
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,880
for the case

406
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,350
of our family.

407
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,520
Besides,

408
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,720
you are honorable and fearless,

409
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,630
while we

410
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
are just common people.

411
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,270
Our family

412
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,440
isn't exactly satisfied

413
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,760
with this outcome,

414
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,080
but we know we should stop for now.

415
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:21,000
Please don't trouble yourself, Mr. Zhen.

416
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:22,630
Goodbye.

417
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:31,420
(Court, Capital Security)

418
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,280
Miss Si, wait.

419
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:36,800
Is there something else, Mr. Zhen?

420
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,080
I...

421
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,670
It's nothing,

422
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,390
I just wanted to talk with you

423
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,830
for a moment.

424
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,790
Zhan, please go ahead

425
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:53,960
and wait for me.

426
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,240
Sure.

427
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,350
Miss Si,

428
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:20,350
I still have feelings for...

429
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,190
Mr. Zhen.

430
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,190
Zhen, you really shouldn't

431
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:29,040
waste more effort on me.

432
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,720
Did I say something

433
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,960
to upset you just now?

434
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,000
No.

435
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,520
You're upright.

436
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,320
I truly admire

437
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:37,630
what you said earlier.

438
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,240
I knew

439
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,760
you'd understand me.

440
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:43,040
The Grand Princess is powerful.

441
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,670
If it were anyone else,

442
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:46,670
I wouldn't press it.

443
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,680
But you are someone

444
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,910
who doesn't fear rumors

445
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:51,800
or the power of wealth.

446
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,270
You can even stand up in court...

447
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:54,110
Zhen,

448
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,510
my brother has just experienced

449
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,390
a great disaster

450
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,520
and is only alive

451
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,040
by the grace of Heaven.

452
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,480
For the rest of our lives,

453
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:05,320
I just wish for our family

454
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,000
to stay safe and sound.

455
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,800
Also, the Jiang Si you mentioned...

456
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:14,240
The one who was once

457
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,280
brave enough to stand up in court

458
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,390
is not the complete Jiang Si.

459
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,320
Most of the time,

460
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:24,000
I'm afraid, I avoid things,

461
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,180
and I also weigh the pros and cons.

462
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,590
You don't need to belittle yourself.

463
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,590
Great courage often appears
as hesitation.

464
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,630
How many women in this world

465
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,720
can possess the kind
of courage you have?

466
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,960
I'm not belittling myself.

467
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,430
Zhen,

468
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,910
I'm not as good as you think.

469
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:44,560
Heaven has its dark clouds;

470
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,320
people have their darker sides.

471
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,560
In court,

472
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,190
I have told lies.

473
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,430
Outside of court,

474
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,910
I've used schemes

475
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,520
to achieve my goals.

476
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,520
But in your world,

477
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,210
things are either black or white,

478
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,830
so you and I

479
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,900
are not suitable for each other.

480
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,960
I don't see it that way.

481
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,520
Dripping water wears away the stone.

482
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,080
With sincere effort...

483
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,730
But I'm not the stone
for your water to wear.

484
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,870
Miss Si, are you refusing me

485
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,280
because you've fallen

486
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,840
for someone else?

487
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,350
I refuse you

488
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:38,830
simply because you and I

489
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:39,800
are not a match.

490
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,030
It has nothing to do with anyone else.

491
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,000
I see.

492
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,560
Goodbye.

493
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:56,670
Miss Si.

494
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,040
Has Yu Qi

495
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,480
seen your dark side?

496
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,670
Does he know everything about you?

497
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,430
Yes.

498
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:43,940
(Capital Security Office)

499
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:21,780
(Capital Security Office)

500
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,760
How is it? Does it look good?

501
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,000
It's beautiful.

502
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,960
Yu Qi, you're here.

503
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:55,630
What's wrong?

504
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:57,980
Look at the flowers I arranged for you.

505
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:58,820
Do they look good?

506
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,300
That night, you saved me.

507
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,870
I have to thank you.

508
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,000
If I had known what you did,

509
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,390
I'd never have saved you.

510
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,560
Yu Qi,

511
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,050
don't force me

512
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:15,020
to resort to the worst.

513
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,080
Goodbye.

514
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:20,530
Yu Qi, I know who you are.

515
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:26,440
What are you trying to say?

516
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:31,920
You've secretly returned to Ling'an
without being summoned.

517
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,280
Does His Majesty know?

518
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,800
Are you threatening me?

519
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:41,830
You're a clever man.

520
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,190
You should understand what I mean.

521
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,720
I don't.

522
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:50,080
Yu Qi, I like you.

523
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:53,430
I don't care if you're an exiled Prince

524
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,000
or some Commandant.

525
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,080
If you go to Lingshui with me,

526
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,000
I'll ensure you a wealthy future

527
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
with a high position.

528
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,880
A County Princess is promising a Prince

529
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,270
a wealthy future

530
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,830
with a high position?

531
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:09,240
Seems like the Grand Princess

532
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,590
is really powerful in Ling'an.

533
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,670
Why mention my mother?

534
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:16,030
Do you truly think

535
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,160
that power is enough

536
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,110
to make everything go your way?

537
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,550
Why did Cao Xingyu,
Marquis Changxing's heir,

538
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:24,800
end up in prison?

539
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,520
Why did Ji Chongyi, Duke An's heir,

540
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,030
get banned from being an official?

541
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:32,910
And you, the once Commandery Princess,

542
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,520
have been demoted to a County Princess

543
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,870
and had to leave Ling'an in disgrace.

544
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,830
I don't think you should worry

545
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,110
about my future.

546
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,870
Your Grace, listen to my advice.

547
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,480
Don't make any more mistakes

548
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,870
and ruin your future.

549
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,320
Is it because of Jiang Si?

550
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:57,720
Let me tell you.

551
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,830
If anyone dares to covet

552
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,080
what I like,

553
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,630
I will gouge their eyes out

554
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,280
and cut off their hands.

555
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:24,960
You're welcome to have a try.

556
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,790
If you dare

557
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,080
harm Jiang Si,

558
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,270
let's see if the Commandant

559
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:32,760
you spoke of

560
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,270
will take your life,

561
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:36,000
County Princess.

562
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:46,870
No man has ever dared to reject me.

563
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:51,870
Yu Qi.

564
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,080
(One day,)

565
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:57,350
(I will make you willingly come)

566
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,430
(to propose to me.)

567
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:07,630
Aman.

568
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:08,830
Miss Chuchu.

569
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,110
I was just about to visit you.

570
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:10,940
Why are you here?

571
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,110
Young Master Zhan hasn't had

572
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:13,270
much of an appetite lately,

573
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,810
so Miss Si asked me to buy some pastries

574
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:15,930
for him to eat on the road.

575
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,920
The incident with the County Princess

576
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,350
must be still affecting him.

577
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,750
Miss Chuchu, you might not know.

578
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,110
I saw the County Princess

579
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,730
getting on a carriage
to head to Lingshui

580
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:26,390
with a lot of money and valuables.

581
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,910
It doesn't seem like she's exiled

582
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:30,410
but more like she's going on holidays.

583
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,000
Aman, you go back first

584
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,200
and tell Jiang Zhan

585
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,040
I'll be there later.

586
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:39,670
Chu...

587
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:44,430
Should I not have told her?

588
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:49,980
(Jiang)

589
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:53,270
Chuchu is supposed to be here by now.

590
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,340
Why isn't she here yet?

591
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,040
Young Master Zhan.

592
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:58,640
Young Master Zhan.

593
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,400
Aman, did you see Miss Chuchu

594
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,760
on your way back?

595
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,560
She said she had something to do

596
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,520
and would come later.

597
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,080
Something to do?

598
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:10,630
Young Master Zhan,

599
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,590
I'm busy. I'll leave now.

600
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:13,630
Wait.

601
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,360
Aman,

602
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:15,860
didn't she tell you where she's going?

603
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:20,420
(Lingshui County)

604
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:40,180
(Lingshui County)

605
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:53,340
(Lingshui County)

606
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:02,820
(Lingshui County)

607
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,560
This way.

608
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,540
(Lingshui County)

609
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,430
What's wrong?

610
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,560
Why stop? Let's go.

611
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:40,140
(Lingshui County)

612
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:58,220
(Lingshui County)

613
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,580
(Lingshui County)

614
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,710
Why haven't we reached the hostel?

615
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,360
Your Grace, please forgive me.

616
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,310
I also find it strange.

617
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:28,230
We should've reached the hostel by now.

618
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,840
Perhaps we took a longer detour.

619
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,800
Useless thing.

620
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,640
It's so hot.

621
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,880
Your Grace, it seems we've

622
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,040
passed this place already.

623
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,280
Could it be that we're trapped here?

624
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,750
What nonsense are you talking about?

625
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,230
Looks like someone will be

626
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:43,480
sleeping in the woods tonight.

627
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,120
Who is it?

628
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,640
Let's go.

629
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,440
- Don't run.
- Stop.

630
00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:00,270
- Don't run.
- Stop.

631
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,710
- Stop.
- Don't run.

632
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:04,560
Stop!

633
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,720
Stop right there.

634
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:14,900
Chuchu.

635
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,190
(Jiang)
Where did you go?

636
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:17,520
I just wandered a little.

637
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,630
Aman, have you finished packing?

638
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,880
You wandered...

639
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,480
Did you get hurt?

640
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,760
No, it was just a scratch

641
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,030
from the carriage on the road.

642
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:27,870
Miss Chuchu.

643
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,440
I've packed everything.

644
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,080
Where's Miss Si?

645
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,690
At Haitang Chamber. Let's go find her.

646
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:33,430
Alright, let's go.

647
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:34,590
Come on, Young Master Zhan.

648
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:35,430
Let's go.

649
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:40,840
So mysterious?

650
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:43,770
I'll get you some medicine.

651
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,880
Chief, we found something
on Directorate of Astronomy.

652
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,000
It was Astronomer Chu and Registrar Xiao

653
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,630
who started to slander you as ill-fated.

654
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,110
Where are they now?

655
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,150
They're both in Lingshui.

656
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,400
Lingshui.

657
00:35:58,450 --> 00:35:59,720
Let's return to the city first.

658
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,960
We'll go to Lingshui tomorrow.

659
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,800
No need to return.

660
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:03,110
I've packed everything

661
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:04,030
we need for the road.

662
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,080
We can set off now.

663
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:10,080
A fortune-teller back then

664
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,660
once said I was an unlucky child.

665
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,080
So, my father

666
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,440
sent me far away.

667
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,230
If the weak

668
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,710
are unjustly blamed for everything

669
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:19,150
by the world,

670
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:20,760
and they neither inquire

671
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,790
nor resist,

672
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,190
doesn't that make them

673
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,400
accomplices

674
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:26,000
to these villains' lies?

675
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,230
If I've been falsely accused,

676
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:30,150
I'll make sure the accusers

677
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:31,360
pay the price.

678
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,070
Chief.

679
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:38,390
Chief?

680
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,280
Chief, were you just

681
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,590
worried about Miss Si?

682
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:49,670
I'm not sure

683
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:50,880
if I should say this,

684
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,110
but I really fear Miss Si

685
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,560
has already been using you.

686
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,040
Chief, I haven't finished.

687
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,710
I haven't started my analysis.

688
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,510
I think Miss Si can prophesy

689
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,400
like the Saintess.

690
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,240
Chief.

691
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:12,960
Yu.

692
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,880
- Qi.
- Where are you going?

693
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:19,030
I'm an Imperial Insignia Guard now,

694
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:21,070
so we're returning to Lingshui
before I start

695
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:22,520
to pay respects to our ancestors

696
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,040
and enjoy the scenery.

697
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,550
I've never been to Lingshui,

698
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:26,760
so I thought I'd join the fun.

699
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,110
Your plan sounds good.

700
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,280
Commandant Yu,

701
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:31,000
why don't you come with us?

702
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,190
Yeah, the more the merrier.

703
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,030
Sure.

704
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:35,520
My chief has official duties.

705
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:36,550
Official duties?

706
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,150
I thought you were here

707
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,630
to send us off.

708
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:41,190
That's not totally true.

709
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,280
We were just...

710
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,790
We were just wandering around nearby

711
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,590
without a destination in mind.

712
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:48,630
Why don't we join you

713
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,320
for some sightseeing?

714
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,270
That sounds great.

715
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:52,550
Yu,

716
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:54,040
they're riding too slowly.

717
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:55,560
I was just thinking of finding someone

718
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,350
to race horses with.

719
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:57,980
You want to race horses with Qi?

720
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:58,920
Catch up with me first.

721
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,480
Without a starting signal?

722
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,510
You two go ahead.

723
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:02,550
I need to catch my breath.

724
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:03,590
Alright, keep up.

725
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,120
What's wrong?

726
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,800
Are you missing home?

727
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,200
It's nothing.

728
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,360
I'm glad you're here.

729
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:13,870
Miss Jiang,

730
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:15,480
the scenery is beautiful.

731
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,550
Why not take a walk?

732
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:17,520
Thank you, Commandant Yu.

733
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,840
It's fine.

734
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,480
I'll just sit here and enjoy the view.

735
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:22,840
This isn't a court.

736
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,850
Don't call me Commandant.
It's too formal.

737
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,440
Shall I call you

738
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,800
Mr. Yu?

739
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:30,950
Sure.

740
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,760
Mr. Yu,

741
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:36,040
thank you

742
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:37,670
for helping my brother.

743
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:39,720
Neighbors are better
than distant relatives.

744
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,030
If there's anything

745
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:42,400
you need help with in the future,

746
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:43,250
just let me know.

747
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,790
Is it really just a neighborly thing?

748
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:46,650
There are at least seven
or eight households

749
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:48,100
living in our neighborhood,

750
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,400
but I've never seen Mr. Yu

751
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,150
put so much effort into other people.

752
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,590
Miss, it's because of you.

753
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:53,980
You're being talkative.

754
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,800
Mr. Yu,

755
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,190
I had a nightmare and dreamed

756
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,410
my brother would be in danger,

757
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:04,190
but when I told others,

758
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,960
they all thought I was overreacting.

759
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:08,150
Only you

760
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:09,150
believed me.

761
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:11,960
You didn't need to lie to me after all.

762
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:14,360
But it is quite amazing

763
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,560
when dreams come true.

764
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:19,230
Have you ever dreamed of anything else?

765
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,880
Maybe you can foresee the future.

766
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:27,000
Mr. Yu, you're just joking.

767
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:28,300
How could an ordinary person

768
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,270
have such an ability?

769
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,440
Yu, Si,

770
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:41,150
there's a beautiful stream ahead.

771
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:42,660
Shall we go and rest there for a while?

772
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,720
I caught it!

773
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,520
Long Dan, you're amazing!

774
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:47,400
Chief, I caught it!

775
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,630
Hurry and put it here.

776
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:50,230
- So impressive!
- What a big fish!

777
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:51,190
Hurry! It's so slippery!

778
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,670
Isn't it too small?

779
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:56,520
Watch me catch a bigger one.

780
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,720
Come on.

781
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,140
Young Master Zhan, can you do it?

782
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:15,110
Zhan, you go start the fire.

783
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:17,270
I'll go start the fire instead.

784
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,000
There's no firewood.

785
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:38,040
I'll help you.

786
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,460
I'll go find some dry firewood
over there.

787
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,880
Alright.

788
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,480
Don't cut yourself.

789
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:59,550
Jiang Zhan, look! I caught one!

790
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:00,440
So impressive!

791
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,200
What's wrong?

792
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:09,840
What happened to you?

793
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:17,230
Wait for me.

794
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:21,360
What's wrong? Did you sprain your ankle?

795
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:25,800
I'll carry you.

796
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:27,800
Can you get on?

797
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,040
One, two, go.

798
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:33,910
Let's go.

799
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:40,880
Put me down.

800
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,310
It's going to rain.

801
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:45,990
I'll carry you to the woods ahead.

802
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,320
Let's go.

803
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:52,470
Slow down.

804
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:56,430
Slowly.

805
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:05,060
