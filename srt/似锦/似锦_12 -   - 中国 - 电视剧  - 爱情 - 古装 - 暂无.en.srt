(Matchmaker Wang's Hall)

12
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:41,530
Zhen,

13
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:42,860
there's something

14
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:43,700
I...

15
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,860
I'd like to clarify.

16
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,340
Go ahead.

17
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,300
That day...

18
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,380
Mr. Zhen.

19
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,540
Mr. Zhen.

20
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,500
Mr. Yu.

21
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:57,860
Commandant Yu.

22
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:58,780
Miss Si.

23
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,860
What are you two doing?

24
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,100
Having tea.

25
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:11,860
Yes.

26
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,180
I can see that.

27
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,420
What a nice surprise.

28
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,620
Miss Si,

29
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,620
this year's new tea

30
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:21,900
looks really nice.

31
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:22,980
I've packed some

32
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,620
for you to bring back.

33
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,780
Thanks, Mrs. Zhen.

34
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,180
Mother, this is

35
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,980
Commandant Yu of Capital Security.

36
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,500
Greetings, Mrs. Zhen.

37
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,380
You really are

38
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,660
a charming young man.

39
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,380
That's very nice of you to say.

40
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,940
You've had tea.

41
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,900
It's boring to sit here and do nothing.

42
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,780
The weather looks nice.

43
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,860
Miss Si, Heng,

44
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,180
let's go on an outing to the suburbs.

45
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,260
I'm sorry

46
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,100
to disappoint you.

47
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,700
Mr. Zhen is needed

48
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,660
at the Capital Security Office.

49
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,460
I see.

50
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,300
No wonder Commandant Yu

51
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,500
came in a rush.

52
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:08,940
Mother,

53
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,340
I need to go to work.

54
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,180
Sorry, I can't keep you company.

55
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,100
My apologies, Miss Si.

56
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,220
Please excuse me.

57
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,660
Good day.

58
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,380
Come on, Mr. Zhen.

59
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,120
Let's go, Commandant Yu.

60
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,460
Good day, Mrs. Zhen.

61
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,620
That silly boy!

62
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,700
My son only

63
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,900
cares about his work.

64
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,020
You look gorgeous, Pei.

65
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,220
You're getting married, my dear.

66
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,180
Don't you look forward

67
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,650
to seeing me marry Administrator Lin?

68
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:27,500
You should be happy.

69
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,900
I am happy. I really am.

70
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,940
She'll miss you when you're away.

71
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,220
I made this handkerchief

72
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,580
for your wedding.

73
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,020
Here's some money for you.

74
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,180
The clan has prepared a dowry for me.

75
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,340
Keep the money to yourself.

76
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,460
Once you leave,

77
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,900
your life will be different.

78
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,620
Money can bring you

79
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,460
security.

80
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,900
Don't be as self-willed as before.

81
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,060
If you get hurt,

82
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,260
do let me know.

83
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,380
Once we marry,

84
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,580
I'll be a good wife.

85
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,020
Don't worry about me.

86
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:09,220
"Cry the fish hawks on sandbars in the river.

87
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:12,900
A mild-mannered good girl,
fine match for the gentleman.

88
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,580
A ragged fringe is the floating-heart,
left and right we trail it."

89
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,900
How dull and tedious!

90
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,700
I'm tired of studying.

91
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,700
Young Master, Miss Si said

92
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,740
you had to copy this whole book today.

93
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,900
No way. I can't.

94
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,580
What are you doing, Master Qin?

95
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,100
Does studying make you tired?

96
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,940
- Come on.
- Can we hang out?

97
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,120
Let's learn martial arts.

98
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,140
No, I won't go!

99
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,220
I can't!

100
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,220
Come on!

101
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,700
Ji, fetch the basin.

102
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:47,900
No, no.

103
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,020
I'm up.

104
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,700
Too... too fierce.

105
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,540
That's too much.

106
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,100
Young Master!

107
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,420
Young Master!

108
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,540
Passed out already?

109
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,340
Goodness!

110
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,580
Stop beating that basin.

111
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,460
You're making me deaf.

112
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,580
It's still early.

113
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,700
I can take a nap.

114
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,580
Stop beating it!

115
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,160
Come on!

116
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,540
Come on!

117
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,460
I quit.

118
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,650
I'm exhausted.

119
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,420
(Morning Drizzle)

120
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,340
Young Master,

121
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:32,940
before Master Qin left,

122
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,140
he told Miss Si

123
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,260
to have me watch you practice every day.

124
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,460
I can't do it anymore,

125
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,340
or I'll die.

126
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,100
Who is this?

127
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,260
It's only been days.

128
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,020
What happened to you?

129
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,020
What brings you here?

130
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,940
To laugh at me?

131
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,260
Don't give up, Jiang Zhan.

132
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,260
Jiang Si asked me

133
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,340
to teach you self-defense skills

134
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,580
that Master Qin hadn't mentioned.

135
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,580
Good heavens!

136
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,900
Si is insane!

137
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,460
Chuchu,

138
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,460
do me a favor, will you?

139
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,140
Knock me out.

140
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,580
I can't do it anymore.

141
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,460
Shut up and do as I say.

142
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,460
Let's begin today's practice.

143
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,460
Fine.

144
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,340
Alright. Let's do it!

145
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:23,330
What is it?

146
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,220
I'll do whatever you say.

147
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,260
This is

148
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,260
what we're going to do.

149
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,460
What do you mean?

150
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,020
I know over the past few days,

151
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,620
you've been exhausted.

152
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,060
It takes time to learn

153
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,020
martial arts.

154
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,660
It can't be rushed,

155
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,260
or it'll do more harm than good.

156
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,460
To learn my skills,

157
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,700
you need to recover your energy first.

158
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,340
Miss Lu,

159
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,300
I've never seen anyone

160
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,820
as smart

161
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,460
and kind as you!

162
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,140
Save it.

163
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,580
Eat up.

164
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,940
It's so good to be outside.

165
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,060
I could use some fresh air

166
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,500
after being grounded for days.

167
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,700
It was Jiang Si's fault.

168
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,460
I'll make her pay someday.

169
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,020
Ji, fetch a pot of liquor.

170
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,220
Yes.

171
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,000
- Eat with me.
- Who's that?

172
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,860
No, thanks.

173
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,700
Ms. Xiao,

174
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,100
that's Miss Si's friend,

175
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,260
Lu Chuchu.

176
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,140
Lu Chuchu?

177
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,260
Is that a girl?

178
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:32,860
Why is she

179
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,060
- dressed like that?
- Try it.

180
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,020
Obviously,

181
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,420
- she's not a decent girl,
- Eat it.

182
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,420
but a humble civilian.

183
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,540
Jiang Si

184
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,220
planted her people

185
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,340
in our mansion

186
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,940
when I was grounded.

187
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:50,940
Clearly,

188
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,380
she's eager to

189
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,580
replace me as the matriarch.

190
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,340
Mother.

191
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,620
Although you've been freed,

192
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,940
from now on,

193
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,300
watch what you say and do.

194
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,300
Don't make mistakes ever again.

195
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,860
Yes, Mother.

196
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,700
I'll keep that in mind.

197
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,820
Let me do it.

198
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,580
Mother,

199
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,740
when I was sick,

200
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:30,220
you managed everything at home. Thanks.

201
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,020
I'm glad you know it.

202
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:36,220
I reflected on myself

203
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,820
in my room in the last few days.

204
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,700
I failed to run the household well,

205
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,340
unlike Si. Look,

206
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,740
she's kept everything in order.

207
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,060
Even Zhan has become better.

208
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,460
I heard he started

209
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,780
practicing martial arts.

210
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:56,180
They were fooling around.

211
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,140
I noticed a girl

212
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,740
in our mansion

213
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,340
who I had never seen before.

214
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:06,460
She and Zhan

215
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,700
seemed quite close.

216
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,700
Who was that?

217
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,500
Mrs. Li,

218
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,620
do you know her?

219
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:15,860
My Lady,

220
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,620
she's Miss Si's friend,

221
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,820
Lu Chuchu.

222
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,180
Her background is unknown.

223
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,580
Refugees have been

224
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,220
sneaking into the city lately.

225
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,220
What if she's one of them?

226
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,180
A refugee?

227
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,060
That's fine

228
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,220
as long as she's honest,

229
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,340
and Zhan likes her.

230
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,220
I agree, Mother.

231
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,460
You're right.

232
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,580
Just now,

233
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,740
we saw her

234
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,460
on the way here.

235
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,820
She looked like a tough girl.

236
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,100
I wonder why a Han like her

237
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,340
was dressed as a Tartar.

238
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,180
My Lady,

239
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,100
a few days ago, I saw her

240
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,460
feeding Young Master Zhan

241
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,700
in the garden.

242
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,780
Actually, they were feeding each other.

243
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,260
She was as if seducing him.

244
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,700
Alright, that's enough.

245
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,580
What nonsense is that?

246
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,220
Don't be mad, Mother.

247
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,460
Please calm down.

248
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:15,100
If she really is like what Mrs. Li said,

249
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,340
that girl is dishonest.

250
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,460
Zhan's marriage is one thing.

251
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,500
We can't risk

252
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,140
the honor of our clan.

253
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:24,980
Stop.

254
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,220
Say no more.

255
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,860
I won't allow anyone in our house

256
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,260
to marry a mysterious girl like her!

257
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,580
Yes.

258
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,060
Greetings, Grandmother.

259
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,580
Why did you ask to see me?

260
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,580
Zhan,

261
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:50,940
what's the relationship between you

262
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,980
and Miss Lu Chuchu?

263
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,460
She's Commandant Yu's friend,

264
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,340
and she's made friends with Si, too.

265
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,500
How... how did she

266
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,660
and Commandant Yu meet?

267
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,740
They've known each other since childhood.

268
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,660
Why are you suddenly

269
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,220
taking an interest in her?

270
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,220
What I'm saying is

271
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,980
if you like her,

272
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,220
you should tell me.

273
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,340
But ask yourself

274
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,020
how well

275
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,580
you know her.

276
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,340
You're familiar

277
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,260
with our family rules.

278
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,740
Mysterious

279
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,580
and dishonest girls like her

280
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,620
will not be accepted by our clan!

281
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,460
Grandmother,

282
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,220
you're biased against her.

283
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,460
First,

284
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,740
she and I

285
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,180
are just friends.

286
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,820
Nothing else is going on between us.

287
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,260
Second, she's

288
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,860
General-in-chief Huaihua's daughter.

289
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,580
How is she mysterious?

290
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,100
What? General-in-chief Huaihua

291
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,620
is her... father?

292
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,700
Correct.

293
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,660
He's well-known and awe-inspiring,

294
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:01,300
having killed countless enemies

295
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,140
and achieved notable merits.

296
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,620
He's a war hero!

297
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,340
Is...

298
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,500
what you said true?

299
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,420
Of course.

300
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:11,740
Besides,

301
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,500
she helped those in need

302
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,740
along the way

303
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:15,860
and spent all her money

304
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:16,980
on refugees.

305
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,340
How could you call her dishonest?

306
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:23,100
She spent all her money on refugees?

307
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:26,460
She has a heart of gold.

308
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,500
She does.

309
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,260
Don't listen to those rumors others said.

310
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,420
Let me pour you some water.

311
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,620
You can relax, My Lady.

312
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,460
Mother.

313
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,140
Mother, Lu Chuchu

314
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,620
is terrible!

315
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,500
You had me tell her

316
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,700
to stay away from Zhan, right?

317
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,780
She was ill-mannered

318
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,580
and extremely mean to me!

319
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,500
Aunt Xiao.

320
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,220
Zhan?

321
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,770
Who did you mean?

322
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,460
Chief,

323
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,940
I get it.

324
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,860
You have feelings for Miss Si.

325
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,820
But what I don't get is

326
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,300
if you like her, why not take action?

327
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,220
Even a scholar like Mr. Zhen

328
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,980
went uphill to gather Lan-tsao

329
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,860
for Miss Si.

330
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,140
If it were me,

331
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,820
I'd be so touched as to marry him.

332
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,100
So what if he got a pot?

333
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,100
I can gather 100 pots!

334
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,180
If he... he thinks he can

335
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:12,140
be a fighter,

336
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,100
then I can be a scholar.

337
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,580
One pot of plant makes a decent gift.

338
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,420
100 pots are ridiculous.

339
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,700
What is love?

340
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,220
It's intangible and romantic.

341
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,540
It spreads

342
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,980
behind the unspoken words.

343
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,820
Your simple and crude idea

344
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,180
will only ruin the romance

345
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,940
and its misty beauty.

346
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,220
Do you have a better idea?

347
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,540
People used to convey love by letter.

348
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:42,860
Now,

349
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,820
we can use crabapple flowers.

350
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,180
Chief said

351
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,540
a fighter like him

352
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,980
didn't know how to look after plants.

353
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,260
Leaves

354
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,730
of this pot of crabapple keep falling.

355
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:54,980
It might be caused

356
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,620
by the soil.

357
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,380
He had me bring this pot to Miss Si to...

358
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,340
If you couldn't tend it,

359
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,860
you'd better stay away from all plants.

360
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,420
Hey, I'm not done yet.

361
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,460
Why is she mad?

362
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,740
Was I being too subtle?

363
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,460
Nah.

364
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,100
Once Miss Si digs,

365
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:14,940
she'll see it.

366
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,660
That day,

367
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,100
I meant to take the chance

368
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,260
to clear the air with Mr. Zhen

369
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,420
and his mother,

370
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,740
but I couldn't say no to them

371
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,820
and didn't get to make it clear.

372
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,700
It's better to leave it that way.

373
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,940
Miss, I've begun to think

374
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,460
Mr. Zhen is really nice.

375
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,620
As quiet as he seems,

376
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,340
he likes you wholeheartedly.

377
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,860
To gather this pot of Lan-tsao,

378
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:41,340
he cut his hand and lost blood.

379
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,460
Unlike Mr. Yu who returned

380
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,060
the crabapple from you.

381
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,140
He took an arrow

382
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,580
for you

383
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,300
and almost lost his life.

384
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,340
He helped you out again

385
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,820
on Lady Jiang's birthday.

386
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:56,860
But...

387
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,700
Aman,

388
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,820
forget about Mr. Yu.

389
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,860
Don't worry.

390
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,100
Mr. Zhen is a wonderful man,

391
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,260
but

392
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,820
he can't make my heart flutter.

393
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,060
I simply

394
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,580
appreciate him as a friend.

395
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,060
That's not love.

396
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,940
If no one

397
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,620
can make my heart flutter,

398
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,140
I'll remain single forever.

399
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,580
Things are going so well now.

400
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,820
I have Zhan, my father,

401
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,340
and you with me.

402
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,820
This is great.

403
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,420
I'm more than content.

404
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,140
Am I right?

405
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,740
(Fragrant Dew)

406
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,980
Are you sure it's Jiang Si's shop?

407
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,300
Yes.

408
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,300
Your Grace,

409
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:56,100
my wife used to own that shop.

410
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,340
It was a lucrative business.

411
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,180
Jiang Si

412
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,180
must've

413
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,180
tricked my wife

414
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,660
into giving away that shop.

415
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,260
You couldn't even

416
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,060
control a businesswoman you married.

417
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,900
And here you are complaining to me?

418
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,100
I'm sorry, Your Grace.

419
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,380
I am but a scholar.

420
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,820
I'm too kind

421
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,220
to deal with

422
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,180
that deep and scheming woman.

423
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,820
What's wrong with women?

424
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,020
Weren't you born by one?

425
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,100
You're incompetent.

426
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,860
Don't blame it on a woman.

427
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,860
This perfume smells good.

428
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,660
I wonder if it works as well.

429
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,700
Your Grace, are you...?

430
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,540
I'm not you.

431
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,300
Those who annoyed me

432
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,780
will suffer for sure.

433
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:52,100
(Fragrance Shop)

434
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,100
Look, everyone!

435
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,020
Come and look!

436
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:58,300
This shop is a trap!

437
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,260
It's run by heartless animals!

438
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,020
We used their balm

439
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,540
and grew rashes all over the face!

440
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,340
Look at my face!

441
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,380
Look, everyone! Look!

442
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,420
Ladies,

443
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,060
why are you making a scene in my shop?

444
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,340
Why?

445
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,260
Look at me, everyone!

446
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,100
Look!

447
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,340
The balm I bought

448
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,260
from this shop

449
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,460
ruined my face.

450
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,940
This shop is a trap.

451
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,340
It's a trap!

452
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,540
How could I live on?

453
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,020
How heartless!

454
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,500
How dare you sell such poison!

455
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,100
Aren't you afraid of karma?

456
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,900
No one will buy their products again!

457
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,580
It's a trap! A trap!

458
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:31,460
Trash it!

459
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,700
Smash everything!

460
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,940
Trash it! Trash it!

461
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:38,540
- Smash!
- Smash!

462
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,020
Nobody moves!

463
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,060
Are you hitting her?

464
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:46,780
Help!

465
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,740
She's hitting us! Help!

466
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,020
She's violent!

467
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,100
Chuchu, let her go.

468
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,180
Jiang Si...

469
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,180
Let her go, Chuchu.

470
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,540
We demand an explanation.

471
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,260
How dare she hit her!

472
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,380
- Yes.
- That's right.

473
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,620
Sorry about this.

474
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:01,820
Ma'am,

475
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,100
where's the rest

476
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,020
of the balm you used?

477
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,060
May I take a look?

478
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,780
Don't try to destroy the evidence.

479
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,220
We're all watching you.

480
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,740
Yes. Right.

481
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,660
That's right.

482
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,220
Don't worry.

483
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,780
I'll test it right here.

484
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,500
Rou'er, show them

485
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,580
the rest of all our balm.

486
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,820
Pick any jar

487
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,180
from our stock.

488
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,820
I'll test it right in front of you.

489
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,060
Rou'er, bring me the picked ones.

490
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,300
Sure.

491
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,180
You said the balm from our shop

492
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,180
ruined your face.

493
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,100
I'll test it myself here and now.

494
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,500
She used this jar.

495
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,540
Take a look

496
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,020
at these two jars

497
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:52,860
and smell them.

498
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,540
Take a sniff, everyone.

499
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,260
Their scents are different.

500
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,500
They aren't the same.

501
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,740
They smell differently, right?

502
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,900
Yes, how come?

503
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,500
That's right. She added

504
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,660
Ruyi Grass

505
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,500
to the balm she used.

506
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,540
That's a poisonous plant

507
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,100
that's corrosive to the skin.

508
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,940
What grass? I've never heard of it.

509
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,180
It was your balm

510
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,300
that disfigured my face!

511
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,100
This shop is to blame!

512
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,780
- It's a trap!
- If you insist on

513
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,340
making groundless accusations,

514
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,140
let's go to court.

515
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,100
We aren't afraid of being checked.

516
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,020
Sue me.

517
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:23,980
I'm not scared!

518
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,500
Your shop is a trap, indeed!

519
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,260
Aman, go to the Capital Security Office.

520
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,220
Ask their officials to come here

521
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,460
to uphold justice.

522
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,300
Yes.

523
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,020
Go ahead and sue me!

524
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,500
You're selling poison!

525
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,500
- You're evil!
- Yes!

526
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,420
You bribed officials.

527
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,500
This shop is a trap!

528
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,020
It's a trap! A trap!

529
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,100
Stop! Come back!

530
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,420
Chuchu.

531
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:44,820
Let them go.

532
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:45,980
But they...

533
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,300
You saw everything.

534
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,020
Isn't it clear who's guilty?

535
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,060
They came to make a scene on purpose.

536
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,500
Rou'er, fetch

537
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,340
the new fragrant tablets we made

538
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,620
and give them to the ladies.

539
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,780
Go home

540
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:59,820
and try them.

541
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,740
See for yourself

542
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,980
the quality of our products.

543
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,540
- Thanks.
- It smells nice.

544
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,340
Thanks.

545
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,420
Thank you, Miss.

546
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,360
So fragrant.

547
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,220
I like its aroma.

548
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,060
Jiang Si,

549
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,180
why did you stop me

550
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,240
from chasing them just now?

551
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,540
I'm afraid

552
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,380
there's more to this matter.

553
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,660
(Haitang Chamber)

554
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,620
Have some tea.

555
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,800
You've been doing the accounts all night.

556
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,980
They smashed away

557
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,820
six months' profits

558
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,660
earlier today.

559
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,580
We had finally had some spare money.

560
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,980
Also, you had paid a lot to run the mansion.

561
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,900
What should we do now?

562
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,700
Even if we sell all the valuables here,

563
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,740
it's still not enough.

564
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:02,020
How about we borrow some money

565
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,020
from Qiaoniang?

566
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,100
We can't.

567
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,100
I've annoyed Duke An's Mansion.

568
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,220
If others find out

569
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,340
that she helped me,

570
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,190
how can she keep a foothold in their mansion?

571
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:13,300
I'll figure something out.

572
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,420
(Morning Drizzle)

573
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,140
Er'niu!

574
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:25,780
Miss.

575
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,100
What are these?

576
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,060
Banknotes!

577
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,420
1,000 taels altogether!

578
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,300
(500 Taels)

579
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,500
Er'niu,

580
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,900
you aren't a dog

581
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,940
but the God of Wealth.

582
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,500
But he took so much money

583
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,340
from whom?

584
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,290
Who else could it be

585
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,180
but Mr. Yu?

586
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,340
Him?

587
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,020
Miss,

588
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,740
could they be forged?

589
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,420
How could he have

590
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,260
so much money?

591
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,100
Forged?

592
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:48,980
He doesn't

593
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,780
seem too rich.

594
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,300
Yes. He lives in a small house.

595
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,540
Nothing he eats, wears, or uses

596
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,020
seems expensive.

597
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,060
Miss,

598
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,260
looks like I was wrong

599
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,140
about him.

600
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,740
Mr. Yu is the one

601
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,100
who's obsessed with you.

602
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,180
That's not

603
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,580
what you said the other day.

604
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,260
A friend in need is

605
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,540
a friend indeed, right?

606
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,620
Think about it.

607
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,780
A poor man like him

608
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,580
must've used every possible means

609
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,180
to gather 1,000 tales,

610
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,620
and he gave it all to you.

611
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,300
If that's not true love, what else is?

612
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,140
Aman,

613
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,530
did he borrow it from a loan shark?

614
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,420
The compound interest is disastrous!

615
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:25,740
Er'niu.

616
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,020
Mr. Yu...

617
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,340
Are you taking a walk?

618
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,340
I'm bringing Er'niu back.

619
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,580
I can tell.

620
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,260
Mr. Yu,

621
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,740
(500 Taels)
I can't take your 1,000 taels.

622
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,740
Your shop was smashed.

623
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,180
Aren't you in urgent need of money?

624
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,500
Even so,

625
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,980
I can't take your banknotes.

626
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,260
By the way,

627
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,820
are they really yours?

628
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,620
Of course.

629
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,020
The salary from your office

630
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:26,980
isn't that high, is it?

631
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,180
Long Dan collects it every month.

632
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,980
Do you not know how much

633
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:31,820
you earn every month?

634
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:32,820
No.

635
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:34,500
Are 1,000 taels not enough?

636
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,360
I can give you more.

637
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:36,820
No, no. It's enough.

638
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:39,980
You're much richer

639
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,340
than I thought.

640
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,340
Money isn't important.

641
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,980
Only the rich

642
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,100
can say so.

643
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,100
I'm not that rich.

644
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,420
Anyway, I can't take your banknotes.

645
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,500
Take them back.

646
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,780
I don't need money at all.

647
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,580
You need it now,

648
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,100
so take it.

649
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,020
Don't be shy.

650
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,020
- I...
- Miss, are you done?

651
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,500
Someone is coming!

652
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:05,820
Oh, I see.

653
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:08,740
It's my problem.

654
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,900
I'll take care of it.

655
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,260
Here are your banknotes.

656
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,700
You...

657
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,660
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

658
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,020
Hold on. Wait!

659
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,420
I'll invest

660
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,540
the money in your shop.

661
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,180
Give me a cut at the end of the year.

662
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,580
Didn't you say

663
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,820
money should be used to make money?

664
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,100
If I left these banknotes in a cupboard,

665
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,500
they might be chipped away

666
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,060
by worms or rats.

667
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:35,780
Alright. Fine.

668
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,140
I'll take 500 taels.

669
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,500
Thanks for your help.

670
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,300
Don't turn around.

671
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,540
Do not move.

672
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,060
How useless!

673
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,540
(Friends Gather Together)
She came out.

674
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:27,060
You should've used that matter
against Jiang Si.

675
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,380
But what happened?

676
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,100
She used it against you!

677
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,740
It was my fault.

678
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,460
I didn't recognize

679
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,340
that she was Jiang Si.

680
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,260
Idiot!

681
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,660
Cousin,

682
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:39,980
is she the best one

683
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,380
you chose to take revenge for me?

684
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,100
She was a member of the Linglong Troupe.

685
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,100
I thought she was smart

686
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,180
and good with words.

687
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,820
I didn't know she'd be so useless.

688
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,420
Get lost!

689
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,260
Get out of Her Grace's sight!

690
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,860
- Yes.
- Wait.

691
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,660
Did I allow you to leave?

692
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,660
If you're so bad with words,

693
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,420
don't bother

694
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,580
to speak ever again.

695
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,100
Drag her out

696
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,260
and silence her.

697
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,140
Guards!

698
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,900
Spare me, Your Grace!

699
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,740
Your Grace!

700
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:16,580
Young Master!

701
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,260
Help me, Young Master!

702
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,580
Young Master! Please!

703
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,820
Do you want to help her?

704
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:24,500
Of course not.

705
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:26,500
I can't care less about a performer.

706
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,540
Very well.

707
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,260
It's better to have her muted

708
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,260
when she doesn't know what to say

709
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:37,900
or say what she shouldn't have.

710
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,340
Trust me, Your Grace.

711
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,780
I won't say a word about this matter

712
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,060
to Uncle.

713
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,860
You're my cousin.

714
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,660
I certainly trust you.

715
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:50,900
But

716
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:52,940
look at the people

717
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,260
you found:

718
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,580
a stupid performer

719
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,340
and a useless scholar.

720
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,980
Ji Chongyi,

721
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,420
your father is a duke.

722
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,980
He might not be powerful,

723
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,100
but he holds a rank.

724
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,820
You're right, Your Grace.

725
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,740
You can hold others in awe.

726
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,500
I admire you for that.

727
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,340
I know Jiang Si all too well.

728
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,020
She's calculative

729
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,340
and thick-skinned.

730
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,540
She went to Capital Security

731
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,580
to cancel our engagement.

732
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,420
I bet

733
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,060
both Zhen Heng and Yu Qi

734
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,100
of that office are her lovers.

735
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,300
The two of them

736
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,900
are known to be tough.

737
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,180
It wouldn't be wise

738
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,540
to set her up

739
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,900
in the open.

740
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,740
That office again!

741
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,020
Do you think

742
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,580
I'm afraid of them?

743
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,180
You aren't, of course.

744
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,660
But we're right

745
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,180
under His Majesty's nose.

746
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,020
If we made too big a fuss,

747
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,260
and the General and Grand Princess found out,

748
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:57,100
it wouldn't be worth it.

749
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,180
It's hard to deal with Jiang Si,

750
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,860
but her brother, Jiang Zhan,

751
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,500
is a fool

752
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,580
and an easy target.

753
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,780
She cares about him

754
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:07,820
the most.

755
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,060
It'll be much easier to destroy her

756
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,580
by using him.

757
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,060
Bad news!

758
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,380
Bad news!

759
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,500
Bad news, Miss!

760
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,240
Young Master Zhan has gone missing again.

761
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,980
(Haitang Chamber)
Miss!

762
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:32,820
Master, Master!

763
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:34,780
Found him?

764
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,260
He isn't anywhere here.

765
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,300
Check the east courtyard.

766
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,140
Yes.

767
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:39,700
Master, he's not in the places

768
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,020
where he'd go fishing!

769
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,100
What about the tea house?

770
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,300
Go there and look!

771
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,140
Yes.

772
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,300
Si,

773
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,580
calm down, will you?

774
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,980
He used to hang out

775
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,020
every few days.

776
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,020
Don't worry too much.

777
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,300
He'll come back when he's tired.

778
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,140
Father, this time is different.

779
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,580
He'll be in danger!

780
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,500
He's an adult.

781
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,580
What could've happened?

782
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,100
Trust me. Things have changed.

783
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,100
It's you who have changed.

784
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,700
In the last few days,

785
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,820
you had him grounded,

786
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,120
making him learn martial arts

787
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,340
and read books.

788
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,740
I was surprised

789
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,700
that he didn't run out

790
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,300
until today.

791
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,620
Miss Si, Master.

792
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,100
How did it go, Master Qin?

793
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:18,860
Found anything?

794
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,580
No. I checked every corner of this house.

795
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,780
I also checked the places

796
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,380
where he'd go for drinks, music, and cuju

797
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,540
as you said

798
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,420
but found nothing.

799
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,380
The riverside.

800
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,740
Go to the riverside!

801
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,340
Mr. Yu!

802
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,380
Mr. Zhen!

803
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,780
(Capital Security Office, Court)

804
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,020
Miss Si sent me to seek help.

805
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,220
Young Master Zhan is missing.

806
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,580
Please gather enough people

807
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,820
to help us find him.

808
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,340
How long

809
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,340
has he been missing?

810
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,260
It's been half a day since this morning.

811
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,820
He's an adult.

812
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:47,900
It's only been a few hours.

813
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:48,900
He's not missing yet.

814
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,340
Our office can't take it

815
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,320
as a missing person case.

816
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,500
But Miss Si said

817
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,340
he might die if we didn't find him in time.

818
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,500
Long Dan, let's go.

819
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,540
- Yes.
- Stop.

820
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:58,980
It's against the law.

821
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,100
If we had to find everyone

822
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,340
who went missing

823
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,290
for a few hours in town,

824
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,660
our system would be destroyed.

825
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,620
You're right. Let's go.

826
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:15,660
Did you find anything?

827
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:16,820
No.

828
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:17,940
What about you guys here?

829
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,420
- Nothing.
- Anything there?

830
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:20,480
No.

831
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,820
What about you, Master Qin?

832
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,180
Negative.

833
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,260
Over here.

834
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,820
This way, please.

835
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:32,900
This is the best room

836
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,020
we have.

837
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,260
You won't get

838
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:38,140
a better view anywhere else in town.

839
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:41,820
Do you need a girl

840
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,060
to play music or sing songs?

841
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,300
Also, she can drink with you.
You'll have fun.

842
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,740
I don't need anyone

843
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:50,690
to play music or sing.

844
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,860
Leave me alone.

845
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:53,940
Sure. No problem.

846
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,020
Thanks.

847
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,500
Enjoy yourself.

848
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:03,580
Sure.

849
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:12,660
Again!

850
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:16,940
Come on.

851
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,060
Knock him down.

852
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,740
- Get him!
- Another round!

853
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,020
- How manly!
- Good.

854
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,380
Get him!

855
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,140
Get him!

856
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,580
Pin him down!

857
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:48,580
Get him!

858
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,340
Get him!

859
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,340
Zhan!

860
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,140
- Si...
- Why are you here?

861
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,340
Master Qin...

862
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,860
We looked everywhere for you.

863
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,860
I... I was watching
Imperial Insignia Guards wrestling.

864
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,260
Go home with me.

865
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,260
Stop running around, Zhan.

866
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,100
Sure. I...

867
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,380
Hey, Yu!

868
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,460
You came, too.

869
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:09,620
Help me, please.

870
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:10,820
Si is crazy.

871
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,140
She imprisoned me. Come on!

872
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,620
Mr. Yu, thanks for your help today.

873
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:18,860
I'll escort you two back.

874
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,180
No need.

875
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,780
I'll bring him back.

876
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:22,860
Good day.

877
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:25,140
Let's go home. Come on!

878
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,460
Come to have dinner with us someday.

879
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,020
Good day, Mr. Yu.

880
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,140
Mr. Yu, thanks to you,

881
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,780
we found Miss Si's brother.

882
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,180
She made

883
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,580
desserts for you and had me

884
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:46,700
bring them over.

885
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,300
No wonder they look familiar.

886
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,860
We're friends.

887
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,500
No need to thank me.

888
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,980
Speaking of her,

889
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,620
she kind of

890
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,780
overreacted

891
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:57,980
earlier today.

892
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,100
Just to be sure,

893
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,780
was everything alright at the Jiang's,

894
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,860
or was there anything wrong with her brother?

895
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,140
All seemed well

896
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,580
except that there was something strange.

897
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,420
What was it?

898
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:12,980
Young Master Zhan said

899
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:15,540
Miss Si had never been strict with him.

900
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,140
But recently,

901
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,700
she became a different person.

902
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,650
She made him learn martial arts at home

903
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,740
and had a physician

904
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,300
come to take his pulse every day.

905
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,500
Young Master Zhan

906
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,540
kept complaining about it.

907
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:27,700
Earlier today,

908
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,060
he managed to sneak out.

909
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,300
We looked everywhere for him.

910
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:34,540
At first,

911
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:36,940
I thought she was anxious

912
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,780
because the Imperial Insignia Guard selection

913
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,860
was in a few days.

914
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,380
She wanted him to get ready at home.

915
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,540
When I helped her look for him earlier,

916
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:46,460
I noticed

917
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,180
that she had replaced

918
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,780
all the servants in his courtyard.

919
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:54,020
She'd test

920
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,020
everything he ate every day

921
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,540
with a silver needle.

922
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,540
I think she was paranoid

923
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,100
just like she was today.

924
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,020
He only hung out for a few hours,

925
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:03,860
but she went crazy.

926
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:05,420
Was it that bad?

927
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:08,580
Is there someone trying to

928
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,900
harm Jiang Zhan?

929
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,580
He might be an earl's son,

930
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:12,940
but he can't inherit the rank.

931
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,780
Who'd waste their time harming him?

932
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:15,900
You're wrong.

933
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,740
Miss Si

934
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,220
has always been cautious.

935
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,060
She must've acted like this for a reason.

936
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,380
Master Qin, you know,

937
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:25,980
I'm also a martial artist.

938
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,020
I'll go with you tomorrow.

939
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,900
If Miss Si

940
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,500
still has concerns,

941
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,940
she can come along, too.

942
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,300
That'd be great.

943
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,700
I'll relay your message to her.

944
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:38,700
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

945
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:40,780
Cheers.

946
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:50,900
(Zhou)

947
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,180
I'm off duty today.

948
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:57,020
Jiang Zhan can't stay indoors all the time.

949
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,780
It's bad for his mood and health.

950
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:00,940
I'll teach him.

951
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,420
Master Qin is here with us as well.

952
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,740
No need to worry, Miss Si.

953
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,780
I appreciate your help, Mr. Yu.

954
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,780
I'll leave you guys alone, Zhan.

955
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:19,700
You're really good!

956
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:21,980
You volunteered to teach me

957
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,740
to ride and shoot to help me out.

958
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,420
Thanks, man.

959
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:26,900
You're welcome, man.

960
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,020
Well then,

961
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,500
keep a squatting stance for one hour first

962
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,400
to warm up.

963
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,100
Sure. One hour...

964
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:35,820
Wait.

965
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:36,940
Look at me.

966
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:37,780
I'm warmed up.

967
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,820
I don't need to squat.

968
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:39,900
I can begin shooting now.

969
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,740
Let's shoot.

970
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:44,980
When you sneaked out yesterday,

971
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,460
your family was worried sick.

972
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:48,100
Are you trying to escape punishment?

973
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,780
You should be on my side.

974
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:52,420
You're my man.

975
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:56,100
Fine. As your man,

976
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,420
I have to

977
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,320
be responsible for you.

978
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:00,780
I'll have Miss Si watch you.

979
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,900
No, wait!

980
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,420
I'm squatting. Look.

981
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,580
- Calm down. Don't be mad.
- You...

982
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,900
That was for your sister.

983
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:22,660
Mr. Zhen.

984
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:26,060
Are you bringing Miss Si flowers again?

985
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,500
I think she and Young Master Zhan

986
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,060
went to the turf in the western suburbs.

987
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,260
Thanks.

988
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,500
My Lady,

990
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,900
came to bring Miss Si flowers again.

991
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:46,780
What did he bring this time?

992
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,620
Gardenias.

993
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:50,100
Last time, it was Lan-tsao.

994
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,180
Just now, he brought gardenias.

995
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,180
How sweet.

996
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,540
Si is

00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:59,580

Miss,

1027
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,300
I'm going to boil some water.

1028
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,900
The gardenias are beautiful.

1029
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,740
A friend of mine,

1030
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,180
who was into gardening,

1031
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,380
planted them.

1032
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,100
Such flowers smell nice.

1033
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,220
They're simple and pleasant.

1034
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,180
I think they're perfect for you.

1035
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:06,900
Thank you,

1036
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:10,300
but I can't take them.

1037
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:11,460
Hold it.

1038
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:16,300
Don't feel pressured.

1039
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,540
They're nothing expensive.

1040
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,500
It's not about money.

1041
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:22,460
You see,

1042
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:24,460
you're a gentleman.

1043
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:27,300
You're pure and unworldly.

1044
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:29,460
However,

1045
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,500
I'm not as good as you think.

1046
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,020
I don't deserve your appreciation.

1047
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:37,660
You should

1048
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,380

1049
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,580

1050
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,260
that annoyed you?

1051
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,740
Tell me. I'll change.

1052
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,100
No, Zhen.

1053
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,460
You're a good man.

1054
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,380
It's my fault.

1055
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,380
I disappoint

1056
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:08,380

00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,660
don't worry.

1059
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:22,540
I won't force you to do anything.

1060
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,500
I'll explain it to my mother.

1061
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,580

1062
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:26,940
I'll propose to you.

As for the flowers,

1064
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,180
I'll bring them back

1065
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:34,900

1066
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:36,900
If one day, you'd like to keep them,

1067
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,250
I'll bring them over again.
