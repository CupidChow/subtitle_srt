62
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:30,870
but...

63
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,920
I know.

64
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,640
I know it all.

00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,520
Still,

66
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,320

Fuqing,

69
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,150
I want to marry you

70
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,680
and grow old with you.

71
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,030
Will you marry me?

72
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:19,800
You once asked me

73
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,560
why I refused the betrothal

74
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:23,830
by His Majesty.

75
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,440
Why did you

76
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,510
refuse to marry me that day?

77
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,280
Back then,

78
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,040
I only saw you as a student.

79
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,440
I wouldn't dare hope for more.

80
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,880
But after this near-death experience,

81
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,390
I realize

82
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,830
you're always in my heart.

83
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:44,910
It beats for you.

84
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,200
Others might've only seen

85
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,680
that you're soft and delicate

86
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,470
while in my eyes,

87
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,240
you're brave

88
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,830
and tough.

89
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm conquered by you.

90
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,950
Although you were in the dark,

91
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,350
you tried to light up others.

92
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:04,950
You'd protect them

93
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:05,950
in your own way

94
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,190
despite the fact

95
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,030
that you were suffering in silence.

96
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,390
I accept you for who you are.

97
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:15,870
I just want you

98
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,110
to be happy,

99
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,720
free,

100
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,390
and healthy.

101
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,800
Our feelings are mutual.

102
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,760
So will you marry me?

103
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:29,950
Yes, I'll marry you!

104
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,950
Thank you for everything, Jin.

105
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,630
It's all thanks to General Cui.

106
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,230
You little cheat!

107
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,350
Don't play games with me.

108
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,280
Cui Xu came

109
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,750
because of Jiang Si, right?

110
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,110
She's a wonderful girl.

111
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,920
You have good taste.

112
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,630
I appreciate your compliment.

113
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,120
By the way, Father,

114
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,630
I've returned

115
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:18,960
the Jade Seal

116
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,710
you entrusted me with in perilous time.

117
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,560
You've grown up.

118
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,230
What plans do you have?

119
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:32,870
Tell me about them.

120
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,740
I want to go to Nanwu

121
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,040
to see Jiang Si.

122
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,720
Go to Nanwu?

123
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,640
Yes.

124
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,990
I'll agree to anything

125
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,520
but not that.

126
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:49,160
This isn't the best time to go there.

127
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,280
When... when is the best time?

128
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,860
(Tiande Hall)

129
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,030
I'll never set foot

130
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,160
in Tiande Hall again.

131
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,080
As for the timing,

132
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,080
that'll be

133
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,520
your decision to make.

134
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:14,800
Over the years,

135
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,550
because of Rongyang,

136
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,440
your mother has fought with me a lot.

137
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,590
After this latest scare,

138
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:22,990
I want to spend some time with her

139
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,140
and take her away to relax.

140
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:21,220
(Tiande Hall)

141
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:27,220
(Nanwu)

142
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:40,670
Grand Elder,

143
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,200
these are the finest spices.

144
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,320
They're rarely seen in Dazhou.

145
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,990
Nanwu

146
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,560
abounds with such spices.

147
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,950
Look. Incense is made in every household.

148
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,590
Grand Elder,

149
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,160
have you considered

150
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,470
encouraging the locals to do business?

151
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,070
Do business?

152
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,040
Nanwu has

153
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,080
never had any merchants,

154
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,160
only farmers and soldiers.

155
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,510
Military expenses

156
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,110
can be a heavy burden.

157
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,990
If there's no war,

158
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,240
the soldiers can

159
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,350
return home

160
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:14,870
to make a living.

161
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:16,990
As for farmers,

162
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,750
your topography

163
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:20,290
isn't suitable for farming.

164
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,350
What would we eat without it?

165
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,830
Farming is for self-sufficiency.

166
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,390
If you couldn't even support yourselves,

167
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:29,110
you had to join the army and fight

168
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,440
with your lives for more resources.

169
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,880
Actually,

170
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,360
there's a better option

171
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,360
for you.

172
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,680
Nanwu is rich in spices,

173
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,350
which are in high demand in Dazhou

174
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,230
despite their high prices.

175
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,120
If the people here

176
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,350
start doing business

177
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,080
by bringing those rare spices

178
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,470
to Dazhou

179
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,080
in exchange for what they need,

180
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,360
that way, even without farming,

181
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,320
they will

182
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,870
lead a better life.

183
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,200
Who'd

184
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,680
risk their lives in battle instead?

185
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:58,950
Do you mean

186
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,350
to sell these spices

187
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,160
to Dazhou

188
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,630
for food, ironware,

189
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,200
and other necessities?

190
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,110
Everyone will get what they need.

191
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,630
Our people's lives

192
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,440
will be greatly improved.

193
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,400
In that case,

194
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,720
the 100-year-long clash

195
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,920
will finally end.

196
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,560
Perhaps it is a better option.

197
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,920
Alright. We'll do it your way.

198
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,200
Let's carry it out

199
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,630
as the Saintess said.

200
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,000
So heavy!

201
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,580

Your Majesty,

207
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:03,920
it's too heavy.

208
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:04,990
Wear it for a day

209
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,440

with many children

214
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,590
to continue the family line

215
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,920
and make your clan thrive.

216
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,280

Yes.

223
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,950
Jiang Si.

224
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,320
Chuchu, sit with me.

225
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,470
My dear Saintess,

226
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,080
you've worked nonstop

227
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:03,990
for Nanwu.

228
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,680
It's time to take a break.

229
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:06,960
Chuchu,

230
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,150
I invited you over

231
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,280
to tell you something.

232
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,080
Could I trouble you to return to Dazhou?

233
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,920
I can go back to Ling'an?

234
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,400
What about you?

235
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:18,550
Won't you come along?

236
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,280
I can't return yet.

237
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,230
When you get back,

238
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,390
tell my sister and others

239
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,510
about the situation here.

240
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,710
I need their help.

241
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,800
Then find out what spices

242
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,590
the rich and powerful in Ling'an prefer.

243
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,030
Please make a list of them

244
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,080
and send it to me.

245
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,470
Sure.

246
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:36,790
Once Dazhou

247
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,320
and Nanwu can trade with each other,

248
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,550
don't forget my help.

249
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:40,470
I won't!

250
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,640
Take a look.

251
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:44,360
These are the rare spices in Nanwu

252
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,320
I've collected lately.

253
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,230
To Yu Jin.

254
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,150
I've made a pact

255
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,630
with Nanwu for a year.

256
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,030
During this period,

257
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,160
I'll stay there

258
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:55,990
and make Nanwu prosper

259
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,000
as never before

260
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,350
without going to war.

261
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,830
I'm confident of it.

262
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:05,040
She didn't mention me at all.

263
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:07,030
Your Majesty,

264
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,590
Minister Zhen came to see you.

265
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:09,950
Send him in.

266
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,150
Grand Princess Fuqing also came.

267
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,590
- Zhen Heng
- Fuqing

268
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,080
- greets you, Your Majesty.
- greets you, Your Majesty.

269
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:38,000
You came together, huh?

270
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:43,710
What's up?

271
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,040
I, Zhen Heng,

272
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,630
sincerely hope to marry
Grand Princess Fuqing

273
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,520
to forever tie the knot.

274
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:57,390
People call me rigid, dull,

275
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,910
and stubborn as a mule.

276
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,350
They aren't wrong.

277
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,430
But only Fuqing

278
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,080
accepts all my shortcomings

279
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,670
and truly admires me.

280
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,470
Your Majesty,

281
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,320
after Marquis Changxing's rebel earlier,

282
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,040
it became clearer to me

283
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:15,830
that I should cherish the most

284
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,430
the one by my side.

285
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,320
I promise to devote my life

286
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,960
to Grand Princess Fuqing.

287
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:23,830
I'll respect her and love her.

288
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,940
Please grant our marriage, Your Majesty.

289
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,670
Do you, who are by his side,

290
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,240
think the same?

291
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,430
His wish is my wish.

292
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,800
Minister Zhen,

293
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,280
I've never seen you like this before.

294
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,390
Please stop making fun of me.

295
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:48,510
Get up already.

296
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,840
Thanks, Your Majesty.

297
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,830
Don't act like Romeo and Juliet.

298
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,150
If it got out,

299
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:57,350
others would call me inhuman.

300
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,240
Minister Zhen,

301
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,350
Fuqing,

302
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,480
I'll attend

303
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,080
your wedding in person

304
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,080
and give you

305
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,720
this, this, and this.

306
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,510
It's as fine as emerald and jade,

307
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,320
the best of the best.

308
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,880
I handpicked it

309
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,320
for you in particular.

310
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,270
Oh,

311
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,520
and this too.

312
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:29,480
A gold-clad turtle with jade shards.

313
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,390
Those gifts you said

314
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,800
seem quite familiar.

315
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,240
But I think

316
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,390
nothing can be better

317
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,630
than your approval.

318
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,560
Granted.

319
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,600
You have my approval!

320
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:49,810
Thanks, Your Majesty.

321
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,390
Look, Grand Elder.

322
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,680
These goods

323
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,590
will be sent to Dazhou

324
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,540
as well as those spices.

325
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:28,670
Your Majesty,

326
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,560
a letter for you.

327
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,520
Please find the attached book
of Nanwu's herbs.

328
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,720
It includes various prescriptions

329
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,740
for unusual diseases, too.

330
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,590
They can help our people.

331
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,030
(To Yu Jin)

332
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,350
Although reform is never easy,

333
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,870
it's started making Nanwu better.

334
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,320
I need hydraulicians from Dazhou

335
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,590
to help Nanwu build dikes and dams

336
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,750
to protect their farmland.

337
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,080
Also... I miss you

338
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,590
and Er'niu.

339
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,000
Did she write to me

340
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,630
only to help Nanwu

341
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:09,750
build dikes and dams?

342
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,830
If one day,

343
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,910
I leave Ling'an,

344
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,040
I'll go to a beautiful place

345
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,000
and

346
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,910
buy a small farm and a cottage

347
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,550
to settle down

348
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:31,040
and lead a simple yet free life.

349
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,320
I'll

350
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:34,670
bring with me my father,

351
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,830
my siblings,

352
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,000
Chuchu, Aman,

353
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,430
Long Dan,

354
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,470
and...

355
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,910
and Er'niu!

356
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:49,800
Good. Very well.

357
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,190
And you too.

358
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,520
Will you go with me?

359
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,670
Have someone send Er'niu to her.

360
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:03,990
She misses him.

361
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,600
Yes.

362
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:23,100
(Report)

363
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:59,180
(Fragrant and Sparse)

364
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,520
Poor pigeon.

365
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:05,490
It has to fly so far only to send two words.

366
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,120
Miss you.

367
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,150
You're the Emperor.

368
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,520
Couldn't you bring more attendants?

369
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,440
These books aren't enough, are they?

370
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,360
Still not enough?

371
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,490
Even if Si read all day,

372
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:35,000
it'd take her years to finish them all.

373
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,860
I bought all the books

374
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,160
I could find over there.

375
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,560
What do you think? Are they enough?

376
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,240
They seem ample altogether.

377
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,160
Right?

378
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:42,720
Let's check other places.

379
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:44,430
Other places?

380
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:46,820
(The Commentary of Zuo
on the Spring and Autumn Annals)

381
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,760
Pack them all and send them to her.

382
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,160
Yes.

383
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,580
(To Jiang Si)

384
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:04,420
(To Jiang Si)

385
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:10,060
(To Jiang Si)

386
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,530
Are you going to leave tomorrow morning?

387
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,110
I've packed everything.

388
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,960
I came to

389
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,480
say goodbye to you, Mother.

390
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,400
Everything in the North is different

391
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,520
from that of Ling'an.

392
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,420
Although it's your ancestral home,

393
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,760
you've never been there before.

394
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,560
You've suddenly been appointed there

395
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,000
as the Protectorate General.

396
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:42,190
I wonder if you

397
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,150
can adapt to that place.

398
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:45,990
Don't worry, Mother.

399
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,520
The North is vast

400
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,560
but underdeveloped.

401
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,240
Jin entrusted it to me

402
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,310
and said I shall do what I see fit

403
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,230
to improve it.

404
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,080
That's all I need to hear.

405
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,670
In the past, with the Crown Prince above you,

406
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,760
you were unappreciated.

407
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:09,510
Now, you have a chance

408
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:10,870
to realize your ambition.

409
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:15,800
However, I'm not sure

410
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,080
when I'll come back.

411
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,510
I can no longer keep you company

412
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:23,670
as before.

413
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,670
Jin might still hold a grudge against you.

414
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,760
That concerns me the most.

415
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,880
Him?

416
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:40,590
He's been visiting me regularly.

417
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,880
Really?

418
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:45,320
He doesn't say much

419
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:47,020
and leaves after paying his respects,

420
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,320
but

421
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,430
he comes regardless.

422
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,030
Very well.

423
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,480
That's at least a good start.

424
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:58,720
I think so, too.

425
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:00,990
Zhang,

426
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,080
keep walking with me

427
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,320
when you still can.

428
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,430
Yes, Your Highness.

429
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:15,280
Your father

430
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,390
and I will also leave soon to travel.

431
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,220
(Earl Dongping's Mansion)
Zhan,

432
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,830
do you need to bring

433
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,110
a few maids with you

434
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,440
to take care of

435
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,830
your daily life?

436
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:41,990
Father,

437
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,400
I'm going to Yangui

438
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,760
as the Envoy to the Southwest

439
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,240
to make sure both sides

440
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,480
trade safely.

441
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,380
I'm not going on a trip.

442
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,400
Besides,

443
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,590
I have arms and legs.

444
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,550
I can look after myself.

445
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,490
I'm more worried about you.

446
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,630
When Si and I are away,

447
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:00,000
take good care of yourself.

448
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,560
Act your age,

449
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,670
alright?

450
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,000
You'll be going there

451
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,310
all alone.

452
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:07,200
I can't stop

453
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,590
worrying about you.

454
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,470
Who told you I'd go alone?

455
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:19,110
Who's going with you?

456
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,840
Who else?

457
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,760
Is Chuchu going to join you?

458
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,760
I guess.

459
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:33,080
Good for you.

460
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,440
Look at her

461
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,480
willing to

462
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,240
go so far with you.

463
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,350
You should marry her

464
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:39,630
as soon as possible!

465
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:40,750
Be committed.

466
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:41,680
You should learn

467
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,790
from me.

468
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:43,830
Stop nagging.

469
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,280
We have our own plan.

470
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,430
What plan?

471
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,720
You don't need a plan for such things.

472
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,480
You'll leave soon.

473
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,080
Congratulations

474
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,480
on being the Envoy.

475
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:08,800
We can hardly

476
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:11,390
see each other again, right?

477
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,190
I guess.

478
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,480
Is there anything you want to

479
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,400
say to me?

480
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,230
Chuchu,

481
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:34,320
I've been wanting to tell you...

482
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,800
I...

483
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:51,750
No.

484
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,910
What are you going to do next?

485
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:08,950
Me?

486
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,520
The same as before.

487
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,240
It's a big world.

488
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,430
I'll enjoy it as much as possible

489
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,520
and explore it.

490
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,160
I can't be

491
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,280
confined to one place.

492
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,320
It makes sense.

493
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,320
You're a heroine after all.

494
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:30,320
May you

495
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,550
live your best life

496
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:33,720
every day.

497
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,830
Well,

498
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:38,750
Jiang Zhan,

499
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,240
after everything

500
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,630
we went through together,

501
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,580
I realize although I want to

502
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:45,560
be a heroine

503
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,560
and see the world,

504
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,670
I enjoy the most

505
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:52,520
the life as it is

506
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,910
to be with my love

507
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,040
and do what I love.

508
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:03,240
Be with your love

509
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:05,710
and do...

510
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:12,150
No one else is here!

511
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:19,190
You love me?

512
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,350
I love you!

513
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,320
What?

514
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,520
I love you!

515
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:32,040
I didn't get that.

516
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,400
I love you!

517
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,150
I love you! I love you!

518
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:56,910
It's a horse!

519
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,340
(One Year Later)

520
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:51,900
(Earl Dongping's Mansion)

521
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,870
All the ingredients are ready.

522
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,050
I see flowers!

523
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,590
Si loves flower cakes the most.

524
00:31:58,590 --> 00:31:59,630
Add more honey.

525
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,000
Yes, Grandmother.

526
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,560
- We've got everything.
- Good.

527
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,320
I wonder

528
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,440
if she's gained or lost weight.

529
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,960
I miss her dearly.

530
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,000
Will she come back

531
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,960
and leave again?

532
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,190
- Grandmother.
- Grandmother.

533
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,350
Welcome back, girls!

534
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,040
I miss all of you!

535
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,320
We miss you, too.

536
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,200
Have a seat.

537
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,120
Sure.

538
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,000
Over the past year,

539
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,110
I've read a lot of books.

540
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,550
In Yang's Family Prescriptions,

541
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:29,950
I found one for leg problems.

542
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:31,750
I want to try it to treat your legs.

543
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,920
How sweet.

544
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,240
You care so much about me.

545
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,830
You've changed so much

546
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:37,760
since we met last time.

547
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,040
You look more like

548
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,830
a refined scholar

549
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,760
than an ordinary girl.

550
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,150
I'm flattered.

551
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,590
It's all thanks to Si.

552
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,120
Without her,

553
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,320
I wouldn't have taken the first step.

554
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,480
Let bygones be bygones.

555
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:57,080
From now on,

556
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,640
you'll lead a wonderful life.

557
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:00,080
Yinlou greets you, Lady Jiang.

558
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:03,430
Commandant Xie.

559
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,670
Welcome, Commandant Xie.

560
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,160
Yi needs to pound

561
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,910
more flowers to make flower cakes.

562
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,240
Go and help her.

563
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:30,080
What are you waiting for?

564
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,080
Give me a hand.

565
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,190
Sure.

566
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:00,310
Anmou,

567
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:01,920
you're terrible

568
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,080
at making dough.

569
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,240
Look how watery it is.

570
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,480
We're making flower cakes,

571
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,190
not flower paste.

572
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,840
You only talk the talk.

573
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,400
Do it yourself.

574
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,040
No problem. I'll make it.

575
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:15,230
It's so thin.

576
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,150
Add some flour.

577
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,400
Stop, stop, stop!

578
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,070
How much are you going to pour?

579
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,280
How much do you need?

580
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,150
I said add some flour.

581
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,190
A tad would be enough.

582
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:27,000
- I did.
- You poured a whole bag!

583
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,440
I added water, too...

584
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,550
Enough, you two.

585
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:31,190
Look what you two have done.

586
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,320
The dough is

587
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,710
getting bigger and bigger.

588
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:34,630
I know, right?

589
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,440
We can make

590
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,000
enough flower cakes

591
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,560
for everyone in town.

592
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,400
Use more strength.

593
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,080
See? Mother is doing much better.

594
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:08,220
(Taiji Hall, Tiande Hall)

595
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,000
There's something

596
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:46,480
I've kept from you.

597
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,920
We checked it out.

598
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,590
Your mother, Su Ke, was born in Nanwu

599
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,480
before Mr. Su adopted her at the border.

600
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,110
Since then,

601
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,630
you've been bonded with Nanwu.

602
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,960
The Saintess has to
go through life and death.

603
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,000
You must've seen

604
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:06,000
the past before becoming it.

605
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,200
You're right.

606
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:11,310
I rose from death

607
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,230
before having that totem.

608
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,360

610
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,630
of the Saintess.

611
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:45,340
(Yu)

612
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,110
It's Nanwu's ancient spell.

613
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,670
If yearnings overlap,

614
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,790
one may trade one's life

615
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:56,520
for a one-in-a-million chance

616
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,190
to revive one's love.

617
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,080
It was Yu Jin.

618
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,960
He bet his life

619
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:04,750
on the slim chance of changing my fate.

620
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,760
Yes.

621
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,790
He lost not only his life

622
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,350

I saw

656
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:17,190
we built a home in Ling'an.

657

and all our family.

661
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,360
Everyone was there.
