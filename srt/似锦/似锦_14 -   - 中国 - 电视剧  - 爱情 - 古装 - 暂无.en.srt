Mother...

13
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,670
Mother,

14
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,760
I've been lying on my stomach for days.

15
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,920
I could really use a walk.

16
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,760
Without my permission,

17
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,510
you can't leave the Mingyue Chamber.

18
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,400
Resting like this all day

19
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,440
doesn't help me recover.

20
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,790
I've got the word out.

21
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,320
You're in a critical condition.

22
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,670
You've been having a fever and unconscious.

23
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,160
Why?

24
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:40,870
Why?

25
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,230
Do you know the victims include

26
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,680
Yang Shengcai, your cousin,

27
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,040
and the Censor-in-chief's son?

28
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,230
A censor is nothing.

29
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,670
I'm not afraid.

30
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,870
Zhang Sheng was merely

31
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,790
an alienated son of a concubine.

32
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,390
That censor is on Prince Qi's side.

33
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,150
Seizing this chance,

34
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,080
he's brought your uncle's attention
to this case.

35
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,360
Your uncle

36
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,550
wouldn't leave it unsolved.

37
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,870
He ordered Capital Security

38
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:12,990
to investigate it.

39
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,760
Before this case ends,

40
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,600
do not take one step

41
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,670
out of this chamber.

42
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,110
Fine, Mother.

43
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,510
Do you really not know

44
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,550
how the fire started?

45
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,590
I...

46
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,510
I was too drunk that day

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,110
to remember.

48
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,550
Since Prince Qi won't let it go,

49
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,550
I'll give him what he wants.

50
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,360
What are you doing?

51
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,510
Let go of my son!

52
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,680
Mother!

53
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,760
- Let him go!
- What's going on?

54
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,430
Let go of my son...

55
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,440
Hands off!

56
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,310
I'm begging you, sir!

57
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,480
Please let go of Chongyi, sir!

58
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,870
Ma'am,

59
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,800
Grand Princess sent us to bring him over

60
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,320
to treat his leg.

61
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,950
Please step aside.

62
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,880
Or would you rather annoy her

63
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,120
(Shijiu, Grand Princess's Guard)
and the Crown Prince?

64
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,000
Don't threaten us

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,160
just because we're women.

66
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,710
This is Ling'an.

67
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,040
You're in a duke's mansion.

68
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,760
You can't barge in and take him away.

69
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,150
We appreciate Her Highness's kindness.

70
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,470
Honey...

71
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,070
Help our son, honey!

72
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:25,910
Father...

73
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,150
It's my son's honor to be treated

74
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,240
in Her Highness's mansion.

75
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,470
What do you mean, Father?

76
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,310
Sir... Chongyi...!

77
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,390
Father, Father!

78
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,240
Chongyi!

79
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,950
- Chongyi!
- Let me go!

80
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:43,710
Chongyi!

81
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,840
Chongyi!

82
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,040
Honey, help!

83
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,000
Do something.

84
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,800
They can't take away your son like this!

85
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,070
You're a duke after all.

86
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,800
Or is that only an empty title?

87
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,950
Yes, it is!

88
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,390
Are you happy now?

89
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,150
The Grand Princess dominates the court,

90
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,790
and she's backed by the Crown Prince.

91
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,350
I'm a mere figurehead as a duke.

92
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,910
Would I dare provoke her?

93
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,470
What are they going to do to my son?

94
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,120
Tell me!

95
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,880
This is his fate.

96
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:15,590
That black sheep brought it on himself.

97
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,560
At this point,

98
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:21,880
he's on his own.

99
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,640
Risking our clan

100
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,760
and my unborn grandchild

101
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,630
for him isn't worth it.

102
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:35,570
You...

103
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,270
My poor son, Chongyi!

104
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:41,680
Ma'am.

105
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,200
Grand Princess has arrived!

106
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,760
Are you Duke An's third son?

107
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,910
Yes, Your Highness.

108
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,200
Your leg was burned.

109
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,510
No need to kneel.

110
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,350
Rise.

111
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,080
Yes.

112
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,120
Do you know why I had you

113
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,150
brought here?

114
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,910
Thanks for your kindness,

115
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,240
but my family is worried about me.

116
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,950
I should go back soon.

117
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,880
That place was burned.

118
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,880
Only you and Mingyue survived.

119
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,240
The three families of the victims

120
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,080
must be in grief.

121
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,390
The Cui Clan is our family.

122
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,830
The Yangs aren't a problem.

123
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,910
But the Zhangs

124
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,560
refuse to let it go.

125
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,240
They insist on blaming Mingyue

126
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,080
for Zhang Sheng's death.

127
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:08,720
Instead of going after

128
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,240
Duke An's Mansion,

129
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,270
why are they holding us accountable?

130
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,200
Your Highness,

131
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,910
you have to trust me!

132
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,880
All of us were drunk that night.

133
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,430
The... the wind must've

134
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,360
tipped over the candlestick,

135
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,470
causing the fire.

136
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,320
Princess Mingyue and I

137
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,470
are the victims!

138
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,470
That fire was a pure accident.

139
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,120
An unfortunate accident!

140
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,150
The Zhangs didn't believe

141
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,030
it was an accident.

142
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,510
One of you must've

143
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,720
overturned it

144
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,800
by accident

145
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,800
or set the room on fire, drunk.

146
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:54,200
But Mingyue didn't do it.

147
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,880
You're wise.

148
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:58,840
You know that, don't you?

149
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,240
Yes, I understand.

150
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,440
Princess Mingyue didn't do it.

151
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,830
It wasn't her.

152
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,200
It...

153
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:12,320
It wasn't me either.

154
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,000
Not me, Your Highness!

155
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,960
It...

156
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,000
It was Jiang Zhan! Jiang Zhan!

157
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,320
From Earl Dongping's Mansion!

158
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:22,270
Jiang Zhan?

159
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,440
Earl Dongping's Mansion?

160
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,320
Shijiu, go and check.

161
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,040
Yes, Your Highness.

162
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,400
Poor Zhan.

163
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,680
He hadn't married before death.

164
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,560
Let him rest in peace.

165
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,750
The rest of us have to move on.

166
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,470
Mother,

167
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,160
should we start

168
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,750
setting up his funeral?

169
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,200
We haven't found him.

170
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,710
He might still be alive.

171
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,200
You can't wait to hold the funeral.

172
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,710
What are you up to?

173
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,320
I'm devastated by his death, too.

174
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,320
You and your brother were close.

175
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,680
It's hard for you to process it.

176
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,040
But we've been looking for him for a week.

177
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,400
It's almost impossible for him to survive.

178
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,830
As the saying goes,

179
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,910
burial brings peace to the dead.

180
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,560
Only in that way

181
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,440
can the bereaved like us

182
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,230
honor him properly.

183
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,200
However long it takes,

184
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,950
I won't stop until my son's found.

185
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:45,230
Poor Zhan!

186
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,080
We can't let his soul

187
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,520
keep drifting.

188
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:53,230
Hold the funeral soon.

189
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,750
Yes, Mother.

190
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,630
Capital Security and our people

191
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,110
have been searching for days.

192
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,510
Only a shoe has been salvaged.

193
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,990
There's little money left.

194
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,470
I'm afraid it's unlikely to find him.

195
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,470
Mother,

196
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,320
you know,

197
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:14,200
we've spent a fortune

198
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,080
on the search,

199
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,200
and used up almost all our savings.

200
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,520
To continue it,

201
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:21,990
you'll

202
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,870
have to give us more money.

203
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,400
We have to bring him

204
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,990
or his body back.

205
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,830
Find him at all costs.

206
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,400
I'll raise

207
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,200
more money myself.

208
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,560
Don't worry about it, Anmou and Xiao.

209
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,950
Si, say no more.

210
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,630
Let's go on looking for him.

211
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,870
She's so spoiled by you

212
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,110
that she acts

213
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,990
without scruple.

214
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,990
Your brother died because of you!

215
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,080
Grandmother,

216
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,320
what are you talking about?

217
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,630
You killed Zhan!

218
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,680
Ancheng, we had talked about it.

219
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,680
I only hoped

220
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,800
Zhan would stop causing us trouble

221
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,920
and lead a peaceful life

222
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,870
as an earl's son.

223
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,440
But what did you do?

224
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,390
You forced him to learn martial arts.

225
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:17,030
He practiced so hard

226
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,440
that he didn't have time

227
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,280
to eat at the table!

228
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:24,710
He used to go out in the morning

229
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,630
and come back at dusk.

230
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,750
Then he'd come to see me.

231
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,080
But this time,

232
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,350
he sneaked out at night.

233
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,270
He didn't want to come home

234
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:39,000
all because of you!

235
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,200
You killed him!

236
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,110
It was my fault.

237
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:47,720
It was all my fault!

238
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,360
So whatever it takes,

239
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,920
I'll find him!

240
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,950
- Si...
- Bad news! Bad news!

241
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:55,830
Bad news, My Lady!

242
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,280
A group of soldiers have

243
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,950
had our mansion surrounded.

244
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:00,950
Let's go!

245
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:02,340
(Earl Dongping's Mansion)

246
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,590
Who are you?

247
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,360
Chief Iron Guard, Shijiu,

248
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,710
of Grand Princess Rongyang.

249
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,950
Her Highness

250
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,870
sent us to seal Earl Dongping's Mansion.

251
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:12,750
No one goes in or out.

252
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,200
Why did she

253
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,080
give such an order?

254
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,280
Jiang Zhan is the prime suspect

255
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,480
in the Huiyue House Arson Case.

256
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,620
Her Highness sent us to guard

257
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,030
your mansion in case he escapes.

258
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:22,870
Ridiculous!

259
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,590
My brother is the victim.

260
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,230
How could you treat him as a criminal?

261
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,520
Once we find him,

262
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,990
we'll prove you're wrong.

263
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,350
This is for the reputation of your mansion.

264
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:32,920
Don't do anything stupid,

265
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,950
or we will resort to force.

266
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,800
I dare you!

267
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,920
Thanks for Her Highness's kindness.

268
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,950
Hold Lady Jiang back.

269
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,110
Let's go, Mother.

270
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,560
Her Highness's nephew died.

271
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,470
Her only daughter is having a fever

272
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,330
and still unconscious.

273
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,280
This case concerns her family.

274
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,840
That's why she sent us

275
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,680
to help.

276
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,830
An open trial will begin tomorrow.

277
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,630
Her Highness can leave it to us.

278
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:00,990
As for Jiang Zhan,

279
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,600
my men will keep an eye out.

280
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,720
Nothing will go wrong.

281
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,590
Here's a friendly reminder.

282
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,320
Don't overreach yourself

283
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,680
for your own sake.

284
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:11,830
I expect you to be fair and just, Mr. Yu.

285
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,080
Of course.

286
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,200
Let's go!

287
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,830
Thanks for helping us out.

288
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,950
Luckily, I got the news in time.

289
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,840
I'm glad you're fine.

290
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,400
I failed to help Zhan out,

291
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,830
and I kept putting you in danger.

292
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,230
I'm really sorry.

293
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,200
No worries.

294
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,040
It wasn't your fault.

295
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,950
I have a question.

296
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:35,040
What you told me about Jiang Zhan

297
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,070
is more than a dream, isn't it?

298
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,280
Sorry.

299
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,920
I shouldn't have brought that up

300
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,520
and upset you.

301
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,200
I don't have time to be upset.

302
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,590
Zhan is still missing.

303
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,350
The Grand Princess

304
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,110
is going to make him

305
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:56,690
the scapegoat for everything.

306
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,520
- But that night...
- Stick to what I said.

307
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,950
You didn't go there that night.

308
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,630
How could I let them

309
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,200
throw dirt on my brother

310
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,560
just to protect myself?

311
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,870
I believe he also wouldn't want you

312
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,710
to take risks for him.

313
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,320
Let's figure something else out.

314
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,350
Mother,

315
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,590
you said you meant to

316
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,630
marry Si

317
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,320
into the Zhen Mansion, right?

318
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,870
That was only a verbal agreement.

319
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:44,280
The Zhen Clan hasn't proposed.

320
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,080
You saw

321
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,710
how intimidating the Grand Princess was.

322
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,520
Now,

323
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,800
there's not much I can do.

324
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:58,040
I'll marry Si into the family

325
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:01,440
that can protect our clan.

326
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,040
That's so thoughtful of you, Mother.

327
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:09,200
But in that case,

328
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,200
will others judge us,

329
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,830
saying we promise Si

330
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,990
to two families?

331
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,520
We aren't sure if Zhan is still alive.

332
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:22,400
I don't care what others say.

333
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,390
I had you

334
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,920
stay in your courtyard

335
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,870
because you were sick.

336
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,870
I wanted you

337
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,950
to get enough rest.

338
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,630
Now that

339
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,800
you've become much better,

340
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,110
and Si is still too young

341
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,160
after all,

342
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,630
I've had them

343
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,630
fetch the tokens and keys for you.

344
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,990
You'll be in charge of our house.

345
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,640
Sorry to trouble you with that.

346
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,350
No trouble at all, Mother.

347
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,160
Rest assured.

348
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,800
I won't disappoint you.

349
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,630
As long as we work together,

350
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,710
there's nothing we can't get through.

351
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,320
My Lady,

352
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,710
your Soothing Soup.

353
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:16,960
Allow me.

354
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:23,080
Take it while it's hot.

355
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,000
Yu Qi of Capital Security again.

356
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,840
Your Highness...

357
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,680
I'm sorry!

358
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,560
Please spare me!

359
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:44,750
Useless.

360
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,510
- Flog her 20 times outside.
- Yes.

361
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:49,000
I'm sorry! Spare me, please!

362
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,950
How clumsy!

363
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:52,150
The trial will begin soon.

364
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,350
They won't be able to find him.

365
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,470
Everything is going as your plan.

366
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,630
Earl Dongping's Mansion

367
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:01,920
shall be hoisted by their petard.

368
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:16,870
Miss,

369
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,590
we're about to go to court.

370
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,110
Do you have a plan yet?

371
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:27,670
Aman,

372
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,320
I need to see Qiaoniang.

373
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,560
Yes.

374
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,320
Qiaoniang.

375
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,590
I got it.

376
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,720
Aman, guard the door.

377
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,560
Yes.

378
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:02,810
Si,

379
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,720
you look haggard.

380
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,390
Your stomach is huge.

381
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,040
Is the baby due soon?

382
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,480
Let's get you seated.

383
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:15,870
Careful.

384
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:18,910
Let's sit.

385
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,760
Si,

386
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,310
you still treat me

387
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,390
as your sister.

388
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:27,910
I'm ashamed of myself.

389
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,150
Despite what happened to us,

390
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,910
you came to see me so late.

391
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,720
I know for sure

392
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,480
you treat me as your sister, too.

393
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,040
You deserve it.

394
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,430
Ji Chongyi shall be condemned,

395
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,240
having him burned

396
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,190
or drowned to pay

397
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,640
for your brother's suffering!

398
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,800
Qiaoniang,

399
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,280
did he

400
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,080
say anything to you?

401
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,830
A few days ago,

402
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,760
he was forced into Grand Princess's Mansion.

403
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:58,550
Earlier today, I heard

404
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:00,240
she had her guards seal your mansion.

405
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,760
Ji Chongyi

406
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,150
told me about what happened that night

407
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,630
to the last detail.

408
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:08,150
No matter how much Zhan suffered,

409
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:12,110
tell me about it.

410
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,000
That night...

411
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,670
Why didn't the fire

412
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,240
kill all of them that night?

413
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,750
Cui Mingyue is

414
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,320
still alive and kicking

415
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:42,000
while Zhan's body is nowhere to be found.

416
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:43,560
Hadn't it been for me,

417
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,590
you and Ji wouldn't have become enemies.

418
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,800
Cui Mingyue was the one behind everything.

419
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,430
Ji Chongyi wouldn't dare kill others.

420
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,910
But I don't get it.

421
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,110
Why did she

422
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,630
go after my brother

423
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,280
and the Fragrance Shop?

424
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,730
When she was riding in the streets that day,

425
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,310
she and the two of you

426
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,150
had a fight.

427
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,720
Mr. Yu brought her to his office

428
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,000
and almost had her flogged.

429
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,000
She had never felt so humiliated

430
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,670
and held a grudge against you two.

431
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,280
What's the difference

432
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,350
between people and ants?

433
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,910
Perhaps in Cui Mingyue's eyes,

434
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:22,590
my brother's life is

435
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,080
as cheap as an ant's.

436
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,560
However much trouble she caused,

437
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,830
her powerful mother

438
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,040
would clean up the mess.

439
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,440
The Grand Princess

440
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,110
claimed that Cui Mingyue was having a fever

441
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,240
and still unconscious

442
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,590
while having Ji Chongyi

443
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,520
treated in her mansion.

444
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,830
She must've planned

445
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,480
to lay the blame on Zhan for everything.

446
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:44,480
If her plan worked, that'd be great.

447
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:45,590
If not, it'd be

448
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:46,750
Ji Chongyi who framed Zhan,

449
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,720
not Cui Mingyue.

450
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,550
Duke An's Mansion wouldn't dare

451
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,790
act against Her Highness openly.

452
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,670
I don't know how I can help you.

453
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,350
Thanks anyway.

454
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,080
Whatever it takes,

455
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,320
I demand an answer.

456
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,760
I think I know what to do.

457
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,220
(Capital Security Office)
Your Honor,

458
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,480
my brother, Jiang Zhan, is still missing.

459
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,630
I'm here to sue

460
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,670
Ji Chongyi, Zhang Sheng,

461
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,350
Yang Shengcai, Cui Yi, Cui Mingyue,

462
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,440
all five of them

463
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,900
for harming my brother by conspiracy.

464
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,800
Enough of your sheer nonsense!

465
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,190
Jiang Zhan was too drunk to control himself.

466
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,720
He set the house on fire

467
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:31,280
which killed Cui, Zhang,

468
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,280
and Yang.

469
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,430
Although Princess Mingyue

470
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,000
and I survived,

471
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,520
we were badly burned,

472
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,190
Your Honor.

473
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,560
So Jiang Zhan committed arson, drunk.

474
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,070
Do you have any proof?

475
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,280
I'm the witness.

476
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:45,720
Zhan and Princess Mingyue

477
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,590
had never met.

478
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,190
Why did he attend her banquet?

479
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,830
She invited Mr. Zhang

480
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:51,280
to that banquet.

481
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,430
He was a good man.

482
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,720
He knew

483
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:56,320
the Jiangs and I were enemies.

484
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,150
He invited Jiang Zhan over

485
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,040
to play the peacemaker

486
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,830
so that we'd bury the hatchet.

487
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,680
Unexpectedly,

488
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,040
after drinking a few cups,

489
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,560
Jiang Zhan started ranting,

490
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:10,040
calling Zhang Sheng a meddler

491
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,160
and roughing

492
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,040
the kind Mr. Zhang up

493
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,760
before setting that house on fire.

494
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,080
According to you,

495
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,000
he burned that place alone.

496
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,470
So the five of you just let him

497
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,590
when he did it?

498
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,320
Except Princess Mingyue,

499
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,040
the rest of you are

500
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,350
strong young men

501
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,000
who had learned some martial arts.

502
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:30,080
Even if Zhan had three heads and six arms,

503
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,550
couldn't all of you combined

504
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,150
- stop him?
- You...

505
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,110
One on five? He couldn't have won.

506
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,880
Jiang Zhan didn't burn that place.

507
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,720
Princess Mingyue is

508
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,200
the Grand Princess's only daughter.

509
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,480
A humble earl's son

510
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,160
wouldn't dare harm her

511
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,190
no matter how bold he was.

512
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,110
It's hard to say.

513
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,760
A drunk man could be crazy.

514
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,150
Order!

515
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:49,930
What's your explanation?

516
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,400
I didn't say he burned

517
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,110
the place in front of us.

518
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:55,040
After he was kicked out,

519
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,320
he sneaked back and set it on fire

520
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,760
when we were drunk and unconscious.

521
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,040
If all of you were unconscious

522
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,150
when Zhan did it,

523
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:05,670
how did you know

524
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,280
it was him?

525
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,200
I went to the toilet.

526
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,270
When I came back,

527
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,720
I happened to see him

528
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,720
burning the house.

529
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,270
As soon as he saw me,

530
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,670
he jumped into the water to escape

531
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,480
while the fire was raging.

532
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:18,970
It was too late to put it out.

533
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,800
Your Honor, he holds a grudge
against our clan

534
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,720
because I canceled our engagement.

535
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Just now,

536
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,040
he contradicted himself.

537
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,390
His statement doesn't stand.

538
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:28,110
Your Honor,

539
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:30,000
my burned leg

540
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,830
is the most direct evidence.

541
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,480
In the critical situation that night,

542
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,320
all of us panicked.

543
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,670
It's understandable

544
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,180
that I don't remember everything.

545
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:41,670
After days of salvage by your office,

546
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,590
only Jiang Zhan hasn't been found.

547
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:46,520
He must've fled to escape punishment.

548
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,350
Please issue an all-points bulletin

549
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,320
to uphold justice

550
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,560
for the deceased and injured soon!

551
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,280
Your words alone

552
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:58,990
aren't enough to convict Jiang Zhan.

553
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,350
At this stage,

554
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,310
only if we find him

555
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,080
will we know the truth.

556
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,630
Your Honor, he told me

557
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,830
about what happened that night.

558
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:12,060
Do you know where Jiang Zhan is?

559
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,320
Yes.

560
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,480
Impossible!

561
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,000
Hadn't he already...?

562
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,760
What? Why was it impossible?

563
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,280
I knew it.

564
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,520
Your clan claimed that he went missing

565
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,910
after falling into the river,

566
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,560
but you hid him somewhere.

567
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,150
Your Honor, you can't cover for them.

568
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,480
Jiang Si,

569
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,520
where exactly is Jiang Zhan?

570
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,560
Last night, he came to my dream

571
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,480
where he told me everything

572
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,390
with no omission.

573
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:46,380
My brother didn't set that place on fire.

574
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:48,430
I won't allow him to be wronged.

575
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,870
A bolt from the blue indicates injustice!

576
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,720
Who knows Jiang Zhan died

577
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,920
and came to his sister's dream?

578
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:56,670
Could the dead

579
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:58,150
go to others' dreams for help?

580
00:24:58,550 --> 00:24:59,830
Zhang Sheng tricked my brother

581
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:01,080
into going to the Huiyue House.

582
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,270
When he was there,

583
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:04,040
the five of them

584
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,630
tortured him to death!

585
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,430
Animals!

586
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:13,920
- Monsters!
- That princess was evil!

587
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,760
Indeed.

588
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,630
How absurd!

589
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:21,190
The court can't

590
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,830
take her ridiculous dream seriously.

591
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,830
Your Honor, have someone check

592
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,160
the evidence salvaged

593
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,000
that day

594
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,800
and see if there's a duck-shaped censer.

595
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:31,910
Guards,

596
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,000
go now.

597
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,800
Ji Chongyi,

598
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,110
answer my question.

599
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,560
Did you

600
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,110
see that censor at the scene?

601
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,430
I...

602
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,390
I don't remember.

603
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:00,040
Let me help you jog your memory.

604
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,670
When you were done beating my brother,

605
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:04,520
you found that he stopped breathing.

606
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Then you and Cui Yi

607
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,830
threw him into the Jinshui River.

608
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,520
Ji Chongyi,

609
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,560
you killed my brother!

610
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,270
You shall die!

611
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:14,680
No, no!

612
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,590
I didn't kill him.

613
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:16,800
I only kicked him twice.

614
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,070
Princess Mingyue had them

615
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,720
drown Jiang Zhan. It wasn't me!

616
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,680
I didn't kill him!

617
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,040
I didn't do it!

618
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:23,910
Ji Chongyi, how dare you

619
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,670
frame Princess Mingyue!

620
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,280
Did he frame her,

621
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:29,750
or did the Grand Princess's family

622
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,260
abuse their power to kill the innocent?

623
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,830
Can the superior royalty

624
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,630
take others' lives as you please?

625
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,240
You committed crimes

626
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,960
but brazenly made an innocent man

627
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,920
- your scapegoat.
- Right.

628
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,390
How vicious and shameless!

629
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:43,750
Others' lives matter, too!

630
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:44,780
He works for the Princess.

631
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:45,760
Yes, he is.

632
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:46,740
- Order!
- Scram!

633
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,790
You must be evil, too.

634
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:48,630
Order!

635
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,390
This is a court,

636
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,790
not a farmer's market.

637
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:54,600
Although that dream is unusual,

638
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,050
the evidence

639
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:57,870
and the details Jiang Si said

640
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,320
match the facts of this case.

641
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:01,670
Jiang Si,

642
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:04,240
did your brother mention that fire

643
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,200
in your dream?

644
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,040
I...

645
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,920
Remember, you're with me all night.

646
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,000
You didn't go anywhere.

647
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,190
The wind knocked over the candlestick,

648
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,350
causing the fire.

649
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,870
Fire! Fire!

650
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,200
Run! Stop drinking!

651
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,040
Fire!

652
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,190
Run!

653
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,000
- Fire!
- Fire!

654
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,390
Fire!

655
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:32,480
It started burning,

656
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,280
but no one at the banquet moved. Why?

657
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:36,080
Because they were stoned,

658
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,590
thinking the fire wasn't real.

659
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,960
Then Cui Mingyue

660
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,630
jumped out the window first.

661
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:43,880
Zhang Sheng and Cui Yi

662
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,420
got their legs pinned down by the beams.

663
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,630
Yang Sheng couldn't swim

664
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:49,720
and drowned.

665
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,480
When Zhang asked Ji Chongyi for help,

666
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,110
Ji Chongyi ignored him

667
00:27:59,110 --> 00:27:59,960
and escaped alone,

668
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,110
leaving Zhang and Cui

669
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,350
being burned to death.

670
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,110
Guards, call the coroner.

671
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:12,660
Your Honor,

672
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,720
there are traces of liquor

673
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,040
being burned in Zhang's abdomen.

674
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,830
Yang and Cui's families

675
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,110
said no autopsies.

676
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,620
The causes of their deaths are unknown.

677
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,240
Zhang's and Cui's deaths

678
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,110
are the result of smoke inhalation

679
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,760
while Yang Shengcai drowned.

680
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,150
They all match.

681
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,560
Unbelievable!

682
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,590
Jiang Zhan's soul

683
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,080
- must've seen it
- He's innocent!

684
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,520
and told Miss Si in her dream.

685
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:35,630
Ji Chongyi,

686
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,080
at this point,

687
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,240
stop telling lies.

688
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:40,910
Did all of you torture Jiang Zhan to death?

689
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,590
If you believe a ghost,

690
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,820
this shouldn't be the Capital Security Office

691
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:46,110
but the Judge of Death's Office.

692
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:47,960
Instead of having you judge the case,

693
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,990
wouldn't it be easier to hire a shaman

694
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:50,800
to talk to the dead?

695
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:51,910
Yes.

696
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,910
Yes. That's right.

697
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,520
There isn't such a thing as ghost.

698
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,550
Your office

699
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:56,580
must've been bought over.

700
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,800
You and Jiang Si

701
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,590
made up such a story.

702
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,960
If you don't believe in ghosts,

703
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:06,000
why did you confess just now

704
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:08,240
that they tortured Jiang Zhan to death

705
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,510
before Jiang Mingyue had them

706
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:12,310
throw him into the Jinshui River,

707
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,670
but you only kicked him twice?

708
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:18,430
Jiang Si messed with my head,

709
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,030
making me ramble!

710
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:22,040
Ramble?

711
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,960
Ji Chongyi, you're in court.

712
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,270
Every word you say

713
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,390
is documented.

714
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,280
Don't try to deny it.

715
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,480
If you convict me

716
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,870
simply based on a ridiculous dream

717
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,400
instead of solid evidence,

718
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,550
it's unfair.

719
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:35,430
Unfair?

720
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:39,480
You want solid evidence, huh?

721
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,040
There he is.

722
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,920
Why is he soaking wet?

723
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,000
There was no rain.

724
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,840
Right.

725
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,440
Ghost! Ghost!

726
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,390
A ghost!

727
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:24,280
Ghost! Ghost!

728
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:29,390
Ji Chongyi,

729
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,390
tell the truth,

730
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:34,000
or I'll drag you to hell with me.

731
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,750
Go away! I didn't kill you!

732
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,200
It had nothing to do with me.

733
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,310
It was... it was Princess Mingyue!

734
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,880
She told me to do that.

735
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,160
Grand Princess didn't want her

736
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,720
to appear in court

737
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,640
and forced me to lie.

738
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,590
Princess Mingyue

739
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:50,640
didn't faint.

740
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,060
Take revenge on her. Leave me alone!

741
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:54,000
Don't come to me. I swear...

742
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,280
I didn't do anything!

743
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:56,630
Spare me, please!

744
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,480
Don't kill me!

745
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,640
I'm begging you!

746
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,520
Spare me!

747
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:06,950
Zhan...

748
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:17,590
You're back!

749
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,680
Is Young Master Zhan

750
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,960
a human or a ghost?

751
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:26,110
That court upholds justice for humans.

752
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,750
Can it do the same

753
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:29,430
for ghosts?

754
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,190
Don't leave us hanging.

755
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,110
Don't spoil our appetite!

756
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,480
- Yes.
- Right.

757
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:35,430
How about this?

758
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:37,240
I'll pay for the next chapter.

759
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,240
Finish the story.

760
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,910
Yes, tell us now.

761
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,320
- Say it.
- What happened next

762
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,110
will be told in the ensuing chapter.

763
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,480
Father.

764
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:12,670
Father!

765
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,960
Father!

766
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,720
Zhan...

767
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:28,110
Zhan!

768
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,390
Zhan!

769
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,960
Zhan!

770
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,110
- Father!
- Is it you, Zhan?

771
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,800
I'm back.

772
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,190
That's great.

773
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,000
I'm so glad you're back!

774
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,080
Father!

775
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:59,750
Slow down. Don't choke on it.

776
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,110
- It's so good.
- Have some water.

777
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,320
By the way,

778
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:06,800
have all your injuries

779
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:08,110
healed?

780
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,240
Right.

781
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,960
Shall we call a physician

782
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,440
to check him again just in case?

783
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,280
Sure.

784
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,280
No need. I've fully recovered.

785
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,430
Look.

786
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,440
Rest for a few more days

787
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,900
and I'll be as strong as an ox again.

788
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,560
Besides,

789
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,960
those losers

790
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,350
couldn't have broken me.

791
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,390
I'd be fine even if there were more of them.

792
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,320
Listen to yourself

793
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:36,870
talking big.

794
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:40,630
Alright, tell us

795
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,790
how you managed to survive

796
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:44,240
and had a narrow escape.

797
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,320
I played dead.

798
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:50,480
Played dead?

799
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,960
They wanted me dead, right?

800
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,000
So I faked it.

801
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,480
They couldn't have

802
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,560
brought me back from death.

803
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,630
Your Grace, he's dead.

804
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:05,910
What to do?

805
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,080
Toss him into the river

806
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,880
to leave no trace behind.

807
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,600
Unexpectedly,

808
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:12,960
those animals

809
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,750
meant to get rid of my body.

810
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,710
I had never known

811
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,710
the Jinshui River was that deep.

812
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:20,480
When I almost drowned,

813
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,880
I heard you calling me

814
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,310
and moved my body like crazy.

815
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,270
But I became exhausted

816
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,040
before reaching the surface.

817
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:28,400
I thought

818
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,040
I could never see you two again.

819
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:33,790
That was the last thing I knew.

820
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,800
Then

821
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,150
who saved your life?

822
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,440
It was me, of course,

823
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,280
who saved him.

824
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,320
Actually, Qi figured out your location

825
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,560
and had me check downstream.

826
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,710
Brilliant!

827
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,590
You bet. Don't you know who I am?

828
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,000
I gave him food and water.

829
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,040
I even caught fish.

830
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,360
Why didn't you come back

831
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,840
as soon as you were saved?

832
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,070
I almost died of grief

833
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:02,480
because of you!

834
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,680
Father,

835
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,960
I wished to grow wings

836
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,080
to come back at once,

837
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,520
but I was injured back then.

838
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:10,470
Plus,

839
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,150
the mountain path was muddy.

840
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,590
What are you doing?

841
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,160
Treat your injury.

842
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,280
What is that?

843
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,230
Will it hurt?

844
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,320
A little bit.

845
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,720
Bear with it.

846
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,670
Easy...

847
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:20,040
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

848
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,440
If you can feel it,

849
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:25,790
you'll recover soon.

850
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,270
How come a girl like you

851
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,080
presses so hard?

852
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,030
Press it yourself.

853
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,230
You shouldn't touch me.

854
00:36:58,510 --> 00:36:59,520
Hold it.

855
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,400
Don't drop it.

856
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,600
Understand?

857
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,880
Fine.

858
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:22,390
We'll

859
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,040
rest here tonight.

860
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,840
Here?

861
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,040
I've barely survived.

862
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:31,840
If I stay the night here,

863
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:34,310
I'll end up dead.

864
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:35,690
Spit it. Don't curse yourself.

865
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,310
I don't want to die with you.

866
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,800
Wait here.

867
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:44,610
I'll go catch a fish.

868
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,230
I'll go with you.

869
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:47,550
You?

870
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:48,990
Stay here.

871
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:51,040
If you get injured again,

872
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:52,230
things will be even worse.

873
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,600
I'm fine.

874
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:56,990
Besides,

875
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,560
I have no more medicine.

876
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,920

Come on. Let's go.

905
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,520
- Sure.
- I got you.

906
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,280
Slowly.

907
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,800
Slowly.

908
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,160
What's wrong?

909
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,360
Does it hurt again?

910
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:24,830
- Where? Let me see.
- Here.

911
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:26,070
Here.

912
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:27,230
- It's poking me.
- Where?

913
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,160
What's this?

914
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,040
I carved it

915
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:39,440
to kill time last night. Here you go.

916
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:45,550
Jiang Zhan, I didn't know

917
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:47,190
you had deft hands.

918
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:53,110
What's so funny?

919
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:55,350
What is it?

920
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:57,030
Nothing.

921
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:00,110
Is that a cow or a horse?

922
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:06,360
The pig

923
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:08,310
looks cute.

924
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:11,030
Give me.

925
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:15,630
It's a horse!

926
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:18,110
A miniature of your horse!

927
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,110
When the Fragrance Shop opened,

928
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,760
you gave that horse you carved

929
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,000
to my sister.

930
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:29,080
A horse, huh?

931
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,800
Fine. It'll be

932
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,040
my new amulet.

933
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:39,390
Well...

934
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:41,310
thank you

935
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:43,430
for saving my life.

936
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,680
Don't mention it.

937
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:54,030
Had it been

938
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:55,480
a dog

939
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,150
in the water that day,

940
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,730
I would've done the same.

941
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:01,670
When my condition became better,

942
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,480
I had Chuchu bring me back.

943
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:05,480
As soon as we entered the city,

944
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,800
I heard everyone in town

945
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,270
talking about the open trial in court.

946
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,820
We asked around about it.

947
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:11,110
Chuchu was so smart.

948
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,240
She told me

949
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,360
to play a ghost

950
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,400
and go there.

951
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,200
What about

952
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,480
the blood covering your face?

953
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:27,390
Clever, huh?
