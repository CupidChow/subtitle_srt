(Yangui)

12
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:10,910
You go first.

13
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,000
Baoping, how many days has it been?

14
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,430
Your Majesty,

15
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,560
more than three days.

16
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,910
By now,

17
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,520
Jin should've already met with Cui Xu.

18
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,800
Your Majesty,

19
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,030
General Cui is loyal and upright.

20
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,570
Once he hears the news,

21
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,400
he'll surely rush to protect you.

22
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,080
Cui Xu may be loyal and upright,

23
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,360
but he would never abandon

24
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,840
the people at the border

25
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,240
just to save me.

26
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,710
He fears no authority
and is only concerned

27
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,800
about the well-being of the people.

28
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,280
To him,

29
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,630
as long as the border remains secure

30
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,910
and the people are safe,

31
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,190
nothing else matters.

32
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,560
What?

33
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,750
Rongyang is rebelling?

34
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,040
And Marquis Changxing.

35
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,520
That's impossible.

36
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,680
Marquis Changxing may be ambitious,

37
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:21,830
but he has fought

38
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,870
alongside His Majesty for years.

39
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:24,870
Why would he rebel?

40
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,870
Everything I said is true.

41
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,100
Please return to Ling'an with me
to rescue His Majesty.

42
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,600
I know that's the top priority now.

43
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,640
However,

44
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,850
as you've seen along the way,

45
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,390
the border situation is dire.

46
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,710
Longgu Pass is easy to defend
but hard to attack.

47
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,270
The Nanwu forces launch constant raids,

48
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,120
and our soldiers are already exhausted.

49
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,480
If we divert

50
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,000
any more troops

51
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,360
to return with your Chiyu Cavalry

52
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,660
to rescue His Majesty in Ling'an,

53
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:51,970
then within three days,

54
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,560
the border will fall,

55
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,090
and the nation will be lost.

56
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,160
Forgive me, but I cannot comply.

57
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,470
(List)
These are the officials opposing you.

58
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,720
Prince Qi is indeed helping you

59
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,310
stabilize the old ministers.

60
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,270
Most of them have pledged allegiance.

61
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,040
If Prince Qi knew I had no intention

62
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,040
of supporting him for the throne,

63
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,490
how do you think he would react?

64
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,870
Marquis Changxing,

65
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,070
why has there never been

66
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,160
a Queen in Dazhou?

67
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:19,800
In my opinion,

68
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,270
it won't be long

69
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,430
before there is one.

70
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,600
At first,

71
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,550
I truly had no such ambition.

72
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,600
Thank you for reminding me of that.

73
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:37,240
However, you've never said

74
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,120
what it is that you want.

75
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,920
I ask for nothing,

76
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,360
only to dedicate

77
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,510
my life to you.

78
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,320
Marquis, sit.

79
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,630
Rest assured.

80
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,360
I will not treat you unfairly.

81
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,160
You'll have power

82
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:59,480
second only to one, above all others.

83
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,600
Thank you, Your Highness.

84
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,390
Father is in danger.

85
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,460
He cannot delay any longer.

86
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,120
If the Grand Princess

87
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,160
truly intends to kill him,

88
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,750
the throne will change hands,

89
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,310
and the nation will be lost too.

90
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,090
Your Highness, please rise.

91
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,290
Given the current situation,

92
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,560
I have

93
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,720
but one choice.

94
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,680
What if I told you that the crisis

95
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,680
at the border can be resolved?

96
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,750
Your Highness,

97
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,160
how do you propose to resolve it?

98
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,390
With the help of my wife, Jiang Si.

99
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:39,910
Ridiculous.

100
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,830
How could a mere woman

101
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,600
make an entire army retreat?

102
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,240
You may not know

103
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,630
that Jiang Si is the Saintess of Nanwu.

104
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,440
Right over there.

105
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,940
(Hunting Order)

106
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,510
Isn't she Su Ke's daughter?

107
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:04,800
How did she become
the Saintess of Nanwu?

108
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,430
I don't know the details either,

109
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,920
but she bears the totem of the Saintess.

110
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,470
Nanwu has troops stationed at the border

111
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,000
for the sole purpose of rescuing her.

112
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,920
Now that she has returned,

113
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,390
they have no reason

114
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,400
to wage war again.

115
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,510
General, please trust me this time.

116
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,240
What do you think

117
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,290
about my ascension to the throne?

118
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:29,480
The sooner, the better.

119
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:32,120
Delays bring unforeseen changes.

120
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,390
However,

121
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,270
someone is joining forces
with other officials

122
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,430
to impeach me.

123
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,040
Tell me.

124
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,190
Should I root him out?

125
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,400
Of course.

126
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,560
Your Highness, you're right.

127
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,310
The top priority now is to eliminate

128
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,190
dissidents and uproot threats.

129
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:54,000
Only then can the enthronement ceremony

130
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:55,420
proceed smoothly in five days.

131
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,630
Let's do as you say.

132
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,260
(Mount Shenjian, Nanwu)
Jiang Si,

133
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:17,560
this totem is identical
to the one on your neck.

134
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,070
Grand Elder,

135
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,000
long time no see.

136
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,970
Who dares trespass upon the sacred area?

137
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:35,080
Everything here is still the same.

138
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,030
Has your old leg injury
gotten any better?

139
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,080
We've never met before.

140
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,080
How do you know

141
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,390
about my leg injury?

142
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:01,460
(Zhou)

143
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:02,990
Chief,

144
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,560
General Cui is avoiding us
under the pretext of military duties.

145
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,010
The main tent has been left to us.

146
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,260
It's obvious that he doesn't want
to go with us.

147
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,300
What should we do, Chief?

148
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,360
What should we do?

149
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:12,990
We have to wait.

150
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:32,820
His Majesty has ordered me

151
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,000
to lead the border troops

152
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,790
and the Chiyu Cavalry to attack Nanwu

153
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:37,750
and fight to the death.

154
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:41,200
We cannot return
until Nanwu is defeated.

155
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,600
What?

156
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,240
This is the imperial edict.

157
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:47,460
If this is the Grand Princess
and Marquis Changxing's decision,

158
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,600
don't you think that it seems

159
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,620
much more reasonable now?

160
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,030
Miss Jiang, Miss Jiang.

161
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,080
This is great.

162
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,800
I'm glad you're back.

163
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:03,200
Grand Elder, she is the Saintess.

164
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:04,860
The Saintess?

165
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,210
She is the Saintess?

166
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,670
How do you know she is the Saintess?

167
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,200
How can you prove it?

168
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,320
Welcome, Saintess.

169
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,480
May Nanwu be blessed. Welcome, Saintess.

170
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,080
The Saintess is here. Everyone, come.

171
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:34,750
May Nanwu be blessed. Welcome, Saintess.

172
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:38,270
May Nanwu be blessed. Welcome, Saintess.

173
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:41,870
May Nanwu be blessed. Welcome, Saintess.

174
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,670
May Nanwu be blessed. Welcome, Saintess.

175
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,960
Grand Elder, please rise.

176
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:48,750
I have come back

177
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,120
with an important matter

178
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:52,720
to discuss with you.

179
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,480
Once this order is given,

180
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,030
the South will be drenched in blood.

181
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,030
Even so,

182
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,790
will you still refuse
to rescue the Emperor?

183
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:02,120
Defying an imperial edict
punishable by death.

184
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,870
A general outside is not bound
by imperial commands.

185
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,510
Yu Jin,

186
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,200
is it true that Rongyang has rebelled?

187
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,440
I know that Nanwu

188
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,720
stationed troops at the border

189
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,240
because I was imprisoned.

190
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,230
But now,

191
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,510
I have returned,

192
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,760
so Nanwu has no reason
to start war anymore.

193
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,080
Grand Elder, please order

194
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,860
the withdrawal of the border forces.

195
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,720
You've just returned to Nanwu,

196
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,030
yet you are speaking for Dazhou.

197
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,440
If we withdraw now,

198
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,440
and Dazhou attacks again,

199
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,720
Nanwu will fall

200
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,080
into an irreversible situation.

201
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,200
Grand Elder,

202
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,030
I am not speaking for either side.

203
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,460
I swear by the name of the Saintess:

204
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,100
If Nanwu withdraws its troops,

205
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,460
Dazhou's army will retreat

206
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,670
within half a day.

207
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:16,750
Report.

208
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:18,820
Report.

209
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,130
General, Nanwu has somehow
withdrawn all its troops.

210
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,070
Are you sure?

211
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,440
General, it's absolutely true.

212
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:24,510
Long Dan.

213
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:26,910
Go tell Mr. Zhen

214
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,790
that we are leaving immediately.

215
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,920
- Yes.
- Pass the order.

216
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,000
We'll go rescue His Majesty
in Ling'an immediately.

217
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,840
Yes.

218
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,750
Yes, Your Highness.

219
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,120
News from the front lines.

220
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,750
The Dazhou forces have indeed withdrawn.

221
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,800
Excellent.

222
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,360
The Saintess's foresight

223
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,870
will guide Nanwu down the right path.

224
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,150
You will surely lead us

225
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,480
to destroy Dazhou.

226
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,870
Dazhou's border is unguarded now.

227
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,840
It's the perfect time to strike.

228
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,440
Saintess, I assume

229
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,840
you will stay with us in Nanwu

230
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,440
and lead us to wipe out Dazhou.

231
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,230
Grand Elder,

232
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,320
war will not

233
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:12,720
revive Nanwu.

234
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,960
I've seen

235
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,320
the aftermath of war.

236
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,630
In that vision,

237
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,200
Nanwu used war

238
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,040
to solve its problems

239
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,080
and killed the Emperor of Dazhou

240
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,870
during the Mid-Autumn Hunt.

241
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,430
Are you saying

242
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,510
what will happen
after the successful assassination?

243
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,200
Yes.

244
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,510
You've always thought

245
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,080
that killing Emperor Jingming

246
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,220
would solve the problem,

247
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,900
but Dazhou will have a new Emperor.

248
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,420
The new Emperor will be incompetent,

249
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,990
and the Grand Princess will hold power.

250
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,870
She'll issue a decree

251
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:39,710
to annihilate Nanwu,

252
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,320
and you'll have to send the Nightingale

253
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,870
to Ling'an to kill the Grand Princess.

254
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,670
We and Dazhou
can't thrive simultaneously.

255
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,080
Nanwu

256
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,910
has limited resources.

257
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,910
Nanwu and Dazhou fight

258
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,670
to develop themselves

259
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,900
while suppressing each other.

260
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,800
Grand Elder,

261
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:57,750
I have a way

262
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,510
to stop this senseless cycle.

263
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,320
Please gather the clan tomorrow.

264
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:03,510
I will announce

265
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,270
the true way to revive Nanwu.

266
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,440
Mr. Zhen, is that you?

267
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,390
Yes.

268
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,130
Recently, the Palace has been preparing

269
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:28,970
for the ritual sacrifices
to heaven and earth,

270
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,440
the ancestral temple, and the state.

271
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:32,700
But I feel this is not as simple
as it seems.

272
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,340
Ritual sacrifices to heaven and earth,

273
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,550
the ancestral temple, and the state?

274
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,920
This is bad.

275
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,470
That's the enthronement ceremony.

276
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:41,070
It's necessary to ascend to the throne.

277
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,300
It seems the Grand Princess

278
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,460
really plans to usurp the throne.

279
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:45,960
If that's the case,

280
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,000
all of us who oppose her

281
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,550
won't be able to survive.

282
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,200
What should we do?

283
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,740
Have Jin and the troops returned yet?

284
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,220
I'm afraid they won't make it in time.

285
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,520
Your Highness,

286
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,480
the stubborn officials

287
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,910
who refused to submit

288
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,390
have been dealt with.

289
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,910
Only one remains.

290
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,590
Who?

291
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,630
It's Zhen Heng,
the first one to join forces

292
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,060
with others against you.

293
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,790
I almost forgot

294
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:22,200
there's this stubborn hard nut to crack.

295
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,900
(Peace and Prosperity)

296
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,150
The Palace is dangerous now.

297
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,720
I've found a way

298
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,900
to send you out of the Palace.

299
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,170
I've packed everything for you.

300
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,780
(Sunshine and Luxury)
You leave tonight.

301
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,550
Mother, I won't leave.

302
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,120
Fuqing, you can't be willful now.

303
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,240
Didn't you always say

304
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:38,610
you wanted to see the world?

305
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:39,790
You have the chance now.

306
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:40,630
Don't you want to go?

307
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,240
Mother, I'm not being willful.

308
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,910
I've grown up.

309
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,270
I'm no longer the little girl

310
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,510
who used to cry

311
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:48,360
hiding in the closet.

312
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,550
I must stay in the Palace,

313
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,750
so I can send messages to Mr. Zhen

314
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,360
and protect you.

315
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,270
No matter what you say,

316
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:57,960
I will never run away on my own.

317
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:06,340
(Sunshine and Luxury)

318
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,360
- Stop.
- Stop.

319
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,490
There are so many people.

320
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,350
Who are you?

321
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,840
Sir, we are a trading convoy
from the north.

322
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,900
- Please let us through.
- From the north?

323
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,600
I can tell from your accent

324
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,870
that you're from the south.

325
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,550
Sir, I wouldn't dare to joke about this.

326
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,230
Here.

327
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,240
Look at your calluses.

328
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,550
You must've been a soldier.

329
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:30,910
As for those behind you,

330
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:32,910
none of them look like porters.

331
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,960
Someone, investigate.

332
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,380
(Ling'an)

333
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,440
Stop.

334
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,790
- Prince Qi.
- Prince Qi.

335
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,720
What's going on?

336
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,110
Prince Qi,

337
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,790
I found this convoy suspicious.

338
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,000
We've arrested them

339
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:14,540
to hand over to the Grand Princess.

340
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:15,510
Leave them to me.

341
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,920
- Take them away.
- Go.

342
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,760
Wait.

343
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,110
Prince Qi, I...

344
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,110
Didn't I just capture them?

345
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:27,840
- Yes.
- Yes.

346
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,320
Let them go.

347
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:46,220
(Ling'an)

348
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,110
Greetings, Saintess.

349
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:57,070
Signs from heaven
can guide all to see the future.

350
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,960
Nothing between heaven and earth

351
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,540
is more valuable than humans.

352
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:05,200
When war ends, Nanwu will thrive,
and the world will be at peace.

353
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,960
Saintess, throughout Nanwu's history,

354
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:09,460
there has only been war, never peace.

355
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,320
That's right.

356
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,480
The people of Nanwu

357
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,480
are born for battle.

358
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,790
Compared to Dazhou,

359
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,580
Nanwu is small and sparsely populated,

360
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,230
but every soldier is skilled in battle.

361
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,390
We take

362
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,960
what we need by force.

363
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,280
It's that simple.

364
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,350
Leader Bai,

365
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,270
no one is born for war.

366
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,590
People are born to live better lives.

367
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,890
If we could live
in peace and prosperity,

368
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:31,030
who would want to fight
on the battlefield?

369
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:32,390
I know

370
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,930
that Nanwu has prioritized war

371
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,480
for the past century.

372
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,000
This cannot be changed overnight.

373
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,160
But since Nanwu has chosen me,

374
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,590
made me the Saintess,

375
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:43,700
and given me the ability
to foresee the future,

376
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,160
I am willing to work with all of you

377
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,440
to turn the beautiful future

378
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,510
I have foreseen

379
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:48,880
into reality.

380
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,960
So, what should we do?

381
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,560
Grand Elder,

382
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,370
let's set one year as a trial period.

383
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,480
In this year,

384
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:00,440
I will stay in Nanwu.

385
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,240
Without starting a single war,

386
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,400
we will achieve
unprecedented prosperity.

387
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,680
What if you fail?

388
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,350
After one year,

389
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,110
if everyone still believes

390
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,880
that war is the best path,

391
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,510
I will lead the charge myself.

392
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,880
Yes, Saintess.

393
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,640
Yes, Saintess.

394
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,880
It's a pity, Mr. Zhen,

395
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,550
that your loyalty

396
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:19,960
cannot save you.

397
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,590
It will only bring harm.

398
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,830
You and those officials

399
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:26,070
have gone to great lengths
to impeach me,

400
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,160
but in the end, it was all in vain.

401
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:33,110
I dared to kill the Crown Prince,

402
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,960
let alone you officials.

403
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,550
In my eyes,

404
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,480
you are nothing but flies

405
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,640
and ants.

406
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:50,240
Death is nothing to be afraid of.

407
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,270
I've seen many people like you

408
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,310
in Capital Security.

409
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,790
You've failed His Majesty's trust

410
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,310
and don't deserve to be

411
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:04,200
the Grand Princess of Dazhou.

412
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,590
Zhen Heng,

413
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,480
you're too bold.

414
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:17,440
No wonder I couldn't find

415
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,830
Earl Dongping's family.

416
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,640
So, they're hiding here with you.

417
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,350
Very well.

418
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,110
I've changed my mind.

419
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,030
I only intended to wipe out

420
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,680
Earl Dongping's family.

421
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,680
But now it seems

422
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,350
your family cannot be left out.

423
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:40,160
Rongyang, how dare you?

424
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,160
Crimes will bring divine retribution.

425
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,830
Zhen Heng has spoken out of turn

426
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,830
and disrespected me.

427
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,200

479
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,160
you were returning to Ling'an,

he came to see me.

481
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,640
How dare you speculate about this?

482
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:46,830
I know very well

483
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,350
that you're not

484
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,310
someone heartless.

485
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,160
What you have done

486
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,110
is to win His Majesty's trust,

487
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,720
to display your talents,

488
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:56,500
and to seek the prosperity of Dazhou.

489
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,720
All of these actions

490
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,200
are justifiable.

491
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,920
In my view,

492
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:02,720
this moment is

493
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:06,270
the perfect opportunity
to fulfill your ambitions.

494
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,790
Instead of rebelling
with the Grand Princess,

495
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,790
you should stabilize her for us now.

496
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,280
I know

497
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,640
the Grand Princess will never let me go,

498
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,440
so first,

499
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,070
Prince Qi,

500
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,070
please protect yourself.

501
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,250
Later,

502
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:25,310
when I'm unable to do anything,

503
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:30,440
Prince Qi, please

504
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:33,830
help the 7th Prince.

505
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,720
Why are you so certain

506
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,480
that I won't tell the Grand Princess

507
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,880
about what happened tonight?

508
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,510
That day in the hall,

509
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,350
you were there, and so was I.

510
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,440
Since I dared to come today,

511
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,720
it means I believe that you

512
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:07,240
have made your decision.

513
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:12,670
Thank you, Zhang.

514
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,200
Our time is limited.

515
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,140
Tomorrow is the enthronement ceremony.

516
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,840
We must stop the Grand Princess

517
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,210
and rescue Father before that.

518
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:21,250
I've made some inquiries.

519
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,790
The Palace is filled with Speed Guards,

520
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:24,880
and outside are the troops
of Marquis Changxing.

521
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,440
So, our top priority is to find a way

522
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,780
to defeat a larger force
with a smaller one.

523
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,680
What if we turn our people

524
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,400
into Speed Guards?

525
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,740
Are you saying

526
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,640
we can find an equal number
of Speed Guards

527
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,720
to match the Chiyu Cavalry,

528
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,920
- and replace them?
- Yes.

529
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,780
Good idea.

530
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:42,270
The Palace guards are fixed in number.

531
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:43,620
With two forces in an attack,

532
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,760
we'll seize the high ground.

533
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:45,940
Once we control the heights,

534
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,040
the ground will be clear.

535
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,160
But that's not enough.

536
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:51,000
We need someone
to balance Marquis Changxing,

537
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,520
or he'll come back at us.

538
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:55,070
I'm willing to do that.

00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,270
Give His Majesty a seat.

566
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,350
Why? You don't want to sit?

567
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:18,550
Bring them here.

568
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:27,630
Father.

569
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,580
Your Majesty.

570
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:29,430
Your Majesty.

571
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:30,590
- Father.
- Your Majesty.

572
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:33,030
Rongyang, what are you doing?

573
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:35,590
Look, everyone's here.

574
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,550
I have no choice but to ask

575
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:39,550
these people you care about
to persuade you.

576
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:41,550
You wouldn't want

577
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:43,160
to watch them die

578
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,480
right in front of you

579
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,790
for an imperial edict, right?

580
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:49,430
Rongyang,

581
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,000
how can you

582
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,110
be so ruthless?

583
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,880
It's not too late
for you to realize that.

584
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:57,870
Come on.

585
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,150
Bring the incense.

586
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:04,830
One stick per person.

587
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:08,000
When the incense burns out,

588
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,480
one of them will die.

589
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:13,400
If you haven't made your choice by then,

590
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:16,270
I will do it for you.

591
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,840
Switch positions.

592
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,860
(Zhou)

593
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,800
Zhang,

594
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,680
take me to the inner hall

595
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,760
to meet with Aunt.

596
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:19,580
What reason is there

597
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,400
to ensure the Grand Princess

598
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:22,980
will meet with me?

599
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,070
This is the Imperial Seal,

600
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:34,100
which His Majesty asked me
in times of crisis

601
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,900
to hand over to you.

602
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:40,150
Please keep it well, Your Highness.

603
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:44,590
Your Majesty,

604
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:46,400
the time has come.

605
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,880
Have you made your choice?

606
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:52,000
Now,

607
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:54,880
let me do it for you.

608
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:18,400
Father... Father...

609
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,920
Your Highness!

610
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:22,830
Your Highness!

611
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,200
Your Highness!

612
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,190
Your Majesty,

613
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,400
the second incense stick has started.

614
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:55,590
Let them go.

615
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,800
You still can't make up your mind?

616
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,110
In this life,

617
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,030
only I would risk my life

618
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,880
to save you.

619
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,280
Are you waiting for Yu Jin to save you?

620
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,960
Yu Jin is now in a dilemma.

621
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:39,650
Even if he comes,

622
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,280
it's a dead end.

623
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,150
Moreover,

624
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,670
he hates you even more

625
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:46,920
than I do.

626
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:56,910
- What's wrong?
- Marquis,

627
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:58,730
someone has replaced
our guards at the tower.

628
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,490
The enemy has infiltrated
into the Palace.

629
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:01,030
What?

630
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:03,110
These useless fools.

631
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,920
You guys stay.

632
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,760
The rest, listen up.

633
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,710
Go save the Emperor.

634
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,550
Yes.

635
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,230
Escort me

636
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:19,500
out of the Palace.

637
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:20,350
Yes.

638
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,230
It's you.

639
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,070
Marquis Changxing,

640
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:35,880
if the Grand Princess knows

641
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,840
that you abandoned her

642
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,190
when things went wrong,

643
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:39,800
she'll be very disappointed.

644
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:44,800
Jiang, you brat.

645
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:46,800
How dare you touch me?

646
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,230
Do you want to die?

647
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:49,890
The one who wants to die is you.

648
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:52,760
Plotting against the Emperor
is punishable by death.

649
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:05,470
Come.

650
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:06,550
Seize him.

651
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,000
Hand over the Tiger Tally,

652
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:15,900
or you'll be executed on the spot.

653
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,890
Tell the Grand Princess

654
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,950
that I seek an audience.

655
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,480
Your Majesty, you must've

656
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,180
been used to being an Emperor.

657
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,110
You're so calm in times of crisis.

658
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,360
This is something I should

659
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,630
learn from you.

660
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,800
Shijiu.

661
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,230
Come at me. Come at me.

662
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,760
You are family.

663
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,360
Why harm each other?

664
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,150
Give me a chance to swear loyalty!

665
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,320
Your Majesty.

666
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:07,880
In my next life, I will still serve you.

667
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:11,440
Who do you think you are?

668
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,960
Do you think you deserve it?

669
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:14,480
Prince Qi is here.

670
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,400
Shijiu.

671
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:21,360
I'm tired.

672
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:22,960
You go tell him

673
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,360
to report to me tomorrow.

674
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,120
Aunt,

675
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,480
I've found the Imperial Seal.

676
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:37,880
Tell him to come in.

677
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:55,400
Greetings, Your Highness.

678
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:00,840
Everyone is here tonight.

679
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,590
Bring me the seal.

680
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,600
Yes.

681
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:09,990
Your Highness.

682
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:12,630
Yu Jin,

683
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,840
do you really think

684
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:17,110
this can reverse the situation?

685
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,400
How ridiculous.

686
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,230
My people have surrounded

687
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,630
the Palace.

688
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:25,400
None of you will leave alive.

689
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,680
Guards!

690
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:36,280
Look, they are all mine.

691
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:38,480
Yu Jin, you're done for.

692
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,600
Is that so?

693
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,800
Aunt,

694
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:47,110
look over there.

695
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,840
Sorry for being late.
I should be punished.

696
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:17,630
Cui, please rise.

697
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,700
Thank you, Your Majesty.

698
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:22,990
Let her go.

699
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:24,270
- Father, no.
- Let her go.

700
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,800
Rongyang,

701
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,800
out of our sibling bond,

702
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,670
I'll give you one more chance.

703
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:39,440
If you plead guilty now,

704
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,680
it's not too late.

705
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:42,800
I can spare your life.

706
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:51,510
Your Majesty, you're right.

707
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,280
It's not too late.

708
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:57,800
It's not the end yet.

709
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,550
Marquis Changxing

710
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,670
will surely come to rescue me.

711
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,280
Your Majesty,

712
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:08,080
Marquis Changxing has been captured.

713
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,220
The Tiger Tally is here.

714
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:56,800
All my schemes have failed.

715
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:02,510
Your Majesty, you've defeated me.

716
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,760
I am not someone

717
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:09,360
who cowers and begs.

718
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:14,150
But no one in this world

719
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,280
has ever understood me

720
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:27,000
or loved me.

721
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,360
But I haven't lost.

722
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,840
From now on,

723
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:40,500
you'll never forget me.

724
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:44,550
Father.

725
