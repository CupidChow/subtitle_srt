11
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,680
(Grand Princess's Mansion)

12
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,640
Although Ms. Duo

13
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,640
always came here

14
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,480
with a veil,

15
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:47,200
her visits weren't all traceless.

16
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,790
How dare you

17
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,510
watch my mansion.

18
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,310
I also know

19
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,430
Yang Nianzhi

20
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,840
often visits you by stealth.

21
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,350
As hostile as you seem to each other,

22
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,200
you two are quite close.

23
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,590
You helped with his career.

24
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,950
I'm the one who threatens others.

25
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,280
Those who threatened me

26
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,190
all bit the dust.

27
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,700
Don't get me wrong, Aunt.

28
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,470
Had I meant to report you,

29
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,390
I wouldn't have waited until now.

30
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,710
Never have I ever attempted

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,030
to act against you.

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,470
My mother came from the North.

33
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,240
Father took her in as his consort

34
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,360
to stabilize the border.

35
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,550
I know even if

36
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,120
the Crown Prince's deposed,

37
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,910
and Father appoints someone else,

38
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,840
I'll never be the successor.

39
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,240
Over the years,

40
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,870
he has indulged me when I provoke

41
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,400
the Crown Prince only to push him.

42
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,680
My mother

43
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,240
failed to see through that.

44
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,400
You're sharper than the Crown Prince.

45
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,960
He's harboring Ms. Duo.

46
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,780
That shows he's no longer loyal to you.

47
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,590
Do you still think he's trustworthy?

48
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,360
I see that you've

49
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,360
always been at odds with my mother,

50
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,560
but if you help me become

51
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,430
the new Crown Prince,

52
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,470
I'll pledge my allegiance to you!

53
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,150
Yu Lang has one strength.

54
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,120
His mother died.

55
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:18,870
Do you dare

56
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,280
kill your mother, Prince Qi?

57
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,030
His Majesty has tons of sons.

58
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,750
Consort Xian can't be the Empress Dowager.

59
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,360
Show him out.

60
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,680
Please, Prince Qi.

61
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,920
Your Highness.

62
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,360
How dare the Crown Prince betray me!

63
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,150
I wonder how much Ms. Duo

64
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,630
has told him about the truth.

65
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,080
If His Majesty finds out,

66
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,840
there will be no way out.

67
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,940
(Crown Prince's Mansion)

68
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,560
Did Aunt kill my mother?

69
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,520
I'm afraid so, Your Highness.

70
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,590
I don't believe it!

71
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,710
She died of leprosy.

72
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,560
All the Imperial Physicians said so.

73
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,410
She couldn't have been poisoned by Aunt.

74
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,240
You made up

75
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,160
such a ridiculous story

76
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,190
to cheat me.

77
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,240
What were you up to?

78
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,840
At this point,

79
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,390
why would I cheat you?

80
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:30,790
And you!

81
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,510
How audacious of you!

82
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,560
Aunt's been looking everywhere for her

83
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,580
while you've had her harbored at our place.

84
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,870
Are you trying to sow discord

85
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,390
between me and the Grand Princess?

86
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,560
Empress Di entrusted her

87
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,600
to me.

88
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,100
If you don't believe me,

89
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,460
go ask her in the Changning Palace.

90
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,190
Fuqing's blindness is also proof.

91
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,740
There is something else.

92
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,000
You're allergic to walnuts.

93
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,230
After your mother passed away,

94
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,190
someone slipped chopped walnuts

95
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,390
into your desserts,

96
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,500
which almost killed you.

97
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,190
The Grand Princess saved your life

98
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,160
and found that it was Consort Xian's doing.

99
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,270
The truth is

100
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,390
all that was part of her scheme

101
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,480
to set Consort Xian up

102
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,040
and win you over.

103
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,560
Liar!

104
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,320
You're lying!

105
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,630
Impossible! That can't be true!

106
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,320
Aunt couldn't have done that.

107
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,440
No way.

108
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,630
I will have you

109
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,510
thrown into prison

110
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,680
and tortured severely!

111
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,240
- Guards! Guards!
- Your Highness!

112
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,350
Your Highness,

113
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,190
your mother was the Empress

114
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,430
who was worshiped by all,

115
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,480
but she ended up being killed by poison.

116
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,070
If you mistook the killer

117
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:31,920
as the savior,

118
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,040
how could your mother

119
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,070
rest in peace?

120
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,310
If you seize Ms. Duo,

121
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,360
I'll be killed for sure.

122
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,950
What if our baby grows up

123
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,990
without knowing how his mother died,

124
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,940
and continues to worship the Grand Princess?

125
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,160
Is that what you want to see?

126
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,640
No.

127
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:09,670
Aunt...

128
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,630
Aunt couldn't have cheated me.

129
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,880
No way.

130
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,160
I didn't get to see the Crown Prince.

131
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,560
The Crown Princess said

132
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,400
he wasn't well enough

133
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,830
to come out.

134
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,950
In the past,

135
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,950
he was

136
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,630
obedient to me.

137
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,600
He'd do whatever I said.

138
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:42,270
He must've learned from Ms. Duo

139
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,040
about the truth of his mother's death

140
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,720
and betrayed me.

141
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,830
Prince Qi was right.

142
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,830
I'm going to bring Ms. Duo back

143
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,120
from the Crown Prince's Mansion.

144
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,960
No need.

145
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,630
Everyone knows

146
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,240
we're bonded together

147
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,870
like a mother and a son.

148
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:01,950
Now that he no longer obeys me,

149
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,800
he's worthless.

150
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,870
I'll show him

151
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:11,190
that he'll reap what he sows.

152
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:16,420
(Luxurious and Gorgeous)

153
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,270
Greetings, Aunt.

154
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,920
You came fast.

155
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,560
I rushed over as soon as I received

156
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,270
your secret message.

157
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,600
Have some tea.

158
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,560
Last time, after you left,

159
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,680
I pondered over your words.

160
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,000
You know,

161
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,390
your talent and diligence

162
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,630
are superior to the Crown Prince's.

163
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,040
For what it's worth,

164
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,350
I shall

165
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,870
give you a chance.

166
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,760
Thank you, Aunt.

167
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,390
This is the totem of Nanwu's Saintess.

168
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:10,600
It was spotted

169
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,480
on Princess Yan.

170
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,310
Is she Nanwu's Saintess?

171
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,000
As you know,

172
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:23,120
His Majesty loathes Nanwu.

173
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,950
Colluding with them is a capital crime.

174
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,040
Not to mention Princess Yan

175
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,550
turns out to be their Saintess.

176
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,720
If you report her to His Majesty,

177
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,910
you'll be eliminating a national threat.

178
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,270
It'll be a great merit for Dazhou

179
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,720
and also

180
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,000
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

181
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,240
Prince Yan and I

182
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,840
are of the same mother.

183
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,840
If I report his wife,

184
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,150
Yu Jin will also

185
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,240
be implicated.

186
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,120
Even my mother and I...

187
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,960
Never mind.

188
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,910
Clearly, your ambition is

189
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,550
no more than empty talk.

190
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,320
You put your brother's wife,

191
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,630
that woman, Jiang Si,

192
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,320
before national security.

193
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,260
(Luxurious and Gorgeous)

194
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,910
No wonder His Majesty

195
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,390
always tells me

196
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:31,910
you only talk the talk.

197
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,030
He doesn't trust you.

198
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:43,460
(Prince Yan's Mansion)

199
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,240
Apply it to your skin

200
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,390
and the totem will be gone?

201
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,670
I've tried.

202
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,480
It can only be concealed temporarily,

203
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,320
and it'll reappear soon.

204
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,120
When Aman helped me get changed

205
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,000
after we came home from the streets,

206
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,630
the concealer no longer worked.

207
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,840
But right now,

208
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,630
I have to conceal the totem.

209
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,750
Apply the concealer every day

210
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,870
to never let it out again.

211
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,000
Every day?

212
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,590
Isn't that too much trouble?

213
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,630
No trouble at all.

214
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,480
Leave all the trouble to your husband.

215
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:23,630
If you don't trouble me,

216
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,390
that'll be my biggest trouble.

217
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,600
So please trouble me

218
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,910
as much as possible.

219
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,390
Stop saying the word "trouble".

220
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,600
I'm lost.

221
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,040
It's disappeared!

222
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,160
Really?

223
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,510
Add more to it.

224
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,080
Is it gone?

225
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,510
It's magical!

226
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,350
All gone.

227
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,900
(Taiji Hall, Tiande Hall)

228
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:53,510
Mother,

229
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,840
what's the emergency?

230
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:56,870
There you are.

231
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:58,870
Read it.

232
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,670
Yesterday, Jin's wife

233
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,790
had her maid

234
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,510
send that to me.

235
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,480
Never in my wildest dreams

236
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,440
did I think the Grand Princess

237
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,670
would depict Jin

238
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,870
as a cursed prince.

239
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,150
She held a grudge against me

240
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,600
and came up with a dirty plot

241
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,360
to separate me and my son.

242
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,510
How wildly audacious of her.

243
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,000
Ms. Xu's testimony

244
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,600
told the whole truth.

245
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,480
First, she set Yu Jin up.

246
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,030
Then she tried to kill Jiang Si.

247
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,030
She survived by sheer luck.

248
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,620
Or she would've died of poison

249
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,260
like her mother.

250
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:39,720
The testimony also said

251
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:42,120
the Grand Princess colluded with Nanwu.

252
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,750
With this testimony,

253
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:46,910
I don't think

254
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:50,030
His Majesty will still cover for her.

255
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:51,550
But were it

256
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,200
able to bring her down for good,

257
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,270
why not hand it in to Father,

258
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,840
but you?

259
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,270
Between Jin and his wife,

260
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:01,630
he grew up in the South

261
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,320
while she's from a declining clan.

262
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,080
They have no roots in Ling'an

263
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,280
and no support in the court.

264
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,030
They gave such vital evidence

265
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,240
to me, not the Empress

266
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,480
because they trusted me.

267
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:13,750
After all,

268
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,120
Jin is my son.

269
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,910
Ms. Xu can change her testimony.

270
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:19,220
Those of Astronomy
responsible for Jin's divination

271
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:19,870
might've died.

272
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,120
Once Aunt makes Ms. Xu retract her words,

273
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,550
we'll be guilty of a frame-up.

274
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,600
Not this, not that.

275
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,910
Anything can hold you back

276
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,150
and drag your feet.

277
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,670
Who did you take after that?

278
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,120
Will I be able to see you

279
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,480
bring down that witch before death?

280
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,080
You aren't half as bold as Jin.

281
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,640
He dared beat the Crown Prince

282
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,790
and fight that witch head-on

283
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,790
not to marry her daughter.

284
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,320
But look at you!

285
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:50,510
Mother,

286
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,990
seizing the throne is the riskiest.

287
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,390
One misstep can kill everyone in my house

288
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,230
and in this hall.

289
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,910
I'm trying to be thorough

290
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:57,910
and cautious.

291
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,480
How is that wrong?

292
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,120
Here comes the chance,

293
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,670
but you're too timid

294
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,960
to do anything.

295
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,080
Clearly, I can't count on you.

296
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,110
Your Highness!

297
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,480
Your Highness, what happened?

298
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,200
Am I really inferior to Jin?

299
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,200
It was spotted

300
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,960
on Princess Yan.

301
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:52,150
If you report her to His Majesty,

302
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,510
it'll be a great merit for Dazhou

303
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,910
and also

304
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:58,120
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

305
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,270
I've been feeling guilty

306
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:10,120
about what happened to Yu.

307
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,200
I'm not your enemy.

308
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,080
When the accident happened,

309
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,840
I was unable to lend a hand.

310
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,790
But if you acted against me,

311
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,600
wouldn't you have one more foe

312
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,240
and one less ally?

313
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:37,240
Ever since we suffered misfortune,

314
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,000
you've been staying as far

315
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,600
as you can from our family.

316
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,030
Why invite me to drinks today?

317
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,510
What do you want? Just say it.

318
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,870
Your biggest enemy isn't me,

319
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,000
but Jiang Si.

320
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,960
She was the one who reported Yi

321
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,150
and talked Jiang Qian

322
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,480
into divorcing him.

323
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,440
Also, she made His Majesty

324
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:10,720
try the case and sentence your son to death.

325
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:14,480
She is your sworn enemy.

326
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,550
Don't you hate her?

327
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,510
Yes, of course!

328
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,720
I wish I could cut them into pieces!

329
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,750
I wish they'd be torn limb from limb!

330
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,790
Now, there's a chance

331
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,600
for you to take revenge

332
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,910
aboveboard.

333
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,080
You lost Princess Mingyue.

334
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,600
Don't you also hate them?

335
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,510
I see.

336
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,390
You want me

337
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,000
to be your sword, huh?

338
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:48,200
Hear me out before you decide

339
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,960
if it's worth it

340
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,360
to be my sword.

341
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:56,470
Your Highness,

342
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:57,820
Prince Qi came to see you.

343
00:15:58,870 --> 00:15:59,710
Let him wait.

344
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,040
Yes.

345
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:16,260
(Grand Princess's Mansion)

346
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,200
(Mingyue,)

347
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,960
(the day to avenge your death)

348
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,240
(has finally come.)

349
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:26,710
(I'll)

350
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,480
(dress myself up)

351
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,630
(as loudly as)

352
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,670
(the day I saw you marry.)

353
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,240
(Mingyue,)

354
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,270
(I will not let go)

355
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:23,670
(a single one)

356
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:26,240
(of those who killed you.)

357
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,350
Your Majesty,

358
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,400
the Grand Princess is outside.

359
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:38,590
Let her in.

360
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,550
Summon the Grand Princess.

361
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:49,720
It's been a while.

362
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,480
I came to pay my respects to you, Brother.

363
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:54,670
Rongyang,

364
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,400
you look much better.

365
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,680
That's quite a relief.

366
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,400
You have to squeeze time

367
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,160
from your already tight schedule

368
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,350
for me.

369
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,590
I'm sorry for troubling you.

370
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,760
Don't mention it.

371
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,510
You're my sister.

372
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,880
I ought to go through this difficult time

373
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,110
with you.

374
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,680
Thank you, Brother.

375
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,030
It's too hot

376
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,440
and sweltering today.

377
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,270
I brought you

378
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,790
our favorite drink in childhood,

379
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,720
the cold perilla drink.

380
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,200
Add some ice.

381
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,830
It'll taste refreshing.

382
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,720
It's so thoughtful of you.

383
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,350
Prince Qi requests an audience.

384
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,720
Send him in.

385
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,720
I'll take my leave.

386
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,070
We're family.

387
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,520
You may stay.

388
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,880
Greetings, Father.

389
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,510
Greetings, Grand Princess.

390
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:54,880
Who taught you that?

391
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,150
I meant to teach you

392
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,160
a few last-minute tricks.

393
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,160
Now, I don't have to.

394
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,960
I had

395
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:03,270
(Before the Flowers)
a wonderful master.

396
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,960
There are two things for sure.

397
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,350
This person is

398
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,720
as skilled as me.

399
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,750
Besides,

400
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,640
someone can't

401
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,720
forget that person.

402
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,200
My master

403
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,440
is called Yu Qi.

404
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,590
I know him all too well.

405
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,350
Isn't he me in the dream?

406
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,760
This is so unfair.

407
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:28,620
I want to do these things with you,

408
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,270
but he's beaten me to them.

409
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,920
- Are you jealous?
- Quite so, indeed.

410
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:32,960
Both of them are you.

411
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:33,960
It's not the same!

412
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,080
Chief!

413
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,880
Chief, My Lady.

414
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,790
The Grand Princess entered the Palace.

415
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:40,990
Prince Qi followed right after.

416
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,030
- Him too?
- Yes.

417
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,640
What must come cannot be avoided.

418
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,080
Zhang.

419
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,040
Yes, Father.

420
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,160
I read your report on tax

421
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,110
and corvee.

422
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:54,750
It was beautifully written

423
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,400
but quite shallow.

424
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,030
It was mere empty talk.

425
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,150
What's this for?

426
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,830
I'm handing in a secret report!

427
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,960
If the Grand Princess went

428
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,510
for Nanwu's Saintess,

429
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,200
Father would summon us soon.

430
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,280
Listen,

431
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,830
leave through the back gate.

432
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,510
Tell others you need to worship ancestors.

433
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,750
Lingshui and Nanwu

434
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:42,790
are in the same direction.

435
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:43,740
No one will suspect you.

436
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:44,910
Also,

437
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,160
bring with you the pendant from me

438
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,080
and go to the Chiyu Cavalry.

439
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,000
If I leave like this,

440
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,370
others will think I escaped,

441
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,480
and you'll be guilty of collaboration.

442
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:54,640
The great merits

443
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:57,160
you gained from years of battling

444
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,640
have finally cleared your name

445
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,480
as a cursed prince.

446
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,160
Are you going to give all that up?

447
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,720
I don't care about anything

448
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,160
but your safety.

449
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,000
Listen to me,

450
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,840
go now.

451
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,520
Go!

452
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,800
Long Dan,

453
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,030
get her out of town!

454
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,520
Yes.

455
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,830
Greetings, Your Majesty.

456
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,920
Show Marquis Changxing that letter.

457
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,240
I heard

458
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,830
you had dug deep into Nanwu

459
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,720
after losing your son.

460
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,390
Do you

461
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,240
recognize this totem?

462
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,390
Marquis Changxing,

463
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,070
if you know anything,

464
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,790
do tell us.

465
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:04,390
Yes.

466
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,040
Your Majesty,

467
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,720
this is the totem of Nanwu's Saintess!

468
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:14,590
It's Nanwu's top secret.

469
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,200
I searched

470
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,040
long and hard

471
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,480
only to see it once in a classified scroll.

472
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,270
Your Majesty, how did you get it?

473
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,920
A few days ago,

474
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,030
I found it from a captured Nanwu's spy.

475
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:28,670
Does it

476
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,200
only appear on Nanwu's Saintess?

477
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,200
That classified scroll said

478
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,480
the Saintess was born with the totem

479
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,680
given by the heavens.

480
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,240
No one else would have it.

481
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,400
That Nanwu's spy told the truth.

482
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,960
Once Princess Yan arrives,

483
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,750
we'll find out.

484
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,060
Are you ready, My Lady?

485
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,100
We're running out of time!

486
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,750
My Lady, can we go?

487
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,520
My Lady!

488
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,150
My Lady!

489
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,040
Where's she?

490
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,080
Oh no!

491
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:13,740
(Before the Flowers)

492
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:14,590
Prince Yan,

493
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,720
His Majesty

494
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,750
summons you and Princess Yan.

495
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,880
Prince Yan has arrived!

496
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:29,400
Greetings, Father.

497
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,080
Yu Jin,

498
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,750
I'll only ask you once.

499
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,030
Be honest with me.

500
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:36,430
What is it, Father?

501
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,800
Is Jiang Si

502
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,030
Nanwu's Saintess or not?

503
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,190
What makes you say that?

504
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,790
- Answer me.
- Pure nonsense.

505
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,000
Really?

506
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,750
His Majesty

507
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:47,160
summoned you and your wife.

508
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:49,550
Why did you come alone?

509
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:52,300
She went home to worship her ancestors.

510
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,750
What a coincidence, huh?

511
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,960
What's that supposed to mean?

512
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,510
Your Majesty, Princess Yan is outside.

513
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,240
Send her in.

514
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:23,550
Greetings, Father.

515
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,270
Sorry, I'm late.

516
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:27,910
Jiang Si,

517
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,240
I received a tip-off

518
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,680
saying you're Nanwu's Saintess.

519
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,680
What do you have to say?

520
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:34,960
Father,

521
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,590
I was born and raised in Ling'an.

522
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,400
The furthest I've been is Lingshui.

523
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,960
How could I be Nanwu's Saintess?

524
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,480
It's utter nonsense.

525
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,160
Trust me, Father.

526
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,720
Clearly, you two are on the same page.

527
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,270
You came prepared, didn't you?

528
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:51,310
Why are you throwing dirt on us, Aunt?

529
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,880
Father, the Saintess

530
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,270
is the chosen one

531
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,310
by Nanwu.

532
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,960
It doesn't have to be their citizen

533
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:00,640
or someone who's been there.

534
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,960
How can we know for sure?

535
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,240
In my humble opinion,

536
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,030
the totem doesn't lie.

537
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,880
Father, please check

538
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,530
the back of Princess Yan's neck

539
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,350
for that totem.

540
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,190
No!

541
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,720
She's my princess.

542
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:16,640
She can't be checked in public

543
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,550
because of sheer nonsense.

544
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,830
Don't you want to clear your name?

545
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:22,270
This is the best chance.

546
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,590
If you insist, Father,

547
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,720
I'll let them check me.

548
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:27,480
But if no totem is found,

549
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,790
please show no mercy to those

550
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,480
who framed me, Father.

551
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,320
Sure.

552
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,440
Have her checked in the Imperial Study.

553
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:45,960
Your Majesty,

554
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,830
we found no totem on Princess Yan.

555
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:49,480
She doesn't have it,

556
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,620
so she can't be the Saintess.

557
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,160
Your Majesty,

558
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,310
please punish those who framed her.

559
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,750
Father, I...

560
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,560
Brother,

561
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,240
rumor has it that heat

562
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,440
will make that totem

563
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,790
show more clearly.

564
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,550
I wonder

565
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,390
if that's true.

566
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:09,390
Father,

567
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,440
she's been checked once.

568
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,580
Why not check thoroughly

569
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:12,790
just in case?

570
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:14,130
In case of what? She has no totem.

571
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:16,160
Rongyang, check her yourself.

572
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,240
Yes.

573
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,510
Pull down her dress.

574
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,480
Jiang Si,

575
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,000
you really are Nanwu's Saintess.

576
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:02,720
Jiang Si is indeed Nanwu's Saintess!

577
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,680
Princess Fuqing, you can't go in.

578
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,760
Why?

579
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,480
Look at you, Jin!

580
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,750
This is the wife

581
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:17,590
you chose,

582
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,200
who betrayed our state

583
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,240
and colluded with Nanwu.

584
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:22,790
Father, she couldn't have been a traitor.

585
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,350
Your Majesty, Mr. Zhen is outside.

586
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:33,950
Send him in.

587
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:43,070
Zhen Heng greets you, Your Majesty.

588
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,030
I'm glad you're here.

589
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,000
Let's try this case together.

590
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:49,430
Jiang Si,

591
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,950
Prince Yan spoke for you

592
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:52,310
at the risk of covering

593
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,560
for a traitor.

594
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,150
How will you defend yourself?

595
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,150
Your Majesty,

596
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,150
I implore you

597
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,160
to think it through.

598
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,750
Marquis Changxing

599
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,440
was quite close to Nanwu.

600
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,030
His son

601
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,400
was found

602
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,550
carrying their secret drug, Surreal Wander.

603
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:12,000
Even he didn't know

604
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,440
how to bring out the totem.

605
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:14,830
How did the Grand Princess

606
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,030
find out so easily

607
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,110
on the pretext of rumor?

608
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,640
Would anyone

609
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,790
in this hall believe

610
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,590
she didn't collaborate

611
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:23,550
with Nanwu?

612
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,030
I was born and raised

613
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:25,880
in Dazhou.

614
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:28,310
I'd never do anything harmful to our state.

615
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:29,870
Your Majesty,

616
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:34,550
my son's case has been concluded.

617
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,640
I followed you

618
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:39,070
fighting here and there my entire life.

619
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:40,670
I've devoted myself

620
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,440
to you and Dazhou.

621
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:44,640
I swear, Your Majesty!

622
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,720
Rise, Marquis Changxing.

623
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,560
Brother,

624
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:57,790
I'd like to call a witness.

625
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,770
Who is it?

626
00:28:58,790 --> 00:28:59,720
A dead man.

627
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,400
Bring him in.

628
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:13,630
Sang Qi?

629
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,590
Didn't you die?

630
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:17,110
Yes.

631
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,310
Didn't he already die?

632
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,280
Jiang Si,

633
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,960
you know him well, don't you?

634
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,830
Zhen Heng, who is he?

635
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,240
He worked for the Nightingale of Nanwu.

636
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,830
His name is Sang Qi.

637
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:33,200
He had been seized by Prince Yan.

638
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,430
Later,

639
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,720
he somehow died of poison.

640
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,830
How come he's here and alive?

641
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,000
I'm also confused.

642
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,700
Back in the Capital Security Office,

643
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,000
Prince Yan and I

644
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:44,680
checked his body together

645
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,550
and confirmed his death.

646
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:49,590
Your Majesty, investigation shows

647
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,350
the last person he saw

648
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:52,190
before he died

649
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,080
was Jiang Si

650
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,790
who held the waist tag

651
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,470
(Capital Security)
of Commandant Yu.

652
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,680
When Speed Guards

653
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,220
were looking for Nanwu's spies earlier,

654
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,440
they caught him again.

655
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,070
This matter involves

656
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,750
Yu Jin and Jiang Si

657
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:08,480
from the very beginning, right?

658
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,520
Your Majesty,

659
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:15,070
I can vouch

660
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,510
for Prince Yan,

661
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:17,420
the then Commandant Yu.

662
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,070
He knows nothing about it.

663
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:20,920
He caught

664
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,480
Sang Qi himself.

665
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,310
Why would he help him escape?

666
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,790
There must be a misunderstanding.

667
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,480
In that case,

668
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,510
it was Princess Yan,

669
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:32,590
sorry,

670
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,960
Nanwu's Saintess, Jiang Si

671
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,550
who alone did it, huh?

672
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:40,640
I had suspected her, too.

673
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,200
In order to check her identity,

674
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,520
I approached her on purpose.

675
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,590
But I found no sign of collaboration

676
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,880
but saw

677
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,880
how she upheld justice for others.

678
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,640
She had no ulterior motives.

679
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,650
She just wanted to protect her family.

680
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,440
Thanks to her reminder,

681
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,640
I was able to know

682
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,000
an eclipse would happen during the Hunt

683
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,720
and keep you safe.

684
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,110
So,

685
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,590
you knew who she really was?

686
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,110
Look, Brother.

687
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,310
Prince Yan

688
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,720
used to be a decorated general,

689
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,880
but he's been bewitched by this vamp

690
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,960
to disregard his country and family.

691
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,350
Obviously, Nanwu's Saintess

692
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:19,030
is formidable.

693
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:21,790
She's able to predict the future

694
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:24,030
and help restore Nanwu

695
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:25,480
to destroy Dazhou.

696
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,510
She's a huge threat to us!

697
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,440
We've fought them

698
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:29,880
for decades.

699
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,960
People have been struggling in war.

700
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,960
They've never had a moment of peace.

701
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,320
Jin,

702
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:36,550
you and the Chiyu Cavalry

703
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,750
fought over and over

704
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,510
only to hold Nanwu back for a while.

705
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,160
Now, you blindly believe

706
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,590
their Saintess?

707
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,790
Did your soldiers

708
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,590
die for nothing?

709
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,510
Prince Yan has been

710
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,110
blinded to the truth.

711
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,070
I heard

712
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:52,880
she was best at confusing people's minds.

713
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,070
Your Majesty,

714
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,030
she shall be beheaded immediately

715
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,200
for good!

716
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,920
You're confusing people's minds!

717
00:31:59,110 --> 00:31:59,950
Drag

718
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,400
Jiang Si out and behead her now.

719
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:03,870
Yes.

720
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:07,110
I dare you to touch her!

721
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:12,270
The Saintess appears, Nanwu thrives...

722
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,220
(Peace and Prosperity)

723
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:28,670
Mother!

724
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,110
Mother, bad news!

725
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:30,960
Be careful.

726
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,280
They called Princess Yan

727
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,510
Nanwu's Saintess.

728
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,790
Who said that?

729
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:37,190
When I went to the Tiande Hall
to see Father just now,

730
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:37,880
I heard that.

731
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,510
No wonder she could

732
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:40,880
recognize the rare Mang Worm

733
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,550
and cure your eye disease.

734
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,240
She's honest and upright.

735
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:46,400
I don't believe she's a traitor.

736
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,480
She risked her life to help me.

737
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:49,920
We can't let her

738
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,880
be wronged like this.

739
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,280
Father,

740
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,160
20 years ago,

741
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:57,110
you had me exiled

742
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:58,440
due to false divination.

743
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,640
Now, you're going to kill my love

744
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,920
based on rumor.

745
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,830
I can lead troops into battle

746
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,680
to wipe out Nanwu.

747
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,400
But you're going to kill a girl

748
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,030
in exchange for Dazhou's safety.

749
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,000
Don't you find that absurd, Father?

750
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,560
Yu Jin,

751
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,550
you knew

752
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:16,390
her identity

753
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,830
but kept covering for her.

754
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:21,240
Did you come back to Ling'an unauthorized

755
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,790
for a hidden agenda?

756
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:24,720
Father, you're confusing right and wrong.

757
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,680
I have nothing else to say.

758
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,880
At this stage,

759
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,960
there's no point in hiding it.

760
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:38,030
Yes, I am Nanwu's Saintess.

761
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,440
Prince Yan,

762
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,310
don't be so naive.

763
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,270
I approached you at first

764
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,680
because I knew you had a special identity.

765
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:48,270
I figured you'd be

766
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:49,590
useful to me someday.

767
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,070
Unexpectedly,

768
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:53,070
all you cared about

769
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:54,400
was wiping out threats for Dazhou

770
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:55,550
and pacifying the border.

771
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,320
There was little chance

772
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:00,000
that you'd help me.

773
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,480
Do you know what you are saying?

774
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,110
Of course I do.

775
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,720
Didn't you approach me

776
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,550
also because you suspected my identity?

777
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,400
I've come this far

778
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:13,110
as Princess Yan.

779
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,280
It's worth it.

780
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,600
Otherwise,

781
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,480
why would I marry you?

782
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,440
After all,

783
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,000
we were strangers.

784
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,640
Report!

785
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:29,400
The border's in danger!

786
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,480
Nanwu's massed troops there,

787
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:32,060
demanding the return of their Saintess.

788
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:33,150
Otherwise, they will

789
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,550
invade in full force to drown Dazhou

790
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:35,320
in a bloodbath!

791
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,770
Order Cui Xu to set out immediately

792
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,960
with our troops to meet them there.

793
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:40,990
Yes.

794
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,920
Your Majesty,

795
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,230
Nanwu believes in their Saintess.

796
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:45,710
Every generation of their people

797
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:47,510
is firmly convinced that the Saintess

798
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,710
will help them seize Dazhou.

799
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,920
If we behead her,

800
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,190
the people of Nanwu

801
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,280
will scatter and escape.

802
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:54,430
Then

803
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,480
no one can

804
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,110
stop our troops

805
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,360
from seizing their land!

806
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,160
Marquis Changxing,

807
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:00,520
with the enemy in front,

808
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:02,480
you're risking our people's lives.

809
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,920
Would you rather see war break out?

810
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:04,950
Your Majesty,

811
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,800
the rumor says

812
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,320
the Saintess embodies Nanwu's belief.

813
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:09,710
If you kill me,

814
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,110
you'll also destroy

815
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:11,950
their belief.

816
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:12,950
In that case,

817
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,590
Nanwu will attack in full fury.

818
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,190
Both Nanwu and Dazhou

819
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,550
will suffer huge losses.

820
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,800
Is that what you want to see, Your Majesty?

821
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,760
Throw her in the Imperial Prison

822
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:29,400
pending a retrial.

823
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,240
Yes.

824
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,510
Your Majesty,

825
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,190
the truth has come out.

826
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,510
A retrial is unnecessary.

827
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:43,190
Capital Security solves and tries cases.

828
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,960
Zhen Heng is known to be fair and just.

829
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,670
He'll deal with this case.

830
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,920
Zhen Heng of Capital Security is on it.

831
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,110
Brother, such a major case

832
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,670
should be tried by two offices for fairness.

833
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,760
The Council of State for military affairs

834
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,960
is the most suitable for it.

835
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,710
Zhen Heng and Marquis Changxing

836
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:09,920
will handle this case together.

837
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,280
You may leave.

838
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,720
Hang back, Jin.

839
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,420
Good day, Your Majesty.

840
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,000
Tell me.

841
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,000
Who am I to you?

842
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,190
The Emperor and my father.

843
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:46,150
You aren't too hopeless.

844
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,800
I'm the Emperor before I'm your father.

845
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:52,550
You should know the line

846
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,960
between state affairs and family affairs.

847
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:58,480
Nanwu firmly believes

848
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,710
Jiang Si is their Saintess.

849
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,280
The rest of her life

850
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:03,000
can only go two ways.

851
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,030
Either she'll be killed,

852
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,280
or she'll be imprisoned for life

853
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,480
as Nanwu's hostage.

854
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,230
Either way,

855
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,440
she'll no longer be your wife.

856
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:20,550
It's better

857
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,710

you had your difficulties.

883
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,360

Princess Yan is on suspicion

904
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,010
As the Commissioner,
I'm ordered to investigate it.

905

Arrest all of them for interrogation.
