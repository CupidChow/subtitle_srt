(Haitang Chamber)

12
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,560
Yi, you suddenly moved back.

13
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,200
Are you adjusting well?

14
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,460
Everything at home

15
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,700
feels so familiar,

16
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,780
like I never left.

17
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:53,940
Yet, looking back,

18
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,220
I've been married away for so many years.

19
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:57,940
Yi,

20
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,900
now that you're home,

21
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,650
don't dwell

22
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:02,620
on that ill-fated bond anymore.

23
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,540
I just can't figure out

24
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,060
why I was wrong about him.

25
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,700
From the day we met,

26
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,260
he played the perfect gentleman.

27
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,620
After spending so many years with him,

28
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,060
I only saw his true colors

29
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,500
at the end.

30
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,020
This isn't your fault.

31
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,780
He fooled us all.

32
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,300
We're all responsible.

33
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,100
If anyone of us

34
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,020
had seen

35
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,340
the slightest hint,

36
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,380
you'd have been

37
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,020
spared this nightmare.

38
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,460
But I don't regret it.

39
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,820
You don't?

40
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,420
Why?

41
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,500
Because we were deeply in love.

42
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,260
Back then,

43
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,260
he was the man who held my heart,

44
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,860
luminous as the moon.

45
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,300
Even in today's situation,

46
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,700
I've come to my senses,

47
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,620
and I detest, resent, and loathe him,

48
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,700
still,

49
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,260
I have the best memories,

50
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,220
right?

51
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,300
But it didn't

52
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,860
end well.

53
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,820
Some things are not

54
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,500
just about endings.

55
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,420
If...

56
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,460
If it's destined to go nowhere,

57
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,220
is it still worth trying?

58
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,820
When you spoke,

59
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,420
were you

60
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,860
thinking of Mr. Yu?

61
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,180
You see through me again.

62
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,740
Affection leaks through;

63
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,260
concern can't be faked.

64
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,860
At Lingshui, I saw

65
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,220
your growing affection for him.

66
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,460
And his feelings for you

67
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:44,860
probably run deeper.

68
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,620
Really?

69
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,540
Do you really think

70
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,180
he cares about me?

71
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,980
The mountain is hidden from view;

72
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,300
you're cradled in its folds.

73
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,540
(Fight)

74
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,700
Greetings, sir.

75
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,500
I'm Bulwark-general Cui Xu

76
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,460
and Commander of the Guards.

77
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,020
From now on, you will

78
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,660
be a Guard as well.

79
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,980
You shall be devoted

80
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,580
and give it your all

81
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,140
to keep His Majesty,

82
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,340
our city,

83
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,940
and our state safe!

84
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,460
Yes!

85
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:04,820
(Border of Ling'an)

86
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,300
(Earl Dongping's Mansion, Jiang)

87
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,140
Good.

88
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,980
Good to have you back.

89
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,220
Good.

90
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,940
l missed you so much.

91
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:25,580
Well then, you two catch up.

92
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,420
I'll prepare the feast.

93
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,020
Tonight we'll have

94
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,860
a proper reunion at home.

95
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,340
Thank you, Father.

96
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,620
Pei, you've traveled a long way.

97
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,660
Have some tea.

98
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,540
Thanks, Qiao.

99
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:45,980
I missed

100
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,300
our tea so much.

101
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,780
Do they skimp on your tea allowance?

102
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,140
Not at all, Mother.

103
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,690
The tea we drink at home

104
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,940
is not cost-effective

105
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,260
for the Lin Family.

106
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,860
My mother-in-law is teaching me in ledgers.

107
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,220
I should set an example.

108
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,540
The tea I pick

109
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,780
isn't pricey,

110
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,140
but it's refined.

111
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:06,740
Next time,

112
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,220
I'll bring you some for tasting.

113
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,740
Since Pei married off,

114
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,260
she's grown wiser and matured.

115
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,380
Who would deny?

116
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,700
Every inch a lady now.

117
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,020
My mother-in-law is skilled in needlework.

118
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,260
I've learned a lot from her

119
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,440
and made some embroidered trinkets.

120
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,380
I'll present some pieces to the elders.

121
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,740
These days,

122
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,260
you'd better steer clear

123
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,420
of your lineal mother.

124
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,340
With Zhan now a Imperial Insignia Guard,

125
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,020
they are in a foul mood.

126
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,940
Then we must visit them more

127
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,940
to lift our name.

128
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:36,020
Although I didn't marry into a noble family,

129
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,780
my husband has a successful official career

130
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:39,900
and treats me well.

131
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,300
If not for his duties today,

132
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,540
he would have

133
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,940
come with me.

134
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:48,660
Miss,

135
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,820
your business is booming!

136
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,660
None of your business.

137
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,340
The street has always been rough.

138
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,780
Thanks to us upholding justice,

139
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,500
you're able to run your business in peace.

140
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,100
Shouldn't our chivalry

141
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,100
earn some gratitude?

142
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:07,940
Exactly.

143
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:08,820
Well,

144
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:09,820
he...

145
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,680
No worries.

146
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,020
Aren't you the very reason

147
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:15,780
there's no peace here?

148
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,620
You!

149
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:18,860
30 coppers a month,

150
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,140
do you pay or not?

151
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,060
Ok, I'll pay.

152
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,940
Bro!

153
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,460
How dare you!

154
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,180
Wench, I'll kill you!

155
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,820
Imperial Insignia Guard here. Who dares defy?

156
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,660
Imperial Insignia Guard?

157
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:36,900
It's a Guard.

158
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,740
You...

159
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,340
Why don't you serve the Imperial City

160
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,900
instead of meddling here?

161
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,380
You bully the weak and extort money.

162
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,620
Shouldn't I meddle?

163
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,620
Your evil actions endanger public safety.

164
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,660
Shouldn't I meddle?

165
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:49,660
Or should I bring in

166
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,420
the Capital Security?

167
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,780
Get lost!

168
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,860
Well done!

169
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,680
The Guard is indeed majestic.

170
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:57,850
Problem solved.

171
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,380
Back to shopping, everyone.

172
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:03,700
Well done.

173
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,580
You're good, Jiang Zhan.

174
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,700
Since joining the Guard,

175
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,060
your eloquence has sharpened.

176
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,060
Wasn't I always eloquent?

177
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,660
It's heavy.

178
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,780
Golden Eagle?

179
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,260
It's a unique symbol of the Guard.

180
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:42,820
You know it?

181
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:47,530
Not bad.

182
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,580
Still, it falls short

183
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:50,820
of my Nie Yinniang's dagger.

184
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,020
Jiang Zhan,

185
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,860
freshly joining the Guard,

186
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:56,980
you're not going home.

187
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,700
Are you here to show off?

188
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,540
I...

189
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:00,940
I...

190
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,580
I'm busy.

191
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,940
I just happened

192
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,180
to stop by,

193
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,380
- Young Master!
- and saw someone...

194
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,780
Young Master!

195
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,380
You walked too fast!

196
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,580
But this isn't the way home.

197
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,020
Isn't it?

198
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,340
Since joining the Guard,

199
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,460
I can't even find my way home.

200
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,660
Which way?

201
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,180
- Your sword.
- Ji, hold it for me.

202
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,260
Greetings, Grandma.

203
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,460
Zhan,

204
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,980
come closer. Let me see you.

205
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,180
So imposing!

206
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,580
You know,

207
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,980
among our house's youth,

208
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,460
you lag in studies,

209
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,300
defy orders,

210
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:06,780
chase fun,

211
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,380
nowhere near your brother, Cang.

212
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,180
Mother, are you praising him?

213
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,220
Who would have thought

214
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,940
you would become

215
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:17,780
our pride?

216
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,060
Grandma, you know what,

217
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,340
today when we reported for duty,

218
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,660
among all the guards,

219
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,580
our commander, General Cui,

220
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,660
chose me alone to serve

221
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,100
at His Majesty's Mid-Autumn hunt.

222
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,580
Which General Cui?

223
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:32,810
Cui Xu?

224
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,460
Yes. You know him?

225
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,980
You've finally made something of yourself.

226
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,380
Come,

227
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,700
let's have a good drink to celebrate.

228
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:46,580
Ancheng,

229
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,460
Zhan has just joined the Guard

230
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,740
and you've already

231
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,460
been impatient

232
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,580
about Mother's instructions?

233
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,980
It's ok. Let them go.

234
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:57,940
Zhan,

235
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,540
Grandma would remind you,

236
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,020
now that you've joined the Guard,

237
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,900
serve with utmost diligence.

238
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,900
You were appointed by His Majesty.

239
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,140
You must excel

240
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,340
beyond others

241
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:11,140
to honor His Majesty's favor.

242
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,980
Yes, Grandma!

243
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,500
Mother, we have to go now.

244
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,180
Come.

245
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,260
Go back and get Yi and Si.

246
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,420
Let's have a big

247
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,540
happy family celebration.

248
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,500
Yes.

249
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,740
I want to invite Mr. Yu too.

250
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,420
Look how smug they are!

251
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,980
My words earlier

252
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,140
weren't just for Zhan,

253
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,460
but to prod your branch.

254
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:48,140
The First Branch once failed us,

255
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,220
but now

256
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,900
they're improving.

257
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,460
Your must

258
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,380
redouble your efforts

259
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,700
so that our entire family

260
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,900
can thrive.

261
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,500
Yes, Mother.

262
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,460
You're right, Mother.

263
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,260
Well then, you can leave now.

264
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,740
Master.

265
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,860
Don't lose heart.

266
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,020
What is Jiang Zhan?

267
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,420
At most

268
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,940
a lowly guard,

269
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,180
not like our Cang

270
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,860
who studies

271
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,100
hard and earnestly.

272
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,500
Though he is

273
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,980
a minor magistrate now,

274
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:25,860
his transfer to Ling'an

275
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,020
in a couple of years

276
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,580
will promise greatness.

277
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,060
As for that petty guard...

278
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:30,940
Enough!

279
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,580
Regardless of what Jiang Zhan is,

280
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,660
he remains Jiang blood.

281
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:42,980
You're being petty

282
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:43,860
and stirring up rivalry.

283
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,540
Do you want to

284
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,620
humiliate our branch even more?

285
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,540
Why lash out at me?

286
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:21,980
Master,

287
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,580
have you returned from Mother's place?

288
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,220
Now that Zhan has joined the Guard,

289
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,180
I'm afraid

290
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,940
Mother put pressure on our branch, right?

291
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,260
Even if I'm bitter about it,

292
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,220
what can I do?

293
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,260
My elder brother

294
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,860
is idle and irresponsible,

295
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,300
while I'm a civilian official,

296
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,350
what...

297
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,020
Master,

298
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,500
Zhan's joining the Guard

299
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,980
is a wise choice.

300
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,660
It suits his temperament perfectly.

301
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,340
What's your point?

302
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,180
I believe that while our two branches

303
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:13,620
compete for dominance,

304
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,340
in the end,

305
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,610
glory and ruin

306
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,820
bind us as one.

307
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,220
If Zhan succeeds,

308
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,420
it brings glory to our entire clan.

309
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,420
Should Cang

310
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,260
return to Ling'an in the future,

311
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,020
he could get a powerful ally.

312
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,180
That makes sense.

313
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:33,980
If Zhan succeeds

314
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,260
in the future,

315
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,900
it will be a win for everyone.

316
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,140
Shu,

317
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,100
you know me better than anyone.

318
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,700
Master, put your mind at ease.

319
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,180
Put my mind at ease.

320
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,300
At ease.

321
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,020
The Transport Commissioner's son?

322
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,540
He is kind of

323
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,460
rough-looking.

324
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,460
(He Zhiyuan)
Lingnan District Defender's son.

325
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,500
It's good that he's skilled in medicine,

326
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,340
but his appearance

327
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,580
doesn't match Jiang Qiao.

328
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,540
This one is good.

329
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,980
(Xiao Lang)
Lingbei Military Commissioner's son.

330
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,860
Prime lineage,

331
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,660
25 years old,

332
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,500
handsome, and imposing.

333
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,340
He bears old...

334
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,260
Old battlefield injuries.

335
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,300
No wonder

336
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,620
he's still unmarried at his age.

337
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,420
What kind

338
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,900
of matchmaker's list is this?

339
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,580
Not a single suitable candidate!

340
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,300
Then I'm going to turn them down.

341
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,660
No rush.

342
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,620
Military Commissioner.

343
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:58,340
The Military Commissioner rules a domain

344
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,380
and wields significant influence.

345
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,180
As a martial official,

346
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,260
his title sounds more prestigious

347
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,900
than the Imperial Insignia Guard.

348
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:08,750
In the past,

349
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,980
Qian had a valiant husband,

350
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,020
but he doesn't count anymore.

351
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,420
And Pei

352
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,300
married a civilian official.

353
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,700
We need to find someone

354
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,140
who commands military might

355
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,300
to bolster our standing.

356
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,620
He's physically frail,

357
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,540
but he comes from a distinguished family.

358
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,300
Marrying the Military Commissioner's son

359
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:37,180
would be a step up for Jiang Qiao,

360
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,420
her hard-won blessing.

361
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,140
Oh,

362
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,220
quickly

363
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,820
get Jiang Qiao's portrait

364
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,380
to the Matchmaker's Hall

365
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,660
so the Xiao Family can evaluate her.

366
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:49,820
Yes.

367
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,780
Good, good.

368
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,580
(Cultivate Virtue and Uphold Righteousness)

369
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,380
Mother, where is Qiao?

370
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,420
She went to see your lineal mother.

371
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,500
She should be back by now.

372
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:16,420
Qiao.

373
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:17,660
What's wrong?

374
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,620
What happened?

375
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,180
Come, have a seat.

376
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,020
Come.

377
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,220
Did she give you a hard time?

378
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,100
Have some hot tea. Take your time.

379
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,700
Here.

380
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,980
Ma'am is brokering my marriage.

381
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,860
Isn't it a good?

382
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,060
What family?

383
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,580
Not to your liking?

384
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,780
What goodwill does she harbor?

385
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,910
Look whom she matched

386
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,060
her own daughter with!

387
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,700
Qian ended up going far away to Lingxi,

388
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,140
not to mention Qiao.

389
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,660
Mother, help me.

390
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,020
Yes.

391
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,500
Explain it to me

392
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,780
in detail.

393
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,820
Ma'am summoned me to her chambers

394
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,620
and had someone

395
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,060
paint my portrait.

396
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,860
She is going to send it...

397
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,660
No,

398
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:12,980
absolutely not!

399
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,620
Why don't I have someone check it out?

400
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:15,860
No, I don't want to marry him!

401
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,260
What's the point of checking it?

402
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,340
Seeing Zhan join the Guard, she's trying

403
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,980
to use Qiao's marriage to please Master.

404
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:22,900
Qiao,

405
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,700
I haven't asked you

406
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,420
about your marriage prospects yet.

407
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,500
What kind of man do you wish to marry?

408
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:32,900
I don't want to

409
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,940
marry a stranger.

410
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,860
I want to marry someone I like.

411
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,540
I hope your wish come true.

412
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,780
What should I do?

413
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,180
Don't worry.

414
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,140
I'll find a solution for you.

415
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,380
Bravo!

416
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,820
The secret passage was no mere tunnel,

417
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,220
but a gauntlet of death.

418
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,860
One misstep

419
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,780
meant certain death!

420
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,500
Yet Li Qingyun,

421
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,460
with unmatched courage and wit,

422
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,540
defied every trap

423
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:20,260
until he reached the end

424
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,820
and found...

425
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:25,300
What do you think he found there?

426
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,820
Zhan, your expression

427
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,500
is different.

428
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,100
Joining the Guard has changed you.

429
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,380
- Sure.
- Exactly.

430
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,700
Everyone,

431
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,340
let's celebrate my son

432
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,860
becoming a guard.

433
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,900
It's not worth mentioning.

434
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,300
I'll toast with tea instead.

435
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,870
- Ok.
- Congratulations, Zhan.

436
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:45,720
Congratulations.

437
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:46,570
- Good job.
- Well done.

438
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,440
Ok.

439
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,580
Sit down, everyone.

440
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,340
Here's a small gift,

441
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,180
Mr. Jiang.

442
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,460
Mr. Yu.

443
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,420
This is carved with the ruyi motif.

444
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,580
May you find fortune and peace.

445
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,620
You're a member of the Guard now.

446
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,300
Though beyond battlefield duty,

447
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,780
let caution be your armor.

448
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,140
So your family may breathe easy.

449
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,620
Mr. Yu, I'm just a humble guard.

450
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:18,940
Yu Qi,

451
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,180
you are thoughtful.

452
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,180
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

453
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,340
Mr. Yu is right.

454
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,380
I too have embroidered an amulet pouch

455
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,460
as a celebration gift to you.

456
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,060
May you enjoy safety and peace.

457
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,060
Yi, I'm not a child anymore.

458
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,100
It feels odd to take gifts.

459
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:35,820
Zhan,

460
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,260
I also made you

461
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,100
a sachet.

462
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,260
I call it

463
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,180
"A Goose to Return".

464
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,940
However far it is,

465
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,820
whether it's warm or cold,

466
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,980
a wild goose will always return.

467
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,540
May you go to work and return

468
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,620
safe and sound every day.

469
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,140
Perfect!

470
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,060
I can't pretend anymore.

471
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,220
I love them all.

472
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,140
Thank you, guys!

473
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:57,700
Fantastic.

474
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,740
Welcome home, Pei.

475
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,100
Here, try this.

476
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,420
Pei, here.

477
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:05,940
Thank you, Father.

478
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,700
Why don't you eat, Qiao?

479
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,500
She might have a poor appetite.

480
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,140
Qiao, try a little.

481
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,460
Qiao, if you don't like the food,

482
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,420
we'll try another restaurant next time.

483
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,580
At least have a try.

484
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,180
Why are you crying?

485
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,420
What's wrong with her?

486
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,300
Master, I have a favor to ask.

487
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:40,580
What is it?

488
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,620
Ma'am is arranging a marriage for Qiao

489
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,580
with the Xiao Family, Military Commissioner.

490
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,140
Lingbei Military Commissioner?

491
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,540
He has got

492
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,660
a sterling reputation

493
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,020
with military laurels in their bloodline.

494
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,260
If this marriage comes to pass,

495
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,020
wouldn't that be a good match?

496
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,860
I've made inquiries.

497
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:05,980
It's their second legitimate son,

498
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,020
Xiao Lang.

499
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,900
He does himself with tonics and medicines.

500
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,580
He is a sickly man.

501
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,700
I've heard about that.

502
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,020
The family has a son renowned for his valor.

503
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,260
Unfortunately,

504
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,260
he suffered a debilitating injury in battle

505
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,780
and hasn't returned

506
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,740
to the field since.

507
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,540
It must be the same son

508
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,460
we're discussing.

509
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,020
Master,

510
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,660
all these years,

511
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,500
I've never asked you for anything.

512
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,500
You brought me into this house,

513
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,940
clothed and fed me,

514
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:40,940
and gave shelter to me.

515
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,780
But I have only two daughters.

516
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,340
I cannot bear to see Qiao

517
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,580
marry an invalid.

518
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,140
That's not fair.

519
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:53,060
Mr. Xiao served his country loyally

520
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,540
and earned himself

521
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,180
a sterling reputation.

522
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,100
But Qiao isn't joining the army for him.

523
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,460
What maiden

524
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,060
would choose to marry an invalid?

525
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,510
Raised with utmost care

526
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,860
by Mother and yourself,

527
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,340
how could she endure such hardships?

528
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,420
Marrying into that family,

529
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,500
what kind of life would she have?

530
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,420
Master.

531
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,620
Qiao, what do you think?

532
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:47,900
Father,

533
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,380
please don't make me go.

534
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,860
I'm not ready to marry yet.

535
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:16,780
Ok.

536
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,180
I see.

537
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,860
Today was truly wonderful.

538
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,700
The moon looks even fuller.

539
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,180
I wish this could

540
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,020
last forever.

541
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,020
If only I could have

542
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:43,860
"A Goose to Return" sachet.

543
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,020
Mr. Yu,

544
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,380
we see each other every day.

545
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,860
Where's room for "return"?

546
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,500
I'm from Yangui, meaning "Goose to Return".

547
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,260
Though it is

548
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,500
a border town,

549
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,660
chimney smoke weaves peace

550
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,140
and the people live in contentment there.

551
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,620
I love living in a town like that.

552
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,340
You think so?

553
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,580
Yes.

554
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,620
I've often dreamed

555
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,020
that if one day

556
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,060
I grow weary of Ling'an,

557
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,340
I'll retreat to a lush valley

558
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,020
with a plot of fertile

559
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,700
and a modest cottage

560
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,780
to live a simple,

561
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,340
untethered life there.

562
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,340
When the time comes,

563
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,820
I'll take Father,

564
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,220
Yi,

565
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,420
Zhan,

566
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:28,940
Chuchu,

567
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,500
Aman,

568
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,820
and Long Dan.

569
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:33,820
And,

570
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,260
and Er'niu too.

571
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,420
Good for you.

572
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,620
And you.

573
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,540
Will you come with us?

574
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,220
Of course.

575
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,780
Is this our agreement?

576
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:53,290
Sure.

577
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,740
Ok, I'll remember that.

578
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,860
Will you lie to me?

579
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,380
No way.

580
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,660
Actually, I...

581
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,100
You what?

582
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,940
I wanted to tell you

583
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:15,780
the moon looks fuller

584
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,620
and more beautiful.

585
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,660
Miss, you're in such high spirits.

586
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,700
Because of Mr. Yu, perhaps?

587
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,140
Not entirely.

588
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,740
When I think of having my family

589
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,740
gathered around

590
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,980
and a place to call home,

591
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,460
I realize how rare

592
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,100
and precious this is.

593
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,460
Aman,

594
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,020
if only days

595
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,140
could keep

596
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:04,940
unfolding

597
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,620
like this

598
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:08,780
forever.

599
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:20,740
Why meat again?

600
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,620
Haven't I told you

601
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:23,650
Ma'am follows a vegetarian diet?

602
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,300
Never mind.

603
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,140
Since I'm dining alone, I can't eat much.

604
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,180
I'll skip it.

605
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,900
Ms. Jiang Pei's returning

606
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,660
benefits the woman at Xiaoxiang Chamber.

607
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,300
Master Anmou specially ordered a feast

608
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,020
to dine in her chambers.

609
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,740
Having wormed her way in through back doors,

610
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,660
that temptress was just lucky.

611
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,500
What on earth does Master see in her?

612
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,900
He never tires of her after all these years.

613
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,220
Master.

614
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,260
Master?

615
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,140
Why are you here?

616
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,380
Hurry, fetch a pot of wine.

617
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,340
You haven't dined yet, right?

618
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,500
Perfect, come.

619
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,140
Let's dine together.

620
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,940
I need to have a word with you.

621
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,140
How can takeout

622
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,780
compare to home-cooked meals?

623
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,540
Here.

624
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,500
I'll drink with you.

625
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:31,780
I'll help myself.

626
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:43,580
Darling,

627
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,460
don't worry

628
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,660
about Qiao's marriage.

629
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,140
Just let them

630
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,340
handle it themselves.

631
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,020
I was wondering

632
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,700
what gust of wind carried you here.

633
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,900
Turns out it was Concubine Ruan's

634
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:03,980
whispering.

635
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,540
The reason doesn't matter.

636
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,100
Either way,

637
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,220
this is none of your concern now.

638
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:16,220
But I will meddle regardless.

639
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:22,980
What, does my word not matter?

640
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,300
As your

641
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,700
properly married wife

642
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,500
and the mistress

643
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,820
of the Earl Dongping's household,

644
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,420
arranging our children's marriage

645
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,900
is my rightful charge.

646
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,420
While your word is law,

647
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:41,820
we must uphold tradition.

648
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,940
Surely we can't disgrace our family

649
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:46,420
over a concubine-born daughter.

650
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,100
What's all the fuss about?

651
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,380
Has Ling'an run out of gossip?

652
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,500
Must everyone fixate on my daughter?

653
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:58,580
Besides,

654
00:29:58,940 --> 00:29:59,780
Pei's marriage

655
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:00,940
was arranged by her mother.

656
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,460
Look how well

657
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:04,020
she's doing now.

658
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,060
The fault lies

659
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,020
in your poor choice anyway.

660
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,620
As for Pei, I intended to betroth her

661
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,820
to Mr. Zhen Heng of the Capital Security.

662
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,540
They rushed

663
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,460
her marriage

664
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,700
while I was indisposed.

665
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:21,780
Master,

666
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,380
don't always

667
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:27,060
believe one-sided whispers.

668
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,300
Qiao ranks third

669
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,900
among our household's daughters.

670
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,740
Her youth is fading.

671
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,260
The child

672
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,500
is shy, reserved, and silent,

673
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,460
like a tomb

674
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,260
when taken out in public.

675
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,660
Arranging her marriage

676
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,860
is doubly challenging.

677
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,540
Moreover,

678
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,220
our household

679
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,900
isn't what it once was.

680
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,900
Jiang Si's engagement revocation

681
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,380
caused a scandal

682
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,460
in Ling'an.

683
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,420
Haven't we been mocked enough?

684
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,980
Must your daughter

685
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,740
follow suit?

686
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:04,700
Darling,

687
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,460
you're a mother yourself.

688
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,980
However Mr. Xiao shines in other aspects,

689
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,460
look into your heart and tell me,

690
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,220
do you truly believe

691
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,060
he is a good match for your daughter?

692
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:16,460
Mr. Xiao may be frail,

693
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,460
but his weak health

694
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,740
stems from battlefield valor.

695
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,620
He made military contributions

696
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,260
for His Majesty.

697
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:25,220
Countless men have made contributions

698
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,420
and His Majesty

699
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,260
favors many.

700
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,900
But you can't pick an invalid!

701
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,300
I know

702
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,820
you've held a grudge against Ruan,

703
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,780
but you can't

704
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,500
take it out on her daughter.

705
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,380
Master,

706
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,940
what grudge could I possibly

707
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,540
hold against her?

708
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,180
How could I take it out

709
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,820
on her daughter?

710
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,260
Master,

711
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,300
I'm doing this for your sake

712
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,860
and to uphold our dignity.

713
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,780
Zhan joined the Guard.

714
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,540
When we left Mother's chambers,

715
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,860
others might not know what was on your mind,

716
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,300
but do you think I didn't see your heart?

717
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,460
Say no more!

718
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,660
I've never seen

719
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,380
a mistress of any household

720
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,300
sowing discord

721
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,540
and twisting the truth like you.

722
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,740
Even at my worst,

723
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,620
I'd never scheme against my own daughter.

724
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:18,940
Darling,

725
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,180
not everyone is a pawn

726
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,260
to be exploited.

727
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:22,780
Did you

728
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,900
drive Qian away in the same way?

729
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,020
Unfortunately,

730
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,580
you arrived a step too late today.

731
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:35,900
What do you mean?

732
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,220
I have already agreed

733
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,540
to the Xiao Family's proposal.

734
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,220
The letter has been dispatched,

735
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,460
bearing the official seal

736
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,500
of Earl Dongping's Mansion.

737
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,500
You!

738
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,740
How do you act on your own authority?

739
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,780
Mother is aware of this.

740
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:52,620
Also, arranging our children's marriage is,

741
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:53,820
by custom and right,

742
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,060
my rightful charge

743
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,060
as their lineal mother.

744
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,060
Unreasonable!

745
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,380
If you truly object,

746
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,620
it doesn't matter.

747
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,260
Isn't it just a letter?

748
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,860
You can follow Ancheng's example

749
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,980
and go to the Xiao Mansion to destroy it.

750
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,180
You!

751
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,060
Master.

752
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:26,420
(Exquisite dice inlaid with red beans)

753
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,420
Exquisite dice inlaid with red beans,

754
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:41,220
do you know my bone-deep longing?

755
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,540
Miss, this is good.

756
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:46,820
No, no.

757
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,180
It's not reserved enough.

758
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,340
It's just a message of love.

759
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:52,780
What's so complicated about it?

760
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,460
You don't understand.

761
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,140
I'll try a few more.

762
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:23,060
(You give me a peach, and I return jade.)

That's it.

770
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:33,660
(Tianxiang House)

771
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,740
(Tianxiang House)

772
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,700
Chen hour, Jiuqu Pavilion, see the moon.

773
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,660
Seems Jiang Si

774
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,780
has a secret crush on Mr. Yu.

775
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,580
I care little for romantic matters.

776
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,260
Stick to business.

777
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,220
Don't be a spoilsport.

778
00:35:58,780 --> 00:35:59,820
Besides,

779
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,700
this is the business at hand.

780
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,740
What do you mean?

781
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:11,540
Jiang Si once posed

782
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,500
as Envoy Zhao Yu of the North Affiliate.

783
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,060
With the Nightingale Token,

784
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,940
she came to me to inquire about the Saintess.

785
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:23,580
What's the problem?

786
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:26,980
Later, I investigated her.

787
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,900
Born in Ling'an,

788
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,620
she's never left Dazhou.

789
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,660
How does a lady secluded in her chambers

790
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,420
know about the Saintess?

791
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,100
Moreover,

792
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:38,340
how does she know my perfume formulas?

793
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:42,460
Interesting.

794
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,180
If she is the Saintess,

795
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,860
her affection for Mr. Yu has brewed treason,

796
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:51,020
then she should be arrested and disciplined.

797
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,100
If not,

798
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,420
I would like to see

799
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,660
who she really is.

800
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,100
Miss, how about this dress?

801
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,500
The vibrant colors

802
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,060
accentuate your delicate charm.

803
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,380
Perhaps too many floral patterns.

804
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:52,660
Let's keep looking.

805
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:53,700
Yes.

806
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,180
Miss, this one is perfect! Perfect!

807
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,660
Such elegance

808
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,660
fits for a noble lady.

809
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:10,020
Aren't the embroideries too elaborate?

810
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:12,580
But many noble ladies

811
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:13,980
in Ling'an adore this style.

812
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,820
It appeals to young lords.

813
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:16,700
Really?

814
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,380
Let's look again.

815
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,380
How's it going? Ready yet?

816
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:28,660
Almost done.

817
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,380
Ok, you can turn around now.

818
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:37,140
So, how do I look in this?

819
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:38,780
Gorgeous!

820
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,780
What about that one?

821
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,180
Also looks great.

822
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,500
Both look great?

823
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,180
It's all because of your stunning looks.

824
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,820
No way, you have to pick one.

825
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,180
Don't put me on the spot, please.

826
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,860
I spend all day with those guys.

827
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,020
I don't know the first thing

828
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,260
about women's fashion.

829
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:54,460
No way.

830
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:55,820
You have to pick one.

831
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:56,980
Which one is actually better?

832
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:00,500
Here's what I think.

833
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,340
Does it feel comfortable on you?

834
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,340
If it does, it is great.

835
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,500
It has nothing to do with others' eyes.

836
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,100
But you're no mere "others".

837
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,380
Then answer me this.

838
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,700
If I changed my clothes today,

839
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,060
would that alter

840
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:13,900
your feelings for me?

841
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:14,900
Absolutely not.

842
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,140
Neither would I.

843
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,740
(Chen hour, Jiuqu Pavilion)
I found this

844
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:36,800
(See the moon)
in Liu Yan'er's room.

845
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,820
It's her help from Nanwu.

846
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,580
They're going to make a big move tonight.

847
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:43,780
This handwriting

848
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,180
looks like Jiang Si's.

849
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,420
Is she really Nanwu's Saintess?

850
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,100
There must be some misunderstanding.

851
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,340
Chief,

852
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,980
if Jiang Si truly is the Saintess,

853
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,300
the one who has been

854
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,700
manipulating the Nightingale Division

855
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,260
and deceiving you from the beginning,

856
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:14,900
can you kill her

857
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:15,740
without hesitation?

858
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,180
The flames are really blazing.

859
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:31,500
Mother.

860
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,020
Mother.

861
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:35,860
At this late hour,

862
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,340
what brings you here?

863
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:38,900
My family

864
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:41,460
sent me a silk quilt.

865
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:42,820
Its fabric

866
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,860
is delicate and smooth.

867
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,500
It feels comfortable against the skin.

868
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,820
Best of all, it's scented

869
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,860
with soothing herbs to help you sleep.

870
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,540
So I brought it over for you.

871
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,340
Such a fine gift!

872
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,180
I'll gladly accept it.

873
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,700
I appreciate this kindness.

874
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:02,820
Mother.

875
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:05,220
Take it inside and spread it for Mother.

876
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:06,580
Fu, go help.

877
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,380
No need. Let her take care of it.

878
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:09,540
You just brew the tea.

879
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:11,340
Well, Mother.

880
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:01,140
Did anyone see you at Mother's chambers?

881
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,140
No.

882
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,340
I was very careful.

883
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:07,100
But using the seal can't be hidden forever.

884
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:09,300
What shall we do if the Elder Lady

885
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,300
inquires later?

886
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:11,780
Relax.

887
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:13,180
I mentioned the marriage

888
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:14,940
to her,

889
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:16,140
and she didn't object.

890
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:18,500
Didn't we request

891
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:20,820
to use the family seal a few days ago?

892
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,260
Let's say

893
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,100
it was stamped then.

894
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:26,300
Even if she finds out,

895
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,740
it's not a serious offense.

896
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,460
Ma'am, why exert so much effort

897
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:31,860
for Ruan's daughter?

898
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:37,100
The more she resists,

899
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:39,500
the more I'll cement this marriage.

900
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:42,580
How dare she whine to Master?

901
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,740
Since she spurns my goodwill regardless,

902
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,740
I'll claim my due dignity

903
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,860
by crushing her defiance.

904
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:52,900
Tomorrow morning,

905
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,300
deliver this letter to the Xiao Mansion.

906
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:58,100
Yes.

907
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:05,100
