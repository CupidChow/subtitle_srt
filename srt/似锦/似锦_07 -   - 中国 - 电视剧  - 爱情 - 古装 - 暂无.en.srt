Chief, Chuchu is here.

Chuchu is here, Chief.

14
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,120
Qi.

15
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:51,650
Chief, Chief.

16
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:52,840
Hurry, Chuchu is here!

17
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,680
Qi.

18
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:56,850
Qi.

19
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:59,440
Chief, are you here?

20
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,760
Qi.

21
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:01,840
Are you here, Chief?

22
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:03,210
Stop!

23
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:09,890
Chuchu.

24
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,800
Long time no see.

25
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,800
Surprised? Unexpected?

26
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:17,890
So surprised.

27
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,050
What brings you to Ling'an?

28
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,000
I've been traveling around,

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,010
upholding justice,

30
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:26,810
and before I knew it,
I ended up in Ling'an.

31
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,050
Maybe it's fate,

32
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,210
sensing that you needed me.

33
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,210
As expected, as soon as I saw Long Dan,

34
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:33,490
I heard you were badly injured.

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,330
Let me see. Where are you hurt?

36
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:38,810
Let go.

37
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:41,490
Chuchu,

38
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,370
it's been so many years.

39
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,090
Can't you think of yourself
as a young lady?

40
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,380
What should a young lady do?

41
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,720
A young lady should follow rules,

42
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,960
stay away from men,

43
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,520
and get married when she's of age.

44
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:06,490
I got it.

45
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:09,210
You must've been pressured
into marriage,

46
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:10,520
so you ran away.

47
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,810
I have feet.

48
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:13,720
I can leave anytime.

49
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,810
This is walking freely in the world.

50
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:17,650
Good for you.

51
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,280
Miss Jiang.

52
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:27,330
Chuchu.

53
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,120
Why are you here?

54
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,930
I live next door,

55
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,400
so I came by to check on Commandant Yu.

56
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,650
You mean Qi?

57
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,210
He's inside. Come with me.

58
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,400
Are you friends?

59
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:41,860
Not only that.

60
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,270
My father is also in the military.

61
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,610
We grew up together.

62
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,120
Even our martial arts master

63
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,000
was the same.

64
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,450
But later,

65
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,450
Qi formed the Chiyu Cavalry

66
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,610
and went to a new camp.

67
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,940
That's when we parted ways.

68
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,490
(No wonder I've never seen her.)

69
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,050
(She's really straightforward.)

70
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,160
(Yu Qi's been hiding)

71
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,650
(the Chiyu Cavalry,)

72
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:00,930
(but it took her no time)

73
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,330
(to tell me everything.)

74
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,840
Miss Jiang,

75
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,170
how do you know Qi?

76
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,560
Because...

77
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,430
Because of official business.

78
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,720
Then I'll take you in.

79
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,800
OK, let's go.

80
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:15,490
Qi,

81
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,310
Miss Jiang is here to see you.

82
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,360
Commandant Yu.

83
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,450
Miss Jiang, please sit.

84
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,210
I won't get up to greet you.

85
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:27,130
Don't get up.

86
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,480
Based on your condition now,

87
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,570
you need a few more days
to recover from the poison.

88
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,530
But I need to report

89
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:35,040
to Capital Security asap,

90
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,720
or Mr. Zhen will think

91
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:39,520
I'm faking,

92
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,160
just staying here enjoying

93
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,010
the fine food you brought.

94
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:44,090
You have to rest

95
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:45,160
for a couple of more days.

96
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,680
Aman.

97
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,160
I made pigeon soup

98
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,130
for you today.

99
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,330
Miss Jiang, he's fine.

100
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,430
You don't have to feed him.

101
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,130
Qi,

102
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,090
what's wrong with you?

103
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:03,160
Just now, you were fine.

104
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,330
You wanted me to...

105
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:05,170
No.

106
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,840
Don't take care of me.

107
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,880
I can handle it.

108
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,640
Chuchu,

109
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,250
how long will you stay in Ling'an?

110
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,840
I didn't plan to stay long,

111
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,720
but since I ran into Qi and Long Dan,

112
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,530
I thought I'd stay a little longer.

113
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:20,250
Qi, will you find me annoying?

114
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,560
Of course not.

115
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:27,480
That's good.

116
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,890
Then we can hang out more.

117
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:29,850
OK.

118
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:32,210
Chuchu, go check

119
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:34,090
if the medicine Long Dan bought for me

120
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,530
- has arrived.
- Medicine?

121
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:36,370
Give it to me.

122
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:37,970
Thank you, Miss Jiang.

123
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:38,810
My pleasure.

124
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,480
Here, Mr. Yu.

125
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,130
I'll try it myself.

126
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:49,600
Can you handle it?

127
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:51,050
I can.

128
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,170
Let me.

129
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:01,570
Thank you, Miss Jiang.

130
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,770
You got hurt because of me.

131
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:22,800
It's only right

132
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,010
that I take care of you.

133
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,650
It's also a way for me

134
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,040
to make up for it.

135
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,560
By the way, Mr. Yu,

136
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,890
what would you like to eat tomorrow?

137
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:35,170
Tasty.

138
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,160
Anything tasty will do.

139
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:50,700
(Grand Princess's Mansion)

140
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,860
(Rongyang, Dazhou's Grand Princess)

141
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:13,620
Mother.

142
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,900
(Cui Mingyue, Rongyang's daughter)
Come in.

143
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,900
(Graceful and Dignified)
The Marquis is coming?

144
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,880
Mingyue,

145
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,600
have you heard

146
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,040
about Marquis Changxing's Mansion?

147
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,920
Of course.

148
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:25,400
They dug up

149
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,920
over a dozen corpses

150
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,250
in the mansion at once.

151
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,360
Such shocking news

152
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:31,770
spread throughout Ling'an

153
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,040
in no time.

154
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,200
Your Grace.

155
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,120
Mother.

156
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:43,130
How shameless Marquis Changxing is.

157
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:44,890
His son is so disgraceful,

158
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,890
yet he wanted me to be
his daughter-in-law.

159
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,880
Mingyue,

160
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,690
how many times have I told you

161
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:54,650
to be more respectful
to Marquis Changxing?

162
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:56,250
When Nanwu

163
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,210
invaded us,

164
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:00,090
he and your father

165
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,600
defended the country together.

166
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,210
He served the country

167
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:08,810
and once helped us.

168
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,090
So, Mother,

169
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,010
how are you going to save Cao Xingyu?

170
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:15,690
Do you have a good plan?

171
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,210
If you personally intervene

172
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:25,400
as the Grand Princess,

173
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:27,690
the Capital Security
will surely let him go.

174
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,400
The dead are

175
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,090
just lowly women.

176
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,570
If we give their families

177
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,170
some generous compensation,

178
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:35,600
everything will be

179
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,050
deescalated, right?

180
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:38,880
How did you come up with this?

181
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,530
I'm so clever!

182
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,810
You are too naive.

183
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,840
In the future,

184
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,840
I'll have your uncle help you find

185
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,170
the best man in the world.

186
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,330
But first,

187
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,480
I have to test him.

188
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,240
Only then

189
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,530
can I feel at ease.

190
00:08:58,970 --> 00:08:59,940
Mother, you're the best.

191
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,650
The Marquis seeks an audience.

192
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:07,130
Marquis Changxing.

193
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,720
Your Highness,

194
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,640
this is Golden Branch and Jade Leaf.

195
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,930
The branches are made of gold,

196
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:22,090
the flowers are made
of mutton-fat white jade,

197
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,880
and the leaves are made
of high-quality emerald.

198
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:27,090
I managed to get it with great effort

199
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:28,480
from Lingnan.

200
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,290
It's for Your Highness.

201
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,720
You came late at night

202
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,210
because of your son, right?

203
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:37,840
How insightful you are.

204
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,450
Zhen Heng from the Capital Security,

205
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,290
and Yu Qi, the new Commandant,

206
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,410
are bold and reckless,

207
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,480
disrespecting me completely.

208
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,690
They fabricated

209
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,210
some nonsensical reason

210
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:49,800
to imprison my son.

211
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,410
They even want to sentence him to death.

212
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:52,050
Your Highness,

213
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,520
you must stand for me.

214
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,520
Is this charge something you made up,

215
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,480
or is it true?

216
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,440
Your Highness,

217
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,690
everything I said is true.

218
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,530
I wouldn't dare fabricate it.

219
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:05,090
Your Highness, you know

220
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:09,690
he's my only son.

221
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,240
You ask me for help,

222
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,840
yet you won't tell the truth.

223
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,760
How am I supposed to help you?

224
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,600
I...

225
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,300
(Court, Capital Security)

226
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,480
Chief, how's your hand?

227
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:21,410
It's fine.

228
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:22,450
Take a look at this.

229
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,810
When we searched
Marquis Changxing's Mansion,

230
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:25,880
we found whips

231
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,720
and this

232
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,090
in the secret chamber.

233
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:30,760
I've asked Miss Chi about it.

234
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,450
Cao Xingyu calls this drug

235
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,360
Surreal Wander.

236
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,690
Before abusing them every time,

237
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,640
he would take one of them.

238
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,640
- This drug...
- Open it.

239
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,360
This drug

240
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:46,760
is effective.

241
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:57,120
How could he even take this?

242
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,090
Go ask the physician.

243
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,690
Does he have some chronic illness?

244
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:01,450
I've already asked.

245
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:02,290
He...

246
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,410
This drug...

247
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:08,930
Come on, spit it out.

248
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:11,640
It's an aphrodisiac.

249
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:16,690
One of the ingredients

250
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:18,240
is a plant called bianteng.

251
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:20,530
It only grows in Nanwu.

252
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,050
The physician said

253
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,840
he had only seen this

254
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,640
when Dazhou and Nanwu

255
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,640
were still trading,

256
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,570
but now it's banned.

257
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,240
Looks like Cao Xingyu

258
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,960
is guilty of more than just murder.

259
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:42,460
I was just worrying
about having no leads,

260
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:44,030
and now it's been delivered to me.

261
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:45,810
Report!

262
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,560
Mr. Yu.

263
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,570
Mr. Zhen.

264
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,090
Outside...

265
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:51,330
Go take a look.

266
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,520
What do Speed Guards do?

267
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,290
They're directly
under the Emperor's command

268
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,700
to investigate the people
and monitor the officials,

269
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:01,840
with more power than us.

270
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:04,330
The person who came today

271
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,360
is Commander Han Ran.

272
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,360
Impressive.

273
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,880
Mr. Han.

274
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,680
Mr. Han.

275
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:19,020
(Han Ran, Speed Guards Commander)

276
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,090
Marquis,

277
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,210
Grand Princess asked me to tell you

278
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,120
that she's aware of the situation
with the Capital Security.

279
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:27,720
Please rest assured.

280
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,570
Grand Princess said

281
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,810
you were a loyal general of the country,

282
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,290
and helping you was helping Dazhou.

283
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,800
(Luxurious and Gorgeous)
Her Highness

284
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,010
also said your son

285
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:39,210
would have to leave Ling'an

286
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,170
after this.

287
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:47,880
Please tell Her Highness

288
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:50,480
I'll send my rebellious son far away.

289
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,760
He'll never come back.

290
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:54,690
(Court)
I came today

291
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,880
for a man

292
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,690
at the Capital Security.

293
00:13:58,690 --> 00:13:59,530
Who?

294
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:01,210
Marquis Changxing's heir,

295
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,050
Cao Xingyu.

296
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:07,480
He is a major criminal in our office.

297
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,060
The case has not been concluded.

298
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,800
I'm afraid he can't go with you.

299
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,760
What a coincidence.

300
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,880
Cao Xingyu is also involved

301
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:17,570
in a case that we've been investigating

302
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:18,640
for many years.

303
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:23,640
It's about treason with Nanwu.

304
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,330
Mr. Han,

305
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:28,530
do you have any official documents?

306
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,290
I'm afraid

307
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:40,960
your vague words

308
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:43,000
can't convince anyone.

309
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,290
Mr. Yu, you've just taken office,

310
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,810
so you don't know about us.

311
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,690
The cases handled by Speed Guards

312
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,360
are confidential.

313
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:53,240
It's about the case.

314
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,330
Nothing can be disclosed.

315
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,320
Well,

316
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,860
I've got many matters to attend to.

317
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:01,050
Please

318
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:03,450
bring Cao Xingyu here now

319
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:04,530
and hand him over to me.

320
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:06,600
Cao Xingyu

321
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,720
has killed a dozen people.

322
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,330
He's a heinous criminal.

323
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,690
We haven't concluded the case.

324
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:16,050
If you want to take him away

325
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:18,000
without any explanation,

326
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,120
I'm afraid

327
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:22,210
we can't cooperate.

328
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,970
You serve the Emperor,

329
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:28,210
but this is also a serious case.

330
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:29,360
Everything

331
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,570
has to follow the proper order.

332
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:34,210
Since we captured him first,

333
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:37,210
we should be the ones
to interrogate him first.

334
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:48,450
Miss Chi is safe here.

335
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,680
Rest assured.

336
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,990
I've heard
about the Speed Guards' actions

337
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:53,730
this afternoon.

338
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:55,130
Thank you.

339
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,330
This really is

340
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,690
troubling you.

341
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,210
It's nothing.

342
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,720
I just didn't expect there to be a spy.

343
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:13,570
Miss Chi is inside.

344
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:14,890
You can go in now.

345
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:16,360
I won't go with you.

346
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,090
OK, I'll go check on her.

347
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,560
Come here.

348
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,840
This afternoon,

349
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,810
Aman...

350
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:31,530
Did you get the documents from Han Ran?

351
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,360
You rest. I'll go.

352
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,810
Don't let me rest.

353
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,880
By the way, Miss Chi,

354
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:49,520
do you need to send a letter

355
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,050
to your family first?

356
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,250
No need.

357
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,640
I have no family.

358
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:56,170
I was orphaned as a child,

359
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,230
and my brother
and sister-in-law took me in,

360
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,800
but they

361
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,120
sold me to a brothel.

362
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,930
Miss Si,

363
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,640
they don't care about family at all.

364
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:08,050
They only care about their interests.

365
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,880
When I settled down in the suburbs,

366
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,980
my brother and sister-in-law
heard about it

367
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,880
and rushed there overnight.

368
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:16,490
I thought

369
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,530
they were guilty and remorseful,

370
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,600
but...

371
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:24,360
I was such a fool.

372
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:27,530
How could I still expect
anything from them?

373
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:29,160
What are you saying?

374
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,560
You want me to marry Cao Xingyu

375
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,970
as a concubine?

376
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,330
Sister,

377
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,600
in your situation now,

378
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:40,440
who would want you?

379
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,090
That's Marquis Changxing's heir.

380
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:46,840
The dowries they sent

381
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,120
have filled our courtyard.

382
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,360
When I married

383
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,890
your brother,

384
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:53,210
it wasn't even this grand.

385
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,440
Once you marry the heir,

386
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,690
who would dare spread rumors

387
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:58,050
about your innocence?

388
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,360
We are thinking of you.

389
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,920
Thinking of me?

390
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:11,770
Before our parents passed away,

391
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,600
they entrusted me to you,

392
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,050
but you sold me to a brothel.

393
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,160
That's not enough, right?

394
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,290
So, you want me to suffer more, huh?

395
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:25,920
I was forced back then.

396
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,170
This is

397
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,210
such a good opportunity.

398
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,160
I want you to have a good life.

399
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,570
Looking back,

400
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,480
since they sold me

401
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,530
to the brothel,

402
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,680
I actually

403
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,680
lost my family.

404
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:41,160
Miss Chi,

405
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:42,920
when you escaped danger,

406
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:45,130
you still risked your life

407
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,250
to save others.

408
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:48,570
With such courage and spirit,

409
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:50,400
there's no obstacle you can't overcome.

410
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,680
You taught me that.

411
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:54,250
Miss Jiang,

412
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,360
you saved me without asking
for anything in return.

413
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:57,740
I will also follow your example

414
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,490
and help others

415
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:01,080
in need.

416
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:01,920
Rest assured.

417
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,730
With Commandant Yu and Mr. Zhen,

418
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:04,830
the truth of this case

419
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,490
will definitely come to light.

420
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:10,250
Thank you, Miss Jiang.

421
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:15,180
(Capital Security)

422
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,640
Cao Xingyu,

423
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,370
are you planning

424
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:21,970
to stay silent forever?

425
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,640
Open your eyes and take a look.

426
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,250
This thing

427
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:30,330
was found in your study.

428
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,680
It's called Surreal Wander, right?

429
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:41,050
What Surreal Wander?

430
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,720
I've never heard of it.

431
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,440
Never heard of it?

432
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:46,880
Then it's not yours.

433
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:51,360
Could it be your father's?

434
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,370
Shut up.

435
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:54,540
Fine, I won't talk about this.

436
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,000
Your father is so old.

437
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,170
This is... Wow.

438
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:59,490
- Yu Qi!
- Fine.

439
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:00,730
Let's not mention it.

440
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:03,220
Let's talk about something else.

441
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:07,330
Is this formula

442
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,680
from Nanwu?

443
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:13,040
I never imagined

444
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,680
that one day your family

445
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,600
would collude with Nanwu

446
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,970
and commit treason.

447
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:23,010
Yu Qi,

448
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,120
I'm telling you.

449
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,200
Don't you dare slander my family.

450
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:31,680
It was found in my study?

451
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,770
You're just framing me.

452
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,400
Good.

453
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,080
Based on your reaction,

454
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,290
I'm relieved.

455
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:39,490
I believe you.

456
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,640
Show him.

457
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,160
(Cao Xingyu, Marquis Changxing's heir,)

458
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:47,760
(is suspected of colluding with Nanwu.)

459
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:50,730
What does this mean?

460
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,970
You've been in the prison,

461
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:55,350
so it's normal for you not to know.

462
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:59,570
Speed Guards came earlier.

463
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,040
They wanted to take you away

464
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,430
on charges of colluding with Nanwu.

465
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,010
Cao Xingyu

466
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:07,250
was manipulated by Nanwu

467
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:10,200
to kill and bury the corpses.

468
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:11,730
Nanwu?

469
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,850
According to Speed Guards'

470
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:14,200
years of investigation,

471
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:16,000
Nanwu has sent spies

472
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,280
into Ling'an

473
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,920
and formed the Nightingale Division,

474
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:21,160
targeting our high-ranking officials

475
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:24,280
to gather intel
and turn them against us.

476
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,400
Marquis Changxing is our top general,

477
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:30,050
with significant power in the military,

478
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:31,970
and he also guards the Imperial City.

479
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,050
They repeatedly tested him

480
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:35,680
but made no progress,

481
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:37,240
so they focused their attention

482
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,280
on his son, Cao Xingyu.

483
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,770
They used drugs to control him,

484
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,200
forcing him to commit murder.

485
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,400
If this drug

486
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,050
can control Cao Xingyu,

487
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:50,400
why not directly control his father?

488
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,650
This is

489
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:56,450
Nanwu's tactic.

490
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:57,400
They want to turn

491
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:59,730
Marquis Changxing

492
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:01,880
against His Majesty.

493
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:06,050
What?

494
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:09,570
Are you trying to stop us

495
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:11,320
from taking away

496
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,440
our suspect?

497
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:13,690
Today,

498
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:14,930
you must hand over

499
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:16,730
Cao Xingyu,

500
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:17,890
whether you want to or not.

501
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:18,760
If we refuse,

502
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,120
will you fight us?

503
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:22,720
Aren't you afraid I'll report this

504
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,840
to His Majesty?

505
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,840
Go ahead.

506
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,810
Go and report it.

507
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,760
If you bring His Majesty's

508
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,250
handwritten edict today,

509
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,400
you can

510
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,560
take him away.

511
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,440
Otherwise,

512
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:37,970
don't think about it.

513
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:39,250
Three days.

514
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,390
You have only three days.

515
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,850
You don't know

516
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:45,560
how hard I worked

517
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,920
to protect you.

518
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:49,770
You should know

519
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,210
the consequences

520
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:53,120
if they get evidence

521
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:55,200
like this.

522
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,410
What do you want?

523
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:05,970
It's not about me.

524
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,400
It's about your explanation.

525
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:12,930
Where did the drug come from?

526
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:16,060
(Nightingale Division Stronghold)

527
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:39,900
(Sang Qi, a nightingale spy)

528
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,250
The Saintess appears; Nanwu thrives.

529
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:06,840
Senior, it's so late.

530
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,530
What's wrong?

531
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,900
(Du'er, Leader of Nightingale Division)

532
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,040
The Marquis Changxing's case

533
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,840
has been causing
quite a stir these days.

534
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:15,290
I heard

535
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,010
they had clues about Nanwu.

536
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,220
The Marquis's mansion
is under your watch.

537
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:21,490
What's going on?

538
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:23,360
Senior, listen.

539
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,440
Cao Xingyu is a lustful man.

540
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:28,120
I planned to use this

541
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,920
to make him our new pawn

542
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,010
in Ling'an.

543
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,400
But he's extremely foolish.

544
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:36,610
After torturing and killing

545
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:37,850
a dozen women,

546
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:39,880
he hid the bodies in his own garden.

547
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,200
But don't worry.

548
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,640
He was imprisoned for murder.

549
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,350
There's no connection to Nanwu.

550
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,560
However, my spy

551
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,120
in Speed Guards told me

552
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,530
that Han Ran was planning
to take him away

553
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,360
on charges of treason with Nanwu.

554
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,690
I'm sure

555
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:59,560
it's just a pretext
Marquis Changxing made up

556
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:00,770
to save his son.

557
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,600
There's no real evidence.

558
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,840
Senior,

559
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,810
you know how I work.

560
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:08,280
I never leave behind

561
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,770
the slightest trace.

562
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,920
Our division has been lurking
in Ling'an for ten years

563
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:23,090
to have this underground network

564
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,970
and hiding places.

565
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:28,160
Right now, the Saintess is missing,

566
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,970
and Dazhou hasn't fallen.

567
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:34,050
The road ahead is still long,

568
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:36,770
so every step must be steady.

569
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,120
Yes.

570
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,970
So, you're confident

571
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:44,000
that you can erase the Surreal Wander

572
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,090
before I discover it?

573
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:47,670
Senior, please calm down.

574
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,440
It happened so suddenly.

575
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:52,130
We didn't have time

576
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:53,830
to retrieve it
from the Marquis's mansion

577
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,530
before the Capital Security searched it.

578
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:02,770
Proceed with caution.

579
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,260
Don't get us implicated.

580
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:05,450
Yes.

581
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,120
Senior,

582
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:10,520
should I directly

583
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,260
silence Cao Xingyu

584
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,410
to eliminate future trouble?

585
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:13,250
No need.

586
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:14,770
Cao Xingyu is already useless.

587
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:16,490
No need to waste another move.

588
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:17,810
Remember.

589
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,120
The more you do,
the more mistakes you make.

590
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,360
Yes.

591
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:22,690
Leave.

592
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,780
What will the Capital Security do

593
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:32,120
about Cao Xingyu's case?

594
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:34,290
Will they let him go

595
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:36,730
or execute him?

596
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:42,970
There's a good show coming up.

597
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:44,930
What do you think?

598
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:46,240
Does this case have any connection

599
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,920
to the Nightingale Division?

600
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,530
They're in the dark,
while we're in the light.

601
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:52,120
They must be waiting

602
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:53,370
to see how we will

603
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:54,680
end this show.

604
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,200
Cao Xingyu's guilt is indisputable.

605
00:26:58,650 --> 00:26:59,530
If we release him,

606
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:01,610
the souls of the murdered women

607
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:03,290
will never have justice.

608
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,530
The Capital Security

609
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,730
will lose all credibility.

610
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,040
(Court)
If we execute him,

611
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,970
Marquis Changxing
will lose his only son

612
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:13,480
so he'll harbor resentment
towards the court

613
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,590
and develop ill intentions.

614
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,290
So, no matter what we choose,

615
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:17,970
it will benefit them

616
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,360
without backfiring.

617
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:22,200
What a poisonous strategy.

618
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:23,840
Now,

619
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,730
we truly are in a dilemma.

620
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:32,120
So, Mr. Zhen, what will you do?

621
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,360
Mozi once said

622
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:39,160
that the law is necessary

623
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,530
to rule the country.

624
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:43,460
Only when all people,
noble or humble, follow the law

625
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,440
can peace be achieved.

626
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:47,210
So,

627
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:51,250
following your heart
and adhering to the law

628
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:53,840
is the correct solution to this problem.

629
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:03,840
Miss Jiang,

630
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:05,600
the wrongdoer should be punished.

631
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,040
Should we just stand by

632
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,600
and watch that villain go free?

633
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,280
Should my daughter

634
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,250
die without justice?

635
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,440
Ms. Xiu, please calm down.

636
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:19,130
I have thought of a method,

637
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,200
but it's a bit risky.

638
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,610
I'm not sure

639
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:22,920
if you're willing to try.

640
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:24,450
Commandant Yu,

641
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,920
among the generals in Ling'an,

642
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,250
few are as wise, courteous,

643
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,880
and eloquent as you.

644
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,680
You must've read many books.

645
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:35,090
May I ask who your master was?

646
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:37,130
Why did you choose to study martial arts

647
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:38,360
instead of literature?

648
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:41,330
That's a long story.

649
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,970
For now, we should focus

650
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:45,770
on how to handle this case.

651
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,920
Even if we rule impartially,

652
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:49,670
we have to end it in three days.

653
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,450
If they come to take him then,

654
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:52,640
we'll have to hand him over.

655
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,400
When they get Cao Xingyu,

656
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:59,120
the testimony might change,

657
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,570
and they might find a Nanwu scapegoat.

658
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,970
Then the trial

659
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:06,770
would be meaningless.

660
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:07,970
You're right.

661
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,680
What should we do?

662
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:15,160
We should have His Majesty
preside over the trial.

663
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:17,320
We should ask His Majesty
to preside over the trial.

664
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,700
Candied hawthorn.

665
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,410
Sir, have a look.

666
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:31,570
We're in a bustling market.

667
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:33,080
You must not be seen.

668
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,900
(Eunuch Liu from the Palace)
What if someone

669
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:35,770
recognizes you?

670
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:40,920
Wait.

671
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:42,490
Stop.

672
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:44,450
Your Majesty.

673
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:46,880
Master.

674
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:48,880
Go buy a cold drink.

675
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,620
We're traveling incognito,

676
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,370
so we didn't bring many guards with us.

677
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:54,520
Only the Capital Security
is patrolling secretly.

678
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,650
It's unnecessary to me.

679
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:57,050
Stop talking and go buy it.

680
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:58,530
Yes.

681
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,320
Get me one.

682
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,360
Sure.

683
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:08,920
Take care.

684
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,560
Master.

685
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,080
Let's go.

686
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,600
Your Majesty,

687
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:41,880
I've been wronged.

688
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:44,120
Please seek justice for me.

689
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:48,490
Take her away.

690
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,240
Your Majesty!

691
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,090
Wait.

692
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,970
Ma'am.

693
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:13,100
(Emperor Jingming of Dazhou)
Continue.

694
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:13,970
Your Majesty,

695
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,120
I had no other choice

696
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,360
but to risk my life and appeal to you.

697
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:20,600
Please seek justice for me.

698
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:22,000
Please give justice

699
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,160
to my deceased daughter.

700
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,920
Why not report it?

701
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,390
The Capital Security wouldn't help?

702
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,120
The murderer holds a high position

703
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,970
and can cover up everything.

704
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,650
My daughter isn't the only victim.

705
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:39,330
He killed over a dozen young girls
of similar age.

706
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,560
The Capital Security

707
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,770
only just arrested him,

708
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:43,600
but before the case is closed,

709
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,160
someone is already intervening.

710
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,250
It's likely he'll be released

711
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:50,680
in a few days.

712
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:53,810
Who is so audacious?

713
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,290
Cao Xingyu,

714
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:57,880
Marquis Changxing's heir.

715
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,930
(Graceful and Dignified)
I never expected

716
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:05,490
something to go wrong with my son.

717
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:06,600
Sorry for the trouble.

718
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:09,040
Your Highness, you are influential.

719
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:09,970
Your words matter.

720
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:12,080
I hope you can help me once more.

721
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:13,880
If I can overcome this obstacle,

722
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:18,370
I will follow your lead

723
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:19,760
without hesitation.

724
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,250
You've become too greedy.

725
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,600
I was deceived by you before,

726
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,480
so I tried to help out of goodwill.

727
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,160
That's the limit of my kindness.

728
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:30,970
Yet your son committed a heinous crime.

729
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:33,440
Perhaps this is his fate.

730
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,320
Marquis,

731
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,970
it's time to accept your fate.

732
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,080
Fate?

733
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:51,290
Is this my fate?

734
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:56,800
I beg your pardon for my rudeness.

735
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,800
Now, don't you think

736
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,970
it's too late for you

737
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:01,480
to distance yourself from me?

738
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,850
If you accidentally caused harm,

739
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:05,680
then that too is your fate,
Your Highness.

740
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:07,640
Since you're ungrateful,

741
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,640
fine.

742
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:11,200
Present it to the Marquis.

743
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,240
Your son

744
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,920
traded the intelligence of Dazhou

745
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,850
for Surreal Wander

746
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:20,690
with Nanwu's Nightingale Division

747
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:22,200
to satisfy his lust.

748
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,720
Impossible.

749
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,970
This is impossible!

750
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,170
My son, however outrageous,

751
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:28,720
would never do such a thing.

752
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,880
This must be slander!

753
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:31,840
It's fine.

754
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:34,160
Speed Guards

755
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:37,050
have many letters like this.

756
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:39,770
Whether it's a misunderstanding

757
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,200
is clear in the letters.

758
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:45,850
Your Highness, I deserve to die.

759
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:47,200
Please forgive me.

760
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:49,010
Please tell me

761
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,730
what I should do.

762
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:54,440
This is a farce.

763
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:56,440
It's time for it to end.

764
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,250
Although my son is rebellious,

765
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:00,970
he's still my only son.

766
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:01,810
Your Highness!

767
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,880
If it were just a dozen young women,

768
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:07,730
the most it'd cost
is the life of the heir.

769
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,970
But this is treason.

770
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,160
Your entire family

771
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:14,800
cannot be spared.

772
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,570
What's more important?

773
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,370
Do I need to say more?

774
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:33,490
Since you

775
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:35,290
brought this treasure

776
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:36,890
(Graceful and Dignified)
from Lingnan,

777
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,800
I cannot take this from you.

778
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,280
I've admired it enough.

779
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:43,600
It's time for you to take it back.

780
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,680
Golden Branch and Jade Leaf.

781
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:56,890
Just as the name suggests.

782
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:14,740
(Tiande Hall, Palace)

783
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,520
Your Majesty.

784
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,800
With both witness and physical evidence,

785
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:30,530
what can you argue?

786
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:31,650
Father.

787
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:33,610
Father.

788
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,000
Your Majesty, I...

789
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:36,840
Your Majesty.

790
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:38,600
I'm guilty.

791
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,470
Do not speak recklessly.

792
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:41,110
Cao Yong.

793
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:44,860
A father should be responsible
for his ill-bred child.

794
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,680
Since my son was young,

795
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:49,200
whenever his father
was unsatisfied with him,

796
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,320
he'd receive a cruel beating.

797
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,850
I was weak and useless,

798
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:55,930
so I failed to stop him.

799
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:58,760
As his parents, we bear great sin

800
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:01,730
for what he's done.

801
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,080
Enough! Shut up!

802
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,570
Don't you dare hit my mother!

803
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:09,770
Your Majesty,

804
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,090
we failed to teach our child,

805
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:15,120
so he has gone astray.

806
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,680
Your Majesty,

807
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:18,970
please

808
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:20,680
spare his life.

809
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,320
Mother.

810
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,360
Mother.

811
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:24,210
Mother.

812
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,000
Mother.

813
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:31,760
If I show mercy to the heir,

814
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:33,570
what will happen to the law?

815
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:49,200
A life for a life.

816
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:53,720
Before I came here,

817
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:55,890
I poisoned myself.

818
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,240
I hope my life

819
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,050
can soothe the souls.

820
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,400
Mother.

821
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:04,690
Mother.

822
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:05,880
Mother!

823
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:07,330
Mother, I'm sorry.

824
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:09,280
Mother, Mother!

825
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,490
Mother!

826
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,640
Spread His Majesty's decree:

827
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,250
Cao Xingyu, Marquis Changxing's heir,

828
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:40,890
kidnapped common women, abused his wife,

829
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:43,280
and trampled on human life.
His crimes are unforgivable.

830
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,200
He will be executed after the autumn.

831
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,480
Cao Yong, Marquis Changxing,
failed to educate his son.

832
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,090
Considering his military achievements,

833
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,450
his title will be retained

834
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:53,530
but will not be inherited.

835
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:56,640
The decree becomes effective
upon arrival.

836
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:04,260
(Tiande Hall)

837
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,290
How considerate of you.

838
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:07,200
I'm sorry.

839
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,250
How did she manage

840
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:09,490
to tell me this?

841
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:11,100
How did she recognize me

842
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,160
among all those palanquins

843
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,120
in the street?

844
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,480
I shouldn't have

845
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,050
used my position in the Capital Security

846
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:18,160
to force Your Majesty

847
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,770
to interrogate Marquis Changxing's heir.

848
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:21,320
This trial today

849
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,120
has cost Marquis Changxing his heir

850
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:25,290
and his wife.

851
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:27,200
Do you know who Marquis Changxing is?

852
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:28,320
I do.

853
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,400
In terms of loyalty,

854
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,050
you two have risked your lives

855
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:33,690
to serve the country.

856
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,160
In the court,

857
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,170
he's one of your trusted officials.

858
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:38,570
Today, Your Majesty's actions

859
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:40,280
have chilled his heart.

860
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:42,450
In the future,

861
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,160
he may never again serve the country.

862
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:45,730
But, Your Majesty,

863
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:47,090
I had no other choice.

864
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:49,970
What's more important, a dozen lives

865
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:51,290
or the Marquis's son

866
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:53,010
who should've been punished?

867
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:54,680
I'm too short-sighted

868
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:56,890
to think of something better.

869
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:58,050
Are you saying

870
00:38:58,370 --> 00:38:59,970
I can't tell right from wrong

871
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,810
and I can't tell
which is more important,

872
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:04,480
a dozen lives or Cao Yong's son?

873
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,970
Of course, Your Majesty can tell,

874
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,640
so you are

875
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:09,160
so painful right now.

876
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:16,820
(Since I returned to the 23rd year
of Jingming,)

877
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:19,010
(Qiaoniang and Ji Chongyi
have got married,)

878
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,890
(and Cao Xingyu's been imprisoned.)

879
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,970
(Everything has changed.)

880
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,160
(If that's the case,)

881
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,600
(I can surely change the fate)

882
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:27,840
(of my brother,)

883
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:29,600
(sister,)

884
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:32,090
(and father.)

885
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:37,850
Commandant Yu,

886
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,930
why didn't you enter the Palace?

887
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:42,850
I just need to hear the result.

888
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:46,800
I'm a little thirsty,

889
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,520
so I came to see you

890
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,760
for some water.

891
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:52,010
Waiter, a cup of tea.

892
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,800
Please enjoy.

893
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,260
It's what everyone expected.

894
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,320
The innocent women who died tragically

895
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:05,280
can finally rest in peace.

896
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:08,120
His mother committed suicide on the spot

897
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,970
to atone for his sins.

898
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:13,240
His mother is truly pitiful.

899
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,680
For the sake of her son,

900
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:16,680
she killed herself as an apology.

901
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:17,760
Pitiful?

902
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:20,410
Her son caused such a disturbance

903
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:22,000
in the house.

904
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,240
Her daughter-in-law
was beaten every day.

905
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:26,410
As the mistress of the house,

906
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,320
how could she know nothing?

907
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,970
I think she must have

908
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,570
turned a blind eye.

909
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,520
No matter what,

910
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,970
all mothers in the world

911
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,320
love their children the most.

912
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,200
Cao Xingyu's mother was like that,

913
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:43,890
and so was my shrewd

914
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:44,730
and calculating aunt.

915
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:48,240
You've been in the Capital Security
for years.

916
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,370
I know you very well.

917
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,640
You could think of ways to seek justice

918
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,570
for the lives of dozens,

919
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,930
but you couldn't have that woman

920
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,120
come to me.

921
00:40:58,410 --> 00:40:59,600
Don't tell me

922
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,640
this was

923
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,890
that woman's idea.

924
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:04,800
Tell me. Who is it?

925
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,490
Just tell me.

926
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,970
I won't punish you.

927
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:12,810
Your Majesty,

928
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,770
I have a friend.

929
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:16,720
Whenever I have difficulty
handling a case,

930
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:18,320
I go to discuss it with him.

931
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:20,490
He has a sharp sense of right

932
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:22,290
and often thinks
of surprising solutions.

933
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:23,610
This time,

934
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,320
he came up with this idea for me.

935
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:27,850
Is he

936
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:29,120
serving in the court?

937
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:30,330
Yes, he's the new commandant

938
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:31,600
of the Capital Security,

939
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:32,650
Yu Qi.

940
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:34,600
Yu Qi?

941
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,530
In this vast world,

942
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,250
there are surely mothers

943
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,340
who don't love their kids.

944
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,970
Are you talking

945
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:46,530
about your mother?

946
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,930
I'm afraid I don't have that chance.

947
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:51,450
The deceased is gone.

948
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:52,780
My condolences, My Lord.

949
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:53,770
You misunderstood.

950
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,050
I'm saying

951
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:01,160
I was abandoned as a child,

952
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:05,330
and she never

953
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:06,320
cared about me.

954
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,490
So, in my heart,

955
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,370
there's no such person.

956
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:14,720
Then, over the years,

957
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,530
you never looked for her?

958
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,520
Perhaps back then,

959
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,010
she had an unspoken reason.

960
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:21,720
I never looked for her.

961
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,090
Unspoken reason?

962
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,090
A fortune-teller back then

963
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,780
once said I was an unlucky child

964
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,600
and would bring disaster to the family.

965
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,640
Out of fear of being implicated
and losing favor,

966
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:39,370
she came up with a plan

967
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,160
to have my father

968
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,450
send me far away.

969
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:43,570
That's it.

970
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:48,110
(Last time,)

971
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:50,020
(The South)
(he refused to talk about this.)

972
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:52,320
(I only know that he wasn't favored
by his relatives)

973
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:54,200
(so he was exiled to the frontier.)

974
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:55,690
(I never expected)

975
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,760
(that he and I had such similar fates.)

976
00:42:58,330 --> 00:42:59,170
(From birth,)

977
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:01,120
(we carried an ominous label.)

978
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:04,940
