Mr. Zhou, please come inside.

Mr. Zhen and Mr. Yu

14
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:47,150
have been waiting for you.

15
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,270
Please.

16
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:58,710
Mr. Zhou.

17
00:01:59,150 --> 00:01:59,990
Mr. Zhou.

18
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,190
Mr. Zhen.

19
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,150
Come on in.

20
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:05,990
Please.

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,160
Mr. Zhen, you're too kind.

22
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,400
My pleasure. Please, take a seat.

23
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,590
Mr. Zhou, your imposing presence

24
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,790
and remarkable demeanor

25
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,280
are almost intimidating!

26
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,120
Pour the wine.

27
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,030
Mr. Zhen,

28
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,880
what's this for?

29
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,040
I fear we offended you last night.

30
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,040
Mr. Yu and I

31
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,480
prepared this meal specifically

32
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,640
to make amends.

33
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,440
Thank you, gentlemen.

34
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,800
Here's to you.

35
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,920
From a military background,

36
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,160
I'm unversed

37
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,510
in the ways of the official circle.

38
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,670
I beg your understanding, Mr. Zhen.

39
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,560
Let the wine speak for us. Come on.

40
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,400
Ok.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,110
Isn't this a case

42
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,600
of family

43
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,270
turning against family?

44
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,670
Exactly, exactly.

45
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,920
Mr. Zhou,

46
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,990
you may not know,

47
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,550
Commandant Yu

48
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,880
hails from the South Chiyu Cavalry

49
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,560
and only recently assumed his post

50
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,480
in Ling'an.

51
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,670
No wonder he seems unfamiliar.

52
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,760
At first glance,

53
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,510
his exceptional bearing

54
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,270
marks him as a valiant warrior,

55
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,240
a true blessing to us all.

56
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,560
I'm flattered, Mr. Zhou.

57
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,640
Here is to you.

58
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,790
This stupid thing

59
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,830
is really in the way!

60
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,920
Mr. Zhen,

61
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,710
I have to thank you.

62
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,040
You've worked hard.

63
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,150
Cheers.

64
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,360
Mr. Zhou,

65
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,120
take a look.

66
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,740
Is this your name?

67
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,910
(Contractor: Zhou Yi)

68
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,360
Yes, I signed it.

69
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,830
Look, isn't this my name?

70
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,000
This contract

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,230
came without effort,

72
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,360
Mr. Zhen.

73
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,600
You check it. I'll be right back.

74
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,360
Fill it.

75
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,640
Thank you, Mr. Zhen.

76
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,910
Look carefully, Mr. Zhou.

77
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,320
Did you sign it?

78
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,880
Yes, I signed it.

79
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,830
To my shame,

80
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,200
I owed 1,000 taels in gambling debts.

81
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,390
They wouldn't let me go until I signed.

82
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,270
Those thugs' petty tricks

83
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,350
are not worth mentioning.

84
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,270
Mr. Yu,

85
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,560
are you putting on a blade show?

86
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,230
Come on.

87
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,360
Tens of thousands

88
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,120
of our Chiyu Cavalrymen

89
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,510
were killed in action!

90
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,950
Yet you signed such a humiliating treaty.

91
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,640
Mr. Yu, please don't.

92
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:09,680
Swords have no eyes.

93
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,270
Watch out, Mr. Zhou.

94
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,240
- You tell me...
- Be careful, Mr. Zhou.

95
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,880
- Mr. Zhou!
- Watch out, sir!

96
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,590
Mr. Zhou.

97
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,830
Don't be afraid.

98
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,640
Mr. Yu has always been hot-headed.

99
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,320
Just tell him

100
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,560
what he wants to know.

101
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:30,800
No, no.

102
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,640
Speak!

103
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,680
Alright, I'll talk.

104
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,840
I'll talk. I'll talk.

105
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,840
I'll talk.

106
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,760
I owed them 1,000 taels in gambling debts

107
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,240
and asked for a few days' extension,

108
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,560
but they refused.

109
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,800
Then they pressed me

110
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,440
about my role

111
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,350
in the autumn hunting

112
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,680
and I told them everything.

113
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,880
What are you doing?

114
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,320
Don't kill me!

115
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,800
I'll do anything!

116
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,680
Anything!

117
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,520
Anything?

118
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,760
Anything, yes!

119
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,860
(Banker)

120
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,940
(Contractor: Zhou Yi)

121
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,680
You're with the Nightingale Division!

122
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,320
Once it is done,

123
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,870
your 1,000-tael debt

124
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:19,800
will be erased,

125
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,800
and we'll return the contract.

126
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,910
This isn't a contract.

127
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,240
It's a death warrant!

128
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,510
What we ask is simple.

129
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,110
Don't worry.

130
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,590
In the autumn hunting,

131
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,440
replace all the procession's candles

132
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,390
with what I gave you.

133
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,200
That's all.

134
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,390
Cut the crap!

135
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,350
Get to the point.

136
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,800
They are with the Nightingale Division.

137
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,510
I had no choice.

138
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:55,790
They promised

139
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,040
if I replaced all the procession's candles

140
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,320
with theirs,

141
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,390
my 1,000-tael debt

142
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,470
would be written off,

143
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,590
and they'd return the contract.

144
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,800
The candles they gave you

145
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,120
won't light, right?

146
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,560
You're right, Miss.

147
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,400
Exactly.

148
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,190
But thinking it through,

149
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,950
what harm could there be?

150
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,870
His Majesty will have returned

151
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,000
to the palace before dark.

152
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,320
The candles wouldn't even be needed.

153
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:26,800
I have no idea

154
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,760
what they're really planning.

155
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,880
I've recorded

156
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,910
everything he just said.

157
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,270
Seems the Nightingale Division

158
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,150
anticipated the solar eclipse

159
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:40,080
and aimed to exploit it.

160
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:43,950
This serves as solid evidence.

161
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:54,150
Mr. Zhen, please help me!

162
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,670
Mr. Zhou,

163
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,880
your treason

164
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,590
is proven beyond doubt.

165
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,350
That's a capital offense.

166
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,800
I beg you!

167
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,950
I've already told you

168
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,680
I was coerced!

169
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,560
I've told you everything I know!

170
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,680
Oh, oh...

171
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,350
Mr. Zhou,

172
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,710
perhaps you should think again.

173
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,310
See if you can

174
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,640
recall more

175
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,240
and give me a reason

176
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,270
to spare your head.

177
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,760
- Don't keep threatening me.
- Mr. Zhou,

178
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,080
don't be nervous.

179
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,320
Think carefully.

180
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,360
If you can provide

181
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,560
something more valuable,

182
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,870
perhaps

183
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,160
Mr. Yu will spare your life.

184
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,470
Think, think.

185
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,090
I'm thinking.

186
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:51,510
Let me think.

187
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,590
Oh,

188
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,320
there is a Palace Woman

189
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,230
with the Food Service

190
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,750
named,

191
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,120
named Aling.

192
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,280
Yes, Aling.

193
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,390
Her brother

194
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,830
also lost money gambling.

195
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,870
I saw her

196
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,590
bail him out myself.

197
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,200
If she's accompanying the hunting,

198
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:13,520
I bet

199
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,840
she'll tamper

200
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,590
with His Majesty's meals!

201
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,950
Help sketch her likeness.

202
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,920
- Can you do it?
- Yes.

203
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,320
Good.

204
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,320
Long Dan.

205
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:26,920
Mr. Zhou,

206
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,710
be careful.

207
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,710
Does this count as atonement?

208
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,280
Please, please.

209
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,200
- I'll go sketch her.
- Hurry up!

210
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,400
Watch your blade.

211
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,350
Given the gravity of this matter,

212
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,470
I must draft a memorial

213
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:46,510
to His Majesty immediately.

214
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:47,630
- No.
- No.

215
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,280
We don't know how many spies

216
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,030
have been planted in the palace

217
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,080
through this gambling den.

218
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,950
If your memorial is discovered,

219
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,080
it could force them

220
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,160
to alter their plans,

221
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,400
making them even harder to predict.

222
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,230
Exactly.

223
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,440
The enemy is exposed; we're hidden.

224
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,160
Rather than baiting them out,

225
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,280
let them walk into the trap.

226
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:20,340
(Jiang)

227
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:37,630
Is it enough, Miss?

228
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,030
The water is freezing.

229
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,280
How can you bathe in this?

230
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:51,750
You did well.

231
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,200
Here, take this.

232
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,560
Don't tell anyone.

233
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,680
Leave now.

234
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,520
Thank you, Miss.

235
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,470
How is she?

236
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,400
She has a fever from the cold.

237
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,510
Take the prescribed medicine, stay warm,

238
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,230
and she'll recover in a few days.

239
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,750
- Thank you, doctor.
- Certainly.

240
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,920
How did she get such a high fever?

241
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,400
This isn't even the season for colds.

242
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,440
I have something to ask you.

243
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,790
She really knows how to pick

244
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,680
the worst timing to fall ill.

245
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,390
The Xiao Family has their sickly one,

246
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,840
and we've got our frail one.

247
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,400
How can they go on a blind date?

248
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,080
Presumably, it's their trick.

249
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,720
Fever at this timing,

250
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,920
Concubine Ruan

251
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,320
is probably

252
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,630
playing some trick.

253
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,950
She really spares no expense.

254
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,630
Shall we use strong medicine

255
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,200
to speed her recovery?

256
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,230
No.

257
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,520
Pick her a dress

258
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,080
and jewels,

259
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,200
the finest ones.

260
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,360
As long as she's breathing,

261
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,590
she'll show up radiant.

262
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,950
- I don't believe
- Yes.

263
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,520
I can't break her defiance.

264
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:14,440
Are you just going to stay sick

265
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,710
and ruin your health?

266
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:19,230
Mother,

267
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,590
you know already?

268
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,160
Tomorrow's matchmaking meeting,

269
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,560
the Xiao Family won't be pleased

270
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,630
to see me gravely ill.

271
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,510
If I'd known

272
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,630
this was your plan,

273
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,040
I wouldn't have allowed your recklessness.

274
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,470
I don't want to cause more trouble,

275
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,720
leading Grandma and Father

276
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,200
to blame you again.

277
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,160
This meeting is unavoidable.

278
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,630
Given the circumstances,

279
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,670
no matter what Mr. Xiao

280
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:47,910
is like,

281
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,230
I refuse to be tied to him.

282
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,680
This is my only recourse.

283
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,230
My poor Qiao.

284
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,990
I should be blamed for incompetence.

285
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,800
Mother,

286
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,110
don't say that.

287
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:14,340
(Cultivate Virtue and Uphold Righteousness)

288
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,240
Ma'am prepared these for Miss Qiao's

289
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,630
matchmaking meeting tomorrow,

290
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,520
all the finest.

291
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,160
Qiao is seriously ill.

292
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,320
How can you still think of the meeting?

293
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,750
Mind your words.

294
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,830
The Xiao Family is a distinguished line.

295
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,910
With Miss Qiao's radiant presence,

296
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,120
the entire household

297
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,040
stands to gain greater prestige.

298
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,720
As for the fever,

299
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,960
rest properly today.

300
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,920
A night's sleep

301
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,470
will surely bring improvement.

302
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:45,870
What kind of talk is that?

303
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:46,710
Mother.

304
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,680
Thank you.

305
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,750
Too bad Pei left so soon.

306
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,080
She should've seen

307
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,200
Ma'am's kindness

308
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,480
to decide if she'd still

309
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,630
do you a favor.

310
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:05,920
Favor, seriously?

311
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,110
Mother,

312
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,950
forced fruit won't ripen sweet.

313
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,680
Since Qiao resists,

314
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,750
I beg you to show mercy

315
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,040
and not to force her.

316
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,950
If I may speak plainly,

317
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,630
Ms. Jiang Pei is far more resourceful

318
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,110
than before.

319
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,320
I shall take my leave now.

320
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,830
I misjudged Pei.

321
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:38,830
I wronged her

322
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:40,360
and uttered

323
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,560
so many harsh words.

324
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,350
How heartbroken she must be.

325
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:45,510
I'm no better.

326
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,590
I didn't try to keep her,

327
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,320
assuming it was a momentary lapse.

328
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,920
In hindsight,

329
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:54,920
how disheartened she must have been.

330
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,350
They haven't come.

331
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,110
What's this?

332
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,280
Don't worry and go ahead, Miss Qiao.

333
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,520
The Xiao Family won't come.

334
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,390
This...

335
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,110
How could the Xiaos

336
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,040
break their promise?

337
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:17,720
We've waited a whole day

338
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,830
without even a message.

339
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:20,240
Enough, enough.

340
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:23,110
We've done all we could in good faith.

341
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,960
Is this truly over?

342
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,110
Of course.

343
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:28,680
How can we forge a marriage alliance

344
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,320
with a family putting on airs

345
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,280
at the first meeting?

346
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,150
Blame that Xiao woman

347
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,390
for picking such a family.

348
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,480
Father,

349
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,670
don't upset yourself.

350
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,430
Qiao, you've borne enough these days.

351
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,830
You're still unwell.

352
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,430
Go rest now.

353
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,240
- I'm leaving.
- Alright.

354
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,480
My goodness.

355
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,320
Mother, this is wonderful!

356
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,390
Oh, who told you to deliver the letter?

357
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,040
Please wait. I'll bring her.

358
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,480
Finally, it's all over.

359
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,590
It's for the best

360
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:09,870
this match didn't happen.

361
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,910
Mother, Qiao.

362
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,040
Pei?

363
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,080
Pei?

364
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:23,110
Was it you?

365
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,870
Come, sit down. Let's talk seated.

366
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,760
You didn't return to your husband's family?

367
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,150
I stayed at an inn for a few days.

368
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,190
How could I see you

369
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,560
with this matter unsolved?

370
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,630
How exactly did you manage it?

371
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,760
I wrote to my husband.

372
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:40,000
His family,

373
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,630
leveraging ties to the Xiaos,

374
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,670
learned of the letter's dispatch time.

375
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,150
They told the messenger they'd deliver it.

376
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,590
In fact,

377
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:48,910
they secretly

378
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,150
intercepted the letter.

379
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,480
With no reply reaching the Xiaos,

380
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,510
they naturally assumed

381
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,720
we were not interested.

382
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,040
So, they wouldn't come.

383
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,670
I owe this to you.

384
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,310
I misjudged you so harshly before.

385
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,480
I'm sorry, Pei.

386
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,960
I was blind to the truth.

387
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,390
Actually,

388
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,280
I've been reflecting these days.

389
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,550
I was

390
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,110
headstrong and impulsive in the past,

391
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,350
always getting into trouble.

392
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,830
But you still regarded me

393
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,910
as family.

394
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:18,520
So, there's no way

395
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,670
I can hold a grudge this time.

396
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,760
I was wrong too.

397
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:24,150
See,

398
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,110
I have two such good daughters.

399
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,910
I failed to see clearly.

400
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,240
My Pei has grown up.

401
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,320
You've gotten smarter, Pei.

402
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,390
I was never stupid.

403
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,670
I have to go now.

404
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,440
I returned secretly

405
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,080
to visit you this time.

406
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,320
Let it be assumed

407
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,350
I left for my husband's family that day.

408
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,830
Even if the intercepted letter

409
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:48,910
is discovered someday,

410
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,430
it'll be hard to trace back to me.

411
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,080
This way, everyone stays safe.

412
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:54,190
Alright, we'll follow your lead.

413
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,960
You must be careful.

414
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,680
Come back whenever you can,

415
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,590
and write often.

416
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,350
As long as our hearts remain united,

417
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,080
we'll never truly part.

418
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,460
(The autumn wind hunts)

419
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,720
Come on, try this.

420
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,560
Is this the Nanwu language?

421
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,190
Know your enemy as yourself

422
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,830
and you can prevail in every battle.

423
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,960
I believe

424
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,040
knowing your enemy as yourself

425
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,480
leads to victory without battle.

426
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:48,670
Why?

427
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,240
Behind every casualty

428
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,910
lies a shattered family.

429
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,720
If Dazhou and Nanwu

430
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,720
had more individuals

431
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,870
like General Yu who were willing

432
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,560
to know their enemies as themselves,

433
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,270
grievances would dissolve

434
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,150
into coexistence.

435
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,560
Wouldn't that be

436
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,430
victory without battles for both sides?

437
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,760
Your vision is profound, Si.

438
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,240
I'm enlightened.

439
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,110
Is it good?

440
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:12,630
Try it.

441
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,110
You've mastered

442
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,560
our Nanwu script well.

443
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,390
Thanks, Grand Elder.

444
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,720
(Yu Qi only learned the Nanwu language)

445
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,320
(after I arrived in the South.)

446
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,760
(How is he proficient already?)

447
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,000
(No matter,)

448
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,720
(perhaps the threads of fate)

449
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,910
(have shifted.)

450
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,110
(Tomorrow)

451
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,870
(is His Majesty's hunting.)

452
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,400
(If Yu Qi)

453
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,830
(succeeds at the hunt,)

454
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,390
(the next step will be)

455
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,870
(a full crackdown on the Nightingale.)

456
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,520
(What can I do)

457
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,390
(to protect Senior Du and the others?)

458
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,150
Miss Jiang.

459
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,430
Ready to go?

460
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,110
Yes.

461
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Be careful.

462
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,520
Don't worry.

463
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,440
When I gave the sachet

464
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,160
to my brother that day,

465
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,240
I actually made one for you, too.

466
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:29,110
Let me fasten it for you.

467
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,610

468
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:41,030

Done.

474
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,350
Bye.

475
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,530

00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:12,710

♪Together, we'll see light♪

479
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,150
Er'niu,

480
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,270
come on.

481
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,670
Take us to the Capital Security.

482
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,760
Let's go.

483
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,240
Good boy.

484
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,460
(Zhou)

485
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,480
Today's grand autumn hunting

486
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,390
is graced by His Majesty's presence.

487
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,040
We, the Imperial Insignia Guard,

488
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,150
must discharge our duties

489
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:45,350
and swear to safeguard the grounds!

490
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,240
Yes!

491
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,670
Today's grand autumn hunting

492
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,630
is graced by His Majesty's presence.

493
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,320
We, the Speed Guards,

494
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,760
must discharge our duties

495
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,190
and swear to safeguard the grounds!

496
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,280
Yes!

497
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:14,820
(Zhou)

498
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:23,120
Mr. Yang is already here.

499
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:24,640
Yes.

500
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,000
I've had someone swap the candles back.

501
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,080
The only problem is Aling, the Palace Woman.

502
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,430
We must find her before the ceremony.

503
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,910
Two officials from the Capital Security.

504
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:37,150
Mr. Zhen, Commandant Yu, go ahead.

505
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,190
Guards and attendants, no entry allowed.

506
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,070
You go back first.

507
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:42,910
Yes.

508
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:48,670
Let's split up.

509
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:52,910
Mr. Zhao, how have you been?

510
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,620
(Capital Security Office)

511
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:03,980
(Prison)

512
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,840
What's up?

513
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,720
Mr. Yu sent this young lady

514
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,040
to question Sang Qi.

515
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,750
The Capital Security regulations state

516
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,200
no unauthorized entry

517
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,150
unless Mr. Zhen or Mr. Yu

518
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:14,240
are present.

519
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,680
I was present

520
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,700
during Zhou Yi's interrogation.

521
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,830
Surely I know Mr. Yu's plan.

522
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,480
I'm here to question Sang Qi

523
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:22,000
because I need to

524
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,630
verify some details with him.

525
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,240
But...

526
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,670
This concerns the autumn hunting.

527
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:27,960
Can you bear the consequences

528
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,240
if something goes wrong?

529
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:30,400
This is a restricted area.

530
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,600
We're just doing our duty,

531
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,920
please don't make things difficult for us.

532
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,200
Mr. Zhen and Mr. Yu

533
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,760
have departed for the Mount Cuiluo hunt,

534
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,830
which is why I've come with Er'niu.

535
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,190
Moreover, here is

536
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,630
(Capital Security Office)
Mr. Yu's waist tag.

537
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,760
Are you still not convinced, officers?

538
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,280
Er'niu has Mr. Yu's full trust

539
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:48,550
and she has the waist tag.

540
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:49,920
If something goes wrong,

541
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,190
we can't afford to take the blame.

542
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,350
Miss, go ahead.

543
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:55,390
Thanks.

544
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:58,200
Aman, stay here with Er'niu

545
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,040
and wait for me.

546
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,640
Er'niu, if I need you later,

547
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,480
make sure you come in.

548
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,040
Hey, everyone, look!

549
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,910
Whose lady is this?

550
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,280
Woman, there is a woman!

551
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,150
Please.

552
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:27,790
Don't waste your time.

553
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,760
I won't say a word.

554
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,870
Can't force it, so now you're playing nice?

555
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,960
Time to eat!

556
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,350
Food is ready, ready!

557
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,240
Junior Sister, hurry up!

558
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,150
Come eat.

559
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,870
Junior Sister,

560
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,040
quick, come over here.

561
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:58,110
Sit down.

562
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,190
Look,

563
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,630
what did I prepare for you?

564
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,480
These are my hometown's specialties.

565
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,350
Exactly.

566
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,640
I bet you're drooling over them.

567
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,760
Dig in while they're hot!

568
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,320
Thank you.

569
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,190
I've noticed

570
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:20,190
you've been dejected these days.

571
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,150
I'm sure it's because you're homesick.

572
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,590
Perhaps your hometown's food

573
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:27,670
will ease your heartache.

574
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,240
Thank you.

575
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,070
But, Senior,

576
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:32,960
where did you

577
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,590
get all this food?

578
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:35,430
This...

579
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,270
I abducted a few cooks from Dazhou

580
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:39,430
to cook for us.

581
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:40,430
Abducted?

582
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,510
Don't worry.

583
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,870
I'll make sure

584
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,440
they go back in one piece,

585
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,280
ok?

586
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,150
Ok.

587
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,750
Senior, eat with me.

588
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,590
Ok.

589
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:51,430
Come on.

590
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,020
(Zhou)

591
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,960
There's a Palace Woman with the Food Service

592
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:04,910
named Aling!

593
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:08,180
(Aling)

594
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,630
Listen to me,

595
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,870
torture won't work.

596
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,110
Neither will

597
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,110
a honey-trap.

598
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,240
Sang Qi, tell me.

599
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,830
What are you plotting to do

600
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,630
during His Majesty's autumn hunting?

601
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,080
Our plot?

602
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:38,670
Get rid of that old fart, Jingming, for good.

603
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,000
If you tell me

604
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,960
the details of your plan,

605
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:45,550
perhaps Commandant Yu will spare your life.

606
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:46,720
No way!

607
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,520
You lackey of Dazhou,

608
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,750
I'm your sworn enemy!

609
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,000
Are you really ready to die?

610
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,310
I came here unafraid to die.

611
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:54,720
But have you considered your clansmen?

612
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,910
And your senior brothers and sisters?

613
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:02,960
- None of your business!
- How dare you!

614
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,560
You!

615
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,150
Sang Qi, listen to me.

616
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,830
I can get you out of here.

617
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,190
The Capital Security has razed

618
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:18,240
your gambling den at Tianxiang House

619
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,240
and obliterated all your bases.

620
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,040
As for your fellow members

621
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,280
of the Nightingale Division?

622
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,630
Dead or fled.

623
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,350
Yet here you are, still stubborn.

624
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:28,000
Don't try to fool me.

625
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,840
Tell me

626
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:30,760
where your black scorpion is.

627
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,280
Fine.

628
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:52,560
Since you won't talk,

629
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:55,040
I'll tell you this.

630
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,150
Sooner or later, someone will talk.

631
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:58,560
Your plan

632
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,280
is doomed to fail.

633
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,320
Officer, let's go.

634
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:18,390
(Senior,)

635
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:19,670
(this time,)

636
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,350
(I will choose a different path.)

637
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,190
(After you escape,)

638
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,110
(may we never be enemies again.)

639
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,800
Miss,

640
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,390
is this handkerchief yours?

641
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:51,040
Sir, it isn't mine.

642
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,350
You must be mistaken.

643
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,480
How could I be mistaken?

644
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,830
I saw you drop it just now.

645
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,390
Did you throw it on purpose?

646
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,760
Look,

647
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,190
my handkerchief is right here.

648
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,280
I haven't lost it.

649
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,350
I saw clearly

650
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,590
that it was yours.

651
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,790
There are witnesses here.

652
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:06,280
Don't think I'm harassing you.

653
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,590
No, it isn't.

654
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:08,430
Mr. Yu.

655
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,000
Mr. Zhen.

656
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:12,400
She says

657
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,760
the handkerchief isn't hers.

658
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,400
Why are you still harassing her?

659
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,040
How am I harassing her?

660
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,000
I saw her drop it,

661
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,420
so I picked it up to return it.

662
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,310
But think about it,

663
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:22,630
if others see this,

664
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,790
how can she still work here?

665
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:26,320
- Then how can I still...
- What's wrong?

666
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,000
What are you doing?

667
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,190
Wasting time here?

668
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,000
Secretary,

669
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,910
this gentleman found a handkerchief

670
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,520
and insists it's mine.

671
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,670
This is a minor matter.

672
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:43,150
We can sort it out later.

673
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,630
This is not a minor matter.

674
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,480
It concerns my reputation.

675
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:48,910
Mr. Yu is right.

676
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:52,110
Miss, if this handkerchief

677
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,030
isn't yours,

678
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,590
and he took the opportunity to harass you,

679
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,880
I will not let him off easily.

680
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,900
- According to Dazhou law...
- Aling,

681
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,040
is this yours or not?

682
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,190
Make it clear now.

683
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,240
Don't delay their or our official duties.

684
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,270
The banquet is about to begin.

685
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,280
We must be there quickly.

686
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,350
It's mine!

687
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:14,720
She admitted it herself.

688
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,190
I'll ask you again.

689
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:21,280
Is this handkerchief yours?

690
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:24,390
It is indeed mine.

691
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:26,270
I rushed to deliver refreshments

692
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:27,200
and didn't check carefully.

693
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,040
Secretary,

694
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,630
she admitted it herself.

695
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,480
But there's poison

696
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,040
in this handkerchief.

697
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:38,080
I... This isn't mine.

698
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,270
Mine carries no poison!

699
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:40,720
You just said it was yours.

700
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,110
Now you're saying it isn't.

701
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,830
Are you hiding something?

702
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:45,670
Guards,

703
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:46,630
search her!

704
00:32:58,830 --> 00:32:59,720
What is this?

705
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,920
Sir, I didn't want to do this!

706
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,750
They forced me to poison His Majesty!

707
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:06,590
Sir!

708
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,630
Sir, I truly had no idea!

709
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,760
Secretary,

710
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:13,720
you know the procedure.

711
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:14,910
Understood.

712
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,550
Bind her and take her away.

713
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:17,760
Spare me, sir!

714
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,310
They forced me, sir!

715
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:21,480
Spare me, sir!

716
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,630
I didn't do it, sir!

717
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:26,240
Today,

718
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,350
I went against my principles.

719
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,960
I cracked my first case without evidence.

720
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,870
But I believe you did the right thing.

721
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:39,350
His Majesty has arrived!

722
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:58,320
Bow!

723
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:05,430
Long live Your Majesty!

724
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,480
Bow once more!

725
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,960
May Your Majesty be in perfect health!

726
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,590
Rise, all my ministers.

727
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,000
The howling wind

728
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,190
highlights your valiant spirits

729
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,590
and honors the splendor of Dazhou.

730
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:10,880
Long live Your Majesty!

731
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:27,580
(Capital Security Office)

732
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,750
How come there's such a strong wind?

733
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:59,300
(Zhou)

734
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,750
Why is the wind blowing so hard?

735
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,940
(Zhou)

736
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,110
Why is it raining?

737
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:29,000
My spices!

738
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,840
Aman!

739
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,150
It's not raining.

740
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,270
It's a solar eclipse.

741
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,710
Solar eclipse?

742
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,140
(Zhou)

743
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,400
Aman, what time is it now?

744
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,480
- Just past the Wu Hour.
- Just past?

745
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,590
(Isn't it three quarters past the Wu hour?)

746
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:01,710
(Was I mistaken?)

747
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:02,670
(Could it)

748
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,880
(have another meaning?)

749
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,960
(Oh no, we've made a mistake!)

750
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,800
(Yu Qi,)

751
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,310
(please stay safe!)

752
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,040
Protect His Majesty!

753
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,190
Hurry, protect His Majesty!

754
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,840
Protect His Majesty!

755
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,760
Protect His Majesty!

756
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:36,950
- Watch out, Your Majesty!
- Brazen assassin! Seize him!

757
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,790
Solar eclipse! Light the candles!

758
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:42,670
- Mr. Yu!
- Your Majesty.

759
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,320
Hurry!

760
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:47,430
Don't move.

761
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,230
Who are you?

762
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:58,270
Yu Qi, Commandant of the Capital Security.

763
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,590
Summon the imperial physician.

764
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:07,750
Send for the imperial physician!

765
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,280
Thanks.

766
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,270
How is his injury?

767
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,710
Your Majesty,

768
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,710
despite the protection of his soft armor,

769
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:50,190
he has numerous old injuries.

770
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,710
The recent strike has aggravated them.

771
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,270
His internal injuries are grave.

772
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:56,630
He must get proper care and rest,

773
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:59,630
otherwise, they may root permanently.

774
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,710
I shall take my leave.

775
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,720
Your Majesty.

776
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,440
Why are you still calling me that?

777
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:19,990
Don't stand on ceremony.

778
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,320
I shall take my leave.

779
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,590
Do you truly believe

780
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:26,510
I couldn't even

781
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:27,360
recognize my own son?

782
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:34,670
The 7th Prince,

783
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:36,590
Yu Jin?

784
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,630
Every year, I had someone

785
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,320
send your latest portraits

786
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,110
from the army,

787
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,630
just to see your face more often.

788
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:53,520
Jin,

789
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,150
(Yu Jin, 7th Prince of Dazhou)

790
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:56,000
all these years,

791
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:59,630
you've weighed heavily on my heart.

792
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:06,110
Come, how is your injury?

793
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:06,950
Let me see.

794
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,790
His Majesty has arrived!

795
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:24,670
We deserve death ten thousandfold.

796
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:26,790
We await Your Majesty's punishment.

797
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,670
The Imperial Guard failed in vigilance,

798
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:30,560
allowing the assassin to infiltrate the hunt.

799
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,110
No death can atone for my fault.

800
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,040
The Speed Guards arrived too late.

801
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,110
I also deserve death.

802
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,200
Your Majesty,

803
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,030
Commandant Yu

804
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:42,360
engaged the assassin.

805
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,190
Does he have any clues?

806
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,110
I believe the assassin

807
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:49,360
is still here.

808
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,680
Your Majesty,

809
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,850
the Imperial Guard has

810
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:53,000
surrounded the hunting grounds.

811
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:54,590
We will surely capture him.

812
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,160
Your Majesty,

813
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:58,670
by royal decree,

814
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:00,510
all officials are barred from entering

815
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:01,800
the hunting grounds with iron weapons.

816
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:03,400
All hunting tools

817
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:04,790
are distributed on-site.

818
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:06,320
Before entering,

819
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,880
the officials

820
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,150
underwent rigorous inspections

821
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:10,360
to ensure they carried no iron pieces.

822
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:12,960
Only the Imperial Guard and Speed Guards...

823
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:18,000
You may not

824
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:19,670
uncover anything on your own.

825
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,880
Yu is proven loyalty in protecting me.

826
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:23,630
This investigation is yours.

827
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:26,840
Your Majesty, I request Mr Zhen's assistance.

828
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,280
Granted.

829
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:36,400
Everyone, drench yourselves

830
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,360
with the water

831
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,440
in your buckets.

832
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,800
Why?

833
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,600
Imperial Insignia Guard,

834
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,200
drench!

835
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,310
Speed Guards, drench!

836
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:00,920
When I fought

837
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,150
the assassin earlier,

838
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,880
I crushed a fragrant pellet in my hand

839
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:07,560
and struck him in the chest.

840
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:12,310
The hidden mark reacts to water.

841
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,150
Everyone, examine each other now.

842
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,800
Oh...

843
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:20,000
- Nothing.
- Nothing on me either.

844
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:24,480
There's nothing.

845
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,710
What's on your chest?

846
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:38,020
(Wang Heng)

847
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:41,400
Merely a stain

848
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,840
I accidentally got.

849
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:43,910
Jiang Zhan!
