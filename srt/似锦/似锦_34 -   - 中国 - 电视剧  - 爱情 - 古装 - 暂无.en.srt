to your mother.

Mother, I'm sorry.

16
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,230
I should've told you about that letter,

but I did burn it.

No, Mother, Mother,

22
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,390
I can't marry him!

23
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,920
Why don't you have him killed now?

61
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,350
Mother let me marry Zhu Ziyu,

62
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,150
but I don't want to.

63
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,750
I really don't, Father!

64
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,590
I know. Then don't marry him.

65
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,270
Let me take you back.

66
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,190

67
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,600
Be careful.

68
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,510
I'm not going.

69
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,630

70
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:31,760

74
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,080
I can't leave in disgrace.

75

81
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,510
Indeed, I am like her.

82
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,390
I was born from her, raised by her.

83
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,200
You've never cared for me since childhood,

84
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,320
so you don't need to start now.

85
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,840
Here.

86
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,280

Won't you join me for a drink, honey?

91
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,150
I'm not your honey.

92
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,000
We just tied the knot.

93
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,440
His Majesty granted our marriage.

94
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,120
What do you think you are?

95
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,680

96
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,190
Indeed,

97
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:27,240
if not for His Majesty's decree,

98
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,200
I've killed you long ago.

99
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,000
Rest assured.

100
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,910

101
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,390
more miserable than death.

102

You'll soon realize

103
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:45,120

dying with your family during exile.

105
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,430
I've promised

106
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,880
not to make this public.

107
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,880

It's all my fault, my fault.

112

If not for me,

113
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,000
they would still be alive.

114
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,830
Yi wouldn't have left me,

115
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,390
and I'd never have to

116
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,470
face a life without Yan.

117
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,200
How pathetic you are.

118

00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,400
May you be blessed

193
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,990
with many children

194
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,110
to continue the family line

195
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,040
and make your clan thrive.

196
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,040
Drink together!

197
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:14,990
You never drink.

198
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,870
Let's skip this step.

199
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,950
We have to drink up

200
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,920
to finally become a married couple.

201
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:22,550
I'll make an exception.

202
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,160
Okay.

203
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,800
Drink together,

204
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,400
solemn and auspicious.

205
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,920
Braid your hair!

206
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,710
Bound by hair as man and wife.

207
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,200
In love and trust we share our life.

208
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,560
Ceremony complete!

209
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,880
Bring the feast!

210
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,710
This is lily lotus soup.

211
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,030
May Your Highnesses enjoy

212
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:10,280
harmonious union with plentiful descendants.

213
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,550
Ms. Hua,

214
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:15,630
does this food box have ten tiers?

215
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,480
Indeed, Your Highness.

216
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,650
Ten tiers for auspicious blessings,

217
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,630
perfection in all ten aspects.

218
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,750
Inside are sesame glutinous rice balls

219
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,870
for harmony and togetherness,

220
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,040
sweet glutinous rice balls,

221
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,560
red date and longan soup,

222
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:29,160
sweet osmanthus lotus root, and red beans...

223
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,390
Ms. Hua, don't worry.

224
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,550
They'll definitely eat it.

225
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:32,560
Why don't we

226
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:33,480
take a rest first?

227
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,750
Right, we'll head out first.

228
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,920
The rituals aren't finished yet.

229
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,040
Your Highness, make sure to eat it!

230
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,280
Yes.

231
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,280
You knew all along, right?

232
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,430
Knew what?

233
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,680
I'm the Nanwu Saintess.

234
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,310
That I did.

235
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,990
Is that why

236
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,280
you came to me?

237
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,800
At first, yes.

238
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,350
But you know full well

239
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,670
how I feel about you later.

240
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,080
I've never lied to you once.

241
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,150
Do you remember

242
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,110
before my brother drowned,

243
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,190
I told you

244
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,960
I had a dream?

245
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,390
But actually, it wasn't a dream.

246
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,560
It was something I'd lived through.

247
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:26,430
Lived through?

248
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,800
Actually, back then,

249
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,080
we were already married

250
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:33,320
and performed the wedding rites.

251
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,630
There's a legend in Nanwu

252
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,720
that the Saintess can foresee the future.

253
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,190
But the reason I became the Saintess

254
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,720
is because those premonitions

255
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,960
were what I had really lived through.

256
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,430
Yet I often wonder,

257
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,190
I wish it had all been just a dream.

258
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,960
I only want an ordinary life,

259
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:04,150
to be Jiang Si of Earl Dongping's Mansion.

260
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,800
Whether you're the Saintess

261
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,720
doesn't matter to me.

262
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,320
While kneeling in front of His Majesty,

263
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,720
only one thought consumed me,

264
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,590
the terror that I'd never

265
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,080
see you again in this lifetime.

266
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,910
Whoever you are,

267
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,560
my devotion remains unchanging.

268
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,480
(For I shall forever remain)

269
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,040
(the Yu Qi who belongs to Jiang Si.)

270
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,140
♪I can't forget about you♪

271
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:54,460
♪However long the road is♪

272
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:58,610
♪No matter the cost, I'll try to restore♪

273
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:01,820
♪The sealed memories♪

274
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,590
This is the first time

275
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:04,910
I've seen Prince Yan drink.

276
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,720
It's truly rare.

277
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:09,040
Is it your first time seeing him drink too?

278
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,520
Of course not.

279
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:11,990
Run.

280
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,340
Once, our chief

281
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,830
led us to a crushing victory.

282
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,350
Upon our return,

283
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:19,400
he couldn't resist

284
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,280
drinking with us.

285
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,800
At first,

286
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,590
we all thought

287
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,150
he could hold his liquor perfectly

288
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,320
since he showed no signs of drunkenness.

289
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,590
But two hours later,

290
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,390
he suddenly collapsed into sleep,

291
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:34,510
only to bolt upright

292
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,630
moments later...

293
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:38,750
Then?

294
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,760
Never mind, I won't talk about it.

295
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,840
Long Dan.

296
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:50,120
- Don't.
- Please, Long Dan.

297
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:51,710
- Just tell me.
- No, no, he...

298
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,480
I won't tell anyone. I won't.

299
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:54,750
Okay.

300
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,000
Since we are

301
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,480
going to be family...

302
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,630
We're already family.

303
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,200
Don't tell anyone.

304
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,510
- I won't.
- You promise?

305
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,430
I promise.

306
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:08,190
He hugged the stool and burst into tears.

307
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,560
Our chief

308
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,720
grew up without parents

309
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,630
and was exiled to the South alone.

310
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,640
He endured untold hardships

311
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,000
and suffered a great deal,

312
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,760
but never once complained to anyone.

313
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,030
However, sometimes I wish

314
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:36,640
he would cry more often

315
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,760
and get drunk more.

316
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,700
(Grand Princess's Mansion)

317
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,080
Your Highness, watch the steps.

318
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,390
The villa caught fire.

319
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:20,190
Princess Mingyue has passed away.

320
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:23,520
Zhu Ziyu killed her.

321
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,800
I failed to protect her.

322
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,110
I deserve death.

323
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,320
You're lying!

324
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,400
No way.

325
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,350
Why are you lying to me?

326
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,270
Why?

327
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,320
Move aside!

328
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:40,160
Your Highness, you mustn't open it.

329
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,720
Move aside! Stop holding me back!

330
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,670
Your Highness, no.

331
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,040
Get out of the way!

332
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:49,710
Move!

333
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,040
Your Highness, you mustn't open it.

334
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:53,270
Your Highness.

335
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,750
Your Highness, no.

336
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,880
Move aside!

337
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,800
Your Highness.

338
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,240
Your Highness.

339
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,960
Your Highness.

340
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,560
Who is this?

341
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,190
Who is this?

342
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,190
She isn't Mingyue.

343
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,240
That's not what Mingyue looks like.

344
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,560
Your Highness!

345
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,630
What are you doing here?

346
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,310
What are you doing here?

347
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,790
Go find her!

348
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:36,070
Go!

349
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:36,920
Your Highness.

350
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,240
Hurry and go!

351
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:40,320
Your Highness.

352
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,110
I know you're

353
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,720
- trying to scare me
- Your Highness.

354
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:04,560
and playing a prank on me.

355
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,910
This can't be real.

356
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:11,200
This can't be real.

357
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,190
Your Highness.

358
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,910
I, I...

359
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,870
I know I was wrong.

360
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:20,830
Go and find her for me.

361
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:24,590
I know I was wrong.

362
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,560
Your Highness!

363
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:31,660
(Prince Yan's Mansion)

364
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,360
Darling,

365
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,590
from today onward,

366
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,080
I'm no longer a member of the Jiang Family.

367
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,880
People

368
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,960
will no longer address me as Jiang Si.

369
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:51,240
Instead, they'll call me Princess Yan.

370
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,910
I believe a good husband

371
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:55,680
should let his wife

372
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,960
be herself at all times.

373
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,920
You will forever remain Jiang Si,

374
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,520
not a woman whose identity I control.

375
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,240
If my wife feels

376
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,390
the slightest disappointment,

377
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,190
I'll have everyone call me

378
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,350
"the son-in-law of the Jiang Family".

379
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,160
Alright.

380
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,830
I was overthinking.

381
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:19,480
Darling, I'd like to go home

382
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,560
to see my sister and the others.

383
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,350
Also, it's time to move

384
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,080
all my things here

385
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,720
from my house.

386
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:26,830
Sure.

387
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:27,910
It's almost time.

388
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,680
Let's get ready.

389
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,200
We are going to the palace

390
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,820
to pay respects
to His Majesty and Her Highness.

391
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:36,870
I'm not going to visit Emperor Jingming.

392
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,160
Alright.

393
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,720
After all,

394
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,880
back then,

395
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,830
His Majesty did grant our marriage.

396
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,240
I believe

397
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,560
he favors you at heart.

398
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,800
Darling,

399
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:59,390
let's think of this as fulfilling a duty, okay?

400
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:00,830
If we don't go, they'll say

401
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:02,560
we've failed to observe proper etiquette,

402
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,430
and that will cause more trouble.

403
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,590
You're right, darling.

404
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:29,580
(Peace and Prosperity)

405
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,350
Please accept our preserved meat.

406
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:47,870
- Thank you, Your Highness.
- Thank you.

407
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,750
I'm delighted

408
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,240
to see you

409
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,520
united in marriage.

410
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:54,510
Rise quickly.

411
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:55,710
Offer them seats.

412
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,800
May you enjoy a long and happy marriage

413
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:01,880
and may children arrive soon.

414
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:02,950
Thank you.

415
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,150
You probably don't know.

416
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,720
Princess Mingyue is dead,

417
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,630
killed by Zhu Ziyu.

418
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:13,830
He then set himself on fire and died as well.

419
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:15,880
No wonder His Majesty was absent

420
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,270
when we went to visit him

421
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,240
this morning.

422
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,200
We were told

423
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,760
he went to the Grand Princess's Mansion.

424
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,320
(Zhu Ziyu's fate did go as I'd expected,)

425
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,910
(but I never dreamed)

426
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,560
(he'd sacrifice his life)

427
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,280
(to break the deadlock.)

428
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,240
For a man like Zhu Ziyu to carry out

429
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,000
such a bold and decisive act

430
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,110
before his death,

431
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:37,560
this must

432
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,670
have been a relief.

433
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,760
Although Mingyue was killed by Zhu Ziyu,

434
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,830
I'm well aware

435
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:46,830
of her mother's temperament.

436
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:49,280
She's certain to plant this blood feud

437
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,310
at both of your feet.

438
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,320
She is ruthless.

439
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:53,880
We can't imagine what she will do

440
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,240
to both of you.

441
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:58,000
Yu Jin, come up with a reason

442
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,560
to take Jiang Si back to the South.

443
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,630
The Chiyu Cavalry is stationed there

444
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,760
and they can protect both of you.

445
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:06,350
However, the misfortune can't be avoided.

446
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,200
Sooner or later, we have to confront it.

447
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,560
The Grand Princess has been

448
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:10,960
plotting against us for long.

449
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,870
We can adapt as needed,

450
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,320
but we're afraid of implicating you.

451
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,590
It's best for you

452
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,760
to distance yourself from us in public.

453
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,960
We'll visit you less from now on.

454
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:23,480
We hope you will understand.

455
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,200
I knew

456
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,670
you are not cowards.

457
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,510
Actually, Mother and I

458
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:31,040
discussed this before your arrival.

459
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:32,870
If you want to leave,

460
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,160
we'll find a way

461
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,390
to get you out safely.

462
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,520
If you choose to stay,

463
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,350
we won't

464
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,590
play it safe

465
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,560
like before.

466
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,920
This time,

467
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,280
we stand together.

468
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,140
(Blessings and Clarity)

469
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:51,780
(Ningxiang Hall)

470
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:52,790
I don't

471
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,830
have a son of my own.

472
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,870
Yu Jin, if you wish,

473
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:00,190
I can petition His Majesty for approval

474
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,190
to acknowledge you as my own son.

475
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,830
Your Highness, before you do that,

476
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:05,720
shouldn't you

477
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,390
ask his mother for consent?

478
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,040
Greetings, Mother.

479
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,160
Your Highness.

480
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:12,760
Your Highness,

481
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:15,200
how could you enter without announcement?

482
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,320
By the time you announce,

483
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:19,110
my son would've been abducted!

484
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,430
It's been a while since you came.

485
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,390
Quickly, offer her a seat.

486
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,390
My son and daughter-in-law just married.

487
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,110
I waited for ages in Jinhua Hall,

488
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:39,110
but they never showed.

489
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,830
Seems I won't get

490
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:42,920
my new daughter-in-law's tea.

491
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,550
Mother, we were

492
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,830
on our way to Jinhua Hall

493
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:46,750
to greet you.

494
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:47,670
Is that so?

495
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:50,000
Then why did I hear you

496
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,590
planning to acknowledge someone else

497
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:52,630
as your mother?

498
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,350
Am I still qualified

499
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,830
to accept your greetings?

500
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,160
Your Highness,

501
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,760
is the "someone else"

502
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,080
referring to my mother?

503
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,000
Although I'm your junior,

504
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,240
I know that my mother

505
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,910
is the lineal mother

506
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,350
to all princes and princesses.

507
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,630
What's wrong with her wish

508
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,040
to adopt Jin

509
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,280
as her lineal son?

510
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:15,510
Look at that.

511
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,070
Princess Fuqing is truly

512
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,960
the Empress's own flesh and blood

513
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,590
who shares a special bond with her.

514
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:22,320
I only complained a little,

515
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:24,350
and she immediately jumped to her defense.

516
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:26,390
If someone with ill intentions

517
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,240
tried to steal her from Your Highness,

518
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,150
what would you do?

519
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,870
Princess Fuqing was raised by her mother.

520
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,350
Of course they share a deep bond.

521
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:39,110
Your Highness didn't raise your son,

522
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:42,560
yet now you insist on blood ties.

523
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:45,150
Are you afraid that my legitimacy

524
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,270
would rattle your designs for Prince Qi?

525
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:49,480
Nonsense! You both are my flesh and blood.

526
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:51,910
Although I couldn't raise you myself,

527
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,430
I've cared for you

528
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,110
just as much as Prince Qi.

529
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,080
You ungrateful son!

530
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:00,280
Consort Xian, mind your words.

531
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,830
Prince Yan is both wise and benevolent.

532
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,590
Since returning to Ling'an,

533
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,150
he's successfully handled several tasks,

534
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,390
earning His Majesty's praise.

535
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,910
If you hold him in such low regard,

536
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,150
and with Prince Qi around you,

537
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,830
I have no qualms left.

538
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,160
Yu Jin,

539
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,760
with Consort Xian's presence,

540
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,040
answer me,

541
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:22,350
will you consent to be recorded under my name

542
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:24,080
as my lineal son?

543
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,560
Yes, I will.

544
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,190
What did you say?

545
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:35,190
Your Highness,

546
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:37,390
Princess Fuqing has a valid point.

547
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,110
As the lineal mother to all princes,

548
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,160
even if Prince Yan

549
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,590
isn't formally recorded under your name,

550
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,960
you remain our lineal mother.

551
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:45,270
We will devote ourselves

552
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:46,390
to serving you wholeheartedly.

553
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,960
There's no need to trouble you

554
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,190
with an adoption ceremony.

555
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,560
Jiang Si is truly sensible.

556
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,960
Do you blame me for stopping you?

557
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,520
I've longed for such a mother.

558
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,720
But you must have your reasons

559
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,720
for stopping me.

560
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,910
Alright, let me hear them.

561
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,430
I believe the Empress

562
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:23,960
and Princess Fuqing

563
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,800
genuinely care for us.

564
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,910
Even without the mother-son title,

565
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,070
we would still

566
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,040
protect each other.

567
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,390
However, claiming that title

568
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,670
would declare your allegiance

569
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,630
to the Empress's faction

570
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:38,190
and signal your ambition.

571
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:40,270
That would make us

572
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,280
instant targets.

573
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,360
Indeed.

574
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:46,000
I was so focused on provoking Consort Xian

575
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,430
that I overlooked these stakes.

576
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,670
I understand.

577
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,240
She's your biological mother.

578
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,390
It's hard for anyone to reconcile that.

579
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,800
From now on,

580
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,240
try to see her less.

581
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:00,960
If you have to,

582
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:02,000
I'll go see her in your place.

583
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,920
Neither should you go.

584
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,160
Have you forgotten

585
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,280
how she treated you last time?

586
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,560
Then neither of us will see her,

587
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,800
okay?

588
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,790
But the Empress...

589
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:12,110
Her Highness is wise.

590
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,560
I believe she understands our intentions.

591
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,960
But how can we

592
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,040
navigate this current crisis?

593
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,830
With Cui Mingyue dead,

594
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,630
her mother will surely seek revenge.

595
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:26,150
Father's name is on the Annals of Divination.

596
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,640
It's inappropriate to present it.

597
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:31,160
Her Highness wouldn't

598
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,800
want the truth exposed,

599
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,780
which would only

600
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,150
invite the Grand Princess's retaliation.

601
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:36,590
Instead,

602
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:38,760
we could launch a preemptive strike

603
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:40,680
by informing Father

604
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,520
about her collusion with Nanwu

605
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,190
and her plot to frame you and your mother.

606
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,000
Okay.

607
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,190
Then let's call Ms. Xiao back

608
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,280
to provide testimony.

609
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,830
Greetings, Mother.

610
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,190
What brings you here?

611
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,600
Mother,

612
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,630
didn't you summon me?

613
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,280
You said Princess Yan is coming today

614
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,640
and asked me to pick several capable maids

615
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,040
for her to take back.

616
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,320
They're all here,

617
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,590
waiting outside.

618
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,640
Forget it.

619
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,640
They've left.

620
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,030
Perhaps we can send them

621
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,520
to Prince Yan's Mansion in your name.

622
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,040
The young Princess Yan

623
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,910
could use assistance managing the household.

624
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,800
It's a gesture of your goodwill.

625
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,630
I said no.

626
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,590
Take your maids and leave now.

627
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:32,990
Yes.

628
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,640
Wait.

629
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:41,520
Let me ask you,

630
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,960
if

631
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,480
the Empress sought to adopt Zhang

632
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,670
as her lineal son

633
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,510
to rightfully compete

634
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,760
with the Crown Prince,

635
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:53,720
what would you do?

636
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,910
You'd surely be overjoyed!

637
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,920
You'd leap at the chance

638
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,910
for a more noble, kinder mother-in-law!

639
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,830
But what if Zhang refuses?

640
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:06,870
You'd whisper in his ear until he agrees!

641
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,670
Mother, why would you ask that?

642
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,360
Did the Empress say something again?

643
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:15,760
How could I

644
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,150
be so heartless?

645
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,440
Crying again.

646
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,840
Zhang isn't here,

647
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,440
no need for your theatrics.

648
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,360
Mother,

649
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,440
it's not what you think.

650
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,920
I didn't.

651
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,840
Enough.

652
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,800
- Leave.
- Mother.

653
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,720
Leave!

654
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,710
If it were her today,

655
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,920
my son would have been claimed

656
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,480
by someone else.

657
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,110
What is Princess Yan

658
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,790
really plotting?

659
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,520
Such a wonderful opportunity...

660
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:04,270
Do you also think it's wonderful?

661
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,720
I spoke out of turn.

662
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,080
Forgive me, Your Highness.

663
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,400
Regardless,

664
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:13,310
Jiang Si's rejection of the Empress suggests

665
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:15,880
she recognizes me as her mother-in-law.

666
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:18,400
In case the Grand Princess

667
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,920
insists on holding her accountable

668
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,560
for her daughter's death,

669
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,680
I will

670
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,080
step in to protect her.

671
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:32,220
(Grand Princess's Mansion)

672
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,680
Your Majesty,

673
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,400
Her Highness suffers from emotional stress

674
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:49,550
and excessive grief.

675
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:51,710
She needs rest and recuperation.

676
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:53,630
I shall take my leave.

677
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,800
Rongyang.

678
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,400
Brother,

679
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,150
I have nothing left.

680
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,440
What's done is done.

681
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,190
Preserve your health.

682
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,560
Mingyue was a good girl.

683
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,880
I'll confer upon her the title of Princess

684
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:30,590
and bury her in the imperial mausoleum.

685
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:38,040
My appreciations, Your Majesty.

686
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:43,030
Rongyang,

687
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,920
the dead cannot be brought back to life.

688
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:48,310
Do not grieve too much.

689
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,560
Take care of yourself.

690
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,190
I'll visit you another day.

691
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:58,750
Yes, Your Majesty.

692
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,560
Did you hear that?

693
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:18,480
Confer her the title of Princess

694
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:20,920
and bury her in the imperial mausoleum.

695
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,590
When she was alive,

696
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,750
they denied

697
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,710
her every wish.

698
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:34,790
Now she's gone,

699
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,270
and His Majesty is making her a princess?

700
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,590
Your Highness.

701
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,840
Your Highness.

702
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,400
Your Highness.

703
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:05,110
Your Highness.

704
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:07,000
The physical pains

705
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,960
can't compare to the ache in my heart.

706
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,630
If His Majesty truly cared for her,

707
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,510
he would never have forced her

708
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:21,960
to marry Zhu Ziyu.

709
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,080
I risked

710
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,230
my life for him,

711
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,480
yet he never truly

712
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:37,480
valued my devotion.

713
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,960
Didn't you meet with Father?

714
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,750
I was going to speak with him,

715
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,070
but he went to the Grand Princess's Mansion

716
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:01,040
for Mingyue's death.

717
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:02,520
Unfortunately, I missed him.

718
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,230
After all that happened,

719
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,880
Father is in low spirits.

720
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:09,400
Perhaps it's better to visit him another day.

721
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,560
Your diligence and ambition

722
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,320
will make it clear to him

723
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,310
that you're far superior to the Crown Prince.

724
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,150
Even if he is incompetent,

725
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,520
he is the late Empress's son.

726
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:21,440
Father will always

727
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,590
hold him in higher regard.

728
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:24,360
Speaking of which,

729
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:27,440
there's another thing.

730
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:28,880
Today,

731
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:30,590
after Mother returned from the Empress's,

732
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,400
she berated me.

733
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,400
Upon inquiry, I learned

734
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,440
that Prince Yan and his wife

735
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,790
visited the Empress

736
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,760
and she intended

737
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,040
to adopt him as her lineal son.

738
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,920
The 7th Prince returning from the frontier

739
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,080
is about to overtake me.

740
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:49,000
If he intends to challenge for the throne,

741
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,040
I'll have another rival.

742
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:54,190
Thankfully, his wife had reservations

743
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,590
and dared not agree rashly,

744
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,920
thus stopping him.

745
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:58,920
This round is ours, but what of the next?

746
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:01,310
Perhaps Yu Jin leaked the information

747
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:02,920
to test Father's reaction.

748
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:04,400
If Father doesn't object,

749
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,400
he could leap to the top overnight

750
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:07,510
and become the Empress's

751
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:08,630
only lineal son.

752
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:09,790
Then what should we do?

753
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:19,260
(Grand Princess's Mansion)

754
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:12,590
Don't touch her.

755
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:19,230
Mingyue is gone.

756
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,510
You don't have to pretend

757
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:23,590
in front of me.

758
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:27,000
We've fought for a lifetime.

759
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,440
If not for our daughter,

760
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,680
we would

761
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,670
have nothing left to say to each other.
