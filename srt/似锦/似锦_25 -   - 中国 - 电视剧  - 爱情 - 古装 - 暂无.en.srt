00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,180
(Prince Qi's Mansion)

12
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,150
Since I joined the Chiyu Cavalry,

13
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,920
to avoid delaying the battle,

14
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,480
I signed a military pledge.

15
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,790
If I drink alcohol,

16
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,120
I'll be punished by military law.

17
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,560
I wouldn't dare defy you, Your Highness.

18
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,760
Lang.

19
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,840
Jin, why take it seriously?

20
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,440
I'm just teasing you.

21
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,110
How could I force you?

22
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,510
Yes, Jin.

23
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,790
You don't know.

24
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,470
Our Crown Prince

25
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,270
loves to joke with us.

26
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,440
I was just kidding.

27
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,600
Lang, don't take it seriously.

28
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,360
Your Highness.

29
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,360
I didn't invite you here in advance,

30
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,940
so I'll drink as an apology.

31
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,160
Zhang, well done.

32
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,450
Sit down.

33
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,460
(Earl Dongping's Mansion)

34
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,000
The golden eagle stands alone.

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,840
Hurry up!

36
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,470
Catch the little chicken!

37
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,760
You can't catch me!

38
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,480
You can't catch me!

39
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,840
Catch the little chicken!

40
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,830
You can't catch me!

41
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,480
What's wrong?

42
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,390
- Father.
- My waist!

43
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,560
- Zhan, come on.
- You're so fragile.

44
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,790
I'm getting older.

45
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,360
A little movement

46
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,950
could easily hurt me.

47
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:03,990
But...

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,190
Yan, you still want to play,

49
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,030
right?

50
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,360
I think it's you who wants to play.

51
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,640
Go.

52
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,360
Ask Si to come and play with them.

53
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:14,870
Master,

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,640
the servants say

55
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,010
Miss Si is not at Haitang Chamber.

56
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,470
She's gone to Prince Qi's Mansion.

57
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,320
Didn't she say she wasn't going?

58
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,990
I don't know.

59
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,920
Grandmother must've forced her.

60
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,830
I'll go find her right away.

61
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,960
Father,

62
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,880
that's an imperial mansion.

63
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,640
We can't just barge in.

64
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,680
Right.

65
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,480
Why be afraid?

66
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,310
If any noble young master

67
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,790
wants to marry her,

68
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,520
they won't be able to do anything

69
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,990
as long as I don't agree.

70
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,800
Father, are you really unwilling

71
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,380
to let Si marry into a prominent family?

72
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,420
Noble families have
complicated relationships.

73
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,040
It can really make people suffer.

74
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,590
I hope Si won't fall

75
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,920
for any young master

76
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,270
in Prince Qi's Mansion today.

77
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,670
Don't worry, Father.

78
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,320
Si has someone in mind already.

79
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,030
Who?

80
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,520
Uncle Yu! Uncle Yu!

81
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,370
Uncle Yu!

82
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,740
- Uncle Yu.
- Don't talk nonsense.

83
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,100
Come on, let's go play over there.

84
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,560
Yu, Yu!

85
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,400
Come back here.

86
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:23,830
Is it Commandant Yu?

87
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,240
Commandant Yu

88
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,390
is quite handsome.

89
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,000
He must've attracted many ladies.

90
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,840
That's not true.

91
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,870
Yu is respectful and composed.

92
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,080
I've never seen any women around him.

93
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,590
He works at Capital Security,

94
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,760
and his monthly salary isn't much.

95
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,950
But he's a military officer.

96
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,830
He's skilled

97
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,950
and can protect Si.

98
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,640
But what if he bullies Si?

99
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,030
Who will teach him a lesson?

100
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,000
Me?

101
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,390
I can't beat him,

102
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,760
but Yu is young,

103
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,000
calm, and dignified.

104
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,510
If Si marries him,

105
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,760
he won't bully her.

106
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:15,600
You're his friend,

107
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,240
always by his side.

108
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,640
Stop trying to persuade me.

109
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,070
This is Si's marriage.

110
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,510
Can you stand on your friend's side

111
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,510
on this matter?

112
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:27,440
I'm just speaking the truth.

113
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:31,190
Moreover, Si...

114
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,080
What's wrong with Si?

115
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,200
Commandant Yu

116
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,710
saved you, won the contest,

117
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,680
and moved next to our house.

118
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,120
Is it all for Si?

119
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,270
That's because they're mutually in love.

120
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,560
What mutual love?

121
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,880
I think he's just taking it
step by step.

122
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,630
I think you wouldn't be satisfied
with anyone.

123
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,470
What did you say?

124
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,950
You win.

125
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,020
(Everlasting Prosperity)

126
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,590
Cousin, you're so generous.

127
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,000
You even brought out

128
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,070
rare items like this.

129
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,350
This is Shanhai Soup, a Palace dish.

130
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,350
- It's made...
- It's made with fish and shrimp,

131
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,180
and it smells fishy when it cools down.

132
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:14,560
It's a pity to waste your kindness.

133
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:17,950
Let's taste it while it's hot.

134
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,440
I hadn't had a chance to mention

135
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,560
that this soup has pepper in it.

136
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,350
Though it looks mild,

137
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,120
it's secretly spicy.

138
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,590
Miss Jiang, are you alright?

139
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,620
Thank you for your concern,
Your Highness.

140
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,080
These ingredients are precious,

141
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,950
and today I'm fortunate to taste them.

142
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,800
But I didn't expect

143
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,680
the rules of Grand Preceptor's Mansion

144
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,120
to be so overbearing.

145
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,120
The host can even be overshadowed.

146
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,200
Who is that noble lady?

147
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,590
Jiang Si from Earl Dongping's family.

148
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,640
The renowned beauty of Ling'an.

149
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:01,710
Ask her to come here.

150
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:02,950
It wouldn't be appropriate.

151
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:03,830
Why not?

152
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,270
There's no rush.

153
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,510
After everyone is full and satisfied,

154
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,180
my wife has arranged a scenic viewing.

155
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,390
But Jin's focus is clearly

156
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,560
on that side.

157
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,190
I have no such intentions.

158
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,330
Is that my intention?

159
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,480
You may be misunderstanding.

160
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,320
Remove the screen.

161
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,800
That would be improper.

162
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,640
A beauty should be viewed
under the light.

163
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,680
The beauty of ambiguity is tempting.

164
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,600
Through a screen and thin fabric,

165
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,870
charm matters more than appearance.

166
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,470
Today, I have to see her.

167
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,840
Remove it.

168
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,950
I'm Jiang Si
from Earl Dongping's family.

169
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,800
Greetings, Your Highnesses.

170
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:50,270
She's tall and graceful,
elegant and poised.

171
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,150
No wonder her name is well-known.

172
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:54,910
Reward her.

173
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,200
A plate of cold fish mint.

174
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,200
The fish mint is white,

175
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,720
the sauce is red,

176
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,080
and the garnish is green.

177
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,120
It looks beautifully colored,

178
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,640
but the taste...

179
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,510
Since I've received your gift,

180
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:17,200
I should return it with something more.

181
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,600
Your Highness,
as the heir to the throne,

182
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,680
you first lost concern for his brothers

183
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,030
and then for ladies.

184
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,590
So I present you

185
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,590
a plate of assorted pastries

186
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,080
to help you

187
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,150
keep your thoughts sharp.

188
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:32,990
Jiang Si.

189
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:33,870
Also,

190
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,870
I want to gift you
a cup of clear wine,

191
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,710
so you can use water as a mirror

192
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,400
to reflect on yourself.

193
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,430
Jiang Si, how dare you!

194
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,240
When did it become your place
to lecture me?

195
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,080
Yu Jin.

196
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,560
Well, well.

197
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,870
You put on quite the show

198
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,990
before all these noble ladies.

199
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,440
Princes are

200
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,160
in the prime of their youth.

201
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,440
They just acted on impulse.

202
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,620
It's surely not to the extent

203
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,630
of harming their brotherly bond.

204
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,380
Alright, tell me.

205
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,390
Who was impulsive first?

206
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,000
- And why?
- It wasn't me.

207
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,120
I went up to stop them.

208
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,230
I didn't fight.

209
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,080
- Zhang.
- Yes.

210
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,470
It's your fault.

211
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,200
Is this the banquet you held?

212
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,470
Father, please punish me.

213
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,600
Zhang is always courteous.

214
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,860
He meant well in hosting

215
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,180
the welcoming banquet for Yu Jin.

216
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,240
He never expected

217
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,400
something like this to happen.

218
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,630
He is innocent.

219
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,630
Your Majesty, please forgive him.

220
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,470
Crown Prince,

221
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:48,840
is this the example you set

222
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,750
for the world?

223
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,230
It was Yu Jin who overstepped,

224
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,750
openly attacking me.

225
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,680
He removed the screen

226
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,440
and commented on the ladies.

227
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,830
He acted inappropriately.

228
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,750
Jiang Si from Earl Dongping's family
insulted me.

229
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,720
You provoked her.

230
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,560
Enough!

231
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,870
Do you know what is most taboo

232
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,630
in the imperial family?

233
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:12,920
Brotherly strife.

234
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,670
How many tragic incidents

235
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,560
in history are caused by such conflicts?

236
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:19,080
You're brothers, and one of you
will ascend the throne.

237
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,920
You don't behave like brothers now.

238
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,280
Will you also disregard
your duties in the future?

239
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,960
- I dare not.
- I am guilty.

240
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,140
You must be severely punished

241
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,200
so that you'll learn from this.

242
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,620
Bring me the Palace Regulations.

243
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,770
You'll be punished severely.

244
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,800
Your Majesty,

245
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,510
the other Princes can be punished

246
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,840
according to the rules,

247
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,810
but the 7th Prince...

248
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:37,690
What's wrong with him?

249
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,490
The 7th Prince is
without an imperial title.

250
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:40,540
So what?

251
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,550
The Palace Regulations

252
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,900
are for imperial family members.

253
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,120
The 7th Prince hasn't entered
the imperial genealogy,

254
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,680
and nor does he have
an imperial title.

255
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,910
So, he's not one of the imperial family.

256
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:49,750
How dare you!

257
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,710
Can't I punish my son?

258
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,110
That's against the law.

259
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,280
Fine.

260
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,440
Tell me.

261
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,440
Any unused characters left in titles?

262
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,480
Yan.

263
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,400
Then he'll be Prince Yan.

264
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,160
Can I punish him now?

265
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,870
Yes, Your Majesty.

266
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,960
Your Majesty,

267
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,510
this is serious.

268
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,590
Your son made a mistake.

269
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,810
As his mother,
you should also be blamed.

270
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,710
You all need to reflect on yourselves.

271
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,350
Alright, everyone, leave.

272
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,440
I take my leave, Father.

273
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,870
You promised me

274
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,750
that I could remain as Yu Qi,

275
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,390
but you've broken your word.

276
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:52,870
You're Prince Yan now,

277
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:53,950
yet you're unhappy about it?

278
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,210
The tree desires peace,
but the wind does not stop.

279
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,750
You want to stay in Ling'an

280
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,590
and avoid turmoil,

281
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,440
but it's hard to have both.

282
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,160
You've seen it.

283
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,030
Many in the Palace

284
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,520
are snobs.

285
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,590
If I don't grant you an imperial title,

286
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,570
how will you protect yourself

287
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,440
and those around you?

288
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:24,600
I don't care about that.

289
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,520
But I do.

290
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,350
Alright, go back now.

291
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,630
From now on, be more composed.

292
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,200
After all, you're Prince Yan now.

293
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,950
Thank you, Father.

294
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,400
Goodbye, Your Highness.

295
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:01,230
This show has come at the right time.

296
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,200
Your Majesty is wise.

297
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,440
Your Majesty,

298
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,800
it's raining.

299
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,280
The weather has been dry for so long.

300
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,400
This is truly a good rain.

301
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:14,920
Jin is a rascal.

302
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,520
He's been a burden since birth,

303
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,560
and he still implicates me now.

304
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,560
Mother,

305
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,110
please calm down.

306
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,680
Don't get so worked up.

307
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,840
Let's sit down.

308
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,920
No matter what,

309
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,160
Yu Jin is still my real brother

310
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,280
and your real son.

311
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,160
He's an ominous man.

312
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,040
That's predestined since birth.

313
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,480
But it seems Father no longer

314
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,590
cares about that.

315
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,030
Otherwise, why would he use

316
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,380
the punishment of us as a pretext

317
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,440
to promote him?

318
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:54,800
He's even Prince Yan now.

319
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,800
Father has also easily dropped

320
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,800
Jin's rebellious return

321
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,230
and forgotten about that.

322
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,280
His Majesty's mind is unfathomable.

323
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,680
Today, His Majesty elevates him,

324
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,720
but tomorrow, he might shift

325
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,280
all the blame to him.

326
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,230
Zhang,

327
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,040
do you understand?

328
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,750
I'll just distance myself from Yu Jin.

329
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,590
No.

330
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,160
Since he's had an imperial title,

331
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:28,200
whatever needs to be arranged
must be done.

332
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,710
We can't let people say

333
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,560
we lack manners.

334
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,560
As you wish, Mother.

335
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,150
It's raining so hard.

336
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,200
Shall we come back another day?

337
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:50,920
Is this the place?

338
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,080
I think so.

339
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,280
Go knock.

340
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,790
No one's here.

341
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:08,110
You should knock harder.

342
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,830
Go, go, go.

343
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,750
Unfortunately,

344
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,080
he's not home.

345
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,280
Father, shall we come back another day?

346
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:24,510
Fine.

347
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,350
I was too hasty.

348
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,280
Upon thinking about it,

349
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,360
we should've investigated

350
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,870
Yu's background first.

351
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:32,710
Yes.

352
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,630
Father, he works at Capital Security

353
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:36,870
and is Mr. Zhen's friend.

354
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:39,520
We can inquire at Capital Security
another day.

355
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,680
Right.

356
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,200
Let's go now.

357
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,400
Now? Father.

358
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,920
It's raining so hard.

359
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,110
Must we go so urgently?

360
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,150
Your Grace, please have some tea.

361
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,280
Thank you.

362
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,560
Mr. Zhen,

363
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,520
I came here today

364
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:55,950
to inquire about something.

365
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,520
Please, feel free to ask.

366
00:15:58,630 --> 00:15:59,470
Alright.

367
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,590
Since you both work at Capital Security,

368
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,630
you must know about the background

369
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,110
of Commandant Yu, right?

370
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:14,510
Your Grace, don't you know

371
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,680
about his identity?

372
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:20,080
I haven't looked into it in detail.

373
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,720
I've only heard

374
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,800
his family is prominent.

375
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,630
With many boys in his family,

376
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,590
he's not highly regarded,

377
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,990
so he has to work his way up.

378
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:35,670
That's what he tells you?

379
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,240
Mr. Zhen,

380
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,750
is there something you can't say?

381
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,470
Young Master Zhan, please have a seat.

382
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:50,080
Mr. Zhen, you're upright,

383
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,350
honest, and reliable.

384
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,950
This is very important to me,

385
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,750
so please don't hide anything.

386
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,590
The tea is cold.

387
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:05,150
Let me get you some more.

388
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,960
Here you go.

389
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,070
Thank you.

390
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,680
- Young Master Zhan.
- I'm not thirsty.

391
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,240
Mr. Zhen, please go ahead.

392
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,390
Yes, yes.

393
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,720
Commandant Yu's identity

394
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,110
may be a bit different

395
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,190
from what you two imagined.

396
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,670
A bit different?

397
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:53,670
Could it be

398
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,630
that his family

399
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,790
isn't prominent?

400
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:00,080
No, no, not at all.

401
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,560
Could it be

402
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,430
he's an orphan with no parents?

403
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:09,630
Mr. Zhen,

404
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,240
why so excited?

405
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,960
Even if it's true,

406
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,880
- it's not a big deal.
- Yes.

407
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,190
As long as he's an upright man,

408
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,560
it doesn't matter if his family is poor.

409
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,480
- Your Grace.
- Yes, Mr. Zhen.

410
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,720
Even if Yu's family is destitute,

411
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,150
and he's alone,

412
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,190
he's still my friend.

413
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,280
Mr. Zhen,

414
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,190
please tell us honestly

415
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,320
about Commandant Yu's family.

416
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,000
Don't worry.

417
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,630
We can handle it.

418
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,590
Yes.

419
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,880
Your Grace, are you sure?

420
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,750
- We can handle it.
- Yes.

421
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,630
We can handle it.

422
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:47,110
Actually, Commandant Yu

423
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,800
is

424
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,280
the seventh son of the Emperor,

425
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,670
Prince Yan.

426
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,870
He's Prince Yan.

427
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,560
Father.

428
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:20,590
Give me a moment.

429
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,720
Your Grace, you...

430
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,350
Are you okay?

431
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:33,680
Mr. Zhen,

432
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,750
is this

433
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:35,910
some kind of joke?

434
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,910
Is it?

435
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,910
Your Grace, Young Master Zhan,

436
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,150
I would never joke

437
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,720
about such a matter.

438
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,280
Yu is a fraud.

439
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,030
- What's wrong?
- That fraud.

440
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:54,870
Your Grace?

441
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,040
Father.

442
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,320
Father.

443
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,670
Wait for me.

444
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,240
Oh, my goodness.

445
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,080
We almost caused a disaster.

446
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,590
Did you just say

447
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,350
the Prince's family is destitute?

448
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,350
You said he was an orphan first.

449
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,430
Father, Father.

450
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,560
Look at it now.

451
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,480
We don't have to worry about Si

452
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,480
marrying into a noble family.

453
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:28,960
No one is more noble

454
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,480
than Yu Qi.

455
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,830
That's true.

456
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,190
But if she marries
into an ordinary family

457
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,190
and ends up with a bad match,

458
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:41,430
she could still get a divorce.

459
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,830
If she marries into the imperial family,

460
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,150
she'll have to endure
whatever comes her way.

461
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,390
What should we do?

462
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:52,670
We can't let Si fall into this trap.

463
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,110
- Hurry home and think of a way.
- Let's go.

464
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,280
No one answers the door,

465
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,960
and there's no doorman.

466
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,870
Let's just wait here.

467
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:48,500
(Haitang Chamber)

468
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,670
Miss, why not sit down and rest?

469
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:51,630
Have some water.

470
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,830
(He hit the Crown Prince because of me.)

471
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,520
(I wonder how the Emperor
will punish him.)

472
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:02,960
Are you waiting for the news of Yu...

473
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,350
the 7th Prince?

474
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,110
Who says I'm waiting for his news?

475
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,000
But this matter did start

476
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,000
because of me.

477
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,080
He hit the Crown Prince.

478
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,670
If the Emperor punishes him,

479
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,320
and something happens to him,

480
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:20,830
won't I owe him then?

481
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,080
Aman, leave us.

482
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,760
You should owe me more,

483
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,630
so you can't refuse to talk to me.

484
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,430
It seems like you're perfectly fine.

485
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:41,350
Indeed,

486
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,630
the Emperor still cares about you.

487
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:44,950
Wait.

488
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,150
The Emperor has made me Prince Yan.

489
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,320
In that case,

490
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,430
congratulations, Your Highness.

491
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,000
I didn't intend to hide my background
from you.

492
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,190
I didn't think it would matter.

493
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:19,350
Whether I'm a Prince or not,

494
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,430
I don't think it'll affect us

495
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,720
but I did have

496
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,960
overlooked your feelings.

497
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,240
I know you just want
to protect your family

498
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,350
and live a peaceful life.

499
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,080
I want the same.

500
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,350
But only if I stand firm

501
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,480
can I protect you.

502
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,200
From now on,

503
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,190
I'll tell you everything

504
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,720
about me

505
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,870
at once.

506
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,900
Who wants to know everything about you?

507
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,110
I'm very busy.

508
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:48,670
But there is one thing

509
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,190
you must know.

510
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,000
What is it?

511
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:54,390
I'm fond of you.

512
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:56,680
I'm fond

513
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,240
of Miss Jiang Si,

514
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,760

00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,640
Lower your voice.

568
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,860
There are so many people here.

569
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,920
See? You knew it all along,

570
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,880
and you didn't tell me.

571
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:33,960
He was keeping it a secret.

572
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:34,830
Do you think I should

573
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:36,030
go around telling everyone?

574
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:38,280
You could've told me quietly.

575
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,870
We're so close.

576
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,870
What do you mean?

577
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,320
Well...

578
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:51,910
Tell me.

579
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,320
We're as close as siblings.

580
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,320
I'm not your sibling.

581
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,520
Don't pretend to be angry.

582
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,000
I'm still angry.

583
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,830
I'm angry

584
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,280
because he's my friend, right?

585
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,000
Aren't I

586
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,150
also your friend?

587
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,720
How can there be secrets

588
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,800
between friends?

589
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:42,080
You two are hiding something from me.

590
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,080
Then

591
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,320
let's not

592
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,560
have secrets between us.

593
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,030
The dog saw me,

594
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:05,910
but why couldn't you?

595
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,190
Chief.

596
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,480
How is it?

597
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,240
It's done?

598
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,520
Of course.

599
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,080
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

600
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,310
These clothes

601
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,350
all look too gaudy.

602
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:30,870
Didn't I tell you?

603
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,550
You should follow

604
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:34,040
Earl Dongping's servants.

605
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,280
What are you waiting for?

606
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,320
Yes.

607
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,240
So stupid.

608
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,110
Your Highness.

609
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:46,590
Mother.

610
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,240
What's wrong again?

611
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:51,680
The fabrics they bought

612
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,910
weren't to my liking,

613
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,320
so I sent them to buy again

614
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:55,590
and scolded them.

615
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,960
You've always hated Jiang Si,

616
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:00,480
but now you're imitating
her dressing style

617
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,800
to please a man.

618
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,870
How could my daughter

619
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,830
be so disgraceful?

620
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,040
Yu Jin likes her that way.

621
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,350
What can I do?

622
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,070
But you shouldn't have

623
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:14,190
urged the Crown Prince
to go to Prince Qi's Mansion.

624
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,870
Though Cousin Lang suffered,

625
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,790
Yu Jin benefited from misfortune

626
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,170
and was granted an imperial title.

627
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,080
Isn't he a perfect match for me now?

628
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,800
But he carries an ill omen.

629
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:25,790
Even if he is Prince Yan now,

630
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,110
he won't amount to much.

631
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:28,860
If you want to get married,

632
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,240
you must marry the Crown Prince.

633
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,320
I'll pave the way for you,

634
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:33,870
and one day,

635
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:36,240
you'll become the dignified Empress.

636
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,150
Who would care about that?

637
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,760
Look at Empress Di
and the Crown Princess.

638
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,430
They both have to listen to you.

639
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:44,310
You're now the most honored woman

640
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:45,760
in Dazhou.

641
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,520
All I want

642
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:52,190
is to marry the man I love.

643
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:58,390
You like him, but does he like you?

644
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,000
Do you think

645
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
you can win a man's heart

646
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,720
just with your feelings?

647
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,480
Mother,

648
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:13,240
the young men

649
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,320
around me these years

650
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,760
all sought power

651
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,240
and wanted to use us,

652
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:21,590
but Yu Jin is different.

653
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:25,590
Since he saved me
from the Jinshui River,

654
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,480
I've been determined.

655
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,560
I can give up everything.

656
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,280
I just ask for this one thing.

657
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,720
Please, Mother, help me.

658
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,150
You never like something long.

659
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,400
How do you know

660
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,320
it's not just a fleeting impulse?

661
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:48,480
Even if it's a fleeting impulse,

662
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,560
I still want him.

663
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:57,340
(Earl Dongping's Mansion)

664
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:03,520
Tonight is my wedding night,

665
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,040
yet as the Grand Princess,

666
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,920
you're forcing me to write

667
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,320
a letter of severance

668
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:10,510
just because your daughter

669
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:11,760
likes my husband?

670
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,110
I can kill Yu Qi

671
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,280
anytime, anywhere.

672
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:19,670
Jiang Si,

673
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:22,960
even if I die,

674
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,670
your life will never change.

675
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,110
You two will never be together.

676
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,580
(Qi)
Miss, look.

677
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:40,960
It's to seek your forgiveness.

678
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,150
I'm fond of you.

679
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:50,870
I'm fond of Miss Jiang Si,

680
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:52,390
daughter of Earl Dongping.

681
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,150
This time,

682
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,830
can we really stay together?

683
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,800
Chief,

684
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,480
many documents are waiting for you.

685
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,720
I'll just go look at her.

686
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,480
Your Highness.

687
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,300
Your Highness, Prince Yan's Mansion
is under construction

688
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,450
as per the Emperor's command.

689
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,670
Your Highness, please come and see.

690
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,240
Okay.

691
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,840
(From His Majesty, Prince Yan's Mansion,
23rd year of Jingming)

692
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,860
(Majesty and Prestige)

693
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:09,340
(Await the Moon)

694
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,480
Your Highness,

695
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,190
what do you think

696
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,960
of the mansion?

697
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,800
It's good,

698
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,630
but something seems to be missing.

699
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,910
Your Highness, if you want something,

700
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:26,280
please let me know,

701
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,590
and I'll take care of it
right away.

702
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:55,910
What about a pavilion here?

703
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:58,910
No.

704
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:00,450
Plant a crabapple tree.

705
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,800
A thousand-year-old crabapple.

706
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:08,030
♪Ask the day and the night♪

707
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:11,630
♪If they saw a glimmer fall

708
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:14,770

710
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:24,400
That's the western yard.

711
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,710
It's under construction.

712
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,470
Chief, Chief.

713
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,320
Over here.

714
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:33,280
This mansion is too big.

715
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,440
Come here and have a look.

716
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:36,590
Your Highness, this way, please.

717
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,790
Sure, lead the way.

718
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,560
Your Highness.

719
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,480
Your Highness.

720
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,230
I'm Zhen Heng from Capital Security.

721
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,710
Greetings, Your Highness.

722
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:15,910
Mr. Zhen,

723
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,270
what brings you here?

724
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,110
I heard

725
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,630
that you're moving today,

726
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,030
so I came to offer my congratulations.

727
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,480
Did you just hit the Dengwen Drum?

728
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,510
Is your brain okay?

729
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:29,270
It's okay.

730
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,520
I'm just a bit nervous.

731
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,080
How considerate of you.

732
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,150
I will never fail

733
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,520
your great expectations.

734
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,560
I'd like to do anything

735
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,670
to serve you.

736
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,880
Come on, bring them in.

737
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:51,040
Bring them in.

738
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:57,550
Place them here.

739
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:58,390
Here. Put them here.

740
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:02,000
Your Highness, look.

741
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:04,440
This is jade-green, lustrous as jade.

742
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,230
It's the Taohe Green Inkstone.

743
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:09,110
Now, look here.

744
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,790
This is Wanshe Ink.

745
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,510
It's glossy like lacquer,
with a good fragrance.

746
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:16,110
It's a rare treasure.

747
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:17,350
Look at this.

748
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,400
This celadon-glazed pitcher

749
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,880
and the gilded box

750
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,880
are personally selected

751
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,710
by me for you.

752
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:25,710
What's wrong with Mr. Zhen?

753
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,720
He's gone mad.

754
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,720
By the way,

755
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,000
I have one more thing.

756
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,360
This is a gold-carved jade-inlaid

757
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,110
little turtle.

758
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,790
These are all small gifts

759
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,080
from me.

760
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:43,920
Your Highness, please accept them.

761
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:58,040
Since you have such filial piety,

762
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,630
then I have to accept

763
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:01,400
these precious gifts.

764
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:06,000
It's my honor.

765
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,880
Enough.

766
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:09,520
You've flattered me enough.

767
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,840
I dare flatter

768
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:19,630
anyone,

769
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:23,110
but I can't

770
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,270
flatter you now.

771
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:31,100
(Earl Dongping's Mansion)

772
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:32,960
Captain Xie, why have you
come to Ling'an?

773
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:35,560
I resigned from my post in Lingshui

774
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,480
and planned to settle in Ling'an.

775
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:40,470
Why?

776
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,040
Miss Jiang,

777
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,190
do you really not know?

778
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:51,190
You're extraordinary.

779
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,440
Whether in Lingshui or Ling'an,

780
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,630
many noble ladies would like you.

781
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:58,390
- You shouldn't...
- I once missed my chance,

782
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:02,500
and I don't want to miss it again.

783
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:06,150
She's the only woman I want to marry.

784
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,320
You know it.

785
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,670
I've made up my mind,

786
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:25,210
and I won't marry anyone.

787
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,000
Since I returned home,

788
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,480
I've been with my family,

789
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,520
watching Yan grow day by day.

790
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:36,640
My life has been simple and peaceful,

791
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,360
and I don't have to please anyone.

792
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:40,710
I'm very content

793
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:42,630
with my life now.

794
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,310
From now on, I only want this.

795
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,630
Captain Xie, I'm sorry.

796
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:59,360
I was being abrupt.

797
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:01,840
I expressed my feelings

798
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:05,080
without asking how you felt first.

799
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:06,920
You're doing well now,

800
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:08,960
and I'm happy for you.

801
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,820
I've waited in Lingshui for seven years.

802
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,710
I don't mind another seven years.

803
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,000
As long as you're willing,

804
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:20,000
I'll always be behind you.

805
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:47,700
(Jiang)

806
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:01,590
Princess Fuqing.

807
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,480
Please take it.

808
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:05,920
It's you?

809
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:07,910
It's me.

810
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,250
I'm surprised you remember me.

811
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,320
Your Highness!

812
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,230
Mr. Zhen.

813
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:14,430
Eunuch Liu.

814
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:15,560
Mr. Zhen.

815
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,160
Thank you.

816
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:20,670
My pleasure, Your Highness.

817
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:21,840
Your Highness,

818
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,670
please stop playing
with that bamboo bird.

819
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:25,360
If you're hurt,

820
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:28,230
how will I explain it to His Majesty?

821
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,230
I was supposed to fly a kite,

822
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,590
but unfortunately,
I couldn't see anything.

823
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:37,950
Your Highness,

824
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,920
I know a kite

825
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,150
that can talk.

826
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,590
Even if you can't see it,

827
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,790
you can hear it

828
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:45,400
and know where it flies.

829
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,710
It can talk?

830
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,670
Does such a thing exist?

831
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:50,990
It does.

832
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:53,110
Next time I enter the Palace,

833
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,300
I'll bring one for you.

834
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,230
That'd be great, Mr. Zhen.

835
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,590
Thank you, Mr. Zhen.

836
00:40:58,630 --> 00:40:59,630
It's my honor.

837
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,330
You suddenly treated me to a meal.

838
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:09,830
Is there something you need?

839
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,840
No.

840
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:12,030
I just wanted to treat you

841
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:13,230
to some noodles.

842
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,400
Speaking of noodles,

843
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,360
for some reason,

844
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,080
it makes me think of my sister.

845
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:25,110
You don't know.

846
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,960
My sister

847
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,230
has a lot of flaws.

848
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,140
For example,

849
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,880
she sometimes takes things
too seriously,

850
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,510
which makes those who aren't serious

851
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:34,400
feel embarrassed.

852
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:35,510
Also,

853
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:36,670
she has a stubborn temper.

854
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:37,970
When she gets stubborn,

855
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:39,190
even nine oxen can't stop her.

856
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:40,030
There's more.

857
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:41,670
Sometimes when she's fierce,

858
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:42,630
even I, her brother,

859
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:43,470
get scared.

860
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:46,710
Why are you telling me this?

861
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,790
I want you to talk

862
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:56,750
to your senior

863
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:57,840
and persuade him.

864
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:00,440
There are many adorable ladies.

865
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,440
People are often asked
to put in a good word,

866
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:06,750
but you're asking me

867
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:08,710
to speak ill of Miss Jiang?

868
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:10,920
Qi's finally found someone he likes.

869
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,190
I can't bring myself to say this.

870
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:16,150
I can't beat him,

871
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:17,400
and now he's a Prince.

872
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,190
If he bullies my sister in the future,

873
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,480
who will be able to stop him?

874
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,760
Another bowl.

875

(Earl Dongping's Mansion)

876
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:29,870
Your Highness.

877
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,790
Uncle, how are you?

878
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:33,770
Your Highness, you came in person.

879
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:35,230
Sorry for not welcoming you properly.

880
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,960
Sorry for not welcoming you properly.

881
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:37,920
It's okay.

882
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,840
Uncle, I'll go find Si.

883
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:43,680
Your Highness.

884
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:52,840
You've been away from home
since childhood,

885
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,310
fighting alone

886
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:56,520
on the frontier battlefield,

887
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:58,840
and achieving great military feats.

888
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,230
Now, in Ling'an,

889
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,360
you're leading Capital Security,

890
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,840
solving cases, and upholding justice.

891
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:09,710
You're truly a talented

892
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:11,960
and extraordinary young man.

893
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,750
Uncle, you flatter me.

894
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:16,670
But Your Highness,

895
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,670
I can't entrust Si

896
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:20,960
to you.
