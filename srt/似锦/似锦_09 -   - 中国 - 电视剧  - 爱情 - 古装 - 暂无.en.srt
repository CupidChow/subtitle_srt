11
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,090
(Earl Dongping's Mansion)

12
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:41,930
Lady Jiang,

13
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,600
I heard
that there's an event here today.

14
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,760
Though you didn't invite me,

15
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,770
I've prepared a humble gift

16
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,930
out of admiration

17
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,130
to express my sincerity.

18
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,730
May you be blessed

19
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:55,770
and live long.

20
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,320
Thank you.

21
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,200
This birthday banquet

22
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,890
was just an excuse for me

23
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,840
to gather the family

24
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,850
together.

25
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,090
I never expected you
and Mr. Zhen to come.

26
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,000
What a delightful surprise.

27
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:12,490
Mr. Zhen,

28
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,250
I have long wanted
to find an opportunity

29
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,000
to properly thank you.

30
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,120
Our family faced many difficulties

31
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,590
some time ago.

32
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,380
It was all thanks
to Capital Security's support.

33
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,210
Lady Jiang,

34
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,400
you are too kind.

35
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,050
Upholding justice

36
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,160
is the duty

37
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,000
of Capital Security.

38
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,330
I was merely

39
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,000
handling cases impartially.

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,840
Mr. Zhen has a righteous heart,

41
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,650
which is a blessing

42
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:37,930
to the people of Ling'an.

43
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,090
Thank you for your praise.

44
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,370
You flatter me.

45
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,090
When I went in just now,

46
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,560
I saw the whole place

47
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,650
bustling with life.

48
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:46,840
Such a flourishing household

49
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,560
is truly enviable.

50
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,680
At my age, having children

51
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,490
and grandchildren
is the greatest blessing.

52
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:54,560
Indeed.

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,210
All the young ladies here
are well-educated

54
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,490
and graceful.

55
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,330
Especially Miss Si.

56
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,930
What do you mean by that?

57
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,400
A while ago,

58
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,990
such a horrifying incident

59
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,240
occurred

60
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:08,800
at Marquis Changxing's Mansion.

61
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,520
Yet Miss Si not only survived the danger

62
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,720
but also rescued her elder sister.

63
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:16,930
Speaking of which,

64
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,840
Ms. Jiang Qian is truly unfortunate

65
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,650
to have been caught up in such a thing.

66
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:21,610
Mother.

67
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,890
Lady Jiang taught Miss Si so well

68
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,650
that she could be so smart

69
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,970
and brave.

70
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:34,880
Indeed.

71
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,330
As her aunt,

72
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:38,210
I am also deeply grateful to Si.

73
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:39,560
If not for her,

74
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,090
who knows

75
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,120
what kind of suffering

76
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,840
Qian would still be enduring?

77
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,960
Your daughter has returned home.

78
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,810
With her by your side,

79
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,090
you should count yourself lucky.

80
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,170
That's true.

81
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,600
With Qian by my side,

82
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,090
at least she has someone to rely on.

83
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,650
Unlike Si,

84
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,170
who lost her mother at a young age.

85
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,840
Lost her mother?

86
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,370
Yes.

87
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,400
Her mother died the moment she was born.

88
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,760
People say she brings misfortune...

89
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,720
She's a child of ill fate.

90
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,210
Without a mother's guidance,

91
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,310
she has still turned out to be
a fine young lady.

92
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:17,920
Your family truly breeds

93
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,570
exceptional people.

94
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,430
To think that such a fine young lady

95
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,330
was rejected

96
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,520
by Duke An's family,

97
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:25,920
they really have no vision.

98
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,440
Lady Jiang,

99
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,800
may I ask if Miss Si has since found

100
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,040
another good match?

101
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:32,690
Not yet.

102
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:33,920
After all,

103
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,960
good men are hard to come by.

104
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,650
How many are as outstanding

105
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:39,840
as Mr. Zhen?

106
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,400
Lady Jiang, you flatter us.

107
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:44,970
For today's banquet,

108
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,010
Ms. Jiang Qian has prepared

109
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,360
fine jewelry and hairpins

110
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,600
as a gift for Miss Pei.

111
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,800
What do you mean by this?

112
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,010
Miss Pei said the things

113
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:52,480
from Marquis Changxing's family

114
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,600
are unlucky.

115
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,570
She dares not keep them.

116
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:55,650
How dare you despise us?

117
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,770
Back when Ms. Jiang Qian

118
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:57,920
was still the heir's wife,

119
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,400
Miss Pei would rush

120
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:00,530
to receive the gifts

121
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:01,650
from the Marquis's family.

122
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,490
And now...

123
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,770
You are right.

124
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,110
Time has changed.

125
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,360
Marquis Changxing's heir
has been sentenced to death,

126
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,400
and Ms. Jiang Qian

127
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,530
is now a cast-off woman

128
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:11,480
after the divorce.

129
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,320
It's not surprising.

130
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,130
How could Ms. Jiang Qian be so ruthless

131
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,130
as to lead her own sister

132
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,400
into a den of wolves and tigers?

133
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,690
In that case,

134
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:18,770
we truly must thank Miss Si.

135
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,040
If not for her,

136
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,020
our young lady might have
suffered the same fate.

137
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,160
You wretched maid,

138
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,940
have you lost your mind?

139
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,500
How dare you gossip about your master!

140
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:28,920
Ms. Xiao, I'm sorry.

141
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,210
I will never do it again.

142
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:31,400
You listen carefully.

143
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,690
Even if my daughter has divorced,
she is still

144
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:34,840
the most honorable young lady

145
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,890
in this household.

146
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,240
Ms. Xiao, I'm sorry.

147
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,280
Please forgive me, Ms. Xiao.

148
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,020
Mrs. Li,

149
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,100
lock her in the woodshed

150
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,340
and starve her for three days,

151
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,070
so she learns who rules this household.

152
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,580
- Have mercy!
- Where is Jiang Pei?

153
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:47,970
I haven't seen her for three days.

154
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,360
She hasn't come to greet me,

155
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,630
disrespecting her lineal mother.

156
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:51,920
Confine her for half a month

157
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,090
to reflect on her mistakes.

158
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,480
My Lady,

159
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,690
I don't think the Zhen family

160
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,250
is influential in Ling'an.

161
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:03,130
What do you know?

162
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,400
Noble families

163
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,890
are not all the same.

164
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,330
Some have high status

165
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:11,330
and hold great influence

166
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,280
in court.

167
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:16,250
Everyone aspires to join such families.

168
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,130
But our family,

169
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:19,480
far away from court affairs,

170
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,210
merely receiving stipends on schedule,

171
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:24,280
is far less prestigious

172
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,800
than an official

173
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,210
who holds real power.

174
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,250
Zhen Heng...

175
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:31,600
Zhen Heng is

176
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,090
the Vice Prefect of Capital Security.

177
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,480
Not only is he powerful,

178
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,210
but he is also favored

179
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,890
by His Majesty.

180
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,690
His future is limitless.

181
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:47,920
In that case,

182
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,520
Miss Si is truly fortunate.

183
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:53,720
Her mother

184
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,690
died shortly

185
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:56,920
after giving birth to her,

186
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,010
and her father
lost his official position.

187
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,800
Our noble title will be gone

188
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,890
after three generations.

189
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,690
Think about it.

190
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,010
How grand and dignified

191
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,650
my past birthday banquets were.

192
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:11,450
The banquet now is much worse.

193
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,320
Grandmother,

194
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,160
you called for me?

195
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:19,530
Si,

196
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,090
come and sit by my side.

197
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:26,280
Si,

198
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,570
Mr. Zhen and his mother

199
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:31,650
came today to celebrate my birthday.

200
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:32,960
As you know,

201
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:34,600
our household has faced

202
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,400
many misfortunes lately,

203
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,250
and Mr. Zhen helped us.

204
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:40,370
Today,

205
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,280
you must take good care

206
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,720
of Mrs. Zhen.

207
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,280
Do you understand?

208
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,810
Yes, Grandmother.

209
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,480
This color is too bright

210
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:01,010
for your hair ornament.

211
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,600
Your hairpin

212
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,650
is too plain.

213
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,330
Let me choose one for you.

214
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,770
This one...

215
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,400
I wore this when I married

216
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,250
your grandfather.

217
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,800
It's festive.

218
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,130
Grandmother, I...

219
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:19,290
Take it.

220
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,840
Thank you, Grandmother.

221
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:27,050
Fu,

222
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,280
ask the steward

223
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,600
to buy more fine fabric.

224
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,170
Si,

225
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:34,170
go pick out a few good ones

226
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:36,720
and have some new dresses made.

227
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,120
Also,

228
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,330
your jewelry

229
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:41,570
needs to be remade.

230
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,090
Treasure Shop.

231
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,720
Go to Treasure Shop.

232
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:46,190
They have beautiful pieces.

233
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:47,640
Pick out a few more.

234
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,450
Charge it to the household account.

235
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:52,360
Thank you, Grandmother.

236
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,320
Qian.

237
00:08:58,810 --> 00:08:59,690
Qian.

238
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,290
This child.

239
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,170
She's drinking again.

240
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:12,130
Qian.

241
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:16,330
Qian, you must stop drinking.

242
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,930
Mother, you're back.

243
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:20,770
Look at this.

244
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:24,360
The Letter of Divorce is real, right?

245
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,690
Cao Xingyu

246
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,050
has nothing to do with me, right?

247
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,880
He'll never hit me again, right?

248
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:33,840
Qian,

249
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,170
these past few days,

250
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:38,450
you've read the Letter of Divorce
over and over.

251
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:39,570
The words are written

252
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:41,090
in black and white.

253
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,530
You no longer have to live in fear.

254
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,090
That wretched man

255
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:46,370
will be executed after autumn.

256
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:49,760
That's wonderful, Mother.

257
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,090
- Give me more wine.
- Stop drinking.

258
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,720
Let me drink more to enjoy myself.

259
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:56,000
Qian, stop drinking.

260
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:05,840
Do you want

261
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:06,880
to waste your life

262
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,930
in wine forever?

263
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,170
Is that beast who beat you every day

264
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:12,480
worth it?

265
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:16,410
My life?

266
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:20,050
I am a divorced woman.

267
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,520
Everyone in this house

268
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,880
looks down on me.

269
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,290
What life do I have?

270
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,120
So what if you are divorced?

271
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,360
Our Empress Jiahui

272
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,360
was also sent back to her family.

273
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,970
Yet she later married the Emperor,

274
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:35,690
standing above all but one.

275
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,320
Qian,

276
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,570
I know

277
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,090
your body aches

278
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:46,600
and your heart suffers,

279
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,000
but one failed marriage

280
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,450
does not mean

281
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,360
you should lose your ambition.

282
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:55,210
If we plan carefully,

283
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:58,240
the future will bring new opportunities.

284
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,600
One day,

285
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,880
you'll become your grandmother's

286
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:10,050
proudest granddaughter again.

287
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,840
Mother,

288
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:19,290
is that true?

289
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,170
I promise you.

290
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,050
Everything will get better.

291
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,120
Come on, get up.

292
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,600
If you listen to me

293
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:40,600
and stop drowning yourself in alcohol,

294
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,330
you will live

295
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,810
an even better life

296
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:44,720
than Jiang Si.

297
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,360
Jiang Si?

298
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,170
Mother,

299
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:56,690
do you bear a grudge against her?

300
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,210
If not for her,

301
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,480
I might never have escaped.

302
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:03,410
She's been visiting me

303
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,240
these past few days.

304
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,760
She is far kinder

305
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:11,450
than that wretched
and ungrateful Jiang Pei.

306
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,960
Why am I being confined?

307
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,940
I can't even attend
Grandmother's banquet.

308
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,090
Mother, what should I do?

309
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:21,600
I was hoping that Mother

310
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,790
could introduce me to Mr. Zhen

311
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:24,530
at the banquet.

312
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,840
Pei,

313
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:27,210
Ms. Jiang Qian

314
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:28,810
kindly gifted you jewelry, hairpins,

315
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,170
silks, and satins.

316
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:31,690
I told you

317
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:32,690
to accept them.

318
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:33,840
You don't have to wear them.

319
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,290
Why return them?

320
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,640
Those things are tainted.

321
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,480
It's kind enough of me

322
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:40,480
to send them back
instead of burning them.

323
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,720
If you don't change your temper,

324
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,700
you will suffer for it.

325
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,480
At the end of the day,

326
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,930
Ms. Xiao is just your lineal mother.

327
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,210
If you offend Ms. Jiang Qian,

328
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:49,930
Ms. Xiao won't let you off easily.

329
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,810
Jiang Pei is a fool

330
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,880
who focuses on trivialities

331
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,570
and misses the bigger picture.

332
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,240
Her schemes are written

333
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,810
all over her face

334
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,150
as if she's afraid others
won't notice them.

335
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,690
But Jiang Si is different.

336
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,570
She is deep

337
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:06,810
and calculating,

338
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:08,480
hiding behind an innocent facade.

339
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,290
Who would've thought could do that?

340
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,450
She got annulled, filed a lawsuit,

341
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:13,570
and convinced you to divorce.

342
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,840
Which of these

343
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,000
could Jiang Pei have pulled off?

344
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:19,760
Qian says she hasn't been sleeping well.

345
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,360
I was thinking of making

346
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,540
a sleeping fragrance for her.

347
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,840
Ms. Xiao and Ms. Jiang Qian

348
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,880
treat you badly,

349
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,060
yet you're still good to her.

350
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:28,760
Qian is just a pitiful soul
with no control over her fate.

351
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:31,480
Aman,

352
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,600
one cannot always dwell

353
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,690
on the past,

354
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,410
or they'll be trapped.

355
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,090
How can they move forward then?

356
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,640
Regardless,

357
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,170
she did help me in some way.

358
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,410
Help you?

359
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,450
I think she simply reaped

360
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,050
the benefits.

361
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,930
You're suffering now,

362
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:51,690
and we're worried about you here,

363
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:53,520
but their chamber

364
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,170
is filled with laughter and joy.

365
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,810
You don't know this, right?

366
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:01,330
She's used this chance

367
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,810
to secure a connection

368
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:04,600
with Zhen Heng from Capital Security.

369
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,930
What?

370
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,930
You are still young

371
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:10,840
and do not understand these things,

372
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,960
but you must remember

373
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,120
that she and you can't prosper together.

374
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,930
If Jiang Si gains the upper hand,

375
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,600
even I will struggle to deal

376
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,330
with someone scheming like her.

377
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:25,640
Mother, don't worry.

378
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,880
Zhen Heng should not worry you.

379
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,330
I've heard

380
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,720
he is notoriously ruthless.

381
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,600
He has offended

382
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,240
nearly every noble in Ling'an,

383
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,530
which has dimmed his future.

384
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,960
That's why he remains unmarried

385
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,410
even at 25.

386
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:47,480
That's only what's on the surface.

387
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,170
I have looked into this.

388
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,930
Zhen Heng has a sterling reputation
among civil officials.

389
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:55,130
His appointment to Capital Security
was arranged by His Majesty.

390
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,480
His Majesty seems indifferent to him,

391
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:00,480
but in reality, he is training him.

392
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,120
Zhen is bound for the Secretariat

393
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:03,810
and may become the Prime Minister.

394
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,450
If Jiang Si becomes

395
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,720
the Prime Minister's wife,

396
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,570
what will

397
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,000
happen to us?

398
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,210
(I must think of a way)

399
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,450
(to stop her from marrying Zhen Heng.)

400
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,940
Jiang Si has set her sights
on Mr. Zhen as well?

401
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,810
I am not your birth mother,

402
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,840
but you still call me Mother.

403
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,170
Qian is unreliable,

404
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,120
so I had hoped to count on you.

405
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,690
What a pity.

406
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:48,130
Mother,

407
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,640
help me think of a plan.

408
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,410
Mother...

409
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,690
Everything before was my fault.

410
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,170
Punish me however you want,

411
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,450
but please help me.

412
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:58,450
Please, Mother.

413
00:15:58,450 --> 00:15:59,840
I beg you, Mother.

414
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,530
I have

415
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,600
a plan,

416
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,290
but I don't know

417
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,530
if you dare to use it.

418
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,500
(Longevity)

419
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,500
(Jiang)

420
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,320
Leave me.

421
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,440
Mrs. Zhen, please have a seat.

422
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,490
Mr. Zhen.

423
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,560
Miss Jiang.

424
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:13,790
Let me introduce you.

425
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,080
This is my mother.

426
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,730
Miss Si, we meet again.

427
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:20,890
Si,

428
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,490
when did you meet Mrs. Zhen?

429
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:24,970
My niece

430
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,000
will be here soon.

431
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,250
I want to prepare two gifts for her.

432
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:31,770
Greetings, Mrs. Zhen.

433
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:34,640
Mother, you and Miss Jiang...

434
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:37,880
Fate brought us together.

435
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:40,130
Such a lively event.

436
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,220
Our family is quite large.

437
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,320
Uncle Anmou.

438
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,970
Who's this?

439
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,080
This is Commandant Yu
from Capital Security,

440
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:49,970
a dear friend of mine.

441
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,120
Oh, you're Zhan's friend.

442
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:53,810
Welcome.

443
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,120
Let's go.

444
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,160
Mr. Zhen

445
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,560
always hovers

446
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,770
around my sister.

447
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,520
How inappropriate.

448
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,610
It makes me so mad.

449
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:08,450
Indeed.

450
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:10,920
Why are you mad?

451
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,880
I'm mad because of you.

452
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,540
You're such a good friend.

453
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,360
At the birthday banquet,

454
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:20,800
I would like

455
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,770
to raise a toast

456
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:24,970
to share this joy with everyone.

457
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:28,880
May our family
be prosperous and blessed.

458
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:30,290
Cheers!

459
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:41,770
- Mother.
- Indeed.

460
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,240
In our family,

461
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,320
Si is skilled in the art of fragrance.

462
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,410
Since today is your birthday,

463
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:50,170
why not have her offer fragrance
as a blessing?

464
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,880
That'd be great.

465
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:53,800
With Si here,

466
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,280
we won't need

467
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,760
to invite

468
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,680
feast officials anymore.

469
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,290
Grandmother, on your birthday today,

470
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:02,010
I present fragrances as my gift.

471
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:03,810
May the lingering fragrance

472
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:05,880
bring joy to you

473
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,050
and everyone present.

474
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:13,010
This drug is called Drunk at 8th Step.

475
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,260
It's colorless and tasteless,

476
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,160
but it can make someone intoxicated.

477
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,650
If Jiang Si gets drunk

478
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:19,640
in front of everyone,

479
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,920
who knows
what disgraceful things she'll do?

480
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,450
After that, how could she

481
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:24,770
and Mr. Zhen still be possible?

482
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:26,250
Pei,

483
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,010
this is
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

484
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:31,360
I've tried my best to help you.

485
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,050
You must seize it.

486
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:23,770
Such an exquisite fragrance.

487
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:25,760
Girls, children.

488
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,840
Come here.

489
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,850
Come on.

490
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:30,090
Enjoy the scent.

491
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,080
What a rare and wonderful aroma.

492
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:33,920
Come on.

493
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,200
Everyone, breathe it in.

494
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,570
My sister's fragrance
is truly delightful.

495
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:52,200
The sky has changed color.

496
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,090
Alright, children,

497
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:59,250
go back to your seats now.

498
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:03,290
What a marvelous scent.

499
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:04,840
Truly marvelous.

500
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,160
Where is...

501
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,120
Where is Miss Si?

502
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,120
Where is Jiang Si?

503
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,200
Commandant Yu is gone too?

504
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:14,130
Could it be

505
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:16,600
that Si eloped with Commandant Yu?

506
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,360
Shut your mouth.

507
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,200
Mrs. Zhen, Mr. Zhen,

508
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:23,850
please forgive us.

509
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:24,690
Zhan,

510
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,600
isn't Commandant Yu your friend?

511
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:27,690
Where is he?

512
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,640
Go find him.

513
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:31,130
How strange.

514
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:31,970
Let's go.

515
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:32,880
I'll help look too.

516
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,080
Xiao.

517
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:36,320
Go search for them.

518
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,770
Could it be that Miss Si is unwell?

519
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:40,010
Yes.

520
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:41,690
Mrs. Li,

521
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:42,840
search carefully.

522
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,410
Leave no corner unchecked.

523
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:45,250
Yes.

524
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,280
You two, check that side.

525
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,120
Yes, My Lady.

526
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:50,320
You two, search this way.

527
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,160
Yes.

528
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:55,560
Have you seen Miss Si?

529
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,400
No.

530
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,410
Have you seen Miss Si?

531
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:58,250
No.

532
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:01,880
Si!

533
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,610
Have you seen my sister?

534
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:05,810
No, Young Master Zhan.

535
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,450
- Hurry.
- Have you seen my sister?

536
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:09,160
- No.
- Go and find her.

537
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:10,450
Si!

538
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,560
My Lady,

539
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:13,080
we've searched the backyard.

540
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:13,920
No sign of her.

541
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:15,050
You two,

542
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:16,690
keep a close watch on Haitang Chamber.

543
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:18,120
You two, search thoroughly.

544
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,080
Yes.

545
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,410
Have you found her?

546
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:22,810
No. Yi, what about you?

547
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,220
Let's check over there.

548
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,210
This is bizarre.

549
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:31,200
There's no sign of her everywhere.

550
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:48,770
Let's go.

551
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:10,010
Honey, don't go.

552
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:13,360
Honey, don't go.

553
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,390
Miss Jiang, what did you just call me?

554
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:16,290
Honey.

555
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,770
Didn't you say you missed me?

556
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:19,770
Sit down.

557
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,560
Miss Jiang, what's wrong with you?

558
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,400
Honey,

559
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,970
didn't you say you missed me?

560
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:25,330
Come here.

561
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,320
Alright.

562
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:28,840
Keep your voice down.

563
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:29,970
I'll sit.

564
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:30,920
Honey.

565
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,530
Honey.

566
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:37,360
Why won't you hold me?

567
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:39,880
I miss you.

568
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:43,530
Honey,

569
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:46,770
didn't you promise me

570
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,200
that we'd settle down

571
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:49,880
in Dazhou together?

572
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,530
Settle down in Dazhou?

573
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:56,280
Do you like Dazhou?

574
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,490
Of course, I do.

575
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,770
I was born and raised

576
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,160
in Dazhou.

577
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:03,120
How could I not love it?

578
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:05,770
But I like

579
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,160
living with you even more.

580
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,320
Miss Jiang, this isn't proper.

581
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,160

593
00:25:58,450 --> 00:25:59,530
it's all my fault.

594
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,730
Even if we're together,

595
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:05,210
will it still not

596
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:06,360
end well?

597
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,530
Will we eventually be separated?

598
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:15,770
How could this happen?

599
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:17,730
Honey...

600
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:21,050
What are you talking about?

601
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,450
I'm so hot.

602
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,160
I'm so hot.

603
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:27,530
Miss Jiang...

604
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:29,890
Honey,

605
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:31,010
don't you miss me?

606
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,440
Honey,

607
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,810
come here.

608
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:36,970
Honey.

609
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,570
Commandant Yu,

610
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,770
what have you done to me?

611
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,290
I saved you.

612
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,810
Why do I feel so dizzy?

613
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,090
Someone must have

614
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,360
poisoned you.

615
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,200
Poisoned?

616
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,840
Who poisoned me?

617
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:10,500
You'll have to figure it out yourself.

618
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,200
How did you bring me here?

619
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:17,690
Did you hold me?

620
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:19,450
If not, how could I have
brought you here?

621
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:20,880
In front of everyone?

622
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:23,610
They did see us.

623
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:25,320
How will I explain this then?

624
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,650
There's no way I can clarify this.

625
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:28,070
I also don't know how to explain it.

626
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:37,250
But I have thought of a way

627
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:38,430
to solve it once and for all.

628
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,490
What is it?

629
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,400
Marry me.

630
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,050
Si,

631
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:52,530
I want to marry you.

632
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,010
I want you to be my wife

633
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,440
and be with you forever.

634
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:02,360
Everyone I care about

635
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,120
has died tragically.

636
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,440
I'm afraid you will too.

637
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:13,330
Then you must marry me.

638
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:16,680
Because I am an unlucky man.

639
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,120
From now on,

640
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:20,440
we can be unlucky together.

641
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,010
If only I could meet you earlier.

642
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:27,570
If I had appeared earlier,

643
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,480
I could have shielded you

644
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,600
from all the calamities.

645
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,600
From now on,

646
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:34,570
I want to face

647
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,360
the uncertainties with you.

648
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:39,920
Do you believe me?

649
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:43,640
I don't believe in fate,

650
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:46,920
but I believe in you.

651
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,210
Si,

652
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:10,250
marry me.

653
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,720
Mother,

654
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:20,040
we've searched the entire house,

655
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,970
but there's no sign of Si.

656
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,810
Commandant Yu is missing too.

657
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:27,330
Could it be that Si

658
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,890
and Commandant Yu

659
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:31,160
really left together?

660
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,010
No way.

661
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:34,720
If they are together,

662
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,330
what will we do if this gets out?

663
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:38,480
Si was just rejected

664
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,440
by Duke An's family.

665
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:41,850
If she's involved

666
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:42,760
in such a scandal...

667
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,680
Enough!

668
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:45,600
Your sister still hasn't been found,

669
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,800
yet as her younger sister,

670
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,690
you have the time to mock her?

671
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:50,170
I'm just worried.

672
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:51,530
Anything could happen

673
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,560
when we can't find her.

674
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,640
Pei, be quiet.

675
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,460
Don't embarrass yourself

676
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,740
in front of Mrs. Zhen's family.

677
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,840
Sit down.

678
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,840
Lady Jiang,

679
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:04,250
I think

680
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,250
there's something fishy about it.

681
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:08,970
If you need assistance
from Capital Security,

682
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,680
please let me know.

683
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,530
This is a family matter.

684
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:15,160
There's no need to trouble you.

685
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,090
Thank you for your kindness.

686
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,150
The internal affairs of the family

687
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,450
truly need to be

688
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:22,290

00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,290
No need to watch her anymore.

716
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:28,400
Chief, didn't you tell me to do that?

00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:30,920
Why suddenly stop it?

718
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,570

00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:12,680

00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,520

Did you ever think of that

762
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:25,260

00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:27,210

00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,600
As expected.

766
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,230
What kind of drug is this?

767
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:35,880
I don't know.

768
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,030
It has nothing to do with me.

769
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:37,770
I don't know.

770
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:39,800
It's not mine.

771
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:46,200
When Qian helped Cao Xingyu lead you

772
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,810
into Marquis Changxing's Mansion,

773
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:49,510
why didn't you have
this kind of courage?

774
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:50,820
Why didn't you hold scissors

775
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:51,570
to her neck?

776
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:54,930
Stop dragging others down with you.

777
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:56,520
She did it because she was desperate.

778
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,410
She had to do it

779
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:58,600
to protect herself.

780
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,860
She didn't want to harm anyone.

781
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:00,890
But you?

782
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:02,450
Did someone force you to drug me?

783
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,730
You schemed to destroy me

784
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:05,320
in front of everyone.

785
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,280
Jiang Pei, you are

786
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,720
much more malicious than Qian.

787
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:16,930
What do you know?

788
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,800
How can you say I'm worse
than Jiang Qian?

789
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:19,890
If I were a lineal daughter

790
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:21,090
like you all,

791
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,010
would I have to fight and scheme

792
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:24,130
for everything?

793
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:25,860
Jiang Qian has always been

794
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,240
better than me since we were little.

795
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,240
She's never respected me.

796
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:32,160
Whatever she wanted,

797
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:33,680
Mother would practically

798
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,930
give it to her.

799
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,480
What about me?

800
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:37,850
I've been humble,

801
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,720
serving Mother every day,

802
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:43,370
but I don't even have
a marriage proposal.

803
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,450
You're like them.

804
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,150
You're a high and mighty

805
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,480
lineal daughter of First Branch.

806
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,120
Just like everyone else in this family!

807
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,160
You're the same!

808
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,680
You all look down on me,

809
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,040
whose mother is a concubine.

810
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,930
Yes, I look down on you.

811
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:57,390
But it has nothing to do

812
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:58,450
with your background.

813
00:36:58,930 --> 00:36:59,810
It's because

814
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:00,800
of your vile character.

815
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:02,480
For so many years,

816
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,830
how many times have you bullied me

817
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:05,160
and made things hard for me?

818
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,320
Can you even count?

819
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:08,700
After the incident
at Marquis Changxing's Mansion,

820
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:10,250
I thought you would change.

821
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,370
But it seems

822
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:13,050
you've gotten even worse now.

823
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:15,280
How can you want others to respect you?

824
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:17,200
Do you think people are blind?

825
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:20,850
It's Mother.

826
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,480
No.

827
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:23,800
It's Ms. Xiao.

828
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:25,570
She gave me the drug.

829
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,160
She told me

830
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:28,800
that if you made a scene,

831
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,930
Mrs. Zhen would never let you

832
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:31,090
be her daughter-in-law.

833
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,800
That way, I'd have a chance.

834
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:35,570
Pei,

835
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,320
you're both vile

836
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:38,970
and foolish.

837
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,900
(Cixin Hall)
What?

838
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:52,410
Commandant Yu was gone too?

839
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,160
I don't know anything about that.

840
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,600
Your story

841
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,890
of picking lotus flowers
to offer blessings

842
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,640
might've fooled others,

843
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:02,370
so last night,

844
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:04,370
I didn't expose you
in front of everyone.

845
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:06,570
Don't push it.

846
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:09,760
Grandmother, I'm sorry.

847
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,410
I did keep it from you.

848
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:14,930
I had unbearable stomach pain
last night,

849
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,160
so I hurried back to Haitang Chamber

850
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:19,050
before I could tell anyone.

851
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,600
Nonsense.

852
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:22,560
Last night, I had people
guard Haitang Chamber,

853
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,160
but they didn't see you there.

854
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,720
Aunt Xiao, what do you mean?

855
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:28,160
You had someone block the door?

856
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,490
Were you hoping I would come back

857
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,160
or hoping I wouldn't?

858
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:35,410
Why do you assume

859
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:36,800
the worst of others' kindness?

860
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,680
I was concerned about you.

861
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,500
You disappeared, and so did Mr. Yu.

862
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,930
I was worried about what he might...

863
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:42,870
If Mr. Yu really wanted

864
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:43,850
to harm me,

865
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:45,970
would he choose such a public place?

866
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,520
Instead of worrying

867
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,490
about that,

868
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,410
you should focus

869
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,720
on managing the household.

870
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,540
What does that have to do
with my managing the household?

871
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,020
I had sudden stomach pain last night,

872
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,820
and I think someone poisoned me.

873
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,460
That's impossible.

874
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,260
Mother, you know me.

875
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,760
I'm always meticulous.

876
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,940
There are rarely any mistakes.

877
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:09,380
Who would dare poison her under my nose?

878
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,700
That's absolutely impossible.

879
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,060
Didn't Mr. Zhen

880
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,860
also mention it last night?

881
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,140
Do you all remember?

882
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,100
There must be
something fishy about this.

883
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,540
Si is just

884
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,220
following Mr. Zhen's words

885
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,780
and spreading nonsense here.

886
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,100
Aunt Xiao,

887
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:26,220
when Mr. Zhen said that,

888
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,380
my sister wasn't here.

889
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:31,980
Xiao,

890
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,540
there must be something fishy...

891
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,540
What's with your family?

892
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,820
What do you mean?

893
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,420
Why are you targeting me?

894
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,860
We were talking about why Si

895
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,940
suddenly disappeared.

896
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,780
Why does this concern me?

897
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,220
Why not report it to the authorities?

898
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:47,020
Mr. Zhen can investigate this.

899
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,940
It's a family matter.
No need to report it.

900
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,380
Right.

901
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:53,580
Si is perfectly fine here.

902
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:54,660
Why report it?

903
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:55,660
Mother is right.

904
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,820
From now on, our girls

905
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,740
should stay away from generals

906
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,580
like Mr. Yu.

907
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,220
What happened to Qian

908
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:05,700
is a lesson to us.

909
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,020
Grandmother,

910
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,540
you can't think all generals

911
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,860
are like that.

912
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,500
Does Cao Xingyu's malice

913
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,060
mean that all generals

914
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,140
are bad?

915
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:16,580
If it weren't for generals
defending the borders,

916
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,380
how could we live peacefully?

917
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:20,660
Mother, listen to that.

918
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,260
Is this something

919
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,660
a lady should say?

920
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:26,220
You really have a sharp tongue.

921
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,900
Do you have something going on

922
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,420
with him?

923
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:32,740
Grandmother, of course not.

924
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:33,580
No?

925
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,180
Fine, then.

926
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,100
Alright.

927
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:41,540
We've been talking here for a while.

928
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,800
I'm tired. Let's call it a day.

929
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,260
Mother, let me help you.

930
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:48,220
- Darling!
- She fainted!

931
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,220
- Hurry!
- Is she okay?

932
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,310
- Get her up.
- Mother!

933
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,060
- Mother!
- Get her up!

934
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,820
- Hurry.
- Get up, Mother.

935
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,580
Hurry. Get up.

936
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,660
Come on, Mother.

937
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,820
She's still laughing.

938
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,380
Why did you hit me?

939
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:11,060
Master, you're bad.

940
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,080
How long has it been

941
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,140
since you came to my room?

942
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,100
What are you doing?

943
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,540
- Everyone's here.
- Hurry.

944
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,620
- How improper!
- Get her dressed.

945
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:19,940
Master, don't you just like it
when I hit you?

946
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:23,540
- Mother!
- Master, take your clothes off.

947
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:25,660
Master.

948
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,060
Hurry and stop her!

949
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,340
Master, don't run!

950
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:30,540
Come to my room for fun.

951
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:31,380
We'll have fun.

952
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,380
This...

953
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:33,660
This is insane.

954
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:34,980
How shameless!

955
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,340
How improper!

956
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,860
Anmou, listen.

957
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,260
Without my permission,

958
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,700
don't let her leave here.

959
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:42,860
Yes.

960
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,660
What's going on?

961
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:45,820
Why has she gone mad?

962
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:46,660
Grandmother,

963
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,340
did someone poison her?

964
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,260
Poisoned?

965
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,340
Poisoned...

966
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,740
Didn't your mother

967
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,180
just say it clearly?

968
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:55,460
No one would be poisoned

969
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:58,100
in this household.

970
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:00,340
Right. Aunt Xiao runs a tight ship.

971
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,220
There wouldn't be such a mistake.

972
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:05,660
Looks like Xiao can't manage

973
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:08,060
the household anymore.

974
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:09,740
Everyone,

975
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:12,260
think carefully about who should manage

976
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:15,660
this household.

977
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:19,940
Grandmother,

978
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:21,340
it only makes sense

979
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:23,340
for Qian

980
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,460
to take over.

981
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:30,380
(She's dejected.)

982
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:31,740
(No.)

983
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:33,660
(Her mother is a concubine.)

984
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,020
(No.)

985
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:42,940
Grandmother,

986
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,140
I think Si is the perfect choice.

987
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:52,740
Mother,

988
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:54,780
Si is still young...

989
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:01,980
Then it's settled.

990
