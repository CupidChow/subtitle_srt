11
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,180
(Earl Dongping's Mansion, Jiang)

12
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,080
At this point,

13
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,710
you still refuse to tell the truth?

14
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,070
Hurry and confess honestly.

15
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,920
Do you really want
to face trial in court?

16
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,710
How dare you hit me?

17
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:52,760
So what if I hit you?

18
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,590
If not for you,

19
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:57,920
how could I have made

20
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,000
one mistake after another?

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,230
Did you really poison her?

22
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,840
Ke never offended you.

23
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,040
Why would you harm her like this?

24
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,790
Do you think

25
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,200
I was born ambitious?

26
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,630
Do you think

27
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,920
I was born malicious?

28
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,080
It was all because of you.

29
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,120
It was because of you.

30
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,270
It was because of all of you.

31
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,160
You forced me into this.

32
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,520
You are the true executioners

33
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,710
who killed Su Ke.

34
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,670
That year,

35
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,990
at the spring banquet
in Willow Garden,

36
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,990
you held my hand

37
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,110
and said you liked me

38
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:46,510
and wanted me to marry your son.

39
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,000
And yet you

40
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,830
fell for a merchant's daughter,

41
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,390
insisting on canceling our engagement.

42
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,870
Everyone in my family

43
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,830
laughed at me.

44
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,320
Lady Jiang,

45
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,000
you hypocritically claimed

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,640
to be looking out for me,

47
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,510
telling me to marry your second son.

48
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,160
Fine. I did as you wished.

49
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,160
I married Anmou.

50
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,960
I had planned to live a quiet

51
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,920
and proper life.

52
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,350
But you...

53
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,830
You despised Su Ke's background,

54
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,110
pushing me to compete with her.

55
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,790
When I couldn't win,

56
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,270
you blamed me for being foolish.

57
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,710
Now, Su Ke is dead.

58
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,160
Isn't that exactly what you wanted?

59
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,210
Mother is not like that.

60
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,630
You must not speak of her this way.

61
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,000
Shut up.

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,600
You self-righteous hypocrite.

63
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:51,270
You envied Brother inheriting his title

64
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,920
and resented his family's happiness,

65
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,760
so you took it out on me,

66
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:58,200
forcing me to compete with Su Ke.

67
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,800
But when have you ever

68
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,710
treated me with the respect and care

69
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:04,440
a proper wife deserves
like Brother treated Su Ke?

70
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,190
I bore your children

71
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,550
and managed this household,

72
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:12,640
yet have you ever truly looked at me?

73
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,230
Has anyone in this family

74
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,270
ever truly looked at me?

75
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,560
Who am I?

76
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,510
Do I even have a name?

77
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:25,150
I am merely a pawn in your hands.

78
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,190
I can only fight for myself

79
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,240
and seize what I can

80
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,720
to secure

81
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,080
my place in this household.

82
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,710
And now, how wonderful.

83
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,760
Su Ke is dead.

84
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,710
The First Branch is finished.

85
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,830
I am now the mistress

86
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,390
of this household.

87
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,240
Don't you have to praise me

88
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,880
for being a virtuous wife?

89
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,470
You are still deceiving yourself.

90
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,320
You poisoned my mother.

91
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:13,920
When my mother died,

92
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,320
she was still so young.

93
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,390
You made my father live
in sorrow for half his life.

94
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,530
You left my siblings and me

95
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,830
without a mother since childhood,

96
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,080
suffering endlessly.

97
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,320
You have a child too.

98
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,560
You are a mother as well.

99
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,830
Have you ever felt even a shred of pity?

100
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,640
Give me back my mother's life.

101
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,360
Give me back my mother's life.

102
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,280
Stop.

103
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,830
I may hate you,

104
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:52,560
but I never intended to kill her.

105
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:56,830
I was deceived too.

106
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,760
(When Su Ke was pregnant,)

107
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,550
(I was managing the household
in her place.)

108
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,120
(I only wanted to find a remedy)

109
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,390
(to slow her recovery)

110
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:06,790
(so that)

111
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,560
- (I could continue)
- Miraculous medicine!

112
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,940
- (managing the household.)
- It's from Hua Tuo!

113
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,950
Do you have any medicine

114
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,030
that can slow a woman's recovery

115
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,880
after childbirth?

116
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:18,870
Ma'am,

117
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,560
you've come to the right person.

118
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,510
This kind of unconventional medicine

119
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,720
is not something you'd find

120
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,740
in an ordinary pharmacy,

121
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,390
but I can prepare
a special dose for you.

122
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,000
As for the price...

123
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,200
Money is not an issue.

124
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:34,120
(What are the ingredients?)

125
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,540
(It won't be fatal, will it?)

126
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,120
(This medicine)

127
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,120
(will only weaken her,)

128
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:39,870
(leaving her frail
for three to five years)

129
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:40,950
(before she fully recovers,)

130
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,570
(but her life won't be in danger.)

131
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,950
(Following the physician's advice,)

132
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,680
(I put the medicine)

133
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,800
(into the bathwater
Su Ke used to cleanse herself.)

134
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,710
(But I never expected)

135
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,350
(that after giving birth to Miss Si,)

136
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,390
(Su Ke would fall ill and die.)

137
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,640
(After that,)

138
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,120
(years passed peacefully.)

139
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,160
(I thought it was all over.)

140
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,070
(Unexpectedly,)

141
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,270
(a few days ago...)

142
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,240
Who are you?

143
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:03,950
Why did you bring me here?

144
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,720
We need you

145
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,350
to do one more thing for us.

146
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,680
You said someone deceived you.

147
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,030
Then tell me.

148
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,680
Who ordered you

149
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,950
to kill my mother?

150
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,830
That woman,

151
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,950
though dressed as a merchant's wife,

152
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,240
wore silk from Langzhong

153
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,710
as her inner garment.

154
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,470
That is a material

155
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:51,200
only the imperial family possesses.

156
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,120
Imperial possessions...

157
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,080
Is that person of imperial blood?

158
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,680
What did that person look like?

159
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,360
Who exactly ordered you?

160
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,280
Enough.

161
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,350
What imperial family?

162
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:04,800
The one who killed your mother

163
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,950
was none other than Xiao.

164
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,150
No one ordered her.

165
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,270
This matter ends here.

166
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:12,870
Anmou,

167
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,800
Xiao is your wife.

168
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:17,470
She murdered her sister-in-law
and framed her niece.

169
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,680
You decide

170
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,030
how she should be punished.

171
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,160
A murderer

172
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:24,870
must pay with her life.

173
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,590
She will end her own life

174
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:29,080
to appease my sister-in-law's spirit.

175
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:31,870
Father!

176
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,640
Father!

177
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:35,710
Father!

178
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,680
Look.

179
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,160
Your father

180
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,830
also chooses the easy target.

181
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:59,420
(Cultivate Virtue
and Uphold Righteousness)

182
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,830
With things as they are today,

183
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,710
I have to sacrifice a pawn.

184
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,470
If Xiao does not take her own life,

185
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,600
I will no longer be able to face Mother

186
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,520
and Ancheng.

187
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,680
If she lives,

188
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,040
Capital Security

189
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,870
will continue investigating.

190
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,160
By then,

191
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,680
our entire family

192
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,230
may be dragged down with her.

193
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,160
Shu,

194
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,440
you understand me, don't you?

195
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,750
Master, you're thinking ahead.

196
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,090
It's been hard on you these years.

197
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,520
Once Xiao is gone,

198
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,160
the affairs of this household

199
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,470
will be yours to manage.

200
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,110
Master, as you wish.

201
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,760
Good.

202
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,280
Should I go

203
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:06,920
to Yaxin Chamber

204
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,110
to see her off one last time?

205
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,920
You should.

206
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,040
Mother,

207
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,870
Father let you manage the house.

208
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,720
Why do you

209
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,710
not seem happy?

210
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,240
Ms. Xiao used

211
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,440
to make things hard for us.

212
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,280
Of course, I'm happy to take charge.

213
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,440
But after all these years,

214
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,560
she managed the household,
bore children,

215
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,330
and paved the way for Master.

216
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,160
Yet in the end,

217
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,560
she was forced to take her own life.

218
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,960
If Master could treat

219
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,320
his wife this way,

220
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,680
how would he treat me in the future?

committing an unforgivable crime.

227
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,920
Today, I take my own life to atone.

Ke,

248
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,350
after all these years,

249
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:21,790
I finally know

250
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,280
how you died.

251
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,680
Do not blame me.

252
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,110
I have wronged you.

253
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:46,950
(I knew all along who was behind it,)

254
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:50,400
(but I could not seek justice for you.)

255
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,520
(I was powerless.)

256
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,760
Darling,

257
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:03,950
I've come to see you off.

258
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,320
- Master.
- Master.

259
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,110
Ms. Xiao is gone.

260
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,160
What?

261
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,590
My wife is already gone?

262
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,560
She didn't die. She escaped.

263
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:16,950
Escaped?

264
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:18,790
Ancheng.

265
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,630
Something terrible has happened.

266
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,280
Prince Yan rescued Xiao.

00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,420
(Prince Yan's Mansion)

268
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,440
Your mother and I were once
in perfect harmony.

269
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:33,040
How could I not be heartbroken?

270
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,800
But this is not as simple

271
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,280
(Majesty and Prestige)
as you think.

272
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,550
A murderer must pay with their life.

273
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,300
That principle is
not hard to understand.

274
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,630
I do not wish to pursue
this matter further

275
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:46,230
for the sake of everyone in the family.

276
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,350
I've never asked anything of you before,

277
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,520
but today,

278
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,440
I beg you.

279
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,470
Please, do not act recklessly.

280
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,160
I do not understand your reasoning.

281
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,630
But to me,

282
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,990
Mother's life comes first.

283
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,320
And I believe

284
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,350
justice exists in this world.

285
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,000
Even the imperial family

286
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,200
should not be an exception.

287
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,880
Si...

288
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,400
- Uncle.
- Your Highness.

289
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,990
Your Highness,
please help me persuade Si.

290
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:24,320
I understand you want
to protect your family.

291
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,870
But whatever she decides,

292
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,470
I will stand by her.

293
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,040
Very well.

294
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:37,320
Your Highness, please protect Si

295
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,350
and do not let her get hurt.

296
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,550
Rest assured.

297
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,080
I will do everything in my power.

298
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,320
Come and chase me.

299
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,280
Over here.

300
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:50,540
You can't catch me, can you?

301
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,070
Hurry.

302
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,710
Come on.

303
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,640
Run.

304
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,320
Mother, why are you crying?

305
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,760
It's nothing.

306
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:11,680
I just...

307
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,630
I miss my mother a little.

308
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,430
Father.

309
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:59,190
Father.

310
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,830
You're drunk again.

311
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,160
Zhan,

312
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:13,560
am I a coward?

313
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,950
You had a dream?

314
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,190
I dreamed of Mother blaming us

315
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,960
for not seeking justice

316
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,430
for her sooner.

317
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,670
Dreams aren't real.

318
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,530
You can't take them seriously.

319
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,630
But I just don't understand.

320
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,000
Why is Father acting like this?

321
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,960
Does he not truly love

322
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,960
my mother?

323
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,350
We already know

324
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,870
who the murderer is.

325
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,110
Then why does Father

326
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,480
want to keep the peace?

327
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,720
He's not weak.

328
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,350
He has a weakness.

329
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,150
You and your siblings

330
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,830
are his weakness.

331
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,720
Are you also trying to convince me

332
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,040
to let this go?

333
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:32,510
No.

334
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,720
I just want to tell you

335
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,970
that however dangerous
the path ahead is,

336
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,630
if you want to take it,

337
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,110
I will go with you.

338
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,640
Thank you.

339
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:53,740
(Haitang Chamber)

340
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,500
(Grand Princess's Mansion)

341
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,430
Mother,

342
00:18:58,690 --> 00:18:59,550
if Jiang Si is dead,

343
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,000
my marriage will be granted, right?

344
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,070
No wonder you were willing

345
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,910
to wake up early and walk with me today.

346
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,350
So, it was all for your marriage.

347
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,590
I don't want anything else.

348
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,190
I just want to take a walk with you.

349
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:13,030
Your little schemes

350
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,390
are written all over your face.

351
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,960
Asking directly is always

352
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,350
the worst plan.

353
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,280
If we can get His Majesty
to suggest it himself,

354
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:24,960
that'd be the best plan.

355
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,400
Mother, you are wise.

356
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,360
As long as the marriage is granted,

357
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,390
it's a win for me.

358
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,590
Ms. Xu, is that your nephew?

359
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,590
Your Highness, please forgive me.

360
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,630
I have warned him many times

361
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,320
not to come here without reason.

362
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,030
I assume his wife

363
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,110
is about to give birth...

364
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,720
- So...
- Say no more.

365
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,480
He is your only family.

366
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,480
It is only right
that you look after him. Go.

367
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,040
Thank you, Your Highness.

368
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,880
Let's go.

369
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,030
Why are you here?

370
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,390
Aunt, something has happened.

371
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,400
Is this true?

372
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,320
Absolutely.

373
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,350
Should we inform Her Highness first?

374
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:22,750
That'd be unwise.

375
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,070
Her Highness only cares

376
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,800
about results, not the process.

377
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,200
Over the years,

378
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,140
so many people have fought
to get close to her.

379
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:34,160
Her trust in me

380
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,520
is not what it once was.

381
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,000
This task

382
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,760
must be executed flawlessly.

383
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:40,990
Yes.

384
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:43,350
Why are we taking this path?

385
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,240
Why leave through the back gate?

386
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,560
Aunt, this is the place.

387
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:49,320
What is this place?

388
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,880
This...

389
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,960
You...

390
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,150
You're finally here.

391
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,240
What happened?

392
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,200
This poison could easily

393
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,870
kill Su.

394
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:06,720
Why did it go wrong

395
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,280
when it came to her daughter?

396
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:09,830
Who would've thought

397
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,800
Prince Yan had encountered
this poison before

398
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,240
in Nanwu?

399
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:15,750
He gave Jiang Si

400
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,430
a detoxification formula.

401
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,560
Jiang Si will wake up very soon.

402
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,800
The poison can be cured?

403
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,920
What did you say?

404
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,920
Nothing.

405
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,110
Prince Yan also said

406
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,320
Jiang Si

407
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,760
was so lucky.

408
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,150
If this poison had gone

409
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,760
just a bit deeper,

410
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,280
she would've been dead by now.

411
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,480
That's why

412
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,760
I called you here.

413
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,720
You must think of a solution for me.

414
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,320
If this gets exposed,

415
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,590
I'll be finished.

416
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:43,560
Why panic?

417
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,110
Let her

418
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:49,590
get poisoned even deeper.

419
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,870
Ms. Xu, we meet again.

420
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,320
Your Highness.

421
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,480
You're not dead?

422
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:04,950
Ms. Xu,

423
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,830
I'm afraid it won't go as you wish.

424
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,640
You...

425
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,200
You...

426
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,760
How dare you betray me?

427
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,960
This is the Slumber Flower

428
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,390
unique to Nanwu.

429
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:20,100
It becomes toxic when it touches water.

430
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,520
It causes vomiting blood, a deep sleep,

431
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,670
and ultimately, death.

432
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,190
This is the Slumber Flower

433
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,430
unique to Nanwu.

434
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,750
Looks like the Grand Princess

435
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,280
has long been colluding with Nanwu.

436
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,480
But Ms. Xu

437
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,910
has served her for years.

438
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,590
She has seen and heard too much.

439
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,150
It won't be easy

440
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,760
to make her talk.

441
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,320
Don't worry. I have a way.

442
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:47,990
Long Dan.

443
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,110
That's too cruel.

444
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,080
Good for you.

445
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,800
What?

446
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,960
I said good for you.

447
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,150
What? I can't hear it.

448
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,110
I said good for you.

449
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,160
Useless thing.

450
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,080
Forgive me, Your Grace.

451
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,460
Are you all right, Mother?

452
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,430
I'm fine.

453
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,590
What's wrong with Ms. Xu?

454
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:37,750
She likes to sleep,

455
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,190
and you let her go. That's fine.

456
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,590
Yet she forgot

457
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,960
that your arm injury flares up

458
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,310
in rainy weather,

459
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,240
and only her massage

460
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,560
can relieve the pain.

461
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,080
She's just grown too arrogant.

462
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,760
Enough, enough.

463
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,800
You're giving me a headache.

464
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,830
Her nephew's wife is in labor.

465
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,240
What's she doing over there?

466
00:23:59,030 --> 00:23:59,950
Shijiu.

467
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:03,110
- Yes?
- Go bring Ms. Xu back.

468
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,770
Why are you standing there?

469
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,120
Go.

470
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,120
Yes.

471
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:21,710
Well?

472
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,120
Can you talk now?

473
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,860
I've been wanting to talk,

474
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:30,830
but you stuffed my mouth.

475
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,430
How could I talk then?

476
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:34,310
The Grand Princess used Nanwu's flower

477
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,630
to kill my mother first,

478
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,590
and now she wants my life too.

479
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,190
Tell me.

480
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,960
What grudge does our family

481
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,150
have against her?

482
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:46,080
The one who offended the Grand Princess

483
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:48,720
was your mother, Su Ke.

484
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:57,350
Your Highness, Ms. Xu is in trouble.

485
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,200
What?

486
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,190
It's all because she had the face

487
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,240
to attract men.

488
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,240
Not only did your father
cancel his engagement,

489
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,590
but even General Cui

490
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:13,440
defied an imperial marriage decree

491
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,190
for her.

492
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,480
To the Grand Princess,

493
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,240
this was the ultimate disgrace.

494
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,960
My mother and General Cui...?

495
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,000
I always thought you and your sister

496
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,590
were the children of Su

497
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,870
and General Cui.

498
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:32,520
Ms. Fei, are you referring

499
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:35,830
to General Cui, Cui Mingyue's father?

500
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,480
My parents were deeply in love.

501
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,780
They were devoted to each other.

502
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,270
Since Mother chose

503
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,190
to marry Father,

504
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,050
how could she possibly
have been entangled

505
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:44,770
with General Cui?

506
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,720
Your father was devoted to her,

507
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:52,430
and his career was ruined
because of her.

508
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,110
General Cui, grew estranged

509
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:58,590
from the Grand Princess for her,

510
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,280
causing them to be a bitter couple.

511
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,040
But your mother, Su Ke,

512
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,280
stole love from others

513
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,440
and was fickle and shameless.

514
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,400
Shut up.

515
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,720
You can't insult my mother.

516
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:13,510
Ms. Xu,

517
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,490
tell us.

518
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:15,610
Why does the Grand Princess

519
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,320
have the flower?

520
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,180
Let her feel more comfortable.

521
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:21,720
Is it itchy?

522
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,400
I'll talk. I'll talk.

523
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,870
That Nanwu woman

524
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:28,080
seduced the Grand Princess.

525
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,760
Your Highness, this can help you

526
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,240
relieve your troubles.

527
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:37,280
I heard that Nanwu excels in sorcery.

528
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,080
I once read in a book

529
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,590
about a Nanwu woman

530
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,830
who placed a love curse on her husband,

531
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:46,520
making him love only her forever.

532
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:49,110
Could this be the same thing?

533
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,670
That's just a rumor.

534
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,160
If Nanwu

535
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,480
could control people's hearts,

536
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,110
Nanwu's status would've been
very different by now.

537
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,430
Then what exactly is this?

538
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:02,720
A thing that can make

539
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,560
your enemy disappear.

540
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,560
Ridiculous.

541
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:12,240
I am the Grand Princess of Dazhou.

542
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,480
It's easy for me to have someone die.

543
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:16,670
Of course.

544
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,240
You hold great power.

545
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,040
You don't need

546
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:23,040
to dirty your own hands to kill someone.

547
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,430
I am willing to be your blade.

548
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,670
Just like this thing.

549
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:31,040
It takes lives silently.

550
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,560
No one

551
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,080
can find out about it.

552
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:39,760
(Xiao and Su Ke
have never gotten along.)

553
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,560
(Healing Hands)
(We discovered that Xiao)

554
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,560
(was planning to poison Su Ke.)

555
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,730
(Kind, Jishi Clinic)
(So, we bribed the physician)

556
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:49,560
(to swap the poison for Slumber Flower.)

557
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,320
(We used Xiao to kill Su Ke.)

558
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,480
(Su Ke died,)

559
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,070
(but the Grand Princess's wish)

560
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,830
(was not fulfilled.)

561
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:03,040
(General Cui became even colder
toward her.)

562
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:05,080
(Yet that Nanwu woman)

563
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,510
(only gained more)

564
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:08,390
(of the Grand Princess's trust.)

565
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:11,280
Where is this Nanwu woman now?

566
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,240
She is a mystery.

567
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,200
Every time she came, she wore a veil.

568
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:18,630
How would I know where she is?

569
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:20,990
Ms. Xu,

570
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,430
you knew this flower could be evidence.

571
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,480
If an investigation starts,

572
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,640
the Grand Princess

573
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,240
may be able to shift the blame.

574
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,240
But you cannot.

575
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,350
You don't want to betray your master,

576
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:32,880
so you made up some story

577
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,240
about a Nanwu woman

578
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,960
to lead us nowhere.

579
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:37,430
Long Dan, continue.

580
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,590
No, no, no.

581
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:40,790
Don't, don't.

582
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,310
Let me think.

583
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,630
Go ahead. Take your time.

584
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,160
I remember now.

585
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,720
That Nanwu woman

586
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,870
asked the Grand Princess
to help her enter the Palace.

587
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:54,350
She is now in Changning Palace.

588
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:55,470
Changning Palace?

589
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,520
That's the Empress's Palace.

590
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,110
If the Grand Princess

591
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,790
finds out

592
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:03,630
I told you all this,

593
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,480
then

594
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,960
the three of us

595
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:09,830
are as good as dead.

596
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,280
I have a plan.

597
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:13,480
Just pretend you never saw me

598
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,480
and I was never here.

599
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,070
Let's pretend nothing happened, right?

600
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,000
Yes, yes.

601
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,040
What a joke.

602
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,270
Do you think my mother's death

603
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,110
was for nothing?

604
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,830
Are you planning

605
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,790
to go against the Grand Princess?

606
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,590
Even a Prince is bound by the law.

607
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:30,280
How naive.

608
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,000
The Grand Princess is

609
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,910
His Majesty's dearest sister,

610
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:37,350
second only to the Emperor himself.

611
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,520
Forget your mother.

612
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,960
Even when nobles died

613
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:45,350
in the Jinshui River fire,

614
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:48,320
Princess Mingyue only lost her title.

615
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,830
Do you really think

616
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:52,440
His Majesty would punish his sister

617
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,070
over a mere merchant's daughter?

618
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,720
Colluding with Nanwu is treason.

619
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,770
His dearest sister?

620
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:58,720
Do you think His Majesty
will turn a blind eye?

621
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,110
The Grand Princess is...

622
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,350
Your Highness, Miss,

623
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:02,920
there's suddenly a large group outside.

624
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,160
Your Highness, why did you

625
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,150
barge into my mansion?

626
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,630
How can you accuse me first?

627
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,080
You kidnapped Ms. Xu from my mansion,

628
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,760
yet now you're asking me why I'm here?

629
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,800
Shijiu, what are you waiting for?

630
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:24,990
Search.

631
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,400
Your Highness.

632
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,870
Your Highness, save me.

633
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,040
They tricked me into coming here.

634
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:41,440
I didn't say anything.

635
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,560
I know nothing.

636
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,900
- Shut up.
- I know nothing.

637
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,230
Let's go.

638
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,870
Don't harm Her Highness.

639
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:52,390
Jiang Si, what are you trying to do?

640
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,280
Are you going to kill me?

641
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,240
Come on, kill me.

642
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,560
Come on, kill me then.

643
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,680
Jiang Si from Earl Dongping's family

644
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,550
attempted to murder a Princess.

645
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:06,470
Seize her.

646
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,190
Yu Jin, you arranged this.

647
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:13,270
You planned everything.

648
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,350
Are you trying to rebel?

649
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,910
Do you think

650
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,590
I won't have you all killed?

651
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:21,960
An imperial decree has arrived.

652
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,360
Rongyang,

653
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,720
what are you doing here?

654
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,870
You certainly got the news fast,

655
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,040
rushing here to save

656
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,870
her daughter.

657
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,490
Prince Yan, receive the decree.

658
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,150
By His Majesty's command,

659
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:49,480
Prince Yan, Yu Jin,

660
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:51,240
shall enter the Palace at once.

661
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,430
I accept the decree.

662
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:00,110
But I must trouble General Cui

663
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:01,370
to report to His Majesty

664
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:04,240
that it seems Her Highness
wishes to stop me

665
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,390
from meeting him.

666
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:06,710
How could Her Highness

667
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,800
trouble her own nephew?

668
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:11,510
Let's go.

669
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:12,910
Ms. Xu stays.

670
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,150
I've already let it go,

671
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,240
but you keep pushing your luck.

672
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,830
Ms. Xu just admitted

673
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,150
she poisoned my mother to death.

674
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,040
If you leave
with the Grand Princess now,

675
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,720
she will kill you to silence you.

676
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,840
Wait.

677
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,360
Poison?

678
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,150
Who killed your mother?

679
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,390
Didn't Su Ke die of illness?

680
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:34,390
The Grand Princess, out of jealousy,

681
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,510
ordered Ms. Xu to use

682
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:37,830
a deadly poison to kill her.

683
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,190
Is this true?

684
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,390
Is it?

685
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,440
Tell me.

686
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,960
Ms. Xu, tell the truth.

687
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,750
Prince Yan and General Cui
are both here.

688
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:52,030
The Grand Princess doesn't rule Dazhou.

689
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:55,390
I deserve death, Your Highness.

690
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,880
I don't know what drug

691
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,160
they fed me,

692
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,150
but I lost my senses for a moment.

693
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,870
General Cui, you must not believe them.

694
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:05,400
It will only cause a rift between you

695
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,750
and the Grand Princess.

696
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,430
How cunning.

697
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
You heard Ms. Xu.

698
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,320
Do you believe my servant

699
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,430
or her daughter?

700
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:23,750
Let's go.

701
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:33,950
Miss Jiang,

702
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,080
what is the truth

703
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:37,520
about your mother's death?

704
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,570
General Cui.

705
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,480
General Cui, don't.

706
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,800
Stop.

707
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:28,190
How long has it been

708
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:32,080
since we sat down for a meal together?

709
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,670
General Cui is always occupied,

710
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,630
rushing from one military camp
to another.

711
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,880
How would you have time

712
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,080
to dine with me?

713
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,280
Rongyang,

714
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:51,040
why do you always speak

715
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:54,310
with thorns in your words?

716
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,190
I am the Grand Princess of Dazhou.

717
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,080
Apart from my brother,

718
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,190
every man in this world

719
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,630
must kneel to speak to me.

720
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:04,430
Remember that.

721
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,880
I will never lower myself

722
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,880
like that lowly merchant's daughter

723
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,360
to please you

724
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,230
with sweet words.

725
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,360
Su Ke has been dead

726
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,000
for so many years,

727
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:25,760
yet you still

728
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,680
call her lowly?

729
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:28,630
Let me tell you.

730
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,750
To me,

731
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,560
she was the best,

732
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,920
the noblest woman

733
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,790
in the world.

734
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,360
So, I killed her.

735
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:47,920
So, she'll never grow old,

736
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:49,110
never change,

737
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:52,150
and forever remain beautiful

738
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,520
and noble in your heart.

739
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,960
You loved Su Ke,

740
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,710
but she died because of you.

741
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,190
If you want to revenge,

742
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:06,400
you shouldn't just blame me.

743
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:07,630
In the end,

744
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,230
you should blame yourself.

745
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:12,630
Enough.

746
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:15,190
We are already married.

747
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:16,760
Why couldn't you let her go?

748
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,710
Why?

749
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,080
She wouldn't let you go.

750
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,440
She was already married,

751
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,360
so why did she still meet you

752
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,710
in secret at Qingyin Temple?

753
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,920
Your Highness,

754
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:29,710
General Cui rode out of the city
early this morning,

755
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,790
heading toward Qingyin Temple.

756
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,000
He doesn't believe in gods.

757
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,230
Why would he go there?

758
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,960
The people watching
Earl Dongping's Mansion

759
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,920
just reported

760
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:40,630
that Su Ke also took a carriage

761
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,000
to Qingyin Temple.

762
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,280
What?

763
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,920
Your Highness,

764
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,480
do we need to go in to check?

765
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:01,560
Let's go back.

766
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:05,150
How many times must I tell you?

767
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,360
That day, I went

768
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,960
to Qingyin Temple alone.

769
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,590
Su Ke and I were innocent.

770
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,560
After we married, we never met again.

771
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:16,710
I don't believe you.

772
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:19,270
She lingered around you.

773
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,670
You both deserved to die.

774
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:22,590
Rongyang,

775
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,040
you never believed me.

776
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:29,270
Never.

777
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:59,230
(That day, I went
to Qingyin Temple alone)

778
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,960
(to put the past behind me.)

779
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:32,150
Do you really think...

780
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,630
Do you really think that Su Ke

781
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,040
was the only reason
we ended up like this?

782
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:46,670
Wasn't she?

783
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,710
Wasn't she?

784
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:59,920
Forget it.

785
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,510
Forget it.

786
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:07,150
Come on.

787
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:09,520
Sit. Drink this wine.

788
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,280
Sit down.

789
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:30,880
Drink this wine.

790
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,590
Let the past

791
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,960
be forgotten.

792
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,480
You want to divorce me?

793
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,630
At our age,

794
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,590
what use is a mere piece

795
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:02,590
of divorce paper?

796
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:06,310
Drink this wine,

797
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:11,310
and consider our marriage over.

798
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:16,310
From now on, we part ways.

799
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,360
Rongyang.

800
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:21,040
Stop tormenting me,

801
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:27,520
and stop tormenting yourself.

802
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:52,190
I told you before

803
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,750
that I'm not a woman

804
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:58,310
who begs and pleads

805
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,670
before men.

806
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:04,360
All these years,

807
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,960
you came and went as you pleased.

808
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,840
Have I ever stopped you?

809
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:13,630
In that case,

810
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,840
after this wine,

811
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:22,590
let us sever all ties.

812
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:23,880
Don't drink it.

813
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,270
Father. Mother.

814
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,790
You want to kill me?

815
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:49,790
You want to kill me?

816
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,400
You want to kill yourself too?

817
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,760
Are you going to take both our lives

818
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,920
to atone for that wretched woman?

819
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,310
Mingyue.

820
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:05,440
From today on,

821
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,590
you no longer have a father.

822
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,110
Mother, Father just...

823
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:12,030
Shut up.

824
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,040
If you still acknowledge him,

825
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,630
then do not call me Mother again.

826
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,720
Mother...

827
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:27,470
Father...

828
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,360
Guards.

829
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,760
Your Highness.

830
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,480
From today on,

831
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:35,840
Cui Xu

832
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:38,480
shall not set foot in my mansion again.

833
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:40,840
General, please leave.

834
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:03,220
