11
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,340
(Zhou)

12
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,230
By the decree of His Majesty,

13
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:50,120
Yu Qi and Zhen Heng of Capital Security

14
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:51,840
captured the killer.

15
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,390
Yu Qi is thus granted the title

16
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,670
of Guardian Contributor.

17
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:01,480
Zhen Heng is thus granted the title

18
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,400
of Righteous Contributor.

19
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,240
The decree

20
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,840
becomes effective upon arrival.

21
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:06,950
Thank His Majesty.

22
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,600
Your Majesty, it's likely connected to

23
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,640
or orchestrated by the Nightingale.

24
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,670
Nanwu has infiltrated Dazhou for years,

25
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,040
and we've never been able
to root them out.

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,990
Now, they've become even more brazen.

27
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,540
Get to the bottom of it.

28
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:42,550
Yes.

29
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,870
Mr. Zhen.

30
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,550
Mr. Zhen!

31
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,760
Analyze this for me.

32
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,200
With my performance today,

33
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,320
how many ranks will I be promoted?

34
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,160
In my opinion,

35
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,200
the greatest merit today

36
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,200
belongs to Commandant Yu.

37
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,120
True.

38
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,910
He's holding onto it
even while sleeping.

39
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:14,440
Looks like a sachet.

40
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,880
Could it be

41
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,640
a keepsake from the girl he loves?

42
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:29,870
Why...?

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,880
What's wrong, Jiang?

44
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,990
It looks a bit like the one

45
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,710
my sister gave me.

46
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:37,830
Your sister?

47
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:40,470
Let me see.

48
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:43,750
Is it the same?

49
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:47,790
This sachet was made by the same person.

50
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,440
Commandant Yu

51
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,270
deserves it.

52
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,270
Made by the same person?

53
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,880
My sister made it for me...

54
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,320
Yu Qi.

55
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,590
Yu Qi!

56
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,080
- That's my sister!
- Jiang!

57
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,430
- Jiang!
- Yu Qi!

58
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,440
He's still injured.

59
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,740
(Border of Ling'an)

60
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,740
(Grand Princess's Mansion)

61
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,630
When solar eclipse happened,

62
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,760
an Imperial Insignia Guard
tried to kill His Majesty.

63
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,200
How is His Majesty?

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,940
His Majesty is unharmed.

65
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,160
Yu Qi of Capital Security

66
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,200
got stabbed for him.

67
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,520
Did he die?

68
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,960
No.

69
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,010
The imperial physician
treated him at once.

70
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,620
Later, His Majesty
even summoned him privately to his tent.

71
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,640
He protected the Emperor.

72
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,320
What reward did he receive?

73
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,240
He and Zhen Heng were granted

74
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,320
an honorary title.

75
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,010
There will be further rewards later.

76
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,680
This isn't growing well.

77
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,320
Your Majesty.

78
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,560
Cui Xu is here.

79
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,910
I wonder how his injuries are.

80
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,110
Your Majesty,

81
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,470
are you referring to the 7th Prince?

82
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:41,240
I wonder if he still resents me.

83
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,880
He won't.

84
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,880
Summon him in.

85
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,590
Greetings, Your Majesty.

86
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:02,000
I've checked
every Imperial Insignia Guard

87
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,390
to ensure they have a clean background

88
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,590
with verifiable origins.

89
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,880
All those who were present,

90
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,910
including myself,

91
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,200
have been recorded

92
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,450
and shall be punished
based on responsibilities.

93
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,710
Please review it, Your Majesty.

94
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,030
What about Yu Qi?

95
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,110
Yu Qi?

96
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:20,790
Your Majesty,

97
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,600
Yu Qi entered Capital Security

98
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,830
through the Tournament

99
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,080
not long ago.

100
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,120
Even Zhen Heng, the pickiest one,

101
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,560
has been working well with him.

102
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,130
He's never impeached him.

103
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,000
It seems Jin is doing well

104
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,950
as the Right Commandant.

105
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,200
Jin?

106
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,190
Commandant Yu who protected

107
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,240
His Majesty at the hunting grounds

108
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,950
is the 7th Prince, Yu Jin.

109
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:46,510
After all these years,

110
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:48,000
only you were sent to see him,

111
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,350
yet you didn't recognize him?

112
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,440
Your Majesty.

113
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:53,790
Here's the thing.

114
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,360
The 7th Prince was far away

115
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,390
in Yangui.

116
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,030
Though you sent me to visit him,

117
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,120
he always

118
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,760
avoided meeting me.

119
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:03,880
He'd only send messages

120
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,950
from the military camp from afar.

121
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,080
Forget it.

122
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,760
For now, keep Jin's identity a secret.

123
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,190
Since he is doing well

124
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,150
in Capital Security,

125
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:16,470
let him remain as the Right Commander

126
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,150
to avoid controversy in court

127
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,830
because of his return.

128
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,320
Yes, Your Majesty.

129
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,830
Come and take a look!

130
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,040
The best in Ling'an!

131
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,470
(Pastry)
Delicious Milk Cakes!

132
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,980
His Majesty was nearly killed
at the hunting grounds.

133
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:36,980
It seems

134
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,570
it was Capital Security that saved him.

135
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,150
Anyone bold enough to kill His Majesty

136
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,650
must not have been easy to deal with.

137
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,320
I heard that someone
from Capital Security

138
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,280
was gravely wounded.

139
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,070
Sir, this is yours.

140
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,910
- Thank you.
- Sure.

141
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,320
- Enjoy. Come again.
- Sure.

142
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,590
- What would you like, Miss?
- He might not survive.

143
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,590
Indeed.

144
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,670
Manager,

145
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,120
did a young lady come by earlier

146
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,510
to reserve a box of Milk Cakes?

147
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,000
This is yours.

148
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,020
She said she was going

149
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,160
to buy something else nearby

150
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,540
and asked you to wait for her here.

151
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:02,790
Thank you.

152
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,080
Alright.

153
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:09,790
Report!

154
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,070
Mr. Zhen, Mr. Yu!

155
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:12,910
It's bad!

156
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:15,230
Sang Qi from the Nightingale
was poisoned in prison.

157
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,150
He's about to die!

158
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,520
What?

159
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,470
How is he?

160
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,400
My Lord.

161
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,390
The poison has spread
throughout his body.

162
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,010
His life is hanging by a thread.

163
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,560
The antidote must be specific.

164
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,280
I need to find out

165
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,780
what poison he's been afflicted with.

166
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,350
It should be his black scorpion.

167
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,600
It was originally kept here,

168
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,750
but when I found this,

169
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,040
the scorpion was already gone.

170
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,160
Physician, can you cure
this scorpion poison?

171
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,420
There are many species of scorpions,

172
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,420
with different poisons.

173
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,990
I can't guarantee success,

174
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,280
but I'll do my best

175
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:48,750
to cure him.

176
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,920
He's a major criminal.

177
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,560
Please try your best.

178
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,840
If you need anything,

179
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,520
Capital Security
will offer full support.

180
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,110
Miss,

181
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,600
you've already added

182
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,990
oriental sweetgum.

183
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,990
Miss, should I fetch
some ink and brushes?

184
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,040
You can paint.

185
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,320
I can also accompany you for a walk.

186
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,440
No need. It's fine.

187
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,710
Are you worried about Commandant Yu?

188
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:37,960
How about...

189
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,110
Let's go to Zaoshu Lane

190
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,350
and check on Er'niu.

191
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,110
Let's see if its owner

192
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,280

Since returning from Lingshui,

255
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,440
you've been making a scene

256
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,690
by beating the servants
and smashing cups

257

00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,680
stripped away.

262
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:07,080

to your return.

00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,200

It's my fault for bad parenting.

278
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,800

279

00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,750
Your Highness,
the County Princess is still young

282
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,590

283
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,990
Don't be too hasty.

284
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,830
It's time to find her a husband.

285
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:32,710
Once she's married,

286
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,830
maybe she'll become more sensible.

287
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,990
Married?

288
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,280

00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,800

300
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:14,040

303
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,680
Come on.

304
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,680
I just finished a dangerous mission,

305
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,560
and you didn't care about me at all.

306
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,750
All you want to do is spar.

307
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,600
His Majesty being assassinated

308
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,920

310
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:36,800

311
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,150

312
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,140

315
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,680
I understand now.

316
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,350
You're worried about me.

317
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,230

318
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,800

This old trick again.

322
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,490
I'm getting tired of it if you are not.

323
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,760
Jiang Zhan, get up.

324
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,390
Jiang Zhan, I'm telling you to get up.

325
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,280
Jiang Zhan?

326
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:30,190

329
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,760
What's wrong with you?

330
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,190
Jiang Zhan!

331
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:42,390

Jiang Zhan, wake up!

334

336
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:49,800
Jiang Zhan!

337
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:54,000
You're so worried about me.

338
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,520
Are you crazy?

339
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,790
You really hit

340
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,080
my fatal spot.

341
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,280
How can you hit me so hard?

342
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:09,950
Are you angry?

343
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:21,040
I was just playing with you.

344
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:31,550

345

Please forgive me.

349
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,320
This poison is too tricky.

350
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,800
I couldn't save him.

351
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:04,630
The trail is lost again.

352
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,760
It's fine.

353
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,670
Nothing can be done

354

without a trace.

355
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,520
We can find more clues.

356
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,430
This scorpion poison
might be contagious.

357
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,200
The body shouldn't stay out
for too long.

358
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,110
Let's bury it first.

359
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,110
Let's go raid their stronghold

360
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,560
(Tianxiang House)
for any clues.

361
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,030
What's going on here?

362
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:36,870

363
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,840
This...

364
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,480
My Lord, I...

365
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,240
My Lord.

366
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,680
This is just a tavern.

367
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,040
Is there a misunderstanding?

368
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,440
I'm innocent, My Lord.

369
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,790
Chief, Liu Yan'er ran away

370
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:00,630
and only left this.

371

373
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,440
and the killer's handkerchief

374
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,080
were made by the same person.

375
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,910
How dare you harbor a fugitive?

376
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:16,000
Tell me. Where is Liu Yan'er?

377
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,320
My Lord,

378
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,150
it has nothing to do with me.

379
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,720
Liu Yan'er's long stopped
receiving guests.

380
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,240
I don't know where she went.

381
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,680
I really don't know

382
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,000
her background.

383
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,240
She works here.

384
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:28,720
You'd better come clean.

385
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,640
It was she

386
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,430
who came here.

387
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:34,310
She was pretty,

388
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,590
could make fragrances,

389
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,040
and had a tragic past,

390
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,960
so I took her in.

391
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,630
If I had known

392
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,560
she'd commit such a huge crime,

393
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,070
I wouldn't have dared to take her in

394
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,520
even if I was much bolder.

395
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,150
Good for her.

396
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,080
She left so soon

397
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,520
without any clues left.

398
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:53,470
Tell everyone to hunt for Liu Yan'er
and Du'er. Let's leave.

399
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,430
Yes. Leave!

400
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,350
When you wake up,

401
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,100
go to the temple outside the West Gate.

402
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,480
Right now, Tianxiang House

403
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:46,000
is guarded by Capital Security.

404
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,630
I'm afraid we can't go back there.

405
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,010
We should find another place to stay.

406
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,080
It's cold at night.

407
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,440
I'm worried about your health.

408
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:53,670
I'm fine.

409
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,650
Let's wait a little longer.

410
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,390
I wonder if Jiang Si

411
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,720
can save Junior Sang.

412
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,680
Remember to wait
for Sang Qi at the temple

413
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,620
outside the West Gate.

414
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:12,950
I think

415
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:14,720
Jiang Si can't be trusted.

416
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,200
She pretended to be one of us

417
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,190
to trick us,

418
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,430
and now she's trying

419
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:20,910
to help us rescue Junior Sang.

420
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,720
It's hard to tell
whether she's a friend or foe.

421
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,280
But when she urged me to escape,

422
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,190
she looked flustered,

423
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,290
and it didn't seem fake.

424
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,560
So, if we don't do what she wants,

425
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,960
or give up the plan,
would she still help us?

426
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,210
- Junior Sang.
- Junior Sang.

427
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,280
- Hurry.
- Senior Liu.

428
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,800
Senior Du.

429
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,040
Senior...

430
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,660
- Who are you?
- Slowly.

431
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:49,630
- Sit down.
- You...

432
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:51,630
She...

433
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,870
She asked me to come here.

434
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,760
I didn't expect

435
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,480
you two to really be here.

436
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,830
Jiang Si saved you?

437
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,150
Who?

438
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:05,950
Jiang Si?

439
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,760
Who's Jiang Si?

440
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,430
Are you talking

441
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,870
about that pretty girl?

442
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,830
Yes, that's her.

443
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,830
Is she really one of us?

444
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,040
We sent several teams

445
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,590
but couldn't rescue you.

446
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,040
She's just a girl

447
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,440
who can't even kill a chicken.

448
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:33,040
How did she break you out?

449
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,520
Break me out?

450
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,240
She didn't break me out.

451
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,040
The prison guard

452
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,800
just brought her in,

453
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:42,910
and she...

454
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,480
She...

455
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,910
She pretended to talk

456
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,190
and saved

457
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,800
my scorpion.

458
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,960
What does she want to do?

459
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,110
Senior Du.

460
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:58,720
I remember now.

461
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,760
I remember it.

462
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,720
After I woke up,

463
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,000
I found this beside me.

464
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,240
Look.

465
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,060
The Grand Elder's bamboo leaf letter.

466
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,720
What do you think, Senior Du?

467
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,520
The Grand Elder wants us back to Nanwu.

468
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,040
What?

469
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,870
Did the Grand Elder

470
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,320
really send Jiang Si here?

471
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,070
The Nightingale is exposed.

472
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,430
I'm afraid

473
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,560
we're hunted in Ling'an now.

474
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:32,730
It's better to go back.

475
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,040
We'll know the truth

476
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:35,560
of this mystery

477
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,130
once we see the Grand Elder.

478
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,860
(Capital Security)

479
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:45,430
What happened?

480
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:46,960
I don't know.

481
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,800
Let's go check.

482
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:53,220
(Hunting Order)

483
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,110
A Hunting Order.

484
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:05,660
(Hunting Order)

485
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,000
Long Dan.

486
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,390
- Long Dan.
- Yes?

487
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,760
Chief.

488
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,150
Go to the same

489
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,430
Milk Cake Shop.

490
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,430
Don't slack off this time.

491
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,480
Wait a little longer. I want fresh ones.

492
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,190
It's for Miss Jiang.

493
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:28,950
I understand.

494
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:30,670
Let's go.

495
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,480
Commandant Yu.

496
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,910
Don't you think Sang Qi's death

497
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,630
is a little suspicious?

498
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,040
Is there a lead?

499
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:43,870
I remember this scorpion box

500
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,280
was pressed under stone bricks.

501
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,100
How could it have been

502
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,430
so easy to escape from?

503
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,040
Right.

504
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:55,760
Also, I heard

505
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,280
Miss Jiang Si

506
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,110
recently went to the prison.

507
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,070
She went to the prison?

508
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:00,910
Yes,

509
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,550
and she used your badge.

510
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:05,080
That's impossible. My badge is...

511
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,880
Do you think it's her?

512
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,720
No.

513
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,390
That's not what I meant.

514
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,630
I know

515
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,830
it was after Miss Jiang left

516
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,760
that Sang Qi died.

517
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,240
But your badge...

518
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,080
Don't worry.

519
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,790
There will never be a next time.

520
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,190
Alright.

521
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,760
I believe you.

522
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,350
(Peace)
Commandant Yu,

523
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,550
our lady really isn't here.

524
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,720
You really can't go in.

525
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,150
I saw it. She's really not here.

526
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:16,110
This poison is too tricky.

527
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,590
I couldn't save him.

528
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,040
Why did you come suddenly?

529
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:23,110
I thought

530
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,150
you'd want this.

531
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,720
Why is the physician here?

532
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,660
Are you feeling unwell?

533
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:29,800
Did you come all this way

534
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,180
just to deliver the Milk Cakes?

535
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,240
I'm happy.

536
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:36,240
Since I got back from the hunt...

537
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,240
Let's go.

538
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,960
I've been especially happy.

539
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,350
Why are you in such a good mood?

540
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,380
Have you heard of someone
who trains hawks

541
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,110
and has the hawk peck out their eyes?

542
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:46,800
What do you mean?

543
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:49,390
I just learned about someone

544
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,440
who was poisoned to death

545
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,280
by his scorpion.

546
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,480
The scorpion must know

547
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,000
the laws of Dazhou,

548
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,040
so it would know where to strike.

549
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,910
That's quite interesting.

550
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,870
Here's something even more interesting:

551
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,150
It seems

552
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,320
my badge has grown legs,

553
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,520
and when I wasn't paying attention,

554
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,480
it went to the prison on its own.

555
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,150
Commandant Yu,

556
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,110
what do you want to know from me?

557
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,830
Miss Jiang, don't you have something

558
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,040
you want to tell me?

559
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:26,870
Yes.

560
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:28,800
I took your badge,

561
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,560
I bribed the physician,

562
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:32,350
and naturally,

563
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,190
I let Sang Qi go.

564
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:35,630
But

565
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,630
I have my reasons.

566
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,880
What reasons?

567
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,900
Sit down, and let's talk.

568
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:48,800
Dazhou and Nanwu

569
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,590
have been in constant warfare for years,

570
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,720
but who is the true victor?

571
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,630
You fought on the frontlines,

572
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:57,800
so you should understand better
than anyone

573
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:00,760
that killing doesn't solve any problems,

574
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,870
and it only causes the people

575
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,000
to suffer more.

576
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,080
So,

577
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,520
I let Sang Qi go

578
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,630
to find a better way forward.

579
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,840
What way?

580
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:12,480
Do you understand them,

581
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,390
or have you been there?

582
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,480
I may not be like you

583
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,430
who's led troops at the border,

584
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,040
but I understand

585
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,540
that there are losers
and winners in wars.

586
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:22,590
But after the war,

587
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:24,150
there are no true winners.

588
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:25,630
Once the war begins,

589
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:26,970
there will be death and injury.

590
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,560
And behind every death or injury,

591
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,480
there is a broken family.

592
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:32,270
Letting Sang Qi go

593
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,190
was to find out

594
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,390
why they came

595
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,630
and what they wanted to do.

596
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,870
Are you discussing
military strategies with me now?

597
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:43,590
If you know yourself and your enemy,
you'll win every battle.

598
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,910
In the future,

599
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:46,960
if more people

600
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,320
from Nanwu and Dazhou

601
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:50,000
are willing to understand each other,

602
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,270
does that mean grudges

603
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:52,240
can be resolved

604
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,280
and peace can be achieved?

605
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,830
If the two sides

606
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,910
could understand each other,

607
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,910
maybe we won't need a battle.

608
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:07,190
That's interesting.

609
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,320
Now, tell me.

610
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,440
Did you come to find me

611
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,190
to return the badge

612
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,110
or just to see me?

613
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,080
Since you've come to accuse me,

614
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,390
I have no choice but to be honest.

615
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,430
I went to find you that day

616
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:35,110
to return the badge.

617
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,280
I don't believe that.

618
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:43,910
I don't care.

619
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:50,950
Turn around.

620
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,840
And you...

621
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:14,570
♪Smile at each other for the future♪

622
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:18,130
♪In the end, we're still together♪

623
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:20,550
♪Like shadows♪

624
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:25,350
♪We're brave enough to advance together♪

625
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:28,630
♪We promise each other the future♪

626
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:32,810
♪Our bond trickles down from youth♪

627
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,970
♪Time glows♪

628
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,540
(Tiande Hall)

629
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,270
Your Majesty, this is the 7th Prince

630
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:43,190
painted by the painter this year.

631
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,630
It's just like him.

632
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,350
But after seeing the real person,

633
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:50,150
I think the man

634
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,160
in the painting

635
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,000
looks less gallant.

636
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,110
The 7th Prince is handsome and elegant,

637
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:58,830
so a painting can never
fully capture him.

638
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:02,440
His brothers

639
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,190
live in luxury in Ling'an,

640
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,560
but no one cares for him,

641
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:10,670
and he has to grow up alone
in the South.

642
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:13,630
He turned out so handsome.

643
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,800
Over these years,

644
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,240
he must've suffered a lot.

645
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:19,550
For all these years,

646
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:21,590
you've never forgotten the 7th Prince.

647
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:23,390
You had people teach him skills

648
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,240
and had paintings sent back every year.

649
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,240
You care about him so much.

650
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:31,030
The 7th Prince
must've certainly felt it.

651
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:32,320
Report!

652
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,150
Your Majesty,

653
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,960
Mr. Zhen and Mr. Yu are here.

654
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,350
Let them in.

655
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,520
Yes.

656
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,190
Let them in.

657
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,960
I'm Zhen Heng. Greetings, Your Majesty.

658
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,320
I'm Yu Qi. Greetings, Your Majesty.

659
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,430
Rise.

660
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,650
I ordered you to investigate

661
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:04,480
the assassination
at the Mid-Autumn Festival.

662
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:05,560
Is there any progress?

663
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,560
Your Majesty.

664
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,490
Wang Heng, Imperial Insignia Guard,

665
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:10,430
Aling, Palace Woman,

666
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,010
and Zhou Yi, Vice Minister of Rites,

667
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:13,410
have been thoroughly interrogated.

668
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,670
Their confessions

669
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:16,320
confirm that the assassination

670
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:18,230
was indeed orchestrated
by the Nightingale.

671
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,350
Now, the Nightingale's stronghold

672
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:21,720
in Ling'an has been purged,

673
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,150
but two major criminals

674
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,150
are still being hunted.

675
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:28,000
Zhen,

676
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,320
I trust your work.

677
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,680
Your Majesty, I have a question.

678
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,640
What is it?

679
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:34,880
The Imperial Insignia Guard
and Speed Guards present

680
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,800
were all elites,

681
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,790
and with Cui Xu and Han Ran

682
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:39,040
commanding,

683
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,100
why was there no one to protect you

684
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,680
during the assassination?

685
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,670
I have punished Cui Xu and Han Ran

686
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,190
for their dereliction of duty.

687
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,590
Apart from them,

688
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,150
others who were absent

689
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,800
should also be held accountable,

690
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,080
such as the Directorate of Astronomy.

691
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,280
If they failed

692
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,800
to predict the solar eclipse,

693
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,310
they are negligent.

694
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:04,510
If they did predict it

695
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:06,040
and failed to report it,

696
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:07,590
it means they lied to you.

697
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,000
They should be punished accordingly.

698
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:11,350
Well said.

699
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,080
As expected of my...

700
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:16,560
My Commandant of Capital Security.

701
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,320
Baoping.

702
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:21,430
Yes, Your Majesty.

703
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,630
When I returned last night,

704
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:27,310
I ordered
the Directorate to be searched,

705
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:28,790
and this letter was found.

706
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:29,950
Take a look.

707
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,640
What kind of language is this?

708
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,420
It's the Nanwu language.

709
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,000
It speaks

710
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:38,310
of the concealed matter.

711
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,640
The Nanwu language

712
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,480
is a forbidden language in Dazhou.

713
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:45,950
Your Majesty,

714
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,360
I've spent lots of time with Mr. Yu,

715
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,150
and I swear with my reputation

716
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:50,830
that he is loyal to the country

717
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,110
and will never betray Dazhou.

718
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:53,950
Your Majesty, please believe me.

719
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,920
Zhen, you may leave.

720
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:56,870
Your Majesty...

721
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,800
Leave now.

722
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,160
Yes.

723
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,750
How good you're at winning people over.

724
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:23,870
You've even melted

725
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,590
a tough stone like Zhen Heng

726
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,230
in such a short time.

727
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:31,520
That's because Mr. Zhen is righteous.

728
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,480
Jin, tell me.

729
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,670
How did you learn the Nanwu language?

730
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,890
I taught myself
while stationed in Nanwu.

731
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:41,590
I suppose it was to know your enemy

732
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:42,830
and gain an advantage in wars.

733
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,920
At first, it was indeed to win battles,

734
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:47,760
but someone

735
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,040
changed my mind.

736
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:50,870
Who is it?

737
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,790
A friend.

738
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:58,150
She believes that knowing your enemy

739
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,610
is for winning without fighting.

740
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:01,790
There are losers and winners in wars,

741
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,040
but there won't be true winners.

742
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,710
Once the war begins,

743
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,140
there will be death and injury.

744
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,880
And behind every death or injury,

745
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,790
there is a broken family.

746
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:13,000
If more people from Dazhou

747
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:14,400
and Nanwu

748
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,710
can understand each other,

749
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:18,000
our accumulated grudges
will be resolved,

750
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,420
and we will live in peace.

751
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,030
For both sides,

752
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:23,040
that'd be winning without fighting.

753
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:27,190
This friend of yours really is a talent.

754
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,060
It's a pity she's in the South,

755
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:31,040
otherwise, I'd really like to meet her.

756
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:32,580
Perhaps you will one day.

757
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,720
Your Majesty,

758
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:36,000
lunch is ready at Jinhua Hall.

759
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,110
Come on, join me

760
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,600
for a meal before you leave.

761
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,840
You can meet with Consort Xian.

762
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,310
You said I could continue being Yu Qi.

763
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:44,840
I allowed you to be Yu Qi

764
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,400
but never said
you could deny your parents.

765
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:49,550
Let's go.

766
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:08,820
(Grand Elder, Nanwu)

767
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:11,390
Grand Elder.

768
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,840
Why have you returned?

769
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:14,950
Grand Elder,

770
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,440
wasn't it your bamboo leaf letter

771
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:18,000
that summoned us back to Nanwu?

772
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,040
I summoned you?

773
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,280
Look at this letter.

774
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:31,040
The handwriting is mine,

775
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:32,560
but this letter

776
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,920
was not written by me.

777
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,670
Could someone have imitated
your handwriting?

778
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:37,960
Where did you

779
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:40,000
get this letter from?

780
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,790
This is truly strange.

781
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:45,560
Sang Qi was imprisoned
by Dazhou back then...

782
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:49,750
Besides that,

783
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:53,080
she seemed to be able
to foresee many things.

784
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,270
Who exactly is she?

785
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I investigated her.

786
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,000
She was born and raised in Dazhou,

787
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,790
has never left Ling'an,

788
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,880
and has no connection

789
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,480
to Nanwu whatsoever.

790
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,520
Yet somehow,

791
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,440
it felt like she had long known us.

792
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:14,670
Is that so?

793
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,800
Grand Elder,

794
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:18,560
our oracle states

795
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,880
that the Saintess can foresee the future

796
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,110
and know everything.

797
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,840
Jiang Si

798
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,290
seems to match that description.

799
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:28,880
Could she be related to the Saintess?

800
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:30,480
Or perhaps...

801
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:31,960
She is the Saintess?

802
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:37,230
What about Sang Qi and Du'er?

803
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:38,920
We are wanted by Dazhou,

804
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,360
so they stayed to cover our retreat.

805
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,240
Tell them

806
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,750
that once this is over,

807
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,290
they must return to Dazhou at once

808
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:47,190
and bring the Saintess back.

809
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:49,990
Yes.

810
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:03,380
(Consort Xian, Yu Jin's birth mother)

811
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,150
Your Majesty,

812
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,680
when you asked Yu Jin
to return to Ling'an,

813
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:12,790
you could've told me in advance,

814
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:16,190
so I could've prepared for this.

815
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,580
There wasn't enough time today

816
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:20,150
to summon Prince Qi to the Palace.

817
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:23,310
He's always been decent and composed.

818
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,190
He's kind to his siblings as well.

819
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,960
When you meet him,

820
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:30,210
I'm sure you'll be pleased.

821
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,920
Even after years apart,

822
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,750
your bond is in your very blood.

823
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,480
Why would a mother need to prepare

824
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:37,660
for a meeting with her son?

825
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,150
You're right, Your Majesty.

826
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,080
This drink is to welcome you back.

827
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:52,560
I don't drink alcohol.

828
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,800
Then have some food.

829
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:59,110
These dishes

830
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,310
were prepared especially for you.

831
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:02,750
I haven't recovered.

832
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,080
I'm afraid I can't have meat.

833
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,440
Look at you.

834
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,480
You don't even know your own son.

835
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,400
There's much to learn.

836
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:20,560
Jin, don't take it to heart.

837
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:24,710
Hurry and have these dishes changed.

838
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,230
- Yes.
- No need, Your Highness.

839
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:29,040
Why call her Your Highness?

840
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,640
Yes.

841
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,800
Mother.

842
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:43,470
Jin,

843
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
before your mansion is decided,

844
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,920
you may stay at Jinhua Hall for now.

845
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:50,880
That way, you and your mother

846
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,040
can spend more time together.

847
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,080
There's still work at Capital Security.

848
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:58,190
It's more convenient for me
to stay at my residence.

849
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,230
Then when you have time,

850
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,590
visit Prince Qi often.

851
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,360
Your brother

852
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:07,840
will surely take good care of you.

853
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,320
Of course.

854
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,000
(With Commandant Yu's temperament,)

855
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,440
(if he truly angered His Majesty,)

856
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:31,990
(he might end up in serious trouble.)

857
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,320
(Why didn't I)

858
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,150
(warn him beforehand?)

859
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,080
(He's always such a handful.)

860
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,960
Where am I now?

861
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,280
Come here.

862
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,780
It can shelter you from the rain.

863
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:22,510
Come on.

864
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,720
Get up.

865
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:31,480
Are you also lost?

866
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,310
The rain is really coming down hard.

867
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,750
The gates must be closing soon.

868
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,750
You're leaving the Palace?

869
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:44,430
Yes.

870
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,880
Is it lively outside?

871
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:53,540
