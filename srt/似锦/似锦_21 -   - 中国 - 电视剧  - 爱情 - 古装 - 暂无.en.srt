11
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:58,790
Miss.

12
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,640
Commandant Yu is waiting for you.

13
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,640
Aman, you go wait for me at home.

14
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,760
Sure.

15
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,270
Zhao Yu from the North Affiliate.

16
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:54,750
You go ahead.

17
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,090
Go to Tianxiang House in Ling'an.

18
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,390
That's our stronghold.

19
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,520
Senior Du, what about you?

20
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,360
If I'm not dead,

21
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,670
I'll meet you at the HQ.

22
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,200
Go.

23
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,150
(Du'er.)

24
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,560
(Oh, no. I have to leave.)

25
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,550
It's not me.

26
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,360
Chief, do you believe it now?

27
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,000
Jiang Si has connected

28
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,840
with the Nightingale.

29
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,390
You said there was no evidence

30
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,610
so we couldn't hurt her.

31
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,190
Then suddenly, you said

32
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,130
she was not the Saintess

33
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,440
and canceled the investigation.

34
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,200
Now the evidence is clear.

35
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,150
Are you going to pretend not to see it?

36
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,390
I didn't expect that letter

37
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,920
to fall into your hands.

38
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,760
Commandant Yu is so lucky

39
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,290
to have a girl like you
in love with him.

40
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,760
Chief, here.

41
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,590
You two really are in sync,

42
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,200
a match made in heaven.

43
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,150
What a pity.

44
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,760
He is holding a bow aimed at you.

45
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,120
(How ironic.)

46
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,450
(I didn't expect
to meet you again so soon,)

47
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,390
(yet you're pointing the arrow at me.)

48
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,350
Let me.

49
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,800
Now, I'll give you the answer.

50
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,270
- No.
- What do you mean?

51
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,000
You asked me before if I could kill her
at the right time.

52
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,510
The answer is no.

53
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,510
But she's the Saintess.

54
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,390
No!

55
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,060
(Tianxiang House)

56
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,310
Go back to Capital Security

57
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,250
and bring our men here.

58
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:49,130
Yes.

59
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,760
You're not Zhao Yu.

60
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,560
I don't know what you're saying.

61
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,640
Let's be honest.

62
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,030
I'm the owner of this gambling den.

63
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,000
My last name is Du.

64
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,000
Now, who are you?

65
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,560
As expected of Du'er,

66
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,600
Leader of the Nightingale.

67
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,440
You must have

68
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,320
a different understanding of honesty.

69
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,960
Few people who know my secret identity

70
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,800
are still alive.

71
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,470
Who exactly are you?

72
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,150
I'm Jiang Si
from Earl Dongping's family.

73
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,640
I'm not your enemy.

74
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,740
Where did you get the Nightingale Token?

75
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,560
Why do you know our secret?

76
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,710
That Nightingale Token I have

77
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,240
belongs to Sang Qi.

78
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,510
The Token is proof of our members.

79
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,030
It'd never be given to outsiders.

80
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,880
Why do you

81
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,310
have his token?

82
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,440
Because I can enter
Capital Security's prison.

83
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:11,150
You're so close to Commandant Yu.

84
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,130
How would you betray Capital Security?

85
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:14,880
Do you think I'm stupid?

86
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,030
Let go.

87
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,590
Senior Du.

88
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,830
When I'm teaching her,

89
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,120
could you not intervene?

90
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,440
Then stop hitting her palm.

91
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,270
Look at her hands.

92
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,470
I'm doing this for her sake.

93
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,400
Being strict with her

94
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,340
will help her learn faster
and remember better.

95
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,320
The materials for fragrances
have to be precise,

96
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,840
or the effect will be completely off.

97
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,050
She's just starting to learn.

98
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,970
The stricter you are,
the less she'll learn.

99
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:38,590
The Grand Elder

100
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,120
taught us like this, right?

101
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,160
Have you forgotten?

102
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,280
Seniors,

103
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,750
it's all my fault.

104
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,110
I'll work harder

105
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,230
and keep going.

106
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,400
Just protect her.

107
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:53,210
Next time,
you take the punishment for her.

108
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,870
Fine. Hit me.

109
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,590
(What should I do?)

110
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,520
(I have to make him stop.)

111
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,470
Because I can rescue Sang Qi

112
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,630
without a fight.

113
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:22,470
Why?

114
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:23,830
I have my reasons.

115
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:24,700
Just promise me

116
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,910
that you'll stop the Nightingale
from doing anything.

117
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,920
If I fail,

118
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,470
you can make your plans.

119
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,230
Yu Qi,

120
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,920
if you don't surrender,

121
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,710
I'll kill Jiang Si.

122
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,500
Go through the back door.

123
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:54,630
What do you mean?

124
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,920
If you want to live, leave now.

125
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,280
Or it'll be too late.

126
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:10,200
Remember to wait
for Sang Qi at the temple

127
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,080
outside the West Gate.

128
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,110
Chief!

129
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,440
Where did they go?

130
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:23,510
They ran.

131
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,160
Chief.

132
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,590
Miss Jiang, are you hurt?

133
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,350
- No.
- Go chase.

134
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,390
Yes.

135
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,390
I'm fine.

136
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,560
This is the Nightingale's mark.

137
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,630
The officers are here.

138
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:10,440
Don't run.

139
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,680
- Don't move.
- Don't move.

140
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,520
Stop!

141
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,500
You, squat down.

142
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,070
My Lord...

143
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,210
- Don't move.
- Squat down.

144
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,920
Don't move.

145
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,340
(Zhou Yi, Vice Minister of Rites)

146
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,320
Explain it.

147
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,920
Why did you go there tonight?

148
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,280
Du'er intercepted my letter.

149
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,870
I didn't expect him

150
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,150
to be the one who showed up.

151
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,520
Who did you plan to meet?

152
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:43,870
Was it Zhen Heng?

153
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,230
- No.
- There's another man?

154
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:52,450
It's none of your business.

155
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,200
This concerns the Nightingale.

156
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,000
Capital Security has the responsibility

157
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,160
to investigate.

158
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,390
Alright.

159
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,400
Then I'll tell you.

160
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,470
You're familiar

161
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,110
with the man I was meeting,

162
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,350
but tonight,

163
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,500
he was standing far away,
with a bow drawn at me.

164
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,440
It wasn't me.

165
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:34,830
It was Long Dan.

166
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,520
You saw me with Du'er.

167
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,020
You suspect me, don't you?

168
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,470
Thankfully, Du'er acted quickly,

169
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:45,560
or you might've

170
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,390
shot me

171
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,270
to death.

172
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,110
Impossible.

173
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,240
I could never do anything

174
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,750
to harm you.

175
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:56,590
Is that so?

176
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:58,960
Then why did you send

177
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,130
the Nightingale Token to me?

178
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,990
I admit it.

179
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,920
I was testing you.

180
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,920
I don't know why,

181
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,400
but

182
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,440
if I really were

183
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,680
the Saintess of Nanwu,

184
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,230
what would you do?

185
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,200
In my heart,

186
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,600
you'll always be

187
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,150
Miss Si from Earl Dongping's family.

188
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,130
You'd never do anything

189
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,520
to harm Dazhou.

190
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,700
Whether or not you're the Saintess

191
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,080
doesn't matter.

192
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,160
If I start

193
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,680
working with Nanwu one day,

194
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,080
what will you do?

195
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,160
I will protect Dazhou,

196
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,280
and I'll protect you.

197
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,500
(Capital Security Office)

198
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:07,350
Commandant Yu.

199
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,390
His Majesty issued an edict.

200
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:10,800
The Mid-Autumn Hunt

201
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,320
will be held at Mount Cuiluo.

202
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:16,040
Officials above the 7th Rank
must attend.

203
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,670
The Mid-Autumn Hunt?

204
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,110
Yes.

205
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,400
Many officials

206
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,760
are hoping to use this chance

207
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,870
to make an impression
in front of His Majesty.

208
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:40,180
(Earl Dongping's Mansion)

209
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,040
Well...

210
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,630
Qiao, you still need

211
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,240
to meet

212
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,430
Mr. Xiao.

213
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,110
Your lineal mother and I

214
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,040
will go with you.

215
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,640
I'll also sit

216
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,430
in a nearby side hall.

217
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:54,950
Also,

218
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,350
your mother

219
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:57,590
can see this as well.

220
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:58,430
Master Anmou,

221
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,200
can you really bear this?

222
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,440
Yes, Father.

223
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,590
Please think of a way.

224
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,430
Father,

225
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,190
did I do something to upset you?

226
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,800
It's too late.

227
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,200
It's too late!

228
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,830
Everything's too late.

229
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,240
The Xiao family likes you.

230
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,590
They wanted to meet you.

231
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,550
Your lineal mother has agreed

232
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,390
without asking me.

233
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,520
She even stamped

234
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,670
the reply letter

235
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,830
with our family seal.

236
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,750
Now, what can we do?

237
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,160
But you are Qiao's father.

238
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,440
If you strongly oppose it,

239
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,730
they won't be able to force it.

240
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,190
Father,

241
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,000
please help me.

242
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,400
Father, think of something.

243
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,350
Please help Qiao.

244
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:49,040
That's Lingbei Military Commissioner.

245
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,270
If I make enemies everywhere,

246
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,880
will I even keep my position after this?

247
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:52,960
If it were that simple,

248
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,800
I would have replied long ago.

249
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,550
That's it. We'll see after the meeting.

250
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,870
Qiao...

251
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,560
Qiao...

252
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,480
Ma'am,

253
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,520
any news from the Xiaoxiang Chamber?

254
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,040
Master Anmou has agreed,

255
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,520
so they have no choice.

256
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,720
However, Miss Qiao has been melancholy,

257
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,270
staying in her room.

258
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,670
I wonder what she's thinking.

259
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,640
I heard from the kitchen

260
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,030
that the meals sent to her

261
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,590
haven't been touched much.

262
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,110
She's just young and ignorant.

263
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:59,110
It's a good family.

264
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:00,910
She's just a concubine's daughter.

265
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:01,960
What kind of family

266
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,310
does she want?

267
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,150
Come on.

268
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,430
Whose life isn't like this?

269
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,290
Find someone to keep an eye on her.

270
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,240
Let the kitchen prepare
something delicious,

271
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,280
so she doesn't lose weight.

272
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,720
Yes.

273
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,520
Ma'am, you're so thoughtful.

274
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,320
Wait.

275
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:24,960
I have to be cautious.

276
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,720
Go call someone for me.

277
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,670
How are you in your husband's family?

278
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Don't worry, Mother.

279
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,200
My husband treats me very well.

280
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:39,350
You've grown up after marriage.

281
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:41,440
You're more mature and sensible.

282
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,510
Pei has always been

283
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,830
close to me.

284
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,350
She always called me Mother.

285
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,200
How obedient and sweet.

286
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,040
Yes.

287
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:52,190
Ms. Jiang Pei listens to you the most.

288
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,680
Now that you're married,

289
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,880
I suddenly can't see you,

290
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,560
but I'm still thinking about you.

291
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,430
In the past, I was ignorant.

292
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,560
Thank you for your care.

293
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,790
Now that you're married,

294
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:06,040
I'm at ease.

295
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,960
But I'm still worried

296
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,480
about your sister's

297
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:12,000
marriage.

298
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,670
She's at the age to be married.

299
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,270
She can't stay

300
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,870
at home forever.

301
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,440
Mr. Xiao

302
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,760
is really good.

303
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,590
You should persuade her.

304
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,150
Mrs. Jiang Qiao,

305
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,910
please don't mind me
speaking out of turn.

306
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,240
Ms. Xiao's words are a bit harsh,

307
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,960
but it's for your good.

308
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,070
Like this time, when she asked you

309
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,430
to persuade Miss Qiao,

310
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
it was for the harmony of the family.

311
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,830
So, why don't you

312
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,150
reconsider?

313
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:44,390
Alright, Mrs. Li.

314
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,000
Please stop here.

315
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,830
(When did Pei start mingling
with Ms. Xiao again?)

316
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,920
You should be outside

317
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,240
and bask in the sun like this.

318
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:21,960
That way,

319
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,630
you won't feel so gloomy.

320
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,520
Actually, sometimes,

321
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,000
once you figure things out,

322
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,000
it'll be over.

323
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,320
I'm a little tired.

324
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:41,660
I'll go back to take a nap.

325
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,670
Did you call me over

326
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:03,000
just for this?

327
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:04,590
What else?

328
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,320
This box has a mechanism.

329
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,480
I guessed it.

330
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,520
Can you open it?

331
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,480
Of course.

332
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,830
Contracts.

333
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,990
They're signed with Manager Du
from the gambling den.

334
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,390
These people

335
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:56,430
owe huge gambling debts.

336
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,440
It also says
that if they help the Nightingale

337
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,910
complete a certain task,

338
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:02,040
they can offset their debts.

339
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,670
The Vice Minister of Rites.

340
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,150
Alright.

341
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,110
Once I catch them,

342
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,320
I'll interrogate them thoroughly.

343
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,530
Find a reason

344
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:14,670
unrelated to the Nightingale.

345
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:15,590
Got it.

346
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:17,080
We don't want to alert the enemy.

347
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:33,800
Three quarters after the Wu hour;
the Mid-Autumn Hunt.

348
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:36,800
Nanwu thrives; Jingming falls.

349
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,190
Dazhou forbids learning
the Nanwu language,

350
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,720
but you can recognize it?

351
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,000
Looks like you know it too.

352
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,830
Could it be that the Nightingale

353
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:55,280
plans to act during the Mid-Autumn Hunt?

354
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,320
(Emperor Jingming is supposed
to die this year.)

355
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,520
(But wasn't it a sudden illness?)

356
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,240
(Could his death)

357
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,190
(be related to the Nightingale?)

358
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,110
What did you say?

359
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:08,880
I said if they plan to act

360
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,720
during the Mid-Autumn Hunt,

361
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,320
we must be cautious.

362
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,280
What does "Three quarters
after the Wu hour" mean?

363
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:16,960
Is it about time?

364
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,520
Three quarters after the Wu hour.

365
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,870
Why at this time?

366
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,190
It's already the Wu hour.

367
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,830
Why hasn't anyone brought lunch?

368
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:27,350
This punishment

369
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,280
will wear you out, Ma'am.

370
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,800
Besides,

371
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,430
today is the Mid-Autumn Festival.

372
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:39,390
This...

373
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,270
Why has the sky gone dark?

374
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:43,590
Solar eclipse?

375
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,280
This is an omen of a great disaster.

376
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:48,140
(The ladies got up and said...)

377
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,350
Why is the bell ringing?

378
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:59,190
Ma'am, Emperor Jingming has passed away.

379
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:01,040
This is to announce
the national mourning.

380
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,110
What?

381
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:03,050
His Majesty passed away

382
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,800
when the solar eclipse happened.

383
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:07,010
I heard that when the sky darkened,

384
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,560
they couldn't even light the candles.

385
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,800
How could this happen?

386
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:15,480
Solar eclipse.

387
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:19,910
Solar eclipse will happen
three quarters after the Wu hour.

388
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,720
How did you know about that?

389
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,480
I'm the Saintess.

390
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,830
I can foresee the future.

391
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:30,520
Is that strange?

392
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,560
No, no.

393
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,240
It seems

394
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,720
the Nightingale plans

395
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,670
to take this chance

396
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:36,870
to kill Emperor Jingming.

397
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:41,110
Will you go to the Mid-Autumn Hunt?

398
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,150
I must go.

399
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,870
Would you help me?

400
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,700
(To)

401
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,780
(Respectfully, Jiang Qiao)

402
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:57,900
(Sealed by Jiang Qiao)

403
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,900
(Court, Capital Security)

404
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:07,280
Hurry to organize the testimonies

405
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,730
from the interrogation last night.

406
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,840
Yes, My Lord.

407
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:11,820
You've worked for a day and a night.

408
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,320
Please rest now.

409
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,000
Go on.

410
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:37,350
Thank you, Commandant Yu.

411
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,430
Any progress?

412
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:42,800
Just some ordinary gamblers.

413
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,390
They'll be fined,
locked up for a few days,

414
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:47,350
and then released.

415
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,240
But according to them,

416
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,760
this gambling den

417
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:52,830
has been operating for years,

418
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:54,480
and we've never caught wind of it.

419
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,390
Fortunately,

420
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,000
you acted swiftly

421
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:01,870
and shut down this disastrous den.

422
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:04,150
Mr. Zhen, you flatter me.

423
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,720
With your compliment,

424
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,280
I must help you.

425
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:10,110
How about this?

426
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:13,390
Issue an arrest warrant,

427
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,480
and I'll interrogate Zhou Yi,

428
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,910
Vice Minister of Rites.

429
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,910
Vice Minister of Rites?

430
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:22,910
Yes.

431
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,870
No need for that.

432
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,040
Why?

433
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,000
He's among these gamblers.

434
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,670
What a coincidence.

435
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,190
Miss Si.

436
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,280
Mr. Zhen.

437
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,190
Miss Si is also here.

438
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,630
Director of the Ministry of Revenue.

439
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:11,170
Director of Exam Office,
the Ministry of Personnel.

440
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,350
Councillor of the Ministry of Personnel.

441
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,170
Vice Director of Natural Resources.

442
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,320
I thought the officials were honest,

443
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:24,670
but I didn't expect such a gambling den

444
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:26,750
(Contract)
to entangle so many officials

445
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:29,590
leaking state secrets
over and over again.

446
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:30,430
Yes.

447
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:31,430
Mr. Zhen,

448
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,830
this gambling den

449
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,720
might be connected to the Nightingale.

450
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,520
What?

451
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,150
Mother,

452
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:57,350
I'm sorry.

453
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,910
I'm not a filial daughter.

454
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:05,590
I'm leaving now.

455
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,110
Qiao.

456
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,800
When I talked to you during the day,

457
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,760
I sensed something was off,

458
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,670
so I kept an eye on you.

459
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,480
Are you planning to run away?

460
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,750
Yes, I'm leaving.

461
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:40,870
Where will you go?

462
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,240
Anywhere is fine.

463
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:44,830
Just because of this marriage?

464
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,390
The rest of my life

465
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:49,800
is controlled anyway,

466
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,480
so I'd rather leave.

467
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,680
I won't be Miss Qiao anymore.

468
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,560
I'll be Jiang Qiao.

469
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:56,490
Whether my life is good or not

470
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,280
will be under my control.

471
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,670
But you've never left home.

472
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,270
If you leave here

473
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:03,680
and no longer be Miss Qiao,

474
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,920
how will you live alone outside?

475
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,870
Do you know how dangerous
the world is out there?

476
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,590
Are you worried about me,

477
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,790
or are you worried that after I leave,

478
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:16,620
you won't be able to explain it
to Ms. Xiao?

479
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,860
What does she have to do with this?

480
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,080
I saw Mrs. Li

481
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,190
sending you back.

482
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:24,630
What's going on?

483
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,430
What happened?

484
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:33,080
Is Miss Qiao about to leave?

485
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,680
Tell me.

486
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,240
What's going on

487
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:41,720
in the middle of the night?

488
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
My Lady,

489
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,000
the servants on night watch

490
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:52,110
heard some noise

491
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,080
from Xiaoxiang Chamber on patrol.

492
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,760
I was worried,

493
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,320
so I took a few people to check.

494
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:58,870
To my surprise,

495
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:02,670
Miss Qiao was trying
to run away from home.

496
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:04,430
What?

497
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,000
Are you sure?

498
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,280
I wouldn't dare speak recklessly.

499
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,070
At that time, Miss Qiao

500
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:15,350
was carrying her luggage,

501
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,860
and on the table in her room,

502
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,240
there was a farewell letter.

503
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,960
(I tried to make my parents proud.)

504
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,780
(I'm so thankful
that my parents raised me.)

505
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:43,630
Take a look.

506
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,350
This is your daughter.

507
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:46,800
Your daughter.

508
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:58,480
Do you really want to leave?

509
00:33:58,790 --> 00:33:59,870
You want to leave this home?

510
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,760
Master Anmou,

511
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:03,270
Qiao must have been confused

512
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,250
because of the marriage.

513
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,150
How could she really leave home?

514
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,380
Qiao, hurry.

515
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:09,110
Apologize to Grandmother
and Master Anmou.

516
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:09,950
Qiao...

517
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:11,350
Yes.

518
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,770
Sorry for being unfilial.

519
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,110
You...

520
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,030
What about your father,
mother, and siblings?

521
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:19,360
Are you leaving them behind?

522
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:21,400
This family no longer wants me here.

523
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,040
Rather than marrying some man,

524
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,790
I'd rather leave and be carefree.

525
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:28,790
But this marriage
hasn't been decided yet.

526
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:31,790
If you're really unwilling,

527
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,360
just say it.

528
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,040
We can always find a way to solve it.

529
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:38,270
Grandmother, what else can I say?

530
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,400
My will is nothing

531
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,070
compared to a piece of paper

532
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:43,480
with the family seal.

533
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:46,480
Alright, I accept it.

534
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:48,710
Thank you for this.

535
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,760
Mother.

536
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,400
Take it inside
to make the bed for Mother.

537
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:53,750
Fu, go help.

538
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,480
No need. Let her go.

539
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,710
You can brew the tea.

540
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,440
Here, Mother.

541
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,480
That family seal represents our honesty.

542
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,190
We only agreed

543
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,110
for you to meet him.

544
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:08,880
We didn't agree on anything else.

545
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,000
"I only need to meet him."

546
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,360
"I only need to get engaged."

547
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,560
"I only have to marry him."

548
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:14,230
What exactly can be considered

549
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:15,110
a big deal then?

550
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,920
I don't want

551
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,070
to live my life aimlessly

552
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:19,010
and without a purpose.

553
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:21,230
The girls in our family

554
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:23,920
are all sharp-tongued.

555
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,270
Where are her manners?

556
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,840
Look, look.

557
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,750
Look at what you've all done.

558
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:34,040
I don't want to be troubled by this.

559
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:37,880
Anmou, this is your family matter.

560
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:39,920
You deal with it yourself.

561
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:46,080
Yes, Mother.

562
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:54,880
Lock her up

563
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,110
so she can think about it.

564
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,070
Master Anmou, please spare Qiao.

565
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:58,960
And you.

566
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:00,180
You failed to educate her.

567
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:02,080
Go back and copy the book ten times,

568
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,200
so you can learn how other families

569
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:06,080
raise their children.

570
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,790
Some people have broken

571
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:20,000
our family rules.

572
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:27,060
(Prison)

573
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,720
Mr. Zhou.

574
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,310
Mr. Zhou.

575
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,480
Who is calling me?

576
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:08,550
Please come with me.

577
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:15,550
After you.

578
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:16,760
- Mr. Zhou.
- Mr. Zhou.

579
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,230
What do we do if you leave, Mr. Zhou?

580
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,090
Mr. Zhou.

581
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:20,190
You must save us!

582
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,130
Mr. Zhou.

583
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:22,590
It was you who invited us here.

584
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:23,430
Mr. Zhou.

585
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,340
Mr. Zhou!

586
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:25,590
Don't leave!

587
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,800
Mother,

588
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,080
don't you blame me?

589
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:31,440
Blame you for what?

590
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,840
For being willful and causing trouble,

591
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,980
and for running away from home.

592
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:38,000
If you leave,

593
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,550
does that mean

594
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:41,100
everything the family has done for you

595
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,190
is completely denied?

596
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,080
Your father would naturally feel hurt,

597
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,750
but I know

598
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:50,590
that you care

599
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,110
for this family

600
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,080
and me.

601
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,590
I've never forgotten

602
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:57,800
how nice Father, you,

603
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,080
and everyone else

604
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,110
in this family treated me.

605
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:03,840
I don't want
to leave all of this behind.

606
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,630
I just really don't know

607
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:09,470
what to do.

608
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:10,630
I know.

609
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,560
I know everything you've said.

610
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:16,270
I'm sorry.

611
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,000
I know how careful,

612
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,400
considerate, and decent

613
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,590
you are

614
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:24,190
in this family.

615
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,400
But now...

616
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:28,070
It's all my fault.

617
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:30,360
It's alright.

618
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,040
Really.

619
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:33,480
Why would I care

620
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,560
what they say?

621
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,520
In this family,

622
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:38,230
only you and Pei are my daughters.

623
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,110
My greatest wish

624
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,110
is for you both to live well.

625
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,790
I'll copy the book with you.

626
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:47,910
Qiao,

627
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,360
no need for this.

628
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:27,300
(Embarrass her parents...)

629
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,710
Mother, Qiao.

630
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:40,790
Pei.

631
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,150
Mother, Qiao.

632
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,660
I just went to Guangju Restaurant

633
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:46,630
and bought some snacks.

634
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,800
They're freshly baked

635
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,710
and still warm.

636
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:49,920
Aren't these

637
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,310
Qiao's favorites?

638
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:53,910
It smells so good.

639
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:55,400
Try some, Qiao.

640
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,240
I'm not hungry.

641
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,480
Then I'll make some tea.

642
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:01,470
Alright.

643
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,200
No need.

644
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,700
I'm not thirsty either.

645
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:15,000
Look at us.

646
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,630
We're finally together.

647
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,150
Let's sit down and have a drink.

648
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:21,030
I think someone is thinking

649
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:22,240
about Ms. Xiao

650
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,040
and doesn't want to talk with us.

651
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:26,150
Qiao, what are you saying?

652
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,310
I kindly brought some snacks,

653
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:31,520
and yet Qiao wronged me like this.

654
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,680
That's not fair.

655
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,000
You know

656
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,270
what you're up to.

657
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,940
I really didn't expect it.

658
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:40,520
You're married now.

659
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,590
Why are you still flattering Ms. Xiao?

660
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,080
What good could she possibly bring you?

661
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,750
Ms. Xiao?

662
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:50,670
Pei, what did you do?

663
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,480
Why would I flatter Ms. Xiao?

664
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:53,710
That's nonsense.

665
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,840
Mother,

666
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,590
I saw

667
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:57,960
Mrs. Li send her back.

668
00:40:58,610 --> 00:40:59,960
I don't know what Pei and Ms. Xiao

669
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,190
talked about in private,

670
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:04,630
but she later urged me to meet Mr. Xiao.

671
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:06,790
Isn't that Ms. Xiao's idea?

672
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,150
Last night, I just left the house,

673
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,040
and Pei immediately followed me.

674
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,480
Mrs. Li just happened to show up

675
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,520
and caught me right in the act.

676
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:15,880
I think

677
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:17,480
Pei must've passed the message

678
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,440
to Ms. Xiao.

679
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,880
Pei, you're being foolish.

680
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,780
Why are you still mingling with her?

681
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,950
Have you forgotten
the lessons of the past?

682
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:28,560
Is this how you see me?

683
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:32,270
Haven't you done similar things before?

684
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:34,710
I just didn't expect

685
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:37,980
that nature is so hard to change.

686
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,400
Qiao is your sister.

687
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,790
How could you help outsiders
to go against her?

688
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:44,480
Since you dislike me,

689
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:48,150
I'll leave.

690
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:50,040
The one who should leave is not her

691
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:51,070
but me.

692
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,790
They fought in Xiaoxiang Chamber,

693
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,800
and Ms. Pei packed her things

694
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,710
and left the house.

695
00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:00,040
She must've returned
to her husband's house early.

696
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,880
It's raining on the way

697
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,190
from Ling'an to Lingbei.

698
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:05,920
The letter to the Xiao family

699
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,560
might be delayed by a few days.

700
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,360
A delay is good.

701
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,670
It'll give Jiang Qiao time

702
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:13,750
to think things through.

703
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,400
Good things take time.

704
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,550
What's wrong

705
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:20,630
with our family?

706
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,030
None of our girls

707
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:23,080
can spare me some worries.

708
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,840
Sorry for last night.

709
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,800
Commandant Yu and I

710
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,440
prepared some food and wine

711
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,310
to apologize.

712
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:37,270
Thank you.

713
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,640
Cheers.

714
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:46,230
This is

715
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:49,230
really troublesome.

716
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,600
Mr. Zhen,

717
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,360
thank you so much. Here.

718
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,310
You suffered the most.

719
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:58,840
Mr. Zhou,

720
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,270
take a look. Is this your name?

721
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:03,510
(Signed by: Zhou Yi)

722
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:04,350
That's right.
