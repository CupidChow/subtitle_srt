(Earl Dongping's Mansion, Jiang)

12
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,520
I'll be gentle.

13
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:53,210
Just hold on a bit, Qian.

14
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,880
Mother,

15
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:00,320
Father has gone to Concubine Ruan's.

16
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,680
Go wherever he likes.

17
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,250
He'd better die in that wench's room.

18
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,920
This heartless creature

19
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,570
cares only for his political climb,

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,090
discarding even his own daughter.

21
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,680
Mother,

22
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,610
you know what?

23
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,800
I suddenly envy the First Branch.

24
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,600
Ji Chongyi only pushed Jiang Si

25
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,280
into the river by accident,

26
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,680
without even injuring her,

27
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,370
yet my uncle risked everything

28
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,050
to annul her engagement

29
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,490
and filed charges with the Capital Security.

30
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:30,240
If it had been Jiang Si today,

31
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,650
my uncle would've grabbed a knife

32
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:34,680
to confront the Cao Family.

33
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,560
If Father showed

34
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,330
half his brother's care for his daughter,

35
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,450
perhaps Cao Xingyu

36
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:42,800
wouldn't dare treat me this way.

37
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,330
Qian,

38
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,520
it was my fault

39
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,650
for planning your marriage.

40
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,000
I've ruined your life!

41
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,120
Mother, what are you doing? Mother!

42
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,170
It seems that

43
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,720
marrying up

44
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,240
isn't necessarily a blessing.

45
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,490
You've finally seen the light, Pei.

46
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,450
I've always envied Qian

47
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,800
since childhood,

48
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,720
not expecting

49
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,370
that her life

50
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,400
is a living hell.

51
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,680
No more.

52
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,110
I'll stop obsessing

53
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,490
over aristocratic marriages.

54
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,520
I'll aim for civilian officials' families,

55
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,520
men who can't lift weights

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,960
or wield tools,

57
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,520
only writing brushes.

58
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,400
At least they won't beat me.

59
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,720
Yes, yes.

60
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:38,210
Mother,

61
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,370
I know you meant well

62
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:41,960
for my future.

63
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,280
You're the only one who truly loves me.

64
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,090
Grandma and Father

65
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:49,720
would never risk so much

66
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,240
to protect me like you do.

67
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,770
My poor child.

68
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:59,650
You are the flesh of my flesh,

69
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,930
the child I carried for ten months.

70
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:04,090
Every blow on you

71
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:06,680
cuts deeper

72
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,650
than on me.

73
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,000
Mother, Mother.

74
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,210
I don't blame you.

75
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:12,960
It's my fault.

76
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,840
My fault.

77
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,560
Ma'am,

78
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,810
please don't send Miss Qian back.

79
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,040
She might really be beaten to death.

80
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:26,370
Qian,

81
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:28,970
don't worry.

82
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,090
Even if I have to risk my life,

83
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,280
I will protect you.

84
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,240
I won't let you

85
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,600
suffer like this anymore.

86
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:41,250
Mother!

87
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:48,290
Who is it?

88
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:49,720
I have an idea.

89
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:51,650
Nonsense!

90
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:54,090
I thought you had a good idea,

91
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,090
but you could get Qian killed.

92
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,480
Didn't Qian say

93
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,720
she would do anything to escape

94
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,720
that beast's torment?

95
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:02,010
Reporting him now

96
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,160
is her best chance to break free.

97
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,570
As you said,

98
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,280
if Qian testifies against Cao Xingyu

99
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,400
at the Capital Security Office,

100
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:09,770
what will Marquis Changxing do?

101
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,600
Will he let her go?

102
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,600
Does she have any other way out?

103
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:15,970
If she goes back, she'll live in fear,

104
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,010
daily beatings, abuse,

105
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:18,450
maybe snuffed out tomorrow.

106
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,600
Cao Xingyu can claim she died of illness,

107
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,480
and wipe out the traces.

108
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,450
What can we do then?

109
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,530
Uncle has made

110
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:26,570
his attitude clear tonight.

111
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,090
He would never step in.

112
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,360
Aunt, Qian,

113
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,330
the two of you

114
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,160
are powerless to file for divorce.

115
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,520
I'm not going.

116
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,280
If I report to the authorities,

117
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,530
Cao Xingyu has 100 ways

118
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:39,040
to make my life a living hell.

119
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,320
Jiang Si,

120
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,650
I had no choice

121
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,250
but to invite you to the mansion.

122
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,520
Do you hate me that much?

123
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,810
Fighters bleed, watchers feed.

124
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,480
You're fanning flames

125
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,160
just to use me as your tool

126
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,210
for vengeance.

127
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,570
If I stay silent, I can at least survive.

128
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:55,840
Survive, seriously?

129
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,010
You're just sitting here waiting to die.

130
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,690
The depth of the ligature marks

131
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:02,840
on the victims' necks

132
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,680
indicates

133
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,400
that all the women

134
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,800
(Capital Security)
were strangled to death

135
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,360
by the same guy using a cord-like object.

136
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,130
Any other leads?

137
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:10,090
Not yet.

138
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,890
Why are her marks different?

139
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,160
Either because of her special constitution

140
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,450
or she was struggling too hard

141
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:24,770
when she was about to die.

142
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,400
It's hard to tell from the body.

143
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,010
See if there's anything

144
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,040
in her throat.

145
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,880
Yes.

146
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,800
Look, sir.

147
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,640
This is

148
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,210
a button.

149
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:53,770
Did Yu Qi

150
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:55,650
really say that?

151
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,240
Absolutely true.

152
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,240
He said Anzi

153
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,600
couldn't afford that thing.

154
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,040
He'd summon you for questioning.

155
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,640
Really?

156
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:18,040
Anzi couldn't afford it,

157
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:21,210
but someone else can.

158
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,130
Your Honor,

159
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:27,720
I'm here today

160
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,520
to tell you something important.

161
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:32,240
After Anzi confessed,

162
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,810
I felt something was wrong.

163
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,920
He was always

164
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,520
honest and law-abiding.

165
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,330
How could he have had the nerve

166
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,690
to kill those women and bury their bodies?

167
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:43,890
You testified

168
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:45,480
against him,

169
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,920
and your father executed him.

170
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,240
Now what?

171
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:50,840
Are you going to

172
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:52,890
change your tune?

173
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,720
You really treat lives like weeds.

174
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:00,960
His death

175
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:02,050
wasn't undeserved.

176
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,570
My father

177
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:04,720
did it fair.

178
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,650
But my investigation of the household

179
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,280
revealed Anzi wasn't the mastermind,

180
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:15,250
just an accomplice.

181
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,460
(Upright and Fair)

182
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,890
Based on what you've said,

183
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:23,770
who's the mastermind?

184
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,890
It's no one else

185
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,050
but my wife,

186
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,760
Jiang Qian.

187
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,560
Stop barking.

188
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,940
(Warrant for Apprehension)

189
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,840
Did Cao Xingyu

190
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,410
- sue Qian in court?
- Yes.

191
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,840
He testified against Jiang Qian

192
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:54,090
as the mastermind of the murder.

193
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,000
Miss.

194
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Qian, Qian.

195
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,000
The villains sue first.

196
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
How outrageous!

197
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,880
Mrs. Cao,

198
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,450
please come with us.

199
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,720
Si was right.

200
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,000
I should have listened to her

201
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,290
and testified against Cao Xingyu.

202
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,810
Mother, what should I do?

203
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:08,650
Qian, don't be afraid.

204
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,290
- Don't go. You mustn't go.
- Take her away!

205
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,290
What are you doing?

206
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:12,290
- Miss!
- Stop it!

207
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,130
- Miss!
- Qian!

208
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,040
Go find Jiang Si.

209
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,090
She's the only one who can help me.

210
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:15,930
Mother!

211
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,240
Let go!

212
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,780
(Capital Security Office)

213
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,290
It's time for you

214
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,690
to confess.

215
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:27,170
You had an affair with Anzi.

216
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:28,760
Seeing him get close

217
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,880
to those women,

218
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,170
you became jealous.

219
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,930
So you ordered him

220
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:34,290
to torture and kill them.

221
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:35,880
What a family disgrace!

222
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,210
You're lying.

223
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,250
I didn't!

224
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:39,840
I had never seen

225
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,760
those women.

226
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,240
How could I possibly kill them?

227
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,290
Your Honor, please discern the truth.

228
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,840
Like the victims,

229
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,330
I endured Cao Xingyu's daily beatings,

230
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,720
but I was too terrified to testify.

231
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,210
I never thought

232
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,570
he would frame me instead.

233
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:58,090
Your Honor, have her injuries examined.

234
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:59,450
They match

235
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:01,170
the victims' injuries exactly.

236
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:02,530
But I have proof

237
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,290
that this wicked woman

238
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,960
had an affair with Anzi

239
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:08,720
and ordered him to kill the victims.

240
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,090
This is the button

241
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:16,000
Jiang Qian left at Anzi's place.

242
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,810
And this is the signed testimony

243
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:22,450
from Anzi's wife,

244
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,170
who witnessed their affair

245
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:26,290
and murder plot.

246
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:27,650
Present it.

247
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,090
He's framing me.

248
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,810
He grabbed a random button,

249
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,450
threatened Anzi's family,

250
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:35,970
and extorted false testimony,

251
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,810
all to frame me, Your Honor.

252
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:38,800
I saw Anzi

253
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,840
burying the bodies that night.

254
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:41,000
Also, my sister

255
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,840
was sleeping

256
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,240
in her room at that time.

257
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,880
How could she be the mastermind?

258
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,120
So it was you who reported it.

259
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,130
Your Honor,

260
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,760
they're real sisters.

261
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:53,570
They must have feared exposure,

262
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:55,640
so they pinned

263
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,880
the case on me.

264
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,570
Your Honor, you must see through this!

265
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,220
(Jiang Qian had an affair with Anzi.)

266
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:07,930
Bring the witness.

267
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,840
Summon the witness.

268
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,760
Your Honor, the witness is here.

269
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:19,530
State your name.

270
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:22,330
Your Honor, I'm Chi Shuying.

271
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,480
I'm asking you,

272
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,360
do you know the Jiang sisters?

273
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,720
I have nothing to do

274
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,960
with them.

275
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,480
Then do you know

276
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:36,650
Cao Xingyu?

277
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,760
Your Honor,

278
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,170
I know him.

279
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,960
I was lured by this scoundrel

280
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,640
to Marquis Changxing's Mansion,

281
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,000
imprisoned in the western yard,

282
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,760
and suffered daily abuse and humiliation.

283
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,960
I...

284
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:48,690
I saw this beast kill someone.

285
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:49,810
You liar!

286
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,150
Come back!

287
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,400
Your Honor, she seduced me,

288
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,720
asking me to abandon my wife and marry her.

289
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,720
I refused, so she turned on me.

290
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,760
Your Honor, my injuries

291
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,840
are proof of that.

292
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,880
Miss Chi,

293
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:11,210
you said you saw Cao Xingyu kill someone.

294
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:14,170
What weapon did he use?

295
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:15,650
Your Honor,

296
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:17,050
a horsewhip.

297
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:19,810
Run! Dare you still run?

298
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,960
Is it exciting?

299
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:23,970
She's only saying this

300
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:25,600
to frame me.

301
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,290
Don't believe her.

302
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,930
I will try this case

303
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:31,050
with impartiality and rigor.

304
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:33,290
Do you know

305
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,880
where the weapon is?

306
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,760
It's in Marquis Changxing's Mansion.

307
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,600
Miss Chi!

308
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,120
Think twice about what you say.

309
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,640
I'm the heir to Marquis Changxing.

310
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:46,760
How dare you slander me with baseless claims?

311
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:48,960
Regardless of your status,

312
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,330
you are not permitted

313
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,050
to act insolently in this court.

314
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,360
Miss Chi,

315
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:56,930
don't be afraid.

316
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,960
Proceed.

317
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,600
Everything I've said is true.

318
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,240
The murder weapon is in the mansion...

319
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,240
Shut up!

320
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:04,290
Miss Chi!

321
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,570
Miss Chi!

322
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,240
Long Dan!

323
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,930
Mr. Yu!

324
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,840
Are you alright?

325
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,810
- Let go of me!
- Get up.

326
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,120
- Let go.
- Cao Xingyu,

327
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,410
you've got some nerve!

328
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,840
How dare you

329
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,240
attack the witness in my court?

330
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:33,480
Take him away!

331
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,880
I am the heir to Marquis Changxing.

332
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,090
You dare lay a finger on me?

333
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:36,960
Long Dan!

334
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:39,840
Take him to prison to await sentencing.

335
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,170
- Yes, sir!
- Let go of me!

336
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:43,770
Mr. Yu.

337
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,290
Get a doctor.

338
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:50,410
Mr. Yu, are you alright?

339
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:52,050
Yes.

340
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:01,810
Mr. Yu!

341
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,080
Doctor,

342
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:08,210
how is he?

343
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,840
Fortunately, the treatment was timely.

344
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,000
A moment later,

345
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,450
even a miracle doctor

346
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:14,760
couldn't have reversed this.

347
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,970
Now, most of the toxin

348
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:18,410
has been purged from his body.

349
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,480
That's good.

350
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:22,010
Thanks, doctor.

351
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,450
But he can't be left unattended tonight.

352
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:25,480
Call me

353
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,480
at any sign of change.

354
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,290
You come with me to the pharmacy

355
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,930
to fetch antidote brews.

356
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,970
Miss Jiang, would you...

357
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:35,810
Don't worry.

358
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:36,840
I'll stay

359
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,810
and take care of him.

360
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:44,810
Come on.

361
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:06,640
(You think I'm the Saintness,)

362
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,840
(but instead of killing me,)

363
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,410
(you risked your life to save me.)

364
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:21,570
You're awake.

365
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:27,240
Thank you for taking care of me.

366
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:31,120
You were injured because of me.

367
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,450
If I don't even take care of you,

368
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:36,000
I'd never live with myself.

369
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:39,240
These minor injuries

370
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,570
are part of the job for me.

371
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:44,640
Please don't trouble yourself over it.

372
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,210
This is no mere injury.

373
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,840
The doctor just said

374
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:49,330
if we had been a moment later,

375
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,760
we would be

376
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,120
holding your funeral now.

377
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,480
Mr. Yu,

378
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,120
I'm neither kin nor ally to you.

379
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:03,090
Why did you risk your life for me?

380
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,120
I didn't realize

381
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,880
the arrow was poisoned.

382
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:16,330
Miss Chi is also a stranger

383
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:17,760
you met by chance.

384
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,450
Didn't you risk your life for her?

385
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,600
Yes.

386
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,090
Who would have thought it was poisoned?

387
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,090
I'll get you some water.

388
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,000
Miss, I'll do it.

389
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,090
Aman, let me do it.

390
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,170
Miss Jiang.

391
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,210
Mr. Zhen.

392
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:40,480
Allow me

393
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,640
to do it.

394
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,320
Ok.

395
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:47,120
What should we do?

396
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,000
What can we do?

397
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,640
Cao Xingyu is only imprisoned.

398
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:54,050
His father will pull every string

399
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,690
to exonerate him.

400
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:57,690
If he is freed,

401
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,720
our Qian

402
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,360
will be thrown to the wolves again!

403
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,600
Master, you must act now!

404
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,000
Master!

405
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,640
Mother.

406
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:07,570
Mother.

407
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:10,330
Mother, do something!

408
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:12,210
Qian is the granddaughter you've cradled

409
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:13,570
in your palms since her first breath.

410
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,000
How can you stand idle

411
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,840
and watch her walk to her death, Mother?

412
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,160
Anmou,

413
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:24,700
find a way.

414
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,120
See if there's anyone reliable in the court

415
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:28,810
we can turn to.

416
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,530
Mother,

417
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,730
Qian

418
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,560
is the daughter I'm most proud of.

419
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,920
How can I leave her alone?

420
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,840
I went to visit them today,

421
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:43,250
but they all refused to see me.

422
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:44,890
I'm afraid they're too intimidated

423
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:46,680
by Marquis Changxing's influence to help.

424
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,050
But Mother,

425
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:50,010
there will be a turning point.

426
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,810
Attend to Mother so that she can rest.

427
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:54,970
I'll take my leave.

428
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:56,730
Master.

429
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,160
Master.

430
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,530
Master, don't leave.

431
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,490
Don't leave.

432
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,560
Mr. Yu.

433
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:15,290
Mr. Yu,

434
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,640
drink some water.

435
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,090
Your hands are hurt.

436
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:22,290
I'll feed you.

437
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,250
My left hand is fine.

438
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:27,600
Mr. Zhen,

439
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,330
please put the cup next to me.

440
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:37,210
So,

441
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:38,570
how do you feel?

442
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,530
I don't feel anything now.

443
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,210
Have you found the evidence?

444
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,250
All seized.

445
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,200
Whenever I handle a case like this,

446
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:01,010
I realize

447
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,340
it's unimaginable

448
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,140
how evil human nature is.

449
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,380
I've handled

450
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,820
so many cases,

451
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,980
but I still

452
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,460
can't get used to it.

453
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,580
It is precisely

454
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,620
your compassionate heart

455
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:18,860
that drives

456
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:19,860
your impartial justice.

457
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,940
No innocent

458
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,460
suffers unjustly.

459
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,100
No guilty

460
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,180
escapes unpunished.

461
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,700
What you strive for

462
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,900
is a conscience that remains clear.

463
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,380
Miss Jiang.

464
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,780
That's why the people

465
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,820
need the Capital Security Office, Mr. Zhen,

466
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,980
especially you.

467
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,500
While the law cannot inspire goodness

468
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,860
in people's hearts,

469
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,700
it can deter them

470
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,220
from acting

471
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:48,900
on evil intentions,

472
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,900
pulling them back from the brink.

473
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,820
Mr. Yu has a point.

474
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,380
Miss Jiang.

475
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,660
But it doesn't work

476
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,180
for some people.

477
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,820
Because they're not human beings.

478
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,940
They're animals.

479
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,940
Mr. Yu, don't worry.

480
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,860
The evidence won't get away,

481
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,820
nor will Cao Xingyu.

482
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,620
But, Mr. Zhen,

483
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:16,980
we still need a backup plan.

484
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,140
Marquis Changxing

485
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,060
won't sit idle

486
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,260
during his son's trial.

487
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,460
He'll spare no effort

488
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,420
to lobby the court,

489
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,580
using every means

490
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,500
to pressure you.

491
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,660
Miss Jiang, I truly

492
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,980
admire your insights.

493
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,260
But please

494
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,620
rest assured.

495
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,460
No matter who

496
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,900
tries to pressure us,

497
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,340
we will never yield.

498
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:44,700
I can assure you of that.

499
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,060
He

500
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,580
is as stubborn as a mule.

501
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,340
Look,

502
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,740
his wounds seem to be almost healed.

503
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,660
Thanks for your compliment.

504
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,900
How about this?

505
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,220
Today,

506
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,620
I will look after Mr. Yu.

507
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,500
You were frightened during the day.

508
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:03,980
Head back and get some rest.

509
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,300
Long Dan went with the doctor

510
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,620
to fetch the medicine just now.

511
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,660
He should be back soon.

512
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,060
I'd better stay here

513
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,340
to brew Mr. Yu's herbal dose.

514
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,180
No, no, no.

515
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,940
It's not a big deal.

516
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:14,940
Let Long Dan do it,

517
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,500
or I'll do it.

518
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:19,420
Miss Jiang should stay here.

519
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,780
I've assigned Long Dan

520
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,940
to other duties.

521
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,140
Capital Security duties.

522
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:35,140
How about I dispatch two constables?

523
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,340
How can we let Miss Jiang

524
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,980
take on such a grueling night shift?

525
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,220
Since when did you learn

526
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,700
to cherish the fairer sex?

527
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,700
Thank you, Mr. Zhen.

528
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,380
Mr. Yu, focus on your recovery.

529
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,500
I'll return to visit you tomorrow.

530
00:21:58,980 --> 00:21:59,820
Miss Jiang,

531
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,380
I'll walk you out.

532
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:02,860
Ok.

533
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,220
Please stay here, Mr. Zhen.

534
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,940
You have to take care of Mr. Yu.

535
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:28,860
Mr. Yu.

536
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,220
Mr. Yu.

537
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,220
Don't you find

538
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:34,940
Miss Jiang

539
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,380
truly unlike

540
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,820
conventional ladies?

541
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,100
Her radiant composure

542
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,340
while arguing the case in court

543
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,980
was striking.

544
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,540
Also, she shows such loyalty

545
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:46,140
and affection to her benefactor.

546
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:48,700
Mr. Yu.

547
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:50,940
Mr. Yu,

548
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,820
did you hear what I said?

549
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,620
If

550
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:01,420
I had saved her from this arrow...

551
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,340
- Then...
- Then we'll feast at your banquet.

552
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,580
Banquet?

553
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,340
If there's a banquet,

554
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,140
it would be great.

555
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,260
The Cao Family is unbelievable.

556
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,260
Poor Qian's fate is so bitter.

557
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:27,940
Shu,

558
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,180
all my children

559
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:31,900
are dear to me.

560
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,980
(Concubine Ruan)
Qian is my daughter.

561
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,940
I love her just as much.

562
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,660
Don't take it to heart.

563
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,940
I never thought

564
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,820
things would

565
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,180
turn out this way.

566
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,900
I thought we should

567
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,620
just put up with it,

568
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,540
not expecting that wretch

569
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,620
to twist it against us.

570
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:53,780
Even though

571
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,380
he's jailed now,

572
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:58,140
we can't do anything about him.

573
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:01,060
Should his father secure his release,

574
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,580
Qian will

575
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,140
suffer in the future.

576
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,900
Even if that monster is released,

577
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,580
as long as Qian stays away from him

578
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,500
and you, me, Qiao, and Pei

579
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,540
remain together as a family,

580
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,820
nothing else matters.

581
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:20,380
Master, he hasn't been released yet.

582
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,220
We should believe that the wicked

583
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,740
will get what's coming to them.

584
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,100
Good point.

585
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:27,700
Shu,

586
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,900
in this family,

587
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:31,940
you're the only one

588
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,380
who can give me peace of mind.

589
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,180
You and your daughter

590
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,100
massacred my entire family,

591
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:02,900
(The South)
drove me from Dazhou,

592
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,620
then tracked me down to the South.

593
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,860
Tonight is my wedding night.

594
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,380
You are the Grand Princess,

595
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,940
but just because your daughter

596
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,700
covets my husband, you're making me

597
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,820
write a letter of severance

598
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,620
and jump off this cliff.

599
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,260
Your relentless hunt

600
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:22,220
will drown you in retribution!

601
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,420
It's Yu Qi's honor

602
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,260
to earn my daughter's favor.

603
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,620
Whoever my daughter desires,

604
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,420
I will ensure she gets him.

605
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:34,980
Jiang Si,

606
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,020
do you truly believe

607
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:36,880
that a man in this world

608
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:38,220
will only love you alone?

609
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,860
Write the letter,

610
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,260
and Yu Qi's heart

611
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,420
will stray from you.

612
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,340
His marriage to Mingyue

613
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,220
is only a matter of time.

614
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,820
You can forget about it.

615
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,660
I'll never write it.

616
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,380
Someone!

617
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:04,940
Darling!

618
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,260
Darling!

619
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,860
What did you do to him?

620
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:10,900
Let go of me!

621
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,740
Don't hurt him!

622
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,180
My next move

623
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,940
depends entirely on your choice.

624
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,100
As things stand now,

625
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,580
you can only write the letter

626
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,820
and leap from this cliff.

627
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,900
Then I'll spare his life.

628
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,740
Otherwise,

629
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,460
I can take Yu Qi's life

630
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,740
anytime, anywhere.

631
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,740
Stop it!

632
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,420
Stop it!

633
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:08,020
(Yu Qi, through our days together...)

634
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,180
Yu Qi,

635
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,500
through our days together,

636
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,900
I'm sorry for withholding my true heart.

637
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,420
When we first met,

638
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:20,620
adrift in this lonely place,

639
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,940
I clung to you for refuge.

640
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,620
But now I see clearly,

641
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,580
there was never love in my heart.

642
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,980
Thank you for your care and protection.

643
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,860
Do not seek me.

644
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,180
Let's

645
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,900
go our separate ways.

(like that?)

667
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:05,980
Miss, your perilla drink is ready.

668
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,620
Miss?

669
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,580
Miss,

670
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,620
are you worried about Mr. Yu?

671
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,140
Didn't you say

672
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,500
he was fine

673
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,420
and he'd recover soon?

674
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:26,140
Is it the so-called "care breeds confusion"?

675
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,100
Aman,

676
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,660
let me ask you something.

677
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:38,180
If you have feelings for someone

678
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,100
but know

679
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,980
it might

680
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,500
not end well

681
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,740
because of misunderstandings

682
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:54,900
or else...

683
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:01,500
Anyway, it might not end well.

684
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:04,980
Would you still

685
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:07,980
choose to be with him?

686
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:11,940
Only if

687
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,660
I'm the one he loves.

688
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:17,900
What if he loves you?

689
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:19,780
Miss,

690
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,660
did Mr. Yu express his feelings for you?

691
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,900
I'm just asking.

692
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,260
I'll take it as me.

693
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,660
If it were me,

694
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,380
I would be with him.

695
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,060
In this fleeting life,

696
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,900
mutual affection is a rarity.

697
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,140
There are so many things

698
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,140
in this world

699
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,340
that we have to worry about.

700
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,060
If we even have to

701
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,620
worry about this,

702
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,020
I'm afraid there won't be

703
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,860
anything joyful in our lives.

704
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,500
How did Xingyu

705
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,860
end up in jail?

706
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,260
Didn't you take care of everything?

707
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,340
A witness came out of nowhere.

708
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,260
How come?

709
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,300
Is it...

710
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,900
Don't worry about that.

711
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,420
Doesn't the Capital Security want to dig?

712
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,140
I'll silence the witness.

713
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,060
Let's see how they proceed.

714
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,220
When will Xingyu get out?

715
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,340
He can't eat

716
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,980
or sleep well in jail.

717
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:32,860
He must be suffering.

718
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:33,900
Enough!

719
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,180
Womanly weakness.

720
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,860
Where is the Golden and Jade

721
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,860
I brought you

722
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:46,940
from Lingnan?

723
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:05,380
- Mr. Wu.
- Mr. Wu.

724
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,660
- Hello, Mr. Wu.
- You've been working hard.

725
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:07,780
Grab a bite.

726
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,660
Thanks, Mr. Wu.

727
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:09,940
Eat while it's hot.

728
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,420
Help yourselves.

729
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,380
- I'll get in first.
- Ok.

730
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:15,940
Thanks.

731
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,180
Miss Chi, I've brought you food.

732
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,260
Thank you, sir.

733
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,540
You must be starving.

734
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,420
Have some food.

735
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,660
Chief predicted it accurately.

736
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:02,460
You are the mole within the Capital Security.

737
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:28,420
(Morning Drizzle)

738
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,540
Si.

739
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,660
- Zhan.
- Where are you going?

740
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,140
I'm going to see

741
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,300
how Mr. Yu is recovering.

742
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,140
Good timing.

743
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,340
I'm also going to see

744
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,340
how he is recovering.

745
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,220
Let's go together.

746
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,140
Ok, let's go.

747
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,060
Sir,

748
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:49,340
didn't we just visit Mr. Yu?

749
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,220
How could I leave my sister

750
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,900
alone with him?

751
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,380
Besides,

752
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,940
can't you smell how good the broth

753
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,900
she is holding?

754
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:09,460
Mr. Yu.

755
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:10,540
Mr. Yu,

756
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:12,420
this is the broth my sister made for you.

757
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,860
Come on, try it.

758
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:14,700
Thank you.

759
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:18,980
Good.

760
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:27,660
Broth shares the same spirit as wine,

761
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,580
better shared than taken alone.

762
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:32,180
Mr. Jiang, would you take the first sip?

763
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,060
No, no, no.

764
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:35,540
It's cooked specifically for your recovery.

765
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,180
- It's ok.
- How could I share it?

766
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:40,060
- Get me a bowl.
- But sharing this broth

767
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,880
carries its own meaning.

768
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,300
Mr. Yu, we have one more bowl.

769
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,500
Look, there is.

770
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,540
I'll help myself then.

771
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,380
Go ahead.

772
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:56,540
I've never had

773
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:58,740
such a savory fish broth,

774
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,220
not a hint

775
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,140
of that fishy aftertaste.

776
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,020
Mr. Yu, I don't mean to boast

777
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:03,940
of my own sister,

778
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,260
but this broth's

779
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,260
layered flavors

780
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:08,020
show real care.

781
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,260
And my sister is thoughtful.

782
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,980
Knowing your injury

783
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:11,860
can't handle spice,

784
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,340
she deliberately skipped the pepper.

785
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,380
If...

786
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:15,860
Do you have pepper?

787
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,180
Come on.

788
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,740
- Mr. Yu.
- Thank you.

789
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,460
I didn't expect that Miss Jiang

790
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,100
has put so much thought into it.

791
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,700
I can't thank you enough

792
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,980
- but
- No need for marriage proposals.

793
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,660
repay you with more

794
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,380
exquisite dishes.

795
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,060
Eat it while it's hot.

796
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:55,980
Take it easy.

797
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:56,860
Don't choke on it.

798
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,580
You've suffered

799
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,660
because of me.

800
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,140
When we

801
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,060
get a chance

802
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,100
to return to Ling'an,

803
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,820
I'll make you all sorts of delicacies.

804
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:10,900
Tell me

805
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:11,820
what you'll make for me

806
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,060
so I can imagine.

807
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,660
Listen to this.

808
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,740
Start by sourcing fresh crucian carp

809
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,820
from Jinshui River.

810
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,620
Coat the fish

811
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,060
with egg white and rice wine

812
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:22,940
to marinate,

813
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,060
then pan-fry it in a heated wok

814
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,100
until golden on both sides.

815
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:29,300
Add ginger,

816
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,660
dried tangerine peel, and other aromatics,

817
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,980
simmering over low heat for two hours.

818
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,980
You'll get tender flesh

819
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,180
with crisp skin

820
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:38,100
and a creamy white broth.

821
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:42,980
Miss Jiang.

822
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,100
Miss Jiang.

823
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:52,220
My hands are still a bit clumsy.

824
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,100
My pleasure.

825
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:56,780
Thanks.

It was Nie Yinniang's dagger once.

845
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,540
Have a look.

846
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,660
Genuine article, fair price. No tricks.

847
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,980
You can trust me.

848
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,180
I do have good taste.

849
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:27,220
Sir, did it

850
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,660
really belong to the famous female assassin?

851
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,380
Sir, are you also interested in it?

852
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,380
Miss, he...

853
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,540
It's you.

854
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:37,820
It's you.

855
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:38,940
I was wondering

856
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,020
how could anyone believe

857
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,620
it was Nie Yinniang's dagger.

858
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,140
You're snatching what I claimed,

859
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:44,340
just to spite me.

860
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:45,820
Sir,

861
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,540
- I saw this dagger first.
- Yes.

862
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,620
How much? I'll take it.

863
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,060
50 taels of silver. Fair price.

864
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,340
I'll pay you 60.

865
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,700
- 60 is good.
- 70.

866
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,060
- Miss.
- 100 for this,

867
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,060
and I'll take more items!

868
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:57,660
Then you...

869
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,140
Could you tell me about this?

870
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,800
Sir, you've got a sharp eye.

871
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,140
This is the legendary Twelve Hours Dial

872
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,420
from the Tang Dynasty's palace treasury.

873
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,740
Observe how each hour

874
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:07,780
corresponds to a zodiac animal.

875
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,380
Twelve Hours Dial, right?

876
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,920
Exactly, the sole surviving piece.

877
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:12,900
Would you

878
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,020
count the hours for me?

879
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:15,900
You don't have to.

880
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,380
It's just used to check the time,

881
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,220
isn't it?

882
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:19,320
Sir.

883
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,180
11.

884
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:22,180
So, this is...

885
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:27,940
There is more!

886
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,660
Sir, is this...

887
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,140
It's the last stone left

888
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,620
when Nuwa

889
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:35,020
mended the sky.

890
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,180
Yeah.

891
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,220
What do you think of this stone?

892
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:41,820
Why do I have a feeling

893
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:42,980
that he is a fraud?

894
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,060
You just realized that?

895
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:46,740
He is a fraud, indeed.

896
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:47,680
What's wrong?

897
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,050
After looking for so long, at least buy one!

898
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:50,180
Is Nie Yinniang's dagger also a fake?

899
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,060
How could there be a dagger

900
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,300
used by Nie Yinniang?

901
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,180
You're pretty good.

902
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:57,300
You can tell it's fake.

903
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,900
Everyone on the street knows it

904
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:00,740
except you.

905
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:04,580
To thank you for your help,

906
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:06,180
I'm returning this to you.

907
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,020
Really?

908
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:09,500
Then you...

909
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:11,620
I've made some money,

910
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:12,740
so I'll pay you back first.

911
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,500
My precious money is back.

912
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,660
Come on, I'll treat you to a meal.

913
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,740
Great!

914
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:23,260
(Guangju Restaurant)
- Great! - Great!

915
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:32,780
I don't have enough money

916
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,700
to feed you alone.

917
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:41,220
My precious money!

918
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,380
You have some too.

919
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:46,860
Try this.

920
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:53,660
- Splendid!
- Bravo!

921
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,780
- Good!
- Perfect!

922
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,700
Today's tales of the extraordinary

923
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,540
turn our gaze to the ill-omened soul,

924
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:03,020
the 7th Prince.

925
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,180
Do you still recall the chaos

926
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:07,660
that gripped our borders two decades ago?

927
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:10,180
At a moonless, windswept night,

928
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:12,060
Nanwu raiders launched a large-scale attack

929
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,660
on Dazhou without any warning.

930
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:15,880
Our troops were caught off guard

931
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,980
and slaughtered.

932
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,740
Yet at the same night,

933
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:21,660
the 7th Prince

934
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,330
was born.

935
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,740
What jubilation echoed through the palace!

936
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,900
However, when the bitter news

937
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,580
of defeat reached Ling'an,

938
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:32,900
everything

939
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:36,260
changed.

940
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,460
What happened to the prince again?

941
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,540
Stop, or Nanwu people will take you away.

942
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,580
As storm clouds gathered,

943
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:47,020
the Directorate of Astronomy stated

944
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:49,860
that the 7th Prince was a jinx

945
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:51,140
and his birth

946
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:53,180
unleashed the border warfare.

947
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,180
Late at night,

948
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:58,420
ministers knelt and refused to get up,

949
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:01,620
pleading with the Emperor to eliminate

950
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:05,020
the prince for his country.

951
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,820
Wasn't he just born?

952
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,260
In the end,

953
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,540
the Emperor relented.

954
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:12,100
He dispatched the swaddled 7th Prince

955
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,540
to the southern borderlands.

956
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:15,060
Should he live, let fate decide.

957
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:15,900
Should he die,

958
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:17,900
consider it solace for the fallen warriors.

959
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:20,660
Thus were the grumbling masses appeased.

960
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:23,620
But mark this!

961
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,220
From then on,

962
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:28,140
Dazhou has never won another victory,

963
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:30,700
and has ceded territory after territory,

964
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,460
all because

965
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:33,860
the ill-omened 7th Prince

966
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:36,140
remained in the ranks.

967
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:38,900
- Yes.
- Exactly.

968
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:39,940
- Exactly.
- That's right.

969
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:42,540
This unlucky 7th Prince...

970
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:44,140
Who is it?

971
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,340
What's going on?

972
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:46,660
- Who is it?
- Who?

973
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,720
- What are you doing?
- Any manners?

974
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:50,380
How dare you spout baseless lies?

975
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,660
I'll shut your filthy mouth for good!

976
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:53,380
Spare me! I'm just scraping by!

977
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:54,220
Chuchu?

978
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:55,980
Long Dan?

979
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:57,270
What's your problem?

980
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:00,910
We were listening just fine!

981
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:01,820
Exactly.

982
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:04,900
