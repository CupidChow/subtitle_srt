(Earl Dongping's Mansion)

12
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,160
Your Highness.

13
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,080
Greetings, sir.

14
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,560
Under your leadership, Capital Security has

15
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,080
solved difficult cases and upheld justice.

16
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,800
You're one of a kind,

17
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,120
with unmatched talent.

18
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,920
That's very nice of you to say.

19
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,840
With all due respect,

20
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,880
I can't let Si

21
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,200
marry you.

22
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,480
Sir,

23
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,680
did I do

24
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,880
anything wrong?

25
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,000
Please enlighten me.

26
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,320
Your Highness,

27
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,600
you're a prince.

28
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,920
Ever since you were born,

29
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,920
you've been involved

30
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,440
in power struggle.

31
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,240
If Si married you,

32
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,480
she'd never be safe.

33
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,640
Sir,

34
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,720
I promise to do my utmost

35
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,280
to protect her

36
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,760
and lead a peaceful life with her.

37
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,640
I fear

38
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,000
it'll turn out the opposite.

39
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,720
You won't have a choice.

40
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:04,420
(Haitang Chamber)

41
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,800
(Qi)
Do you truly like Prince Yan?

42
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,440
I admire him.

43
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,160
I hate to upset you,

44
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,080
but I've been in love, too.

45
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,800
Here's my advice.

46
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,800
As a prince

47
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,240
of the imperial family,

48
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,040
even if you two managed to

49
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,030
hurdle the first barrier,

50
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,590
and you were married into his mansion,

51
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,720
no one could guarantee you'd live

52
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,680
happily ever after.

53
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,640
Don't worry about me.

54
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,200
I'll take good care of myself.

55
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,260
(Qi)

56
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,120
Look at it.

57
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,880
I'm simply curious.

58
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,160
Why do you

59
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,640
desire to be a heroine?

60
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,280
I grew up in the army.

61
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,200
I was surrounded by men.

62
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,240
I heard all kinds of stories

63
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,440
of heroes in my childhood.

64
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,800
They made me wonder

65
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,480
why the heroes

66
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,800
in those stories

67
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,920
were always men

68
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,560
while women

69
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,320
could only wait for their help.

70
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,920
I found that unfair.

71
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,240
Who says

72
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,080
women can't be heroes?

73
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,880
If men can be heroes,

74
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,840
so can I, Lu Chuchu.

75
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,560
I see.

76
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,280
You're quite special.

77
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,760
It seems

78
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,020
that nothing can stop you

79
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,120
from doing what you want.

80
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,000
You only follow your heart.

81
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,400
Jiang Zhan,

82
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,360
thanks for your compliment.

83
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,160
My sister is the same.

84
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,800
Both of you have big hearts.

85
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,720
It should be

86
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,240
these people.

87
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,680
The eclipse had been

88
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,520
predicted and recorded.

89
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,840
Read this.

90
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,280
It says the next day,

91
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,160
they overturned

92
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,320
all the previous predictions.

93
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,840
No wonder Supervisor Yang Nianzhi

94
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,360
didn't receive any predictions
of the eclipse.

95
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,520
Thankfully, we found
the Nightingale's secret letters.

96
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,040
Otherwise, even if the eclipse were true,

97
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,720
they'd be guilty of negligence at most.

98
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,840
We can't wait.

99
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,440
I'll put together the evidence

100
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,560
and present it to His Majesty

101
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,400
tomorrow morning.

102
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,680
Appreciated.

00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,860

109
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,000
Your Majesty,

110
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,600
I'm also shocked

111
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,480
by the number of those of Astronomy

112
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,480
involved in this case.

113
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,190
Head of Spring Office, Zhang Qi,

114
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,200
Register Wei Yuan,

115
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,960
and Observer Li Chujiang

116
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,240
were all involved in the Hunt Case.

117
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,000
To think the Nightingale

118
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,720
has gone so deep in our state for so long.

119
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,360
It's appalling!

120
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,720
Astronomy failed in their duties.

121
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,560
First, they made me send away my son

122
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,760
based on their observation of the sky.

123
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,560
Then they failed to predict the eclipse

124
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,440
followed by an assassination.

125
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,040
All of them are dismissed.

126
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,160
Yang Nianzhi failed as the Supervisor.

127
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,550
He'll lose two years' pay.

128
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,840
With so many vacancies,

129
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,760
I fear

130
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,600
the wicked will rise to power.

131
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,840
I'd like to recommend someone,

132
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,680
Earl Dongping, Jiang Ancheng.

133
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,500
(Capital Security Office)

134
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,960
Are you making a kite?

135
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,240
Yes.

136
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,200
It's much easier to buy one.

137
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,720
Handcraft is a lot of work.

138
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,520
This one is different

139
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,520
from those for sale.

140
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,560
I'm making it for a...

141
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,000
a girl

142
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,840
in particular.

143
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,840
Wait, what? For whom?

144
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,880
A girl?

145
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,000
Here's the thing.

146
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,400
A few days ago,

147
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,290
I mistook a girl for someone else,

148
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,800
causing her some trouble.

149
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,280
I'm making this kite

150
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,360
for her

151
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,320
as an apology.

152
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,560
That's it?

153
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,880
Yes.

154
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,400
Good.

155
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,960
Commandant Yu.

156
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,280
What are you here for?

157
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,040
Nothing serious.

158
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,640
His Majesty means to
promote Earl Dongping, right?

159
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,080
I think it's better to

160
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,680
keep this news

161
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,680
from his family.

162
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,680
Do you mean

163
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,400
to keep it from Miss Si?

164
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,240
She might get worried.

165
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,680
I see.

166
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,320
Protect Earl Dongping

167
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,840
from political struggle, huh?

168
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,640
Rest assured.

169
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,840
I won't tell anyone.

170
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,480
Your Highness,

171
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,680
Mr. Zhen had me

172
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,880
bring you this kite.

173
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,840
He said

174
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,320
the bamboo flute on it

175
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,520
would sound like this...

176
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,320
in the wind.

177
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,160

178
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,160
Yes.

179
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,360
We'll fly it for you now.

180
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,550
Hold on, Your Highness.

181
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,640

I know about

187
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,960
a kite that sounds.

188
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,240
Even if you can't see it,

Is there really such a thing?

There is.

When I come to the Palace next time,

194
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,720
I'll bring it to you.

195
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,680
Thank you, Mr. Zhen.

211
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,640
Has Fuqing gone to bed

212
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,200
this early?

213
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,640
Yes.

214
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,040
She flew a kite in the morning.

215
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,920
Maybe she was tired.

216
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,280
She went to bed

217
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,520
just after the Xu hour.

218
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,000
(Ms. Hua, Empress Di)

219
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Why did she suddenly want to fly kites?

220
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,280
She had never done that before.

221
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,040
That kite seemed to be

222
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,760
a gift from Mr. Zhen

223
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,800
of Capital Security.

224
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,320
Her Highness really liked it.

225
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,000
Also,

226
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,600
a bamboo flute

227
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,920
was added to it

228
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,040
that would sound in the wind.

229
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,480
It was unique

230
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,240
and different from those for sale.

231
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,320
I think

232
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,240
it was handmade by Mr. Zhen.

233
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,360
Zhen Heng?

234
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,160
His Majesty

235
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,080
always speaks highly of him,

236
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,480
saying he's erudite, upright,

237
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,720
and devoted.

238
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,440
How did he and Fuqing meet?

239
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,760
A while ago,

240
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,120
the two of them took shelter

241
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,720
from the rain under the same eave.

242
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,320
Really?

243
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,680
What are the odds?

244
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,720
I agree.

245
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,840
Your Highness,

246
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,000
it's said that His Majesty

247
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,840
will hold a blossom-viewing banquet

248
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,840
for Prince Shu

249
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,160
and Prince Yan

250
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,320
to select their wives.

251
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,800
Actually,

252
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,520
Princess Fuqing

253
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,960
has reached the age of marriage as well.

254
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,280
His Majesty has mentioned it a few times,

255
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,560
but you know Fuqing's eyes.

256
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,840
I wonder if her husband

257
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,560
will treat her well.

258
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,040
I hope

259
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,440
she'll marry someone she loves

260
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,080
who'll cherish her.

261
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,240
Mr. Zhen seems to be

262
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,960
a good choice.

263
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,280
Greetings, Father.

264
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,520
Jin,

265
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,760
how are you settling into your mansion?

266
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,360
Thanks for choosing the best for me, Father.

267
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:27,450
Very well.

268
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,080
Now, all you need is a wife.

269
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,960
Ask Consort Xian to come over.

270
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,680
Your mother can help you choose.

271
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,160
You're old enough

272
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,040
to get married.

273
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,000
Does my marriage

274
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,800
have to be decided by my mother?

275
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,840
Those in the South can marry

276
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,200
as long as they love each other.

277
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,960
As Prince Yan,

278
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,960
you have to abide by the rules.

279
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,080
Things here are different from the South.

280
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,000
Or are you

281
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,320
already in love with someone?

282
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,400
That's fine.

283
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,280
Invite her to the banquet.

284
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,080
On that occasion,

285
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,080
noble girls will be there for selection.

286
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,160
The late Empress and I

287
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,000
were engaged like that

288
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,240
years back.

289
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,320
Yes.

290
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,720
Thank you, Father.

291
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:20,960
Besides,

292
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,400
Prince Shu is older than you,

293
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,080
yet he's also single.

294
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,040
Consort Zhuang has urged me several times.

295
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,880
Pass my order

296
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,520
to her and Consort Xian

297
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,560
to set up the banquet.

298
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,840
Yes.

299
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,320
Jin,

300
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,000
what's that in your hand?

301
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,160
Please, Eunuch Liu.

302
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,760
It's Soothing Incense for you, Father.

303
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,640
Good day, Father.

304
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:58,060
(Fast and Persistent)

305
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,840
A few days ago,

306
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,560
I told Prince Yan

307
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,240
your head hurt again.

308
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,040
You couldn't sleep well.

309
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,960
Big mouth.

310
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,280
Sorry.

311
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,500
(Fragrance Shop)

312
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,720
Lately, I've been occupied, Yi,

313
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,480
while our business has been booming.

314
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,150
I have so much on my plate right now,

315
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,560
so I could really

316
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,960
use your help.

317
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,760
You've already had Chuchu

318
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,010
and Rou'er to help run the shop,

319
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,280
and they've been doing so well.

320
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,640
I can't do business.

321
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,640
What if I ruin it?

322
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,840
You won't.

323
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,320
Ms. Yi, if you don't mind,

324
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,840
feel free to ask me about management.

325
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,080
I'll tell you everything I know.

326
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,560
Yes, that's right.

327
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,160
The more help, the better.

328
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,120
I look forward to working with you.

329
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,320
Thanks for the offer, Si.

330
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,840
Once you have a career

331
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:54,920
and feel fulfilled,

332
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,640
you won't have time to get upset.

333
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,860
(Prepare)

334
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,040
It's late.

335
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,240
(Spring Plowing)
Your head still hurts.

336
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,440
You should rest, Your Majesty.

337
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,160
Jin's incense is quite soothing.

338
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,880
I'm feeling much better.

339
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,840
Few can be as filial as Prince Yan.

340
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,800
He's pure-hearted as well.

341
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,560
He might be too pure,

342
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,160
which worries me.

343
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,040
He said he just wanted to

344
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,680
marry a girl he loves.

345
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,040
But a prince's marriage

346
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,200
isn't that easy.

347
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,120
Even I couldn't

348
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,560
just be with someone I loved.

349
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,640
Your Majesty,

350
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,760
Physician Han's here with your medicine.

351
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,360
Let him in.

352
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,720
Your Majesty,

353
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,480
your Soothing Soup for tonight.

354
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,520
Take it away.

355
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,640
It stinks.

356
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,840
I finally

357
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,800
found this prescription for you.

358
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,560
Good medicine tastes bitter.

359
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,120
Lately, your pulse has become stable,

360
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,920
and your headache has been relieved

361
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,080
- all because...
- Stop nagging.

362
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,680
Baoping, pour it outside.

363
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,840
Yes.

364
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,760
Your Majesty,

365
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,320
Princess Mingyue used her blood

366
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,200
to decoct the herbs

367
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,240
for you.

368
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:12,560
Your Majesty,

369
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,080
such love and devotion to you...

370
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,080
What did you say?

371
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,560
I'm going to the temple with Mother,

372
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,760
so I can't come tomorrow.

373
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,040
Decoct the herbs tonight

374
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,360
for His Majesty to take tomorrow.

375
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,720
But you've already lost so much blood.

376
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,400
Any more and you'll collapse.

377
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,440
It's fine.

378
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,480
It's worth it for His Majesty's health.

379
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,520
Mingyue.

380
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:39,960
Uncle,

381
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,120
what brings you here this late?

382
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,680
Show me your arm.

383
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,840
Physician Han,

384
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,280
didn't I ask you not to tell my uncle?

385
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,280
Your Grace,

386
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,920
I didn't mean to.

387
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,120
Your Majesty,

388
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,080
Princess Mingyue comes every day,

389
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,280
using her blood

390
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,760
to make the decoction for you.

391
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,800
The relief of your headache

392
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,640
shows

393
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,520
this prescription is working.

394
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,120
Those medical books you read

395
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:12,960
have made you a nerd.

396
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,560
Do you believe such nonsense?

397
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,120
Don't be mad, Uncle.

398
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,200
I found that prescription

399
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,320
and gave it to him.

400
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,440
I was afraid you hadn't forgiven me,

401
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,600
so I came by stealth...

402
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,080
Mingyue! Mingyue!

403
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,080
Can you hear me?

404
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,560
- What's wrong?
- Excessive loss of blood

405
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,920
can cause dizziness, Your Majesty.

406
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,480
Hold her back to rest.

407
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,320
Yes.

408
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,480
Baoping,

409
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,200
send a message to Rongyang.

410
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,120
Yes, Your Majesty.

411
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,280
Look at you

412
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,160
always acting rashly.

413
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,040
You're the apple of your mother's eye.

414
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,760
If she sees you like this,

415
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,440
she'll blame me for sure.

416
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,520
I didn't tell her, of course.

417
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,320
As long as you can be cured,

418
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,560
I'll give up my life

419
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,400
without hesitation.

420
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,760
That's too sweet of you.

421
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,600
I shall reward you. What do you want?

422
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,320
May I marry

423
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,680
Prince Yan?

424
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,440
Knock it off, Mingyue.

425
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,120
Good evening, Your Majesty.

426
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,520
Don't take

427
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,880
her words seriously.

428
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,720
You simply helped

429
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,960
treat your uncle for a few days.

430
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,000
Are you taking his kindness for granted?

431
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,640
No one in the Palace

432
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,320
is as filial as her.

433
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,480
From now on,

434
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,760
she'll be reinstated as Commandery Princess.

435
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,320
Thank your uncle, Mingyue!

436
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,500
Thank you, Your Majesty.

437
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,900
(Changle Palace)

438
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,880
Back then,

439
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,280
you stayed in this hall.

440
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,920
The two of us

441
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,960
always played games here.

442
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,080
We did.

443
00:19:59,120 --> 00:19:59,960
Brother,

444
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,120
remember

445
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,240
I saw all the princesses

446
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,200
had rare birds

447
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,960
but me.

448
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,080
To cheer me up,

449
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,600
you went up this tree

450
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,480
and gave me a nest of sparrows.

451
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,680
You said

452
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,280
no one in the Palace had sparrows but me,

453
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,520
so my birds

454
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,840
were even rarer.

455
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,520
At that time,

456
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,120
I was a neglected prince.

457
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,120
That was the best

458
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,480
I could do for you.

459
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,280
You deserved better.

460
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,240
Don't say that,

461
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,480
or I'll be mad.

462
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,040
Although we're only half-siblings,

463
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,800
we lost our mothers

464
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,840
in childhood

465
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,360
and grew up

466
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,200
with Grandmother.

467
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,760
To me,

468
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,600
such a bond means the world.

469
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,160
I know.

470
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,920
Time flies.

471
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,000
We've been with each other

472
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,960
for so long.

473
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,400
Even Mingyue has grown up.

474
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,080
Brother,

475
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,400
she's spoiled

476
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,760
and naive.

477
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,960
She only said to marry Yu Jin

478
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,640
on the spur of the moment.

479
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,920
Don't worry.

480
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,720
As much as I pamper her,

481
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,360
I won't indulge her willfulness.

482
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,040
She lost so much blood

483
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,960
to help me recover.

484
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,920
She's a wonderful girl.

485
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,280
Although our family is different from others,

486
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,600
we're concerned

487
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,520
about our children's marriage

488
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,160
the same as other parents.

489
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,320
I've had Consort Xian hold

490
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,280
a blossom-viewing banquet for Yu Jin.

491
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,680
If Mingyue does have feelings for him,

492
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,520
she may attend it as well

493
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,480
and take the chance

494
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,000
to see if they're meant to be together.

495
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,760
Thanks for your kindness.

496
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,160
You barged in so late.

497
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,440
What if someone sees you?

498
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,080
I don't care.

499
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,640
I miss you.

500
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,680
I wish they'd see me

501
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,000
so that they'd know

502
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,880
you're the only one I love.

503
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,040
A banquet is going to be held

504
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,310
to select wives for me and Prince Shu.

505
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,240
I'll make sure

506
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,200
you're invited to it.

507
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,040
At that banquet,

508
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,640
I'll tell everyone

509
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,640
in public

510
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,000
that I'll marry you.

511
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,440
Do you expect me to be there

512
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,760
to compete against those noble girls

513
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,560
for you?

514
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,920
I can't care less about them.

515
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,600
Even if you do nothing,

516
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,550
I'll choose no one but you.

517
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,320
I don't deserve such honor.

518
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,320
You're the noble Prince Yan

519
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,600
while I'm merely a humble civilian.

520
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,400
I don't belong

521
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,480
to a prince's mansion.

522
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,000
I'll leave someday

523
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,440
to live my own life.

524
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,440
Stop joking about that.

525
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,200
Or I'll take it seriously.

526
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,880
Serving the emperor is the riskiest.

527
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,800
You have to ponder over

528
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,000
everything he says and does

529
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,680
to avoid even one misstep.

530
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,280
It's fine

531
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,240
to be a spoiled girl

532
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,200
when he doesn't mind.

533
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,400
But when he shows even the slightest sign

534
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,400
of discontent,

535
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,040
do not push your luck.

536
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,960
His Majesty always seems

537
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,440
good-tempered,

538
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,680
misleading others into thinking

539
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,960
he's a benevolent

540
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,680
and guileless emperor.

541
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,120
But the truth is

542
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,880
he's most scheming.

543
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,240
To be his favorite sister,

544
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,360
I can't be like those fools

545
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,600
asking him for more and more and more.

546
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,560
If Uncle doesn't betroth me to Yu Jin,

547
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,040
he won't marry me, will he?

548
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,040
He only cares about Jiang Si.

549
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,440
Why won't he?

550
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,280
My daughter is

551
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,520
an all-around talent.

552
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,080
Also, in terms of looks,

553
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,480
you're second to none.

554
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,080
Now that His Majesty

555
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,520
will hold a banquet for Yu Jin

556
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,760
to select his wife,

557
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,440
we'll

558
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,840
make him choose you.

559
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,840
You're so wise, Mother.

560
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:04,920
It's late.

561
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,080
You should leave, Prince Yan.

562
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,240
I hope

563
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,880
you'll enjoy the banquet

564
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,800
and find your love.

565
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,360
What?

566
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,880
Are you asking me to leave?

567
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,200
Yes.

568
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,760
I need to rest.

569
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,520
Didn't you just leave?

570
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,840
I know as Prince Yan,

571
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,920
the future will be even tougher.

572
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,000
That's not your ideal life

573
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,720
of having a small farm and a cottage.

574
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,560
But you're the love of my life.

575
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,040
You shall be with me forever.

576
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,120
You're stuck with me

577
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,480
unless you can't fulfill

578
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,160
your long-cherished wish

579
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,040
until we part.

580
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,600
Then just tell me.

581
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,480
I'll

582
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,360
bid farewell to you.

583
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,040
A small farm

584
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,280
is way beneath a prince like you.

585
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,560
But it seems fine

586
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,280
for Yu Qi.

587
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,160
Relax.

588
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,520
I'll win at the banquet.

589
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,120
Your love

590
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,400
can only be me.

591
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,800
You're right, my love.

592
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:17,960
This jade pendant

593
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,880
has been with me since childhood.

594
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,360
When I'm away,

595
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,740
it'll be with you as me.

596
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:00,300
(Tiande Hall)

597
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,800
(List of Noble Girls)
Invite kind

598
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,680
and elegant girls from prominent clans

599
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,760
to the banquet for Jin,

600
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,280
as well as a few of noble birth.

601
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,640
Yuhu.

602
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,720
Yes.

603
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,280
Send it to the Rites Office.

604
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,320
Yes.

605
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,360
I wonder who Consort Zhuang

606
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,760
has invited.

607
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,880
Your Highness, Prince Yan comes to greet you.

608
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,680
All of a sudden?

609
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,320
He's waiting outside.

610
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,700
Will you let him in, Your Highness?

611
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,720
Yes.

612
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,800
I expect him

613
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,000
to assist Zhang in the future.

614
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,680
Send him in.

615
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,040
Greetings, Mother.

616
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,760
I'm glad to see you.

617
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,600
Is everything alright?

618
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,840
Has the date for the banquet

619
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,680
been fixed?

620
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,440
Yes, it's on the 18th.

621
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,560
Are you concerned

622
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,880
about my arrangement?

623
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:07,960
Not at all.

624
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,600
I guarded the South in the past years.

625
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,440
I barely know any noble girl in town,

626
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,800
but I long for

627
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,400
a happy marriage.

628
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,160
Whether or not

629
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,880
I'll have a perfect wife

630
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,880
depends on you, Mother.

631
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,640
Trust me.

632
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,520
I'll select just the one

633
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,560
you want.

634
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,160
I shall take my leave, Mother.

635
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,560
When Jin and the Crown Prince fought,

636
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,600
I thought he was wild and unruly.

637
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,080
Turns out,

638
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,880
he's simply childish.

639
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,800
He's so looking forward to his marriage.

640
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,280
Your Highness,

641
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,360
with all due respect, Prince Yan

642
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,360
seems...

643
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,400
Too pure.

644
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,600
That's actually a good thing.

645
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,880
If he likes his wife,

646
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,640
he'll listen to

647
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,880
what she says.

648
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,760
Then

649
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,480
if I and his wife get along well,

650
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,080
he'll help Zhang for sure.

651
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,160
Jiang Si, the rest is up to you.

652
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:42,300
(Lan Xingwen)

653
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,480
Mr. Sun.

654
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,160
Here's Consort Xian's guest list

655
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,000
for the banquet.

656
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:56,300
(Earl Dongping's Lineal Daughter, Jiang Si)

657
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:07,500
(To Earl Dongping's Lineal Daughter,
Jiang Si)

658
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,680
Si seems quiet,

659
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,560
but look.

660
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,720
She's invited to the Palace.

661
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,840
This is great!

662
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,360
What a big surprise!

663
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,800
Grandmother.

664
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,800
Si.

665
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,840
Come here.

666
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,280
Sit with me.

667
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,120
Let's sit.

668
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,120
Take a look, Si.

669
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,200
An invitation

670
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,240
from the Palace for you.

671
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,560
A banquet is going to be held

672
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,200
to select wives for me and Prince Shu.

673
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,640
I'll make sure

674
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,480
you're invited to it.

675
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,840
Do you know

676
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,440
why they

677
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,240
sent you this invitation?

678
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,320
No, Grandmother.

679
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,880
I didn't know

680
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,660
they had such a blossom-viewing banquet,

681
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,840
let alone

682
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,400
why I was invited to it.

683
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,280
If so,

684
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,560
why aren't you surprised?

685
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,360
Don't you always tell us

686
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,560
to remain calm no matter what?

687
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,240
That's how a noble lady

688
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,160
should behave.

689
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,000
Mother!

690
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,240
Mother!

691
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,680
Did Si receive an invitation from the Palace?

692
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,640
Did you also hear

693
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,880
the great news?

694
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,640
Blossom-viewing banquet?

695
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,880
It's to select wives for princes.

696
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,200
Si,

697
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,440
you can't go.

698
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,280
Are you insane?

699
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,440
It came directly from the Palace.

700
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,720
Was it Yu Qi's doing?

701
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,400
What was it to do with him?

702
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,520
Mother,

703
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,080
Yu Qi is the 7th Prince, Yu Jin!

704
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,400
Him? The 7th Prince?

705
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:51,120
That's why Si cannot go!

706
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,200
I... I always think

707
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,560
he's a wonderful young man.

708
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,520
If he and Si tie the knot,

709
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,400
that'll be a beautiful story.

710
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,280
Besides,

711
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,360
for all we know,

712
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,200
she might not be selected.

713
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,600
But with this invitation,

714
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,600
everyone in our clan can finally

715
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,400
hold our heads high.

716
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,480
And it'll be much easier

717
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,840
for you to marry.

718
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,480
Father,

719
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,960
it's not easy to be selected.

720
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,200
Besides,

721
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,080
this invitation came from the Palace.

722
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,640
It's not like

723
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,680
we can turn it down.

724
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,800
Exactly.

725
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,280
Si,

726
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,320
go back and prepare yourself for the banquet.

727
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,160
Tell the butler

728
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,320
if you need anything.

729
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,240
I have two sets

730
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,640
of fine jewelry.

731
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,880
I'll have Fu bring them to you.

732
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,400
Thanks, Grandmother.

733
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,400
By the way,

734
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,600
keep in mind what I'm about to say.

735
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,480
Follow the rules in the Palace.

736
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,040
Watch your ears.

737
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,320
Watch your eyes.

738
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,040
Watch your mouth.

739
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,120
Do what others do.

740
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,160
Remember,

741
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,080
do not stir up trouble.

742
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,440
Prince Yan,

743
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,000
these are made

744
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,560
of the finest Hetian Jade:

745
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,320
jade plates, jade bowls,

746
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,360
jade pots, and jade pillows.

747
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,720
Here's stationery

748
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,240
from the Longyan Shop.

749
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,200
(Peaceful and Carefree)

750
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,480
These are landscape scrolls

751
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,920
by the Great Four of Dazhou.

752
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,280
What are these for, Aunt?

753
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:26,960
My daughter, Mingyue,

754
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,840
admires you.

755
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,960
If you choose to

756
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,680
marry her at the banquet,

757
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,120
I'll let go of the past

758
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,840
and guarantee you a bright future.

759
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,720
Tell me, Aunt.

760
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,640
How will you guarantee that?

761
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,080
What if

762
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,200
I can make you the Crown Prince?

763
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,640
Really?

764
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,240
Yu Lang has no talent or virtue

765
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,280
but he hasn't been deposed.

766
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,680
Do you know why?

767
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,240
That's because of you, of course.

768
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:57,920
Too bad,

769
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,520
I have zero interest

770
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,000
in that position.

771
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,400
I'm unambitious.

772
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,640
I just want to be a carefree prince.

773
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,960
You were born cursed.

774
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,680
His Majesty might've forgotten,

775
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,800
but I haven't.

776
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,920
Neither have those court officials.

777
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,400
His Majesty yielded

778
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,840
to their demand when they kneeled

779
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,440
and sent you to the South.

780
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,760
That can happen again.

781
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:29,160
But I can also make them forget everything.

782
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,160
Your Highness,

783
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,400
do you really think

784
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,680
you can always get your way,

785
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,880
and a few words you say

786
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,160
can change

787
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,120
my life?

788
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,600
Absolutely.

789
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,680
I'm running out of patience.

790
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,320
Don't try to do anything stupid.

791
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,400
Goodbye, Your Highness.

792
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:12,880
Chief,

793
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:13,950
shall I take them away

794
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:14,800
and throw them out?

795
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,000
Keep them. They're quite valuable.

796
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,360
What?

797
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,360
A banquet in the Palace?

798
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,720
Yes.

799
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,160
They say it's to select princes' wives.

800
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,920
Select princes' wives?

801
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,560
Other than Si,

802
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,680
who else was invited?

803
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,400
Only she received the invitation.

804
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,200
Everyone in our house says

805
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,680
perhaps Miss Si

806
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,040
will become a princess.

807
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,000
If she

808
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,120
marries a prince,

809
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,560
the First Branch

810
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,880
will walk on air,

811
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,040
leaving even less room for us to survive.

812
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,040
Don't worry too much.

813
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,320
Miss Si was born a jinx.

814
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,240
She's not blessed.

815
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,800
She can't be a princess.

816
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,680
She wants to

817
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,760
be a princess?

818
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,640
In her dreams!

819
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,940
(Tiande Hall)

820
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,200
The Palace is huge!

821
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,080
Young Master Zhan!

822
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,440
Si!

823
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,560
Zhan.

824
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,240
Are you nervous?

825
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:32,920
I'm fine.

826
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,440
Go back to work

827
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,960
in case others see you leave.

828
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:37,920
It's fine.

829
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,600
What's that?

830
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,360
Rose Fudge.

831
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,520
Eat sweets for good luck.

832
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,400
Sure.

833
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,600
Is it sweet?

834
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:52,920
Yes.

835
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,000
Trust me.

836
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,240
Luck will be on my side.

837
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,030
Your Grace, your new dress

838
00:37:59,040 --> 00:37:59,840
looks stunning.

839
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,520
Where did you have it made?

840
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:03,860
I wish I could
go to the Imperial Garden with you.

841
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,480
Do tell me everything when you get back.

842
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,800
Sure. I'll leave out no details

843
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,080
of what I saw.

844
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,840
How come Miss Si's dress

845
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,480
looks identical to Princess Mingyue's?

846
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,680
Greetings, Your Grace.

847
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,440
How shameless!

848
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,400
How dare you dress like me!

849
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,560
Take that off.

850
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,800
Your Grace,

851
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,560
my dress was tailor-made

852
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,680
by the Tianxiu Shop

853
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,000
on Zhuque Street.

854
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,240
I drew the design

855
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,880
and picked the fabric.

856
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,440
Did the Grand Princess's tailor

857
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,360
copy it from that shop,

858
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,200
or did you

859
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,720
copy my dress on purpose?

860
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,280
Hong,

861
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,040
tear up her dress.

862
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
What are you doing?

863
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,640
- Stop!
- Aman...

864
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,480
Stop it!

865
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,600
- Mother.
- Grand Princess.

866
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,040
That was rude of Mingyue.

867
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,040
She offended you.

868
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,760
Please forgive her, Miss Si.

869
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,600
Of course, Your Highness.

870
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,840
I won't

871
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,960
hold it against her.

872
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,760
Mother,

873
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,320
I simply meant to

874
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,480
teach that vixen a lesson.

875
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,840
Why did you stop me?

876
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,280
Mingyue,

877
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,640
if you want someone dead,

878
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,800
be the nicest aboveboard

879
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,720
while doing the worst under the table.

880
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,600
If you make too big a fuss,

881
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,840
once she dies,

882
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,480
you'll be to blame.

883
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,820
Lesson learned, Mother.

884
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,040
You still have a lot more to learn.

885
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,900
(Palace, Imperial Garden)

886
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,040
The consorts have arrived!

887
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:28,140
(Fragrant and Sparse)

888
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:31,060
(Consort Zhuang)

889
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,400
Greetings, Your Highness.

890
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,000
Rise.

891
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,360
Please be seated, Consort Zhuang.

892
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,640
After you, Consort Xian.

893
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,200
The princes have arrived!

894
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,480
- Brother.
- Jin.

895
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,620
(Prince Shu)

896
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

897
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:27,550
After you, Brother.

898
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,400
Please.

899
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,480
Please, Consort Zhuang.

900
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,440
Begin.

901
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,380
Yes.

902
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,800
I'm Censor Sun Congxin of Rites.

903
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,040
I'll be the question master

904
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,320
for your competition

905
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,800
at today's banquet.

906
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,520
Now, peonies are in full bloom,

907
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,720
outshining each other,

908
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,360
so flowers will be the questions.

909
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,040
There will be three rounds.

910
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,240
Round one, draw them.

911
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,440
Round two, arrange them.

912
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,560
Round three, appreciate them.

913
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,520
Ladies, I hope you'll

914
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,160
impress everyone

915
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,720
and show all your talent.

916
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:07,440
Round one, peonies.

917
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:10,440
You'll have two hours to draw.

918
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,840
You may begin.

919
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:41,100
(Jiang Si)

920
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,560
Is that Earl Dongping's daughter?

921
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,360
I thought

922
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,920
Consort Zhuang could've done better,

923
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,000
but I overestimated her.

924
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:56,800
I can't believe she invited such a girl.

925
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,760
What's wrong with her?

926
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,000
Jiang Si

927
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,880
might own unmatched beauty,

928
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,360
but

929
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,560
her family and personality are...
