11
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,500
(Jiang Si, daughter of Earl Dongping)

12
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,080
Why would Consort Xian

13
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,040
invite a girl

14
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,360
like Jiang Si?

15
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,280
You didn't invite her?

16
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,790
Why would I invite her?

17
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,200
Family background and character

18
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,920
matter far more than looks.

19
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,560
It seems Consort Xian

20
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,280
intends to find Prince Yan

21
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,920
a wife of low birth.

22
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,630
But she shouldn't have picked

23
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,600
a girl who was rejected
by a Duke's family.

24
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,710
They all say Consort Xian

25
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,950
is indifferent to Prince Yan.

26
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,710
As we can see, it's true.

27
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:33,310
Does Consort Zhuang want

28
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:35,390
to take in a stunning concubine
for Prince Shu?

29
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,710
But concubines

30
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,160
have their own selection process.

31
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,950
They should never be mixed

32
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,640
with the candidates for the wives.

33
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,830
At the blossom-viewing banquet
that year,

34
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,430
I gave peonies

35
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,230
to six young ladies,

36
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,880
but in my heart, I only wanted

37
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,990
to give one to Qingrong.

38
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,950
Back then, the late Empress and you

39
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,200
were a match made in heaven.

40
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,510
Everyone envied you.

41
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,040
In the blink of an eye,

42
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,950
Qingrong has been gone for years.

43
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,920
Your Majesty,

44
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,430
Yang Nianzhi from the Astronomy
requests an audience.

45
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,830
Let him in.

46
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,790
Greetings, Your Majesty.

47
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,550
Greetings, Your Highness.

48
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,320
Before the Princes' weddings,

49
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,680
Directorate of Astronomy

50
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,230
should customarily predict
marriage compatibility.

51
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,710
Here are the marriage fortunes

52
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,360
of Prince Shu and Prince Yan.

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,080
Please have a look.

54
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,950
Prince Yan's fate is marked
by misfortune,

55
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,040
already deemed inauspicious.

56
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,750
He must never

57
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,830
(Yang Nianzhi, Supervisor)
marry someone

58
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,090
with a similarly ill-fated destiny.

59
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,110
It'd bring calamity
to the nation and the family.

60
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,790
It could spell disaster for Dazhou.

61
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,040
Yet Prince Yan once saved my life

62
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,670
in a time of crisis.

63
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,000
Supervisor Yang, why won't you

64
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,120
let go of that omen?

65
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,600
- But...
- Supervisor Yang,

66
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,160
must a Prince

67
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,510
be bound

68
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,870
by the Astronomy

69
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,640
from birth to marriage?

70
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,950
His Majesty has promised

71
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,280
Prince Yan that he may choose
a bride that he likes.

72
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,160
There is no need

73
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,320
for your baseless talk.

74
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,210
Your Highness,

75
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:21,430
ensuring that everything
aligns with the will of heaven

76
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,000
is our duty in the Astronomy.

77
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,000
How is that coercion?

78
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,040
You...

79
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,000
All our predictions are based

80
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,880
on extensive calculations.

81
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,240
They are not baseless.

82
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,480
Enough.

83
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,710
Supervisor Yang is only
fulfilling his duty.

84
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,470
Your Majesty, rest assured.

85
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,200

87
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,710
They won't bear an ill-fated destiny.

88
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,390
Forget it.

89

00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,160
Yes.

this painting, Better than Spring,

is by Princess Mingyue.

121
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,760
Not bad.

122
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,120
It exudes wealth and grandeur.

123
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,560
Mingyue paints with a refined style.

126
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,560

Thank you, Your Majesty.

130
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,240
Jiang Si, did you see that?

131
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,150
When I wish to win,

132
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,590
I never lose.

133
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,360
This painting, Grace by the Water,

134
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,710
is by Kou Lingbo
from the Grand Preceptor's family.

135
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,320
It is elegant and otherworldly.

136
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,240
As expected of the Grand Preceptor's
granddaughter.

137
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,920
This painting, Gentle Breeze,

138
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,800
is by Jiang Si
from Earl Dongping's family.

139
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,120
This...

140
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,640
What does that mean?

141
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,510
This...

142
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,680
Everyone can be bad at painting,

143
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,800
but Jiang Si

144
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,120
submitted a blank sheet of paper.

145
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,950
This is contempt
for the imperial family.

146
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,560
Who is Jiang Si?

147
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,000
Summon her.

148
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,200
By His Majesty's order,

149
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:40,040
Jiang Si of Earl Dongping's family
is summoned.

150
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,200
What about me?

151
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,280
Your Grace,

152
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,110
His Majesty only summoned Jiang Si.

153
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,780
I'm Jiang Si
from Earl Dongping's family.

154
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,870
Greetings, Your Majesty.

155
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,830
Jiang Si.

156
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,280
This is a contest of skill.

157
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,400
How dare you submit a blank scroll?

158
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,440
Your Majesty,

159
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,680
I spent two hours painting.

160
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,520
How could it be blank?

161
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,030
Mr. Sun,

162
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,350
when you inspected earlier,

163
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,110
you saw me painting.

164
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,520
Jiang Si, how dare you.

165
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,030
Not only did you submit a blank scroll,

166
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,440
but you also spouted nonsense.

167
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,280
Your Majesty,

168
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,830
after an hour has passed,

169
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,710
I still haven't seen Jiang Si
pick up her brush.

170
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,320
It wasn't until the second hour

171
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,560
that I saw her take the brush

172
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,080
and pretend to paint.

173
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,630
Show her the painting.

174
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,280
Yes.

175
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:51,670
What are you doing?

176
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,350
Why stand out in this situation?

177
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,600
Your Majesty,

178
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,240
I saw Jiang Si pick up the brush

179
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,990
and paint just now.

180
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:00,630
The 7th Prince was far
from the painting area.

181
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,280
How could you see clearly?

182
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,990
Jiang Si came here for the banquet.

183
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,200
Why would she submit a blank scroll?

184
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,160
Is she waiting for you to condemn her?

185
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,520
There must be something fishy.

186
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:10,710
Father, please judge wisely.

187
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,200
The evidence is clear.

188
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,280
What else could it be?

189
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,590
She has no talent or skill.

190
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,110
She couldn't paint,
so she submitted a blank scroll.

191
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,400
Your Majesty,

192
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:24,870
I indeed painted this,

193
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,710
but it isn't blank.

194
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,510
Could it be

195
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,320
that no one else has eyes but you?

196
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,200
The smell of this paper is strange.

197
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,080
There is a grassy scent on it.

198
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,680
I've studied plants since I was young.

199
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,230
There's a plant

200
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,560
called Traceless Grass.

201
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,510
When its juice

202
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,590
is mixed with ink,

203
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,000
the strokes will vanish

204
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,280
in a moment.

205
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,280
So, I suspect

206
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,440
someone tampered

207
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,440
with my paint.

208
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,440
Your Majesty,

209
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,800
could you give me some clear water?

210
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,160
Granted.

211
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,160
Come on, pour it.

212
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,230
Jiang Si, how dare you!

213
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,950
Only at a national funeral
would we use black flowers.

214
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,200
What do you mean by painting this?

215
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:27,080
Come!

216
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,710
Drag her out and cane her!

217
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:29,570
Hold on.

218
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:30,910
Your Majesty, please don't be mad.

219
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:31,990
I did paint

220
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,320
this black peony,

221
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,680
but it was done

222
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,040
with a special intention.

223
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,280
Alright, tell me.

224
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,160
Let me hear

225
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,470
your special intention.

226
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,040
Today, I didn't paint

227
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,440
this black peony

228
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,400
for the people present

229
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,280
but

230
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,110
for the late Empress.

231
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,830
Empress Qingrong adored peonies.

232
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,200
This is known to all.

233
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,290
Your Majesty, you planted peonies

234
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:00,510
throughout the imperial garden,

235
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:03,160
presumably to express your sorrow.

236
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,130
Empress Qingrong was compassionate

237
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,810
and concerned
for the people's suffering.

238
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,990
She advocated for thrift

239
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,320
and led by example.

240
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,750
The people all followed her.

241
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,110
She established charity schools

242
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,870
to support many impoverished students

243
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,710
and founded charity workshops

244
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:20,160
to treat common patients,
saving countless lives.

245
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,080
Empress Qingrong

246
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,750
was loved by the people of Dazhou

247
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,600
and was the woman

248
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,920
I most admire.

249
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,080
Today, I named this painting

250
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,110
Gentle Breeze

251
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,800
because I thought

252
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,200
Empress Qingrong

253
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,830
was like a gentle breeze.

254
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,080
Waters matter no more
compared to the vast sea;

255
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,760
Clouds matter no more
compared to those in Mount Wu.

256
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,710
Though the imperial garden

257
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,500
is filled with bright, colorful flowers,

258
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:46,870
this black peony

259
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,440
is rare in the world,

260
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,160
just like Empress Qingrong,

261
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,590
who was also unique

262
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,750
in Your Majesty's heart.

263
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,160
How thoughtful of you.

264
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,830
Your Majesty,

265
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,520
the painting is good,

266
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,800
but if it weren't for the ink,

267
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,560
perhaps this sentiment

268
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,990
would not have been revealed.

269
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,440
Sun Congxin,

270
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,280
how do you explain

271
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,520
Jiang Si's blank scroll?

272
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:28,040
I'm not aware of the ink matter.

273
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,080
Your Majesty, please judge.

274
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,040
All of this was arranged by you.

275
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:34,270
Why is it

276
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,040
that only Miss Jiang's ink
had a problem?

277
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,800
Under my very eyes,

278
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,160
how dare you be so audacious?

279
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,200
Bring me the ink for inspection.

280
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,710
Yes.

281
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,620
Your Majesty.

282
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,050
The stationery used for the contest

283
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,470
has all been cleaned,

284
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,150
and there's nothing left to inspect.

285
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,800
Well, Sun Congxin.

286
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,870
You really did a fine job.

287
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,750
You can make a painting disappear

288
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,520
and destroy evidence.

289
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,270
Are you too good to stay

290
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,470
in Rites Office?

291
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,600
I swear it wasn't me.

292
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,440
He tampered with things
at a royal banquet.

293
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,280
I don't believe
he could've done it alone.

294
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,480
Your Majesty,

295
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,400
why not hand him over to me
for questioning?

296
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,990
But Your Majesty,

297
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,630
I heard

298
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:23,160
that the 7th Prince and Miss Jiang

299
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,830
have a deep relationship.

300
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,870
He can't preside over the trial.

301
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:29,030
Why not arrest Sun Congxin first

302
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:30,120
and question him

303
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,200
on another day?

304
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,360
After all, the noble ladies of Ling'an

305
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,750
are attending in full attire today.

306
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,960
This matter concerns

307
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,350
the imperial family's dignity.

308
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,990
Your Majesty, what do you think?

309
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,800
Rongyang makes a good point.

310
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,400
Drag Sun Congxin out of here.

311
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,840
Your Majesty,

312
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,750
I'm innocent.

313
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,530
I'm innocent!

314
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:47,870
- Your Majesty...
- Your Majesty.

315
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,470
Though this has stirred up trouble,

316
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,320
it has also opened our eyes,

317
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,800
and we've seen Miss Jiang's

318
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,470
unique black peony.

319
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:55,630
Why not let her enter

320
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,280
the second round of the contest?

321
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,520
What do you think?

322
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,560
As Consort Zhuang suggests.

323
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,150
Thank you, Your Majesty.

324
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:05,210
Thank you, Your Majesty.
Thank you, Your Highness.

325
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,800
What is your name?

326
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:07,910
Your Majesty,

327
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,510
I am Lan Xingwen, Deputy Rite Censor

328
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,150
- of Rites Office.
- Good.

329
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,240
Next,

330
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,990
you will preside over the contest.

331
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,440
Thank you, Your Majesty.

332
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,400
Who would use withered wood
as decoration

333
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,350
and pair it with flower buds?

334
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,230
How ridiculous.

335
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,320
Time is up.

336
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,260
Your Majesty,

337
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,550
this is by Kou Lingbo
from the Grand Preceptor's family.

338
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,550
Your Majesty,

339
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,030
my floral work is named

340
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,230
Spring Over Stones.

341
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:57,230
It is fresh and elegant. Reward.

342
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,790
Your Majesty,

343
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,440
this is by Princess Mingyue.

344
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,470
My floral work is named Splendors.

345
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,440
It indeed adds splendor to the garden.

346
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,440
Here, on the other side,

347
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,400
this design forms the character "Zhou".

348
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,750
With this arrangement,

349
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,350
I wish Your Majesty good health

350
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,630
and prosperity for Dazhou.

351
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,080
Marvelous.

352
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,710
It has both form and meaning.

353
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,350
Good.

354
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:27,830
Thanks for your praise, Uncle.

355
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,440
It's thanks to Mother's teachings.

356
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,680
I've only learned
a fraction of her skills.

357
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,200
Indeed.

358
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,710
Your mother's floral artistry
is unparalleled.

359
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,800
No one present

360
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,160
can compare with her.

361
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,400
Your Majesty, don't tease me.

362
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,680
This is their banquet.

363
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,320
Your Majesty,

364
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,750
this is by Jiang Si
from Earl Dongping's family.

365
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,560
Miss Jiang,
why did you choose flower buds

366
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,440
and pair them with withered branches?

367
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:04,990
Your Majesty,

368
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,670
my floral work is called

369
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:08,040
Spring amidst Trees,

370
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,040
as in "spring amidst drying trees"
from Liu Yuxi's poem.

371
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:15,000
But I see only dying trees.

372
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:17,320
Where is the supposed spring?

373
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,430
Miss Jiang,

374
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,240
are you performing a magic trick?

375
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,520
It is not a trick.

376
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,040
I only thought

377
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,480
that flowers in the garden

378
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,560
would die soon,

379
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,880
but these two buds

380
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,960
haven't bloomed.

381
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,510
I simply wish

382
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,630
to encourage them,

383
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,000
so they won't be lazy

384
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,390
and will bloom quickly.

385
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,800
If Miss Jiang

386
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,560
can make these buds bloom,

387
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,390
then it wouldn't be a magic trick

388
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:44,520
but rather an elegant wonder.

389
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,590
I have never heard

390
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:48,870
of such a method before.

391
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,070
Jin, do you think Miss Jiang

392
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,560
can really make the buds bloom?

393
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:54,870
I'm quite curious.

394
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:43,190
Could it be the water temperature?

395
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,240
Or was something added to the water?

396
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,280
Miss Jiang, how remarkable.

397
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,010
I am unworthy of such praise.

398
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,550
I present Spring amidst Trees

399
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,810
to both consorts,

400
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,350
wishing you eternal youth

401
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,800
and longevity.

402
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,790
Making flowers bloom

403
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,350
is truly unheard of.

404
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,830
Miss Jiang, thank you.

405
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,520
Miss Jiang's offering

406
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,240
is indeed fresh and unique.

407
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,670
To witness such an event today

408
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,560
is truly an eye-opening experience.

409
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,080

is tiresome.

00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,000
How about this?

436
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,030
Just hold all the flowers

437
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,110
and deliver them at once.

438
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,160
Jin, that would not be proper.

What's not proper?

How could you give all six flowers

473
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,080
to Jiang Si?

474
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,760
Jin.

475
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:13,730
It's not I want to blame you.

476
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,590
How can you fool around like this?

477
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,040
You're just fooling around.

478
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,640
This is no place for that.

479
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,000
It's precisely because it's serious

480
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,670
that I must treat it

481
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,630
with the utmost caution.

482
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:27,240
Father, I'm not fooling around.

483
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,830
There are so many

484
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,430
noble ladies present.

485
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,200
Prince Yan gave all six flowers

486
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,390
to one lady,

487
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,480
which is unfair

488
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,150
to other ladies.

489
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,030
Fair?

490
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,110
Aunt,

491
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,000
there is no such thing

492
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,190
as absolute fairness in this world.

493
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:47,050
I simply want to give

494
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:48,270
the flowers to Jiang Si alone.

495
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:49,400
If I have to give the flowers

496
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,550
to other ladies,

497
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:51,670
that's not fair.

498
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:53,150
That's just deceiving oneself.

499
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:54,630
Aunt, this is too ridiculous.

500
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:56,010
What's ridiculous about it?

501
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:59,240
This is not a banquet for talents

502
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,870
but a banquet to choose a wife.

503
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,240
I'm only one man.

504
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,960
I don't need six wives.

505
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,730
Mother, please don't be upset.

506
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,390
I just don't understand

507
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,750
why you only gave the flowers

508
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,320
to Miss Jiang.

509
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,000
The reason is simple.

510
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,160
There's only one.

511
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,590
Once I laid eyes on Jiang Si,

512
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,350
I knew she was perfect for me.

513
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:29,430
How perfect.

514
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:33,320
Prince Yan, you're too young

515
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,870
to understand some things.

516
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,030
Whether something is truly perfect

517
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,430
is not a matter of impulse

518
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,150
or liking someone on a whim.

519
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:43,320
To be with someone for a lifetime,

520
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,430
there are so many things to consider.

521
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,150
But when I look

522
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,510
at someone,

523
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:53,520
I feel an unease in my heart.

524
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,000
How can I marry her for a lifetime?

525
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,270
Father,

526
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:58,160
you and Mother

527
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,110
promised me before

528
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,350
that I would have

529
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:04,430
my perfect wife.

530
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:07,110
Now, Jiang Si is

531
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,520
the only perfect one for me.

532
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,200
So, you brat

533
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,560
have already made up your mind.

534
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,530
You've been planning every step,

535
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:15,550
and now you've set up

536
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:16,670
your mother and me.

537
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,110
That's not true.

538
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,110
This isn't about being perfect;

539
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:22,790
it's about being willful.

540
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,670
I will not approve

541
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:26,150
of such a disregard for rules.

542
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,830
You must either divide the six flowers

543
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:29,800
among six ladies

544
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,070
or wait for me

545
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:33,240
to arrange your marriage.

546
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:37,270
A prince does not take back

547
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,510
what he has given.

548
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:39,590
Right, Father?

549
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,790
Your Majesty.

550
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:44,790
Prince Yan...

551
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,040
Enough, enough.

552
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,670
It's just flowers.

553
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,630
Why make such a fuss about it?

554
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,720
Since the banquet is over,

555
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,510
- everyone can leave.
- Yes.

556
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:55,110
- Your Majesty.
- I'll walk you out.

557
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:04,630
Alright, alright.

558
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,910
Princes giving flowers

559
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,630
to their future wives

560
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,400
is merely a custom,

561
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,520
not an explicit rule.

562
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,430
Besides, the final decision

563
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,390
is not for the Prince to make.

564
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,630
Grand Princess, you're right.

565
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,110
My dear,

566
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,430
why make such a fuss?

567
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:39,000
He's been raised in the South.

568
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,350
I am not unsympathetic,

569
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,510
but he cannot disregard

570
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:45,320
the imperial traditions.

571
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:47,190
I think

572
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,910
Miss Jiang is good.

573
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,560
Your Majesty...

574
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,520
I've had it checked.

575
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,630
The name hidden in Miss Jiang's flower

576
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:58,590
is also Yu Jin,

577
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,520
showing that the feelings are mutual.

578
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,080
Why not grant their wish?

579
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,080
Your Majesty, you may not know,

580
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,790
but Miss Jiang was once rejected

581
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:09,870
by the son of Duke An.

582
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:11,510
That's not

583
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:13,320
a big deal.

584
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,040
The Empress of our ancestors

585
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,830
was once married

586
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,240
and even had two children

587
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,760
with her ex-husband.

588
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:21,870
In the end, didn't they join hands

589
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:24,880
to create a prosperous dynasty

590
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,960
and become a model couple?

591
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,750
How can this be the same?

592
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:29,830
My dear,

593
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,590
it's to find Jin a wife,

594
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,590
not a Crown Princess.

595
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:35,560
As long as he is happy,

596
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,830
that's good enough.

597
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,670
To look on the bright side,

598
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,750
having a daughter-in-law

599
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,590
who can perform tricks to amuse you

600
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,110
might be even more fun.

601
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,240
I am angry

602
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,000
because he should've told me

603
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,800
about his plans.

604
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,800
Instead, he disregarded me entirely.

605
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,430
Where is his respect for me?

606
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,040
How about this?

607
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:02,240
I will ask Jin again about this.

608
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:10,720
Father, Mother.

609
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:12,200
Jin.

610
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,240
As you think Miss Jiang Si is perfect,

611
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,670
do you want to marry her?

612
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,150
Father, how well you know me.

613
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:20,830
But Miss Jiang was once rejected.

614
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,520
You may not mind it now,

615
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,720
but who knows about the future?

616
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,830
If you regret it later,

617
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,000
will you ask me

618
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,480
to break my promise?

619
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:29,910
Give me a reason

620
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,080
why you don't mind this.

621
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,110
The blind who missed out on treasures

622
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:37,240
shouldn't stop those with good eyes

623
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,430
from cherishing them properly.

624
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,160
Alright then.

625
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,070
I'll give you what you want.

626
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,960
I'll make Jiang Si your wife.

627
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,800
Thank you, Father.

628
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,110
Thank you, Mother.

629
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:54,320
This is the wife you chose yourself.

630
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:56,150
The future

631
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,190
is entirely up to you.

632
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,390
Mother, don't worry.

633
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,190
I will make sure I am happy.

634
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,590
Leave now.

635
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,080
I take my leave.

636
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,040
Look at how happy he is.

637
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,870
This boy is so simple-minded.

638
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,240
He can't hold back his emotions.

639
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,390
I've always been thinking of him,

640
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,800
but now I'm the bad person.

641
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:32,760
My dear, you're overthinking.

642
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,720
As for his marriage,

643
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:38,080
I hope you will manage it carefully.

644
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,640
In time, he will understand

645
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,870
your good intentions.

646
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,320
I...

647
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:48,870
My dear, please stay.

648
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,960
Yu Jin is

649
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,520
such a fool.

650
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:04,800
Even though he does like her,

651
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,870
can't he at least hide it?

652
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:09,080
Prince Yan's thoughts are pure,

653
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,430
and he's in his prime,

654
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,830
so it's only natural
that his true feelings show.

655
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,080
Good.

656
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:22,390
Giving all six flowers to one lady

657
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:25,080
is something I wanted to do

658
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,560
but I didn't dare.

659
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,220
(Earl Dongping's Mansion)

660
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,320
Si,

661
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,480
did you really receive

662
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,320
all six flowers at yesterday's banquet?

663
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:41,040
What an honor to our family.

664
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:45,080
Who gave them to you?

665
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,200
Prince Yan.

666
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,280
And?

667
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:52,870
That's it.

668
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,280
It was all from Prince Yan.

669
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,480
Oh, no.

670
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,240
Grandmother, what do you mean?

671
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,440
The tall tree is bound
to be struck by the wind.

672
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,280
Don't you understand that?

673
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,070
By showing off like this,

674
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:12,390
you'll inevitably be hated,

675
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:14,000
and our family

676
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,110
will be dragged down.

677
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,320
Mother.

678
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:18,960
Mother.

679
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,040
What is it? Tell me.

680
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,320
Mother,

681
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:26,080
everyone is talking

682
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,560
about Miss Si.

683
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:29,870
They say she's a disaster,

684
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,630
and the Palace won't admit

685
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:34,720
the flowers she received.

686
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,760
They say if our girls

687
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,590
want to marry a Prince,

688
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,800
it'll only be a fantasy.

689
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,920
Si, listen.

690
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,680
Listen to what they're saying about you.

691
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,830
You're too young

692
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:52,590
to know how to conceal your brilliance.

693
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:54,310
Sometimes, you need to hold back.

694
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,830
You must understand this principle.

695
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,420
Everyone should maintain their dignity,

696
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,480
so you can meet them in the future.

697
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,590
Grandmother, you're right.

698
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,070
As for other matters,

699
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,430
I'll follow the rules.

700
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,150
But I find it hard

701
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,760
to give up my marriage.

702
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,200
Think carefully.

703
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,590
If this marriage succeeds,

704
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:14,880
it'll be perfect.

705
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,000
But if it doesn't,

706
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,310
how will our family

707
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:19,320
be able to hold our heads up?

708
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,800
Alright.

709
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,040
Stay in your chamber

710
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:27,440
for the time being.

711
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,550
Reflect on your actions,

712
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:30,190
restrain your temper,

713
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,440
and don't let others think

714
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,920
that our family

715
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,080
lacks propriety.

716
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,480
Yes.

717
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,480
I take my leave.

718
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,190
Mother, calm down.

719
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,400
Calm down.

720
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,590
Here's what I'm thinking.

721
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:51,430
If she really marries a Prince,

722
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,790
I would be happy for her.

723
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:55,000
I hope the girls marry well.

724
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,240
But

725
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,240
noble families are fraught with dangers.

726
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,080
Yes, you're right.

727
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:03,270
Who would have thought

728
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:06,150
that Commandant Yu is Prince Yan?

729
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:07,070
Since Si

730
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:08,710
got involved with Prince Yan,

731
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,920
she's been reckless and unrestrained.

732
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:14,150
Mother, calm down.

733
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,550
Didn't I say it before?

734
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:24,030
She's not suitable to marry a Prince.

735
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,150
You're going to ruin her.

736
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,840
Mingyue likes the 7th Prince.

737
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,400
What can I do?

738
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,230
Well then.

739
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:32,840
Now, all the 7th Prince's flowers

740
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,030
went to Jiang Si.

741
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,400
Mingyue saw it herself.

742
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,480
She'll give up now, right?

743
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:38,080
What's the big deal about that?

744
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,550
I arranged the banquet

745
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:41,630
with great care,

746
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:44,960
but Jiang Si completely avoided it.

747
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,080
What a pity.

748
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,150
She almost got caned.

749
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,960
As expected of Su Ke's daughter.

750
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,880
Like her mother,

751
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:58,230
she's a beauty who brings disaster.

752
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:02,710
What?

753
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,000
Is it not enough that you broke up

754
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,880
my relationship with Su Ke back then?

755
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,760
Now, you want Mingyue

756
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,560
to steal love from her daughter?

757
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,480
Is Mingyue your daughter,

758
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,630
or is Jiang Si your daughter?

759
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:16,920
Stop this nonsense.

760
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:18,110
Feeling guilty now?

761
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,520
I've hit the nail on the head?

762
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:25,320
No wonder there are rumors

763
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,760
about you and Su Ke being close

764
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,440
and losing your innocence long ago.

765
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,040
I guess it's true.

766
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,040
Rongyang,

767
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,230
don't push it.

768
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:42,080
There was nothing between Su Ke and me.

769
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:44,550
She's been dead for years.

770
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:45,920
Why still slander her name?

771
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:47,710
How malicious of you!

772
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,400
Shut up!

773
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:51,460
How can you say that about me
for a dead woman?

774
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,740
(Luxurious and Gorgeous)

775
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,630
Beautiful.

776
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:08,710
So beautiful.

777
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,110
These flowers are as beautiful as you.

778
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,400
Your Grace.

779
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,760
- Please forgive us.
- Please forgive us.

780
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:32,360
Raise your head.

781
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:43,230
Your Grace, please spare us.

782
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:45,520
- Please spare us.
- Please spare us.

783
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,480
Bring the fire.

784
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,880
Mother.

785
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,190
Mingyue,

786
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:30,440
if a man's heart is elsewhere,

787
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,150
no matter how good he is,

788
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,710
what does it matter to you?

789
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,510
But I've seen

790
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:38,750
how good he is.

791
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,960
If I can't have him,

792
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:47,440
I won't die in peace.

793
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,230
Some things,

794
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,630
even if forced,

795
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,960
may not go as wished.

796
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,040
But Mother,

797
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,670
if you had another chance,

798
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:00,960
you would still

799
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,190
choose the same, right?

800
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:03,880
If I don't fight,

801
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:05,480
how can I let it go willingly?

802
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,520
Mother, please believe me.

803
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,480
I will have a different ending.

804
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,000
Perhaps I can achieve

805
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,480
what you couldn't.

806
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:33,740
(Chengtian Hall)

807
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,440
Greetings, Your Highness.

808
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:54,190
General Cui,

809
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:56,630
thank you for saving me.

810
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,230
It's my duty.

811
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,190
Greetings, Your Majesty.

812
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,550
Your Majesty,

813
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:12,000
the rebellion has been crushed,

814
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,310
with seven cities reclaimed
and 3,000 captured.

815
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:15,630
Good.

816
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,560
General Cui is unstoppable.

817
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,080
I will reward you greatly.

818
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:20,880
I shall let you marry

819
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,920
Grand Princess Rongyang, my only sister.

820
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,110
What do you think?

821
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:25,750
Thank you, Your Majesty,

822
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,420
but I am already engaged

823
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:28,990
and do not wish to marry anyone else.

824
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:46,670
Very well.

825
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,520
I will let you marry him.

826
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,320
Lady Jiang,

827
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,550
why would the Palace

828
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:11,000
suddenly issue an edict?

829
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:13,280
I think it's because Si

830
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,190
stole the show

831
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:15,520
at the banquet.

832
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:17,560
Especially with the 7th Prince.

833
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:19,760
Who knows

834
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,320
what storm will come?

835
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,840
Lady Jiang is here.

836
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:31,110
His Majesty has ordered:

837
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,710
Jiang Si, daughter of Earl Dongping,

838
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,030
is virtuous

839
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:38,400
and graceful.

840
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:40,480
I am pleased.

841
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,230
The 7th Prince, Jin,

842
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,630
is at a marriageable age,

843
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:45,670
and a virtuous match is needed.

844
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,150
Thus, I betroth Jiang Si

845
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:49,000
to the 7th Prince.

846
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,960
They shall marry at a good time.

847
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:53,110
The authorities shall carry it out.

848
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:55,030
Thank

849
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:56,150
His Majesty.

850
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:02,630
Miss Jiang Si,

851
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:03,710
accept the edict.

852
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:12,950
Congratulations, Miss Jiang Si.

853
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:14,150
Thank you.

854
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:17,110
Goodbye, Eunuch.

855
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,280
Grandmother.

856
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:24,710
Si.

857
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:30,560
Congratulations, Miss Si.

858
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,480
Aunt, are you going to be a Princess?

859
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:36,510
(Jiang Si from Earl Dongping's family)
Will you move to a big house?

860
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:38,750
I want to go with you.

861
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,510
Okay. You can go anywhere

862
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:41,840
I go, okay?

863
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,440
Si.

864
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,520
Congratulations.

865
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:46,190
Congratulations, Miss.

866
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,500
Congratulations, Princess Yan.

867
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,480
May all your wishes come true.

868
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,040
Congratulations, Si.

869
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:52,590
Here.

870
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,070
Take it.

871
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:55,150
Si,

872
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:58,750
the imperial family's status
is unmatched.

873
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:01,000
Now, our family

874
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,960
has support

875
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:04,920
in the Palace.

876
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:06,310
Our family

877
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:08,710
will only thrive

878
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,750
in the future.

879
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:12,800
You grew up

880
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,710
in this mansion.

881
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,000
I have always believed

882
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,230
you are blessed.

883
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:23,670
Prince Yan is noble,

884
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:26,000
and you like each other.

885
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:29,360
I bless you both

886
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:30,960
to live in harmony.

887
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,480
Grandmother, you flatter me.

888
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,280
It is thanks to the family's teachings.

889
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,710
Since you'll marry a Prince,

890
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,710
your dowry must be fitting.

891
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:38,840
I have the jewelry

892
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,920
you'll need for your wedding.

893
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:43,880
Come on, let's choose your jewelry.

894
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,270
- Sure. Let's go, Yan.
- Let's go.

895
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:47,040
I can choose for Aunt.

896
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:48,710
Sure.

897
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,780
They've left.

898
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,960
What did

899
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:57,280
that eunuch say?

900
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,790
He said she'd be Princess Yan.

901
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:10,360
So, she's truly flying high.

902
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,080
My daughter was virtuous,

903
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,670
yet she married Cao Xingyu,

904
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:15,920
a cruel man.

905
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,670
How lucky she is.

906
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:19,480
In a blink,

907
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,110
she's become Princess Yan!
