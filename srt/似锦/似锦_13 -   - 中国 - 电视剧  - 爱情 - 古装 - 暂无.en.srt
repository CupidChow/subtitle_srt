Mr. Yu.

18
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,940
Gentlemen don't eavesdrop.

19
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,220
This is already the second time.

20
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,020
I...

21
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,900
I'm no gentleman.

22
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,100
Sorry.

23
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,820
At first, I thought

24
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,380
you had feelings for Mr. Zhen.

25
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,060
Whoever I have feelings for,

26
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,060
it's none of your business.

27
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,700
Of course, it does.

28
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,980
Must you speak to me so coldly?

29
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:46,820
Aren't we...

30
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:49,660
What?

31
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,300
Neighbors?

32
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,100
Mr. Yu, you truly jest.

33
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,660
You returned my begonia gift

34
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,940
for the housewarming.

35
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,380
Someone as mighty as you

36
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,100
is out of my league.

37
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,220
Returned your gift?

38
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,540
I didn't.

39
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,500
It must be Long Dan.

40
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,100
That good-for-nothing

41
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,220
who fails at everything.

42
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,500
Something's wrong with the soil.

43
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,780
Please take a look at that.

44
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,300
What's wrong with the soil?

45
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,660
- It...
- Yu!

46
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,380
I always miss it.

47
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,260
Is something wrong with the bow?

48
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,660
Come and take a look.

49
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,620
Long Dan,

50
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,140
go take a look.

51
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:36,980
Yes.

52
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,460
The soil is a bit loose.

53
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,780
- Really?
- Yes.

54
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,740
You'll know it once you see it.

55
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,420
Why didn't you say so earlier?

56
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,060
I had to wait for the chance.

57
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,220
Actually, today,

58
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,500
I'm not resting.

59
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,900
I came to teach Jiang Zhan
how to ride and shoot,

60
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,940
and I also wanted to ask you

61
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,060
if something was wrong.

62
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,900
You dreamed that Jiang Zhan would die?

63
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,580
But dreams aren't real.

64
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,500
What if it comes true?

65
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,900
The dream was very vivid.

66
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,860
I saw my brother fall into the water

67
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,600
and the fire in the tavern spreading,

68
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,340
and there was
my brother's memorial tablet

69
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,900
in my family's ancestral hall.

70
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,780
What if my brother really dies?

71
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,560
I have to prepare for the worst.

72
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:36,900
I hit it!

73
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,460
Yu, Si.

74
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,140
Look, I hit it.

75
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,820
Come and take a look.

76
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,140
Based on Jiang Zhan's personality,

77
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,820
if you keep him

78
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,380
at home every day,

79
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,580
it will only backfire.

80
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,900
He will find ways to run out.

81
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,580
How about this?

82
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,660
When he goes out,

83
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,780
we can take turns and follow him.

84
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,140
What do you think?

85
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,340
Don't you think what I'm saying

86
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,080
is absurd?

87
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,580
I know you care about him.

88
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,700
Did Miss Si really say that?

89
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:09,780
Yes.

90
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,140
I've taken the liberty and told Miss Si

91
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,260
to temporarily put off

92
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,580
the marriage proposal.

93
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,740
Come on.

94
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,040
Your bride-to-be has slipped away

95
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,100
just like that.

96
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,700
Mother, we should respect

97
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,820
Miss Si's wishes.

98
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,260
Forget it. I was too impatient.

99
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,140
On Lady Jiang's birthday,

100
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,740
she was framed.

101
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,260
I thought that her family

102
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,900
was a place full of trouble,

103
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,900
so I was eager to propose to her.

104
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,300
I just wanted her

105
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,820
to marry you sooner

106
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,040
to prevent her from suffering.

107
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,020
But now,

108
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,780
it seems I shouldn't force her.

109
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,820
Mother, you did everything for me.

110
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,820
What do you plan to do?

111
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,260
Should we just let the marriage go?

112
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,360
Knowing one's limits
is the way to advance.

113
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,360
Looking afar is the way to be motivated.

114
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,220
I won't give up

115
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,580
until Miss Si is engaged.

116
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,420

165
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,000
but the business
has dropped dramatically.

166
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,880
No one has visited
for several days in a row.

167

Even the regular customers

168
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,540
have returned their goods.

169
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,540
I secretly asked them the reason,

170
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,580
and they said that a noble told them

171
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,540
whoever dared to buy anything here

172
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,580
was going against them.

173
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,500
As for who this person is,

174
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,500
they dare not tell me.

175
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,420
Since it's a noble,

176
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,460
they won't be
from another fragrance shop.

177
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,540

00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,700
Everyone, please stay calm.

190
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,860
Commandant Yu is investigating this.

191
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,380
As the saying goes,

192
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,580
good things are worth the wait.

193
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,820
I don't believe anyone

194
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,700
can truly block all our customers.

195
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,700
You're right, Si.

196
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,860
I'll treat my friends

197
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,380
to some drinks these days

198
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,920
and have them introduce some customers.

199
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,820
It won't work.

200
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,060
Why?

201
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,500
Your playful friends

202
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,540
won't be of any help.

203
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,860
Are you trying

204
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,220
to go out and have fun again?

205
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,540
It's serious now.

206
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,480
How can I be in the mood

207
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,340
for fun and games?

208
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,100
How could you think of me like that?

209
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,460
Alright.

210
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,980
Anyway, you cannot

211
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,100
look for those friends.

212
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:04,940
Got it.

213
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:23,900
(Fragrance Shop)

214
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,100
You're killing me.

215
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,700
Enough already.

216
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,340
Don't laugh yourself to death.

217
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,500
This is the first time I've heard

218
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,780
of a sister locking her brother at home

219
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,140
and making him stay indoors.

220
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:39,980
What do you know?

221
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,060
My sister is doing it for my own good.

222
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,220
(Zhang Sheng)
She wants me to have less fun

223
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,740
and work harder to improve myself.

224
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:46,860
Fine.

225
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,620
Then I'll leave now,

226
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,820
so I don't delay your progress.

227
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,140
Don't. Don't go.

228
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,300
Come back, come back.

229
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,740
You don't know

230
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,940
how boring it is to drink alone.

231
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,900
You, a grown man,

232
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,220
obey your sister like this.

233
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,820
Aren't you ashamed?

234
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:02,860
So what?

235
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,380
My sister is

236
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,440
ten times smarter than me.

237
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,420
She is always right.

238
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,620
The more obedient you are,

239
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,020
the less she'll think of you.

240
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,860
My sister wouldn't think less of me.

241
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,340
Right?

242
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,700
She's your sister.

243
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,220
Can she say that openly?

244
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,020
Your playful friends

245
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,100
won't be of any help.

246
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,500
Are you trying

247
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,820
to go out and have fun again?

248
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,580
As long as I pass the selection

249
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,080
and join the Imperial Insignia Guard,

250
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,000
my sister will definitely
think better of me.

251
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,360
She will never think I'm useless.

252
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,820
What if you don't make it?

253
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,740
What?

254
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,060
Are you confident?

255
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,580
I have no confidence at all.

256
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,620
Zhang, you know me.

257
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,220
With my fake skills,

258
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,820
no matter how hard I try,

259
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,940
I'm still nervous.

260
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,220
These women...

261
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,400
- I don't know them.
- Xiang.

262
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,140
They insist that a man

263
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,380
has to hold a position

264
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,460
to be considered successful.

265
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,720
What's so great
about the Imperial Insignia Guard?

266
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,220
Being out in the wind and sun all day.

267
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,220
That's right.

268
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,340
Haven't you thought of some way

269
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,100
to make your sister think better of you?

270
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,300
Zhang,

271
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,820
do you know any

272
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,580
rich ladies

273
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,980
who need perfume?

274
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,340
Yes.

275
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,220
Really? That's great.

276
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,460
Come on.

277
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,500
Ji,

278
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,300
Jiang Zhan took the bait?

279
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:07,940
As expected.

280
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,660
After this mission,

281
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,040
the Commandery Princess has said

282
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,160
there will be a place for you
in the Rites Office.

283
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,060
I will not disappoint Her Grace.

284
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,180
Goodbye.

285
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,380
(Unlicensed Tavern)
Candied hawthorn.

286
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,340
Zhang,

287
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,260
is the buyer the top courtesan

288
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,340
of some brothel?

289
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,660
What does it matter who she is?

290
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,100
She has money.

291
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,140
Anyway, tonight,

292
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,000
this lady is spending very lavishly.

293
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,320
If you can talk her into this,

294
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,140
you won't have to worry
about Fragrance Shop

295
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,060
for the whole year.

296
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,100
Promise me.

297
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,400
You can't take the boat,

298
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,700
nor go near the river.

299
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,940
It's just boating. Come on.

300
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,500
Let's forget it.

301
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,500
If my sister knew

302
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,740
I came to this kind of place,

303
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,700
she'd scold me to death.

304
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,860
Always talking about your sister.

305
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,260
Can't you live without her?

306
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,180
What nonsense is this?

307
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,660
Who said I can't live

308
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,500
without my sister?

309
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,700
If you can, come with me.

310
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,340
Come on, let's go.

311
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,860
You... Slow down.

312
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,460
Come on.

313
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,100
Come on.

314
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,700
Fill his glass.

315
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,540
I'm not drinking.

316
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,820
Come on, have a drink.

317
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:34,940
(Moon House)

318
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,460
Let me help you.

319
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,700
Let's go, Zhang.

320
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,460
It's the wrong way.

321
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,500
Leave us.

322
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,540
Your Grace, I don't know

323
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,980
you're here with these gentlemen.

324
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,380
My friend here

325
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,220
took the wrong path.

326
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,700
Sorry to disturb your enjoyment.

327
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,460
Sorry, sorry.

328
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:29,700
Hold on.

329
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,220
It was us who asked your friend

330
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,740
to bring you here.

331
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,620
Your Grace, what do you mean?

332
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,180
Don't you want to know

333
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:46,860
who's blocking

334
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,340
Fragrance Shop's livelihood?

335
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,100
Let me tell you.

336
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,860
It's me.

337
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,580
Impossible.

338
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:58,940
Everyone knows you're pretty and kind.

339
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,500
How could you do such a thing?

340
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,820
This must be my fault.

341
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,500
I always

342
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,060
speak without thinking.

343
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,580
They all know this.

344
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,740
I must've offended you

345
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,620
somehow.

346
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,780
I hope you can enlighten me.

347
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,100
How sensible of you.

348
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,100
Fine.

349
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,740
I'm in a good mood today,

350
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,580
so I'll let this one go.

351
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,100
I forgive you.

352
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,580
Thank you, Your Grace.

353
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,660
I didn't allow you to leave.

354
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,480
There's no seat for me.

355
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,420
Princess Mingyue's family banquet

356
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,580
isn't something

357
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,860
anyone can attend.

358
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,020
Jiang, since you're here,

359
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,620
you must drink.

360
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,780
Come on, serve Jiang some wine.

361
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,020
I...

362
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,100
Your Grace...

363
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,020
Drink these three jars of wine,

364
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,620
and I'll let Fragrance Shop go.

365
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,140
How's that?

366
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,340
This...

367
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,300
Your Grace,

368
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,860
are you serious?

369
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:10,860
Of course.

370
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,860
Thank you for the wine, Your Grace.

371
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,820
I forgot to mention

372
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,940
that this is the Fiery Wine
I brought back

373
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,340
from the Western Regions.

374
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:36,820
A few drops and you'll be
in a drunken stupor.

375
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,980
Sorry, it slipped.

376
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:41,980
What's the matter?

377
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,300
Princess Mingyue awarded you

378
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,660
with such a precious wine.

379
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,100
Why not drink it?

380
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,260
Sure.

381
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,580
I'll drink.

382
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,100
Zhang Sheng came to our home days ago,

383
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,580
but I didn't think much of it.

384
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,500
But after dinner today,

385
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,660
my brother disappeared.

386
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,660
Don't worry.

387
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,820
Maybe he sneaked out to drink

388
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,060
like last time.

389
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,540
Why is it leaking?

390
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,860
Come on, help him.

391
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,320
What are you doing?

392
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,680
You two search along this path.

393
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,720
We'll go across the river.

394
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,540
(Licensed Tavern)

395
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,820
Jiang Zhan, look at you now.

396
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,020
Run then.

397
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:30,860
Cui Yi,

398
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,620
this is the Emperor's capital.

399
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,820
How can you do as you please?

400
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,620
I'll fight it out with you.

401
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,540
What will you fight with?

402
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,820
(Yang Shengcai)
You've improved

403
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,060
in just a few months.

404
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,280
If you want to practice,

405
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,220
we'll play with you.

406
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,060
Go.

407
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,660
Enough.

408
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:27,860
Cover him.

409
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,380
Wasn't it spilled earlier?

410
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,380
This time,

411
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,500
take your time.

412
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:39,580
Drink slowly. No rush.

413
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,020
Jiang Zhan!

414
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,300
Young Master Zhan!

415
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:45,980
Jiang Zhan!

416
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,100
How's it going?

417
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,100
Speak up.

418
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,340
What?

419
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,340
Kill me.

420
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:58,900
Kill you?

421
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,480
He wants us to kill him.

422
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,060
This is the first time

423
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,420
I've heard such a request.

424
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,580
Take your time.

425
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,620
Breathe.

426
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,380
Stop playing dead.

427
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,180
Ji...

428
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,620
Is he...?

429
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,340
Jiang Zhan.

430
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:44,780
Jiang Zhan.

431
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,420
Zhan.

432
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,660
Brother...

433
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,940
What are you doing? Who's your brother?

434
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,060
Sorry, sorry.

435
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,140
Sorry.

436
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,300
Zhan?

437
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:01,940
Oh, no.

438
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,500
He's stopped breathing.

439
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,540
He's so weak.

440
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,540
He's dead.

441
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,000
What should we do now, Your Grace?

442
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,580
Strip his clothes off.

443
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,580
Sorry.

444
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,060
Zhan...

445
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:52,860
Are you alright?

446
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:56,620
Your Grace,

447
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,620
he really is dead.

448
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:03,660
Boring.

449
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,060
What should we do?

450
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,780
Why panic?

451
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,540
It's just a worthless life.

452
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,380
He's useless,

453
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,340
but his family has a title.

454
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,980
Just throw him into the river,

455
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,820
and it'll be over.

456
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,580
Come on.

457
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,260
Throw him.

458
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:35,820
Jiang Zhan.

459
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,740
Not bad.

460
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,140
Look, he's fallen into the water.

461
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:42,300
What happened?

462
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,340
He's probably drunk.

463
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,620
Wake up, Zhan.

464
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,180
(Moon House)

465
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,300
He's fallen into the water.

466
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:13,900
Mingyue,

467
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,180
if Uncle finds out,

468
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,740
what will we do?

469
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:23,100
Take all of the servants away.

470
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:24,900
Tomorrow, I don't want

471
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:25,740
to see them

472
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:26,820
in Ling'an anymore.

473
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,420
No, no.

474
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,500
Your Grace, please.

475
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,540
Go.

476
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,020
Hurry up.

477
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,580
Hurry up.

478
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:51,060
Everyone, you'll be

479
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,300
generously rewarded

480
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,260
for today.

481
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:58,100
- Thanks, Your Grace.
- Thanks, Your Grace.

482
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,100
Zhang Sheng,

483
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,420
you're the hero of the day.

484
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,300
You called Jiang Zhan here.

485
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,140
What?

486
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:09,380
A perfume buyer?

487
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,860
You're bold to say that,

488
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,340
and he's bold to believe that.

489
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,340
No, no.

490
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,220
- It was Ji's idea.
- Ji.

491
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,260
It's thanks to Ji.

492
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,180
- Ji?
- Right.

493
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,020
Ji, Ji.

494
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,340
- No, no.
- Good for you.

495
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,500
We're just

496
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,420
having fun, right?

497
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,340
Jiang Zhan

498
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,780
looked tough,

499
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,700
but I just covered his face

500
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,900
and spilled the wine,

501
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,260
and he was dead before I could finish.

502
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,820
Fortunately, Her Grace...

503
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,580
Yeah.

504
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,780
Your Grace, have you had fun today?

505
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:46,660
Boring.

506
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,380
What's the difference

507
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,580
between humans and ants?

508
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,820
There's no difference.

509
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,260
They're all yours.

510
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,900
I want

511
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,300
Jiang Si dead.

512
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,300
(Cui Mingyue,)

513
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,860
(I'll make you pay)

514
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,820
(with your blood for this now.)

515
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:12,100
(Moon House)

516
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,540
Jiang Zhan!

517
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,780
(Moon House)

518
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,940
(Clear Moon on the River)

519
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,580
It's on fire.

520
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,100
Run!

521
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,180
Run!

522
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,740
Miss Jiang.

523
00:27:58,940 --> 00:27:59,900
Those beasts...

524
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,540
Yang Shengcai, Zhang Sheng...

525
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,860
They tortured my brother

526
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,420
to death

527
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,220
and threw him

528
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,020
into this river.

529
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:16,700
(Moon House)

530
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:24,020
(Moon House)

531
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,340
Remember.

532
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,260
You were with me all night.

533
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,300
You didn't go anywhere.

534
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,340
Chief, there's a cliff downstream.

535
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,380
It's extremely dangerous.

536
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,820
If Jiang Zhan really drifted down,

537
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,140
he might've been dead by now.

538
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,300
- Keep searching.
- Yes.

539
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:28,900
(Grand Princess's Mansion)

540
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,340
Your Highness.

541
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,660
Princess Mingyue must be medicated

542
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,340
every day to avoid scars.

543
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,500
Be gentle, Mother.

544
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,100
Now you know the pain.

545
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,140
Cui Mingyue.

546
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,180
Cui Mingyue.

547
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,940
Look at the mess you've caused.

548
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:45,780
Come out.

549
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,420
Don't move.

550
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:49,860
Lie down.

551
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,260
You still know she's your daughter?

552
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,140
Can't you see how badly she's hurt?

553
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,060
What's wrong with her getting hurt?

554
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,660
At least she's still alive.

555
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,580
What about Cui Yi? He's gone.

556
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,580
He was so young, barely in his twenties.

557
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,780
He's my brother's child.

558
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,260
How can I face my brother?

559
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,460
What? Why blame Mingyue

560
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,820
for his death?

561
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,980
Did Mingyue set the fire?

562
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,580
Did Mingyue kill him?

563
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:19,580
You...

564
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,060
Everyone in this mansion knows

565
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,260
she was always

566
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,940
bossing her cousin around,

567
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,540
never showing him any respect.

568
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,300
Also,

569
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,420
she's an unmarried lady,

570
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:35,820
but she always meets

571
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,220
with a bunch of men late at night.

572
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,820
Now, the tavern caught fire.

573
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,580
Two are dead, one is wounded,

574
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,100
and one is missing.

575
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,740
She caused

576
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:45,660
this huge disaster.

577
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:48,740
As her mother, how can you defend her?

578
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:49,860
Listen.

579
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,980
If you keep spoiling her like this,

580
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,540
one day,

581
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,100
she'll lose her life.

582
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,340
Never curse

583
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,580
my daughter.

584
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,340
Mother.

585
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,340
What exactly happened last night?

586
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,900
Tell me everything.

587
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,540
Don't miss anything.

588
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:17,060
(Duke An's Mansion)

589
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,140
Be gentle.

590
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,660
Son, bear with it.

591
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,260
Physician,

592
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,820
how is

593
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,940
my son's leg injury?

594
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:34,780
Ma'am,

595
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:36,900
his leg is severely injured.

596
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,180
I'm afraid

597
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,820
he won't be able to walk again.

598
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,780
He's still so young.

599
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,100
He can't be crippled.

600
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,300
Whatever it costs,

601
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,540
we must cure him.

602
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:48,740
You should seek a better physician.

603
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,300
- Physician...
- You...

604
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,420
Please treat my leg.

605
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,260
Mother.

606
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,500
Physician, please think of something.

607
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:57,820
Physician...

608
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,580
- Mother, save my leg.
- Physician, save my son.

609
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:01,860
Physician...

610
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,740
Ji Chongyi,

611
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,780
if you harm my baby,

612
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,020
I will not let this go.

613
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,540
I'm hurt,

614
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,660
and you don't even look at me.

615
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,820
How can you be so cruel?

616
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,420
I'm cruel?

617
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:22,660
Ji Chongyi,

618
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,660
you're just a tool I used
to get into this family.

619
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,100
Whether you're crippled or not,

620
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,180
I couldn't care less.

621
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,340
You venous woman.

622
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,540
I told you

623
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,580
Princess Mingyue was overbearing.

624
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,500
Everyone in Ling'an was avoiding her,

625
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,340
yet you still tried to get close.

626
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,180
Look.

627
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,060
Look at you now.

628
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,620
What do you know as a businesswoman?

629
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,020
I'm doing all this

630
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:52,180
for the future of our family.

631
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:54,820
The Grand Princess holds power now.

632
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,100
Can I afford to offend her?

633
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,660
The court is full of intrigue.

634
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,100
Even your father can't handle it.

635
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,740
Who do you think you are

636
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:04,620
to get involved?

637
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,540
You're just seeking death.

638
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,180
If not for worrying

639
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,260
about my baby,

640
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,660
I wouldn't even bother telling you this.

641
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:14,500
My son.

642
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,100
There's hope now.

643
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:18,360
The Grand Princess sent a carriage
to pick you up.

644
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,100
Her mansion has imperial physicians.

645
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,620
They'll surely heal your leg.

646
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:22,980
That's great, Mother.

647
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,780
Let's go.

648
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,820
Why are you standing there?

649
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,260
Come here and help.

650
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,140
He can't go.

651
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,660
What did you say?

652
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,820
You don't want my son to get better?

653
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,580
- Mother.
- I've married him.

654
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,660
We're all in the same boat.

655
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:43,500
Think carefully.

656
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,100
Two people died in the fire last night.

657
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,860
One was the Censor-in-chief's son;

658
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,900
the other was General Cui's nephew.

659
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,380
The one who's missing is

660
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,180
Rite Censor Sun's grandson.

661
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,180
None of them are easy to deal with.

662
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,060
Why is it only him

663
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,420
and Princess Mingyue who survived?

664
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,020
What do you mean by that?

665
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,980
My son is also an heir.

666
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,540
He's also a noble.

667
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:05,260
Stop deceiving yourself.

668
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,740
Our family is declining now.

669
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,700
With this incident,

670
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,700
they might even strip us of our title.

671
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:18,060
The Censorate and the Rites Office

672
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,300
aren't easy to deal with.

673
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,380
They wouldn't let their kids

674
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,540
die in vain.

675
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,500
If someone has to take

676
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,180
the blame for this,

677
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:28,660
who do you think

678
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,620
the Grand Princess will push forward

679
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:31,980
to take the fall?

680
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:36,100
Right, the Grand Princess

681
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,500
probably isn't so kind.

682
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,140
So, what do you think

683
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,580
we should do now?

684
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:43,860
In any case,

685
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,260
he can't go
to the Grand Princess's Mansion.

686
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:51,020
Please go and tell the Grand Princess

687
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,060
that Chongyi can't move

688
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:54,860
because of his leg.

689
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:56,780
Good.

690
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,220
I'll go and tell her.

691
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:03,980
I didn't expect you

692
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,060
to have some conscience.

693
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:08,980
I'm not doing this for you

694
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,100
but for my baby.

695
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,580
What exactly caused

696
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,900
the fire last night?

697
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,300
For the sake of our family,

698
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,380
you should tell me the truth.

699
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,780
Actually, last night,

700
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,860
besides the five of us,

701
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,780
there was another man.

702
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,500
They're searching for someone.

703
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,940
They say many died.

704
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,460
It's dangerous.

705
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,620
How is it? Any findings?

706
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,460
No.

707
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:09,820
Long Dan,

708
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:11,620
go search over there.

709
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,620
- Yes. Follow me.
- Yes.

710
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:16,060
Anyone who finds my grandson

711
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,300
will be rewarded 1,000 taels.

712
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,580
1,000 taels.

713
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,180
It's 1,000 taels.

714
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,540
Yes, let's go find him.

715
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,500
Hurry up.

716
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,060
Over there, over there.

717
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,060
1,000 taels.

718
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,100
- 1,000 taels.
- Mr. Sun.

719
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,500
This is the Jinshui River,

720
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,420
not a small creek.

721
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,540
Even the best swimmer

722
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,480
could have an accident.

723
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,780
Please take back the reward.

724
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:36,620
You can't find my grandson.

725
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,980
Can't I search myself?

726
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,460
The more people search,

727
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,540
the greater the chance

728
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,700
of finding my grandson.

729
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,140
Over there.

730
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,540
- Look over there.
- Hurry.

731
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,500
Go look.

732
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,100
Master, Miss.

733
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,540
- How is it?
- Master, Miss.

734
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,540
Nothing there either.

735
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,180
No news is good news.

736
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,420
It'll be fine.

737
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,380
We'll definitely find your brother.

738
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,980
He's a troublemaker.

739
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,980
Troublemakers live long.

740
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,460
Someone's underwater.

741
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,100
My Lord, over here.

742
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:14,940
We found him.

743
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:16,620
We found him. Hurry.

744
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,300
Let's go, let's go.

745
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,740
Let's go, Master.

746
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,620
Move, move.

747
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:24,620
Over here, over here.

748
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,540
Hurry. Over here.

749
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,140
- Save him.
- Come and save him.

750
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,140
Over there.

751
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,540
Master.

752
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:33,660
- Hurry and pull him up.
- Pull him up.

753
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:35,670
Hurry.

754
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,440
Get him up.

755
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:41,520
Got him.

756
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,580
It's really him.

757
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:43,660
The purple robe...

758
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:48,660
Sheng loved purple robes the most.

759
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,100
Sheng...

760
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:54,420
How can you do this?

761
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:58,420
How can you let your grandpa bury you?

762
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,380
- Chief.
- Miss.

763
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,220
Si.

764
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,780
- Miss.
- Send her back.

765
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:04,620
Yes.

766
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,020
Miss,

767
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,660
you haven't eaten anything all day.

768
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,100
At least drink some hot soup.

769
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,340
Aman,

770
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,540
any news about my brother?

771
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,580
It's all my fault.

772
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,060
It's my fault.

773
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:17,500
Uncle,

774
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,140
why not go back and rest?

775
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,300
I'll stay here.

776
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,060
Why is the Jinshui River

777
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,220
so deep

778
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,500
and so long?

779
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:34,220
You can't overexert yourself.

780
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,420
How can you keep searching if you do?

781
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,500
If we find him,

782
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,420
will he still be alive?

783
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,300
Sure.

784
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,960
He'll certainly be alive.

785
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:03,940
I...

786
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:08,380
I'm not worthy to be a father.

787
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:11,940
Since he was young,

788
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:15,300
I've never disciplined him.

789
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:18,020
When he grew up,

790
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,220
all I did was scold him

791
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,100
and complain.

792
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,900
I never truly cared about him.

793
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,100
Though he was mischievous,

794
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,620
he was a good kid.

795
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:45,860
I failed him.

796
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,140
Uncle, don't worry.

797
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,580
I will definitely find him.

798
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,140
We'll definitely find him.

799
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:05,980
Yes.

800
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:12,100
We'll definitely find him.

801
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:19,980
Your Highness,

802
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,460
you must help me.

803
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,300
Your Highness,

804
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,300
my son was burned.

805
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:27,420
His face is unrecognizable.

806
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:30,740
This is horrible, Your Highness.

807
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,300
Mr. Zhang, sorry for your loss.

808
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:36,660
But I don't understand

809
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,900
why your son

810
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,540
was

811
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,900
with Princess Mingyue.

812
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,500
Your Highness, please trust me.

813
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:49,220
You're the reason why I'm here today.

814
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,060
And I am

815
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:53,220
loyal to you.

816
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:55,460
Zhang Sheng

817
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,620
was only my concubine's son.

818
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,660
He was uneducated

819
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,020
and unambitious,

820
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:03,940
failing in the imperial exams
time and again.

821
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:07,540
I also neglected to discipline him.

822
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:10,260
I have no idea how this rascal

823
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:12,180
got involved

824
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,860
with Princess Mingyue.

825
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:20,980
Though his mother was a concubine,

826
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,740
he was still your son.

827
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:26,900
It's too bad

828
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:27,960
that he was burned to death

829
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,580
somehow like this.

830
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:32,860
Your Highness,

831
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,860
it's the Grand Princess's fault
for bad parenting.

832
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,460
Princess Mingyue is undisciplined,

833
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:40,940
indulging in pleasures
and losing herself,

834
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:42,860
which has led to the accident

835
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,260
and killed several men.

836
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:46,980
Your Highness,

837
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,540
I'll report it to His Majesty

838
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,980
and demand Princess Mingyue be punished.

839
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:05,020
