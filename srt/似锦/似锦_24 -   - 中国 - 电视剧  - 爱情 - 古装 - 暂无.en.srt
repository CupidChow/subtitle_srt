11
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,040
Come here!

12
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,120
Take shelter here.

13
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,600
Careful.

14
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,880
Get on.

15
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,080
It's raining heavily.

16
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,610
The palace gates are about to close.

17
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,510
Are you going out?

18
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,240
Yes.

19
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,760
(Princess Fuqing)
Is it bustling outside?

20
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,310
Of course.

21
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,190
Much more so than in the Palace,

22
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,140
especially at the Lantern Festival
in the West Market.

23
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,600
There are all kinds of lanterns.

24
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:21,750
They're amazing.

25
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,080
Also, the fireworks

26
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,680
are breathtaking.

27
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,200
You have to

28
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,600
see for yourself someday.

29
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,120
Have you never seen them?

30
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,950
The rain is about to stop.

31
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,480
I'll walk you out.

32
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:56,870
Uh...

33
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,490
is it too much trouble?

34
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,430
Not at all.

35
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,760
Thank you then.

36
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,950
Princess Fuqing?

37
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,710
(Is she that princess)

38
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,680
(who's said to have eye disease?)

39
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,440
Your Highness! Your Highness!

40
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,470
Your Highness,

41
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,320
I've finally found you.

42
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,310
Are you alright?

43
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,040
Greetings, sir.

44
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,030
Your Highness, I was so worried

45
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,390
when the rain poured down just now.

46
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,560
Please don't ever

47
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,040
go out alone again.

48
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,640
Your Highness.

49
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,710
I failed to recognize you earlier.

50
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:06,950
I'm sorry

51
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,600
for my rudeness.

52
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,920
It's fine.

53
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,270
No one had ever said that.

54
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,200
They had never told me

55
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,630
about those fun things to see and do

56
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,640
in case I became upset.

57
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,840
Ms. Hua,

58
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,350
he's leaving.

59
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,680
Please walk him out for me.

60
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,320
Yes.

61
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,090
Let's go back, Your Highness.

62
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,680
Good night, Your Highness.

63
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,230
Miss!

64
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,270
Bad news, Miss!

65
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,000
Is Commandant Yu alright?

66
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,150
He's fine. It's Duke An's heir.

67
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,130
He died all of a sudden

68
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,120
when drinking with girls.

69
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,270
Died all of a sudden?

70
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,240
What about Qiaoniang?

71
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,390
I knew you'd be worried

72
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,320
and asked about her.

73
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,870
Everyone in Duke An's Mansion

74
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,200
is looking forward to her baby,

75
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,190
the sole lineal grandson

76
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,070
of great significance.

77
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,560
I hope Qiaoniang will be fine.

78
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,710
Ji Chongyi died...

79
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,680
(He had died much earlier last time.)

80
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,870
(I thought as things changed,)

81
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:28,880
(he'd live,)

82
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,000
(but he ended up the same.)

83
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,120
(It was probably his fate.)

84
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,760
Smells so good!

85
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,480
How long will it be done?

86
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,760
In a second.

87
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:15,830
Taste it, Zhan.

88
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,560
Is it good?

89
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,470
So rich and flavorful!

90
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,350
I... I want more.

91
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,150
Chief,

92
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,490
here come noodles. Let's eat.

93
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,030
No.

94
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,640
No?

95
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,760
Still waiting for Miss Si's fish soup?

96
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,830
Mind your own business

97
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,160
or those things in the office.

98
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,680
Fine. I won't get between you two.

99
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,590
I'll go once I'm done.

100
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:57,260
(Fragrance Shop)

101
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,710
Stop sighing,

102
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,190
or you'll drive away

103
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,640
all our clients.

104
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,760
Qi is a rare catch.

105
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,640
He's most reliable and charming.

106
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,760
He and Si make a perfect match.

107
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:26,670
Lift your arm.

108
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,640
So what?

109
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,440
My sister

110
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,950
deserves the best man in the world.

111
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,680
Be reasonable.

112
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,560
In all of Ling'an,

113
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,680
there's hardly anyone

114
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:42,790
better than Qi.

115
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,000
This side.

116
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,510
I disagree.

117
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,920
I think I'm

118
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,000
as good as him

119
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,230
if

120
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,710
not a tad better.

121
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:59,600
You...

122
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,950
What's that supposed to mean?

123
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,510
If you ask me,

124
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,080
people are different.

125
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,950
No need to compare yourself with others.

126
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,950
Ever since he and Si became close,

127
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,760
she's been paying
less and less attention to me.

128
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,640
It can't go on like this!

129
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,080
Look at you

130
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,800
being so jealous already.

131
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,590
When she

132
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,640
gets married,

133
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,390
won't you feel even worse?

134
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:54,750
Yu Jin.

135
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:56,990
What are you doing here?

136
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,080
Why are you here?

137
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,800
I'm here for something important.

138
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:02,990
Speak.

139
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,440
Aren't you going to let me in?

140
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,720
What if I speak up,

141
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,870
and everyone hears?

142
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,320
I don't mind, though.

143
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,080
The door's over there.

144
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,520
Yu Jin.

145
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,560
Yu Jin.

146
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,080
Are you living in this hut?

147
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,630
It's way beneath you.

148
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,160
When will Uncle reinstate you as prince?

149
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,950
I heard you two had met

150
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,800
at the Mid-Autumn Hunt.

151
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,590
What's your point?

152
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:43,800
Yu Jin,

153
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,230
my point is

154
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,280
we're family.

155
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,320
That dog bites,

156
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,160
Yu Jin!

157
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,200
Cui Mingyue, cut to the chase.

158
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,590
Then get out.

159
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,200
Yu Jin,

160
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,230
if that's your attitude,

161
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,960
I'll talk to Jiang Si instead.

162
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,110
Your Grace probably forgot

163
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,040
about my warning.

164
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,750
I remember

165
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,590
every word you've said.

166
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,230
Although you're mean to me,

167
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,320
I can't blame you.

168
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,630
But Jiang Si is different.

169
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,520
A humble earl's daughter

170
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,230
is no match for the Grand Princess.

171
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:33,830
If you...

172
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,040
If you obey me,

173
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,990
I won't give her a hard time.

174
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,960
Can we sit down and talk now?

175
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,130
There's nothing to talk about.

176
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,200
Here's my only advice.

177
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,110
Stay away from Jiang Si.

178
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,160
Some bravado you got, Prince Jin.

179
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:53,600
She still doesn't know

180
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,040
who you really are, right?

181
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,200
A prince is

182
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,360
way out of the league

183
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,110
of a powerless earl's daughter.

184
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,590
Yu Jin, your wife

185
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,750
should match your status,

186
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,440
who's noble

187
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,160
and well-connected.

188
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,550
Although Jiang Si is

189
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,950
good-looking

190
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,630
and seductive as her mother,

191
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,110
making men fall for her,

192
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,200
you should know

193
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,320
it's no more than a fling.

194
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:28,750
You two won't make it

195
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,040
even without me.

196
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,680
Who's there?

197
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,630
You should leave.

198
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:42,630
At ease.

199
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,800
Here you are being so caring and sweet.

200
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,990
Su seduced my father the same way, huh?

201
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,390
It was Commandant Yu

202
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,230
who made you mad.

203
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,200
Why vent your anger on me?

204
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,510
You said

205
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,350
my mother and I seduced men.

206
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,160
Your Grace,

207
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,800
why not try it yourself

208
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,350
and see if it'll work?

209
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,200
There aren't noble or dirty ways

210
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,720
as long as they work.

211
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,200
How shameless!

212
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,750
You think I was complimenting you?

213
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,160
You came alone,

214
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,790
insisting on chatting with Mr. Yu,

215
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,270
and threatened him to comply.

216
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:25,080
Weren't you trying to seduce him?

217
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,320
But he has no interest in you.

218
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,350
This is the first time I've seen

219
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,910
a girl harassing a man

220
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:31,930
when he asks her to leave.

221
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,400
A County Princess like you

222
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,560
is indeed bolder.

223
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:35,600
Clearly, a decent girl

224
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,230
like me is not your match.

225
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,280
Your Grace, will you leave,

226
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,710
or shall I make you go?

227
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,390
Stop.

228
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,630
You're the 7th Prince.

229
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,040
You crossed the line.

230
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,160
Just you wait.

231
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,270
Did you hear everything?

232
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,990
I'd tell you later.

233
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,550
I didn't mean to keep it from you.

234
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,680
Behave yourself, Prince Jin.

235
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,680
I apologize for not recognizing you

236
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,190
and offending you before.

237
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,440
Let's go, Aman.

238
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,440
Yu Jin, your wife

239
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,630
should match your status,

240
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,350
who's noble

241
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,040
and well-connected.

242
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:35,400
Eat now.

243
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,200
Eat it.

244
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,110
Are you on a fast like him?

245
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:49,900
You...

246
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,680
Chief,

247
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,120
stop splitting firewood

248
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,200
in the middle of the night.

249
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:57,990
Look,

250
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,440
we can fight on the battlefield,

251
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,630
but you can't do this.

252
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,800
Stop, please.

253
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:06,080
Chief, I'll help you.

254
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,630
I'll apologize to Miss Si for you.

255
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,040
Alright?

256
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,840
Wait, no.

257
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:14,750
Go with the ax.

258
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,750
Is it to kill?

259
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,790
I need you to tell her

260
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,510
not to bottle up her anger.

261
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,470
Vent it on me!

262
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,350
Relax, Chief.

263
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,840
Once she sees me,

264
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,320
she'll know your apology

265
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,200
is sincere.

266
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,800
I'm on it now.

267
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,960
Go.

268
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,160
This stab

269
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,560
is for my husband,

270
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,800
Yu Qi.

271
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,400
Why did you kill him, too?

272
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,800
Do you think

273
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,400
he's just that Yu Qi you know?

274
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,440
(Turns out, Yu Qi is)

275
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,800
(the 7th Prince, who's said to be cursed.)

276
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,830
(He never told me about that.)

277
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,750
(The Grand Princess, after learning)

278
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,400
(about his identity,)

279
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,680
(feared that he'd threaten her power.)

280
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,870
(She deprived him of his military power)

281
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,950
(and Chiyu Cavalry)

282
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,750
(before declaring him dead.)

283
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:27,670
(But her daughter)

284
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,870
(was in love with Yu Qi.)

285
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,440
(So, she kept him alive)

286
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:32,830
(but caged in the Palace.)

287
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,520
Are you still mad, Miss?

288
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:49,400
I can go through that hole

289
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,590
to see Commandant Yu,

290
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,200
no Prince Jin,

291
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,200
and beat him up

292
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,230
for you.

293
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:55,920
Who says I'm mad at him?

294
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,990
Actually, I'm mad at myself.

295
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm mad that I

296
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,190
knew so little about him

297
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,830
and got kept in the dark for so long.

298
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:09,870
But

299
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,190
it hasn't been too long

300
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,830
since you two met, right?

301
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,830
You canceled the engagement.

302
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:17,240
Then he moved in

303
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,560
and...

304
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,720
I feel as if

305
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,040
it's as long as two lifetimes.

(Prince Qi's Mansion)

323
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,720
You're right, Your Highness.

324
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,080
The Crown Prince
and Grand Princess are close.

325
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,560
When following him last night,

326
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:41,870
I found a powerful official

327
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,150
going to her mansion

328
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,320
with him.

329
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:45,750
Who was it?

330
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,110
I'm sorry.

331
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,520
Crown Prince's guards saw me

332
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,390
before I could get a good look.

333
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:51,960
I had a narrow escape.

334
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,080
That man's identity is unknown yet.

335
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,040
Go back and rest.

336
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,590
Thanks, Your Highness.

337
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:10,870
Where's your mask?

338
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,350
Your Highness,

339
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,240
I must've dropped it in the fight.

340
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,910
It was my fault. Please forgive me.

341
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,390
Don't worry.

342
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:26,760
Your Highness, I think

343
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,280
no one saw my face.

344
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,830
He was trained for years.

345
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,800
What a shame.

346
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,000
Your Highness.

347
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,590
Bury him properly.

348
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,240
Give his family 100 taels of silver.

349
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,350
100 taels?

350
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,430
He served me for years.

351
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,910
He deserved it.

352
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,800
I wish I wouldn't need to pay a copper

353
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,150
as long as he lived.

354
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,870
It's our great honor to be at your disposal,

355
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,110
Your Highness.

356
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,190
What's this, darling?

357
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,590
(Everlasting Prosperity)

358
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:14,960
When I went to the Palace

359
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,110
to greet Mother earlier,

360
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,160
I learned that Jin had returned

361
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,590
from the South

362
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:21,630
and gone to the Capital Security Office.

363
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,630
(Princess Qi)
I took the liberty

364
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,110
of preparing this gift for you.

365
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,520
You know,

366
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,110
that's really thoughtful.

367
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,960
I was wondering

368
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,190
how to get close to him.

369
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,580
We haven't met for years.

370
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,110
Mother said

371
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,480
Father hadn't

372
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,870
reinstated his position.

373
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,110
Speaking of which,

374
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,430
I'm clueless as well.

375
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,800
Father called him back

376
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,880
but made him work undercover

377
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,090
in the Capital Security Office.

378
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,760
Why?

379
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,870
After serving in the military for so long,

380
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,190
he has gained prestige.

381
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,550
The Chiyu Cavalry trained by him

382
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,630
is considered formidable.

383
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:08,400
But in the past,

384
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,550
Father seemed to

385
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,870
forget about him.

386
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,910
Why did he suddenly...?

387
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,800
Maybe there are certain things

388
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,590
that no one can do

389
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,870
but him.

390
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:30,240
Zhen Heng of Capital Security

391
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:31,760
might be a tough one,

392
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:34,080
but he's a scholar after all.

393
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:36,080
He's incapable of harsh means.

394
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,080
To think Father
questioned Cao Xingyu himself.

395
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,910
Maybe

396
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,390
that was pushed by Jin.

397
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,630
I know little about court affairs,

398
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,550
but you and Jin are brothers.

399
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,080
You two are of the same mother.

400
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,080
You're closer than others for sure.

401
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,670
As you said,

402
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,590
he's highly respected in the military.

403
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:00,240
He can be of great help

404
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,190
to your future plan.

405
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,320
You have a point, darling.

406
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,960
Father called him back secretly.

407
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,200
That means the past

408
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,080
is the past.

409
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,970
Maybe he'll entrust Jin with important work.

410
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:13,830
It'll do us no harm

411
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:14,670
to win him over now.

412
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,280
I have an idea.

413
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,670
Why don't we hold

414
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:21,080
a family banquet to welcome him back?

415
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,520
I heard he didn't get married.

416
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,240
I can invite

417
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,320
some noble girls I know.

418
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:28,170
Jin and the girls can get to know each other.

419
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:30,240
What do you think?

420
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:32,670
Brilliant!

421
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,390
I can take this chance

422
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,190
to sound my brother out

423
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,590
and see if he's greedy for power, money,

424
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,320
or girls.

425
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,080
Er'niu!

426
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,520
Er'niu!

427
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,520
I'm counting on you.

428
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:54,630
Go!

429
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:16,700
(Morning Drizzle)

430
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,840
Er'niu?

431
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,080
Look, Miss.

432
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,450
Bearing rods to apologize.

433
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,140
(Qi)

434
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,720
Jin.

435
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,520
Jin,

436
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,960
we're reunited.

437
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,560
Finally!

438
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:00,430
I prepared a gift for you.

439
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,190
Thanks, Prince Qi.

440
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:06,150
That's too polite of you.

441
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,800
Call me Zhang or Brother.

442
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,320
Brother.

443
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:14,830
I didn't know you had come back

444
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,760
or settled down in such a shack.

445
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,380
You've suffered too much.

446
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,590
Why don't you live with us

447
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,410
before receiving your title and mansion?

448
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,760
No, thanks.

449
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,110
I'm used to

450
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,670
living alone.

451
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,270
I don't want to

452
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,830
trouble you and your wife.

453
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,630
No trouble at all.

454
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,560
We're brothers.

455
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,870
Fine, I won't force you

456
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,150
if you don't want to move in.

457
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,040
But now that you're back,

458
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:42,040
we should at least get together

459
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,240
to catch up, right?

460
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,720
My wife has arranged a dinner banquet

461
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,190
to welcome you home.

462
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,150
I...

463
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,630
That's too extravagant.

464
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,920
I... I prefer solitude.

465
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,760
Yu Jin,

466
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,910
here in Ling'an,

467
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
it's necessary

468
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
to make connections

469
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:04,000
to keep a foothold.

470
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,460
(To the 7th Prince, Yu Jin)

471
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,320
Thanks, Brother.

472
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,240
I have to go to work.

473
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,390
Please excuse me.

474
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,350
Sure, go ahead.

475
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,390
See you at my mansion.

476
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,760
Chief,

477
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,350
are you going to Prince Qi's banquet?

478
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,910
Going there my foot!

479
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,480
Your Highness, My Lady,

480
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,150
invitations to tomorrow's banquet

481
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,830
have been prepared and sent to the guests

482
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:41,950
on the list.

483
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,190
Send one to

484
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:47,000
Earl Dongping's Mansion, too.

485
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:49,590
Yes.

486
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,910
Earl Dongping's Mansion?

487
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,640
Jiang Si is well-known in town

488
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,760
for her beauty.

489
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,590
But she made a fuss

490
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,630
in order not to

491
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,110
marry Duke An's heir.

492
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:01,560
Her name was impaired.

493
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,590
I fear Jin'll mistake it,

494
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,040
thinking we look down on him.

495
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,590
That's fine.

496
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:10,630
My biggest fear is

497
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,390
what if

498
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,870
he doesn't come.

499
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,720
You two are brothers.

500
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,240
He won't embarrass you in front of others.

501
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,320
I hope not.

502
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,400
(To Earl's Lineal Daughter, Jiang Si)

503
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,520
Mother,

504
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,910
Si shouldn't go.

505
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:31,630
We're talking about Prince Qi's banquet.

506
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,240
All the guests

507
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:34,550
are leading celebrities

508
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,350
in town.

509
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,430
If any of them takes an interest in Si,

510
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,910
she'll be in luck.

511
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,920
That's exactly why

512
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,830
I don't want her to

513
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,480
get involved in those prominent clans.

514
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:47,680
She'll suffer

515
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,870
if she's married into one.

516
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:54,040
You're worrying too much.

517
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:56,110
If it were before

518
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,720
when she was soft,

519
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:00,350
she'd probably have a hard time.

520
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,520
But ever since she almost drowned,

521
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,560
she's become way too tough.

522
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,240
We should be glad if she doesn't

523
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,430
make others suffer.

524
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,870
I'm afraid

525
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,520
none of those clans

526
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,350
will marry their heirs to her.

527
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,350
Good!

528
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,870
I won't marry her to them either!

529
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,040
My Lady, Miss Si is here.

530
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,190
Grandmother.

531
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,000
Father.

532
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,240
Aunt Xiao.

533
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,960
Si,

534
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:33,240
Fu told you about it, right?

535
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,760
Prince Qi's Mansion sent an invitation

536
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,150
to you to their banquet earlier.

537
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,240
You should be dressed up.

538
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,240
I have

539
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:43,430
a set of the finest emerald jewelry.

540
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,870
Take it when you leave.

541
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:45,910
Thanks, Grandmother,

542
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,910
but I won't

543
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,080
go to that banquet.

544
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,350
Even Prince Qi's Mansion

545
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:55,280
isn't good enough for you?

546
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:56,400
I have no desire

547
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,950
to be married into a distinguished clan.

548
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,800
I just want to live an ordinary life.

549
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:03,190
Good! That's my daughter.

550
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:04,720
Do you hear that?

551
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,830
Given that attitude,

552
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:07,400
none of those clans

553
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,910
will choose her.

554
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:20,640
I hate Long Dan!

555
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,590
Why isn't he here yet?

556
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:27,950
Aman!

557
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,590
Aman!

558
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,190
Stop! Stay right here!

559
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:34,890
I'm not allowed to see you.

560
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,910
Aman,

561
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,390
come on. You're the best.

562
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:41,790
Tell me how we can

563
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:43,040
cheer Miss Si up.

564
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,890
Chief's so frustrated
that he splits firewood every day.

565
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,590
We've got more than enough for a year.

566
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:48,960
He doesn't eat

567
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,240
or sleep.

568
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,790
He's lost tons of weight.

569
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:53,150
It pains me to see him like that.

570
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:54,910
I'm begging you!

571
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,000
He lied to Miss Si.

572
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,840
He deserves it!

573
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:00,430
So do you for helping him.

574
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:25,960
Chief simply made

575
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,830
the same mistake

576
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,040
every man makes.

577
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,200
Why can't Miss Si let it go?

578
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,040
What?

579
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,350
- Long Dan!
- Listen,

580
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,480
she's invited to

581
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,590
Prince Qi's banquet.

582
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:35,630
We'll go and see

583
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:37,070
if every man is as terrible

584
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,240
as your chief!

585
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,040
Miss!

586
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,590
Go ahead. We won't stop you.

587
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,070
You said so yourself!

588
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:51,000
- We'll go!
- Stop them!

589
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,040
Aman, let's go.

590
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,320
She... she left.

591
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,940
Stop them, stop them, stop them!

592
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,190
I thought you said the opposite.

593
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:21,940
(Grand Princess's Mansion)

594
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:30,590
Aunt.

595
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,590
What's wrong this time?

596
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:40,280
Aunt, did you hear

597
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,790
that Jin had returned quietly

598
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:44,110
from the South?

599
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:45,920
He's been working undercover

600
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,120
in the Capital Security Office.

601
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:50,590
And he's brought down

602
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:51,960
Earl Changxing's Mansion.

603
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,720
Was all that Father's order?

604
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,400
What's his attitude

605
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,560
toward Jin?

606
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,270
Will he pose a threat to my heirdom...?

607
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,630
Don't panic.

608
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,430
As the Crown Prince,

609
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,830
you shall always remain calm.

610
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,870
How could I remain calm, Aunt?

611
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:13,590
Father's never satisfied with me.

612
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:14,630
I was appointed

613
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,960
Crown Prince

614
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,000
simply because I was

615
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,100
the late Empress's only son.

616
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,000
Zhang has been

617
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,190
challenging me over the years.

618
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,400
Now that

619
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,420
his brother, Jin, is back,

620
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,830
he'll gain great help, won't he?

621
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,320
Relax.

622
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,400
Yu Jin returned

623
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,720
without permission.

624
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,150
His Majesty had to cover for him

625
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,830
in case he was impeached.

626
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:40,950
Really?

627
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:44,720
Why would I lie?

628
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:46,630
Be seated.

629
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,800
But

630
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,520
he and Prince Qi are of the same mother.

631
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,960
He has great prestige in the Chiyu Cavalry.

632
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,720
We have to beware of him.

633
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,390
You're wise, Aunt.

634
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:02,720
I'll be cautious.

635
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:06,430
Aunt, without you,

636
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,800
I'd be so lost!

637
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,520
Aren't you sweet?

638
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,080
Mother!

639
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,040
So loud. Where are your manners?

640
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,430
Mingyue is still young

641
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:17,910
and naive.

642
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,480
Greetings, Cousin Lang.

643
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:21,670
Mother,

644
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:23,630
did you hear

645
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,750
that Prince Qi'd hold a banquet today

646
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,390
to welcome Prince Jin back?

647
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:31,150
Why the fuss?

648
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,440
Prince Qi also invited many girls

649
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,590
from prominent clans.

650
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,240
That's not to welcome Prince Jin back

651
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:39,190
but to choose a wife for him.

652
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,830
Among all the princes,

653
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:43,830
I've never seen Mingyue

654
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,190
being so interested in any of them.

655
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,630
Cousin Lang,

656
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,150
Mother,

657
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,870
you probably don't know.

658
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:58,280
That day,

659
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,520
after I fell into the Jinshui River,

660
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,800
it was Prince Jin who got me out.

661
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,560
So?

662
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,040
So...

663
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,910
I want him, too.

664
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:12,960
Do you like Yu Jin?

665
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,000
I always let you have your way

666
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:22,190
except for being with Yu Jin.

667
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,280
Why?

668
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,560
You and Consort Xian are enemies,

669
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:28,830
so I can't marry

670
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:30,320
someone I admire?

671
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:32,200
He's

672
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,870
a cursed prince.

673
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,110
He doesn't deserve your admiration.

674
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,720
You're old enough

675
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:41,520
to get married.

676
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,430
I've chosen

677
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,870
a few men for you.

678
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:47,100
Let me tell you about them.

679
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:47,840
Don't bother.

680
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,910
I just want Prince Jin.

681
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,040
Aunt,

682
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:53,590
Mingyue is still a naive girl.

683
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:55,590
It's normal to fall for someone.

684
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,840
You know,

685
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,830
Jin

686
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:59,390
grew up at the border.

687
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:01,150
He isn't close

688
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,870
to Prince Qi or Consort Xian.

689
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,720
Once he marries Mingyue,

690
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,910
won't we gain

691
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:07,480
huge support from him?

692
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,590
How many times have I said

693
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,400
not to involve Mingyue

694
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,750
in power struggle?

695
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,240
Crown Prince,

696
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,720
have you forgotten?

697
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,640
Sorry, Aunt.

698
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:21,100
I'll keep that in mind.

699
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,320
Guard.

700
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,760
Yes.

701
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,520
Watch my daughter closely

702
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,670
before Prince Qi's banquet ends.

703
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,000
She cannot go out.

704
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,160
Yes.

705
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,000
Please, Your Grace.

706
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:35,880
So unfair!

707
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,920
Aunt, Mingyue's spoiled.

708
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,330
She didn't mean what she said.

709
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:45,480
Don't take it to heart.

710
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:46,900
I'll talk some sense into her.

711
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,710
Yu Jin,

712
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:02,480
the 7th Prince...

713
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,680
Mingyue!

714
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,640
Mingyue!

715
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:09,960
There you are.

716
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,440
Why weren't you inside

717
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,520
to be lectured by my mother?

718
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,640
Why did you come out?

719
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,750
I hate to see girls' tears the most,

720
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,590
not to mention you're my cousin.

721
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,310
Mother is so unreasonable.

722
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,670
I can't go out.

723
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,520
Can you go to that banquet for me, please?

724
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,510
Pretty please!

725
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:34,360
Alright, fine.

726
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:35,760
I'll go there

727
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,270
to sabotage it for you.

728
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:50,620
(Prince Qi's Mansion)

729
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:52,670
With little etiquette left,

730
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:53,710
even the rabble

731
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:55,000
can enter Prince Qi's Mansion.

732
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,720
Let me check

733
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:59,360
if that invitation is forged.

734
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,040
(Ji Fanghua, Duke An's 3rd Daughter)
What?

735
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,150
Princess Qi had it

736
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:03,590
sent to Miss Si.

737
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,800
What are you doing?

738
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,480
How dare a maid interrupt!

739
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,070
Clearly, no one in your house

740
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:11,190
has manners.

741
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,280
I shall

742
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,080
teach her a lesson.

743
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,360
You're mad because I canceled the engagement

744
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:17,670
with your brother

745
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,080
and trying to take revenge.

746
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:20,030
How absurd!

747
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:21,790
It was my brother

748
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,840
who abandoned you, jinx!

749
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,000
Let bygones be bygones.

750
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,220
(Kou Lingbo, Granddaughter
of Grand Preceptor Kou)

751
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,150
Let me see.

752
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,080
Princess Qi is my cousin.

753
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,960
This doesn't match her handwriting.

754
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,310
She is indeed suspicious.

755
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:50,710
I knew it.

756
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:53,190
How could a humble girl like her

757
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,000
be invited to Prince Qi's Mansion?

758
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,880
Forgive me if I'm ignorant,

759
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,630
but I've never heard

760
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,310
that the hostess would

761
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,440
write invitations herself.

762
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:04,550
That's right.

763
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:06,110
Even in our humble abode,

764
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:08,230
we'd have the gatehouse do such work.

765
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:09,390
You...

766
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:15,310
Ling... Lingbo can't be wrong.

767
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:16,840
Is Princess Qi close to you

768
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,040
or her?

769
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,200
I don't know her,

770
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,440
but since she sent

771
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,630
an invitation to me,

772
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,190
she must've had her reason.

773
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,400
If you two insist

774
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,960
that I can't go in,

775
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,590
I shall explain everything to Princess Qi

776
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,750
in case she feels insulted,

777
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:31,150
thinking I have no manners.

778
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:35,440
Please send in a message for me

779
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,840
that Jiang Si

780
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,230
is kept outside by these two girls.

781
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,190
I'm unable to greet Princess Qi today.

782
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,680
Yes.

783
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,200
Wait!

784
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,560
Go ahead then.

785
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,600
Don't bluff!

786
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,590
Lingbo's grandfather is Grand Preceptor Kou.

787
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,310
Her uncle is the Vice Prime Minister

788
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,880
while your father is a mere 5th-rank earl.

789
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,920
If you sit with us,

790
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,750
won't you feel inferior?

791
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,750
So what if you're of noble birth?

792
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,310
You sound

793
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:02,590
even ruder than a boor.

794
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,040
Aman, let's go.

795
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:05,030
Yes.

796
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:10,740
(Prince Qi's Mansion)

797
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:20,140
(Everlasting Prosperity)

798
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:28,990
Everyone,

799
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:31,840
this banquet is to welcome

800
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,920
my brother, Jin, home.

801
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,480
Welcome back, Jin.

802
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,790
Let's toast to his return!

803
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,190
- Cheers.
- Hear! Hear!

804
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,040
The Crown Prince has arrived!

805
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:46,310
Greetings, Your Highness.

806
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,680
What now?

807
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:50,960
You invited all our brothers

808
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,920
but me, huh?

809
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,150
I'm simply having

810
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,840
a casual dinner with my brothers.

811
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:00,110
Am I not

812
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:01,790
your brother?

813
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,230
You're too busy, Your Highness.

814
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,040
I wouldn't dare disturb you.

815
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,840
Be seated.

816
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,840
Sit, everyone.

817
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,840
You're also here, Jin.

818
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,320
Your Highness.

819
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,600
Prince Qi,

820
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:27,960
this is your fault.

821
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,750
Why didn't you tell me?

822
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,120
Uh...

823
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,590
I made a lapse.

824
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,110
Please forgive me.

825
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,120
Jin,

826
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,360
we're brothers.

827
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,750
Although we've never met before,

828
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,750
no need to be too polite.

829
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Yes, Your Highness.

830
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,790
Knowing that you came back,

831
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,110
I meant to

832
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:47,670
go with our brothers to drink with you.

833
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:49,440
But you don't

834
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:51,480
have a title or a mansion yet.

835
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:53,270
We don't have

836
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,840
a place to drink.

837
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:58,480
We can

838
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,480
drink anywhere

839
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,320
but not with anyone.

840
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,480
You mean it's the people,

841
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:12,920
not the place that matters, huh?

842
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,280
If we fail to

843
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,880
make Jin happy today,

844
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,840
we'll be to blame.

845
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,920
Am I right?

846
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,560
- Yes, that's right.
- Yes.

847
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,760
Let's

848
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,000
- get plastered with Jin!
- Good.

849
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,360
I appreciate

850
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:26,710
your kindness,

851
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:29,710
but I don't drink.

852
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:33,360
I'll toast you with tea instead.

853
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:34,920
Sorry for my negligence.

854
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:36,480
Serve tea.

855
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:41,630
I heard you

856
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,520
and your Chiyu Cavalry were invincible.

857
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,400
How could

858
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,960
a warrior like you be afraid of a drink?

859
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,360
Your Highness,

860
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,840
all eight of us

861
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,670
have finally got together.

862
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:15,480
Whether we drink liquor or tea,

863
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:17,310
our brotherhood remains

864
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:19,310
the same as ever.

865
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,630
If it's the same,

866
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:23,270
why drink tea?

867
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,760
What if

868
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:25,920
I must see

869
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,150
how much Ji can drink?

870
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:33,840
Jin,

871
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:35,880
please.

872
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,440
If you insist on making me drink,

873
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:43,310
I'll comply.

874
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:07,880
Ever since I joined the Chiyu Cavalry,

875
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:09,790
I've made a pledge not to drink

876
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,360
for the sake of warfare.

877
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,590
If I drink, I shall be

878
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,080
punished by military law.

879
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:18,750
If His Majesty got wind of this,

880
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:20,790
what would he think?

881
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,720
Never mind.

882
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:26,920
I wouldn't dare disobey your order.

883
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,790
I toast you, Lang.

884
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,670
Are you threatening me, Yu Jin?

885
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,750
I wouldn't dare.

886
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,840
I'm following your order

887
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,000
at the risk of my life.

888
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:43,960
Don't take it seriously.

889
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:45,630
I was joking with you.

890
