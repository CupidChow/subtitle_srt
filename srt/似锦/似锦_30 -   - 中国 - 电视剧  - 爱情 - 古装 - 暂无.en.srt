(Earl Dongping's Mansion)

(Earl's Wife, Su Ke's Tablet)

13
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,230
Now,

14
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,390
the three of you swear

15
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,640
on your mother's tablet

16
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,840
that you'll never

17
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,280
avenge her death

18
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,640
on the Grand Princess.

19
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,790
Do you hear me?

20
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,120
No.

21
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,430
Si has confirmed

22
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,400
that she had Xiao

23
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,510
kill our mother.

24
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,440
As her son,

25
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,390
I must avenge her death.

26
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,750
- You fool!
- Zhan!

27
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,440
Who do you think you are?

28
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,080
What can you do to her?

29
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,480
Father,

30
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,760
I know you mean to protect us.

31
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,440
The Grand Princess is too powerful.

32
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,440
You fear

33
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,710
we'll fail and end up dead,

34
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,040
right?

35
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,160
Yi,

36
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,790
you're the eldest.

37
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,200
You're also a parent.

38
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,000
You know better than anyone

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,200
how I feel as your father.

40
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,200
Right now,

41
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,400
if your daughter, Yan,

42
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,510
were in danger,

43
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,150
wouldn't you protect her

44
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,760
at all costs?

45
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,830
I don't want anything

46
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,430
but the three of you

47
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,880
living in peace for the rest of your lives.

48
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,520
Back then,

49
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,320
I failed to protect your mother.

50
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,720
Now,

51
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,590
whatever it takes,

52
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:21,440
I can't put you in harm's way!

53
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:23,950
Swear to me now.

54
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,280
Fine.

55
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,160
I swear to you.

56
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,600
Yi!

57
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,390
You've

58
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,950
always been the most obedient.

59
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,320
I never need to worry about you.

60
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,550
Father!

61
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,670
If you

62
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,240
insist on

63
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,270
risking your life for revenge,

64
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,320
then get out of this house.

65
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:51,630
And your name

66
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,390
will be removed from our pedigree.

67
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,640
I, Jiang Ancheng...

68
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,710
I, Jiang Ancheng,

69
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,790
will no longer see you as my son.

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,920
Father!

71
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,480
If you still think I'm your father,

72
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,830
swear to me right now.

73
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,280
Fine.

74
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,710
I won't take revenge

75
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,950
or stir up trouble.

76
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,510
Happy now?

77
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,830
Are you happy now?

78
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,040
Si,

79
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,640
Zhan and Yi have sworn to me.

80
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,600
Will you?

81
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,160
Father,

82
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,190
do you really think we'll be safe

83
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,470
by letting go of the past?

84
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,000
My mother compromised over and over,

85
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,870
suffering in silence,

86
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,950
but did the Grand Princess spare her?

87
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,310
Now that we know who killed her,

88
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,600
why can't we take revenge?

89
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,600
How can we let the killer

90
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,800
get away and enjoy her life?

91
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,470
I won't swear to you

92
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,350
no matter what.

93
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,920
Whether you'll remove my name

94
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,150
from our pedigree

95
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,120
or kick me out of our house,

96
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,830
I swear revenge on the killer.

97
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,000
The Grand Princess must pay

98
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,920
with blood!

99
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,270
Shut up!

100
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:40,870
Si!

101
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,680
- Father...
- You're too young.

102
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,120
You have no idea

103
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,910
about the Grand Princess's might.

104
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:52,310
She's favored by His Majesty

105
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,560
who's the only one above her.

106
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,270
There's no way we can bring her down.

107
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,800
Little strokes fell great oaks!

108
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,920
We haven't even tried.

109
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,270
How do you know we can't?

110
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,270
What will you do?

111
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,800
What can you do?

112
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,560
File a suit to His Majesty?

113
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,830
Before you can beat the drum

114
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,000
outside the court,

115
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,270
she's cooked up

116
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,360
tons of charges against you

117
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,830
without lifting a finger.

118
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,760
Or will you poison her as well

119
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,080
or assassinate her?

120
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:23,480
You know you're weak and delicate.

121
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,150
Will you succeed?

122
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:27,880
Si,

123
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,120
how else should I put it

124
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,320
to make you give up?

125
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,030
Father...

126
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,510
Father...

127
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,560
I've...

128
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,800
I've lost your mother.

129
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,240
I cannot lose you either.

130
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,200
I can't!

131
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,920
Father.

132
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,440
Come here, Jin.

133
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,760
Let's see who will win.

134
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,190
Sure.

135
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,310
Jin,

136
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,270
Supervisor Yang of Astronomy

137
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,590
handed in a report yesterday.

138
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:45,750
He asserted

139
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,560
that if you married a girl

140
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,830
who was born a jinx,

141
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,920
it'd harm

142
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,080
our family and state.

143
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,800
Dazhou would be in chaos.

144
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,960
Do you believe that?

145
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,640
All the officials do.

146
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,350
Water can carry a boat but also overturn it.

147
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,760
Although an emperor is above everyone,

148
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:12,240
he can't shut all of them up.

149
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,280
Jin,

150
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,440
if disasters happen,

151
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,560
I don't want others

152
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,950
to pin everything on you again.

153
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,030
The one who was "born a jinx"

154
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,510
as Supervisor Yang said

155
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,350
was Jiang Si, right?

156
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,070
Yes.

157
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,710
You've issued the edict of betrothal.

158
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,800
You can't take that back.

159
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,470
By Supervisor Yang's calculation,

160
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:34,080
Cui Mingyue's date of birth

161
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,160
complements Jiang Si's.

162
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,400
If you marry them both,

163
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,160
it'll neutralize the harm.

164
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,440
I've asked the Grand Princess.

165
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:46,870
She'll marry Mingyue to you

166
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,470
for the greater good.

167
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,990
But I won't marry her.

168
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,920
Mingyue is a Commandery Princess.

169
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,280
In terms of status,

170
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:58,520
she's a better match than Jiang Si.

171
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:01,560
Father, I've made my decision.

172
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,230
Why bring trouble on myself?

173
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,280
Jiang Si is what my heart yearns for

174
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,830
and belongs to.

175
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,670
Go home and think it over.

176
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,750
Then tell me your decision.

177
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,000
I don't need more time to think.

178
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,160
This is my decision.

179
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,320
Father, if there's nothing else,

180
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,830
I shall take my leave.

181
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,630
If I allowed

182
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,630
other princes

183
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,040
to marry two girls together,

184
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,080
they couldn't thank me enough for that.

185
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:48,470
What a stubborn mule.

186
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,320
I know I'm guilty.

187
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,870
I've knelt for a day and a night

188
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,080
without eating anything.

189
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:07,110
Your Highness,

190
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:10,440
please spare me.

191
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,400
When you were little,

192
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,160
you'd cry in your sleep.

193
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,590
I had to hold you

194
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,200
every night to comfort you.

195
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,350
Before you turned three,

196
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:30,110
I hadn't had one good night's sleep.

197
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,320
That's why I tended to

198
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,870
sleep a lot afterward.

199
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:38,320
I'm too old.

200
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,960
They beat gongs and drums

201
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,400
to keep me from dozing off.

202
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,230
I couldn't take it anymore

203
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,990
and let it slip!

204
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,920
How have I treated you these years?

205
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,350
However many people in this house

206
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,400
told me you overreached yourself,

207
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,920
I ignored them and tolerated you.

208
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:06,270
How dare you betray me!

209
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,630
Spare me, Your Highness!

210
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,910
I only said

211
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:10,910
Su Ke

212
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:13,320
was flirtatious and seductive

213
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,470
in front of men.

214
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,830
Being poisoned

215
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,400
to death

216
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:18,790
was her karma.

217
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:19,970
Did you tell them about Nanwu?

218
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,070
I wouldn't dare

219
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,390
say a word about it.

220
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,400
Your Highness, I have news for you.

221
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:28,950
Come in.

222
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,120
Your Highness,

223
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,560
Prince Yan refused His Majesty's offer.

224
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,590
He wouldn't marry Princess Mingyue.

225
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:42,270
(Graceful and Dignified)
I admire loyal couples the most.

226
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,320
They won't have their way.

227
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:47,800
If Jiang Si

228
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,390
refuses to die of poison

229
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,990
like Su Ke,

230
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,200
we'll do something else.

231
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,750
Yes, Your Highness.

232
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,910
After leaving the Palace yesterday,

233
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,990
Prince Yan went to find

234
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,270
those two officials of Astronomy.

235
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,030
Luckily, we had silenced those two

236
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,280
beforehand.

237
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,110
That was wise of you.

238
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,870
Did you leak it?

239
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,880
Otherwise,

240
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,440
he wouldn't have gone to check overnight.

241
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,630
I accidentally

242
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,120
told his guard

243
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,750
about 20 years ago.

244
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,750
That was all my fault!

245
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,830
Useless!

246
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,750
I'm sorry, Your Highness!

247
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,950
I deserve death!

248
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,350
Wait... Your Highness,

249
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,400
the dead can't talk.

250
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,440
What I said

251
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,990
is also vague.

252
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,110
Prince Yan can't find any evidence.

253
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,510
He won't report you

254
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,710
to His Majesty.

255
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,590
I dare him!

256
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,440
Brother has so many children.

257
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,120
He didn't even grow up in the Palace.

258
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,320
He's a nobody.

259
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,080
How dare he report me!

260
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,080
The dead can't talk.

261
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,920
Actually, you remind me of that.

262
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:06,790
Servant.

263
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,670
What now?

264
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,830
You refuse to drink

265
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,280
the tea from me?

266
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:34,080
Your Highness,

267
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,920
your arm was once injured.

268
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:40,440
Other servants can be clumsy.

269
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,200
If you aren't used to their service,

270
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,080
and you'd rather have me instead,

271
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:51,630
my life is worth it.

272
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,080
What are you talking about?

273
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,110
You breastfed me.

274
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,950
I'll give you another chance, of course.

275
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,120
Yesterday, if you believed

276
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,670
I'd kill you for sure

277
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,280
and didn't come back with me,

278
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,280
you'd become

279
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:29,870
one of the dead who couldn't talk.

280
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:35,800
The tea is a reward and punishment.

281
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,830
Next time,

282
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,350
however soft I am,

283
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,920
I will not spare you.

284
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:44,830
Thanks for your mercy, Your Highness!

285
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,970
When I was alone in the room with Ms. Xu,

286
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:48,450
she let slip

287
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:49,520
that the Grand Princess had

288
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,720
tried to ruin you 20 years ago.

289
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,640
20 years ago?

290
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,150
When I was called cursed

291
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,400
by the Directorate of Astronomy?

292
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,990
Was that her doing?

293
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:58,200
By the way, Chief,

294
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,190
Mr. Xiao's letter arrived

295
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,440
from Lingshui earlier today.

296
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:08,920
"Observer Jiang Ancheng also knows."

297
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:14,020
(Jiang)

298
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,920
(Father,)

299
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,120
(do you really think we'll be safe)

300
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,200
(by letting go of the past?)

301
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,750
(My mother compromised over and over,)

302
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,670
(suffering in silence,)

303
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,680
(but did the Grand Princess spare her?)

304
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,360
(Now that we know who killed her,)

305
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,590
(why can't we take revenge?)

306
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:46,840
(How can we let the killer)

307
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,990
(get away and enjoy her life?)

308
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,440
- Your Highness.
- Sir.

309
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,080
Why did you ask to see me

310
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,240
this late, sir?

311
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,920
Please have a seat.

312
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,280
Do you know

313
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,520
I disapprove of Si

314
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,110
marrying you?

315
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,310
I do.

316
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,520
I hoped that she'd

317
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:26,040
lead a peaceful life.

318
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,280
Even if

319
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,280
it'd be ordinary,

320
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,230
I didn't want her...

321
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,240
I know you don't want her to be involved

322
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,520
in power struggle.

323
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,190
Neither do I.

324
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,590
There is something

325
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,470
I've kept to myself for years.

326
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,800
No one else knows.

327
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,350
I'm afraid

328
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:51,280
it greatly concerns you.

329
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:53,120
20 years ago,

330
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,720
I was an official in Astronomy.

331
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,640
I know that.

332
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,440
I've talked to Mr. Chu

333
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,360
and Mr. Xiao.

334
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:01,710
I was wondering

335
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,680
how I should bring that up,

336
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,110
and here you are

337
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,080
being candid about it.

338
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,280
Alright then.

339
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,080
I'll cut to the chase.

340
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:17,280
You weren't born cursed.

341
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,910
On the contrary,

342
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,350
that night,

343
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,110
when I observed the sky,

344
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:25,520
it showed a great omen!

345
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,910
In the 3rd year of Jingming,

346
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:32,110
on the 5th day of the 5th month...

347
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,670
Mr. Jiang,

348
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,150
(Astronomy)
the sky seems abnormal tonight.

349
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,280
Supervisor Yang sent us to take your shift.

350
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,430
You may come down.

351
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,680
Gentlemen,

352
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,590
(Astronomy)
here's my observation tonight.

353
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:50,150
I think it's a great omen!

354
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,480
It's not the time yet.

355
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,270
You've stayed up all night.

356
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,590
Go back and rest.

357
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:56,510
Sure.

358
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,670
I'll take my leave then.

359
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,640
Mr. Xiao,

360
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,720
why would the Grand Princess brand

361
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,550
a newborn prince a cursed boy?

362
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,540
(In the 3rd...)
You know

363
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,240
(North Star...)
what happened in the South?

364
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,800
Nanwu invaded our border.

365
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,590
(...a great omen.)
Our garrison suffered

366
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,830
the worst defeat ever.

367
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:15,750
But what was that to do

368
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,830
with that prince?

369
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,960
Their commander is Cui Xu.

370
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,000
The Grand Princess's husband?

371
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,310
The prince's mother, Consort Xian,

372
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,000
will soon become a Noble Consort.

373
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,790
The Grand Princess

374
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,080
cannot allow it.

375
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,560
A cursed prince will be

376
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:31,440
a heavy blow to Consort Xian

377
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,720
and help Cui Xu out,

378
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,670
killing two birds with one stone.

379
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,640
I can't believe that in order to

380
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,280
prevent Cui Xu from being punished

381
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,720
and my mother from being promoted,

382
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,110
the Grand Princess

383
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,910
reversed my fate!

384
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,040
I feel guilty about it.

385
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,110
Back then,

386
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:55,760
I was too afraid of the Grand Princess

387
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:57,440
to bring her scheme to light

388
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,920
or tell the truth

389
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,520
to uphold justice.

390
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,480
Now, I'm cornered.

391
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,760
They've killed my wife.

392
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,960
Si is their next target.

393
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,880
Sir,

394
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,480
she doesn't want you to get involved

395
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,590
in this mess either.

396
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,960
I'll find the evidence

397
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,590
against the culprit myself.

398
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,800
Your Highness,

399
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:20,040
the Annal of Divination
for the year you were born

400
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,670
can be the evidence.

401
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:26,320
As much as I feared to be in trouble,

402
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,520
I didn't want the truth

403
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,830
to be buried forever.

404
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,430
(That explains why Father)

405
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:34,720
(tried to stop me)

406
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,830
(from marrying Yu Qi.)

407
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:44,620
(Majesty and Prestige)

408
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,000
The Grand Princess planted

409
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,190
spies into the harem.

410
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,520
She must've been prepared.

411
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,110
Your safety comes first.

412
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,670
Be careful when you gather information.

413
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:54,950
You too.

414
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,330
The Directorate of Astronomy

415
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:57,480
is tough to deal with.

416
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,510
What the divination was

417
00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:59,430
when you were born

418
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,080
will be found out eventually.

419
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,630
Don't act rashly

420
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,400
or risk your life.

421
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,840
I know.

422
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,620
(Tiande Hall)

423
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:11,830
Ever since His Majesty

424
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,480
issued the edict of betrothal,

425
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,590
Jin has become a laughingstock

426
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,150
in the entire harem.

427
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,830
They say he's uncultured

428
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,440
as he grew up in the South.

429
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,480
He's ignorant,

430
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,320
short-sighted, and simple-minded.

431
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,670
I'm furious!

432
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,080
Please calm down.

433
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,560
Mother, I'm not sure

434
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:35,560
if I should say this.

435
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,640
Out with it.

436
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,110
Don't be bashful.

437
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,440
Miss Jiang Si is

438
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,870
really something else.

439
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,760
She outshone all the girls,

440
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,000
including Princess Mingyue, at the banquet.

441
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,030
Even Father was

442
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,390
impressed by her.

443
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,350
To think if she disobeys you

444
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,040
while Prince Yan takes her side...

445
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,280
How is she my match?

446
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,040
You, go to Earl Dongping's Mansion.

447
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:05,000
Summon her to the Jinhua Hall

448
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,720
to be lectured.

449
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:07,990
Yes.

450
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:10,750
Your Highness,

451
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,320
Miss Si is right outside

452
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,960
to pay her respects to you.

453
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,870
Perfect timing.

454
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,080
Send her in.

455
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,200
Yes.

456
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,270
I'm here as the Commandant

457
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,800
of Capital Security

458
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,000
to check

459
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,350
certain files in your archives.

460
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:27,960
Please be cooperative, Mr. Yang.

461
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,920
(Astronomy)
Prince Yan,

462
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,720
all our archives have been

463
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,000
stored in the warehouse.

464
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,870
To access them,

465
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,470
you'll need

466
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,030
a reading permit

467
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,240
with His Majesty's seal.

468
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,880
Of course.

469
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,720
As far as I remember,

470
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,030
this reading permit

471
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:52,950
was granted

472
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,030
when you and Mr. Zhen

473
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,630
investigated the Hunt Case, right?

474
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,130
There are unanswered questions,

475
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,030
requiring further investigation. Problem?

476
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,320
His Majesty is fair and just.

477
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:01,750
The Directorate

478
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,590
has dismissed those involved in that case.

479
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,960
What else

480
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:06,560
needs to be investigated?

481
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,440
- Has the permit expired?
- Not yet.

482
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,790
- Has the case closed?
- Not yet.

483
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:12,510
Your persistent hindrance makes you

484
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,550
look guilty, Mr. Yang.

485
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,590
Looks like

486
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,430
I have to report everything to His Majesty.

487
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,990
- Please.
- Thanks.

488
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,620
(Astronomy)
Uh, Chief.

489
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,510
My stomach hurts all of a sudden.

490
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,430
Show him, Mr. Yang.

491
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,600
Go straight.

492
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,640
Thanks, Mr. Yang.

493
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,080
Jiang Si of Earl Dongping's Mansion

494
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,910
greets you, Your Highness.

495
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,280
May you live long and prosper.

496
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,920
Miss Si,

497
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,670
when paying your respects for the first time,

498
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,100
(Ms. Lin)
you should also kowtow.

499
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,800
Didn't your family teach you that?

500
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,080
My apologies.

501
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,390
I greet you, Your Highness.

502
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,590
May you live long and prosper.

503
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,190
Your manner

504
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,520
doesn't look too bad.

505
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,590
Thanks, Your Highness.

506
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:30,110
Her Highness hasn't allowed you up.

507
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,910
Listen to her lecture on your knees.

508
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:44,950
Yes.

509
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,760
I heard

510
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,830
your mother was from a house of merchants.

511
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:53,960
As humble as Earl Dongping's Mansion is,

512
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:56,150
your ancestors were noble

513
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,520
with ranks.

514
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,910
How did they let your mother in?

515
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,280
Or

516
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,110
did you learn from her

517
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,150
about how to marry up?

518
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,520
Your Highness,

519
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,520
I lost my mother

520
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,080
when I was born.

521
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,110
Although I was unable to

522
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,190
grow up with her,

523
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,720
I heard a lot from others

524
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,760
about her virtue

525
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,280
and integrity.

526
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,110
She's my role model.

527
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,320
Compared with those who lived

528
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,720
but abandoned their children

529
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,560
and taught them nothing,

530
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,240
my mother is much better.

531
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,280
How dare you

532
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:37,350
make such insinuating remarks against me!

533
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,280
Slap her!

534
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,190
Are the rest of you dead? Go!

535
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,030
Let me go!

536
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,480
Mother,

537
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,140
this is only her first visit to the Palace.

538
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,480
Please show mercy

539
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,760
and spare her this time.

540
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,390
If she gets hurt,

541
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,670
Prince Jin will be worried and mad.

542
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:07,670
It might ruin the bond between you two.

543
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,520
Slap her!

544
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,000
If I hadn't vented my anger,

545
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,240
I probably wouldn't have made it

546
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,830
to the day we bonded.

547
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,640
Ms. Lin.

548
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:37,920
Yes.

549
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,870
First, Jiang Si was

550
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,520
betrothed to Duke An's heir.

551
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,760
Then she and the Zhen Clan were close.

552
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,920
You

553
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,520
shall check her

554
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:51,240
thoroughly for me

555
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,550
to see

556
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:55,350
if she's still a virgin.

557
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:56,750
Your Highness,

558
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,000
you can't insult me like that!

559
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:59,190
Princess Qi!

560
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,230
Let go of me!

561
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:09,760
Don't be mad, Mother.

562
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,190
Her mother had died years ago.

563
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,520
Why didn't you tell me that?

564
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,000
Did you mean to give her a chance

565
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,480
to mock me?

566
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,430
I apologize for my negligence.

567
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,320
Let go of me!

568
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:28,630
Let go...!

569
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,350
Gag her already!

570
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,230
Don't touch me,

571
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,280
or Prince Yan will make you pay!

572
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:39,510
Have you lost your virginity?

573
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,670
Are you afraid we'll find out,

574
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,990
so you're threatening us with your life?

575
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,430
- Seize her!
- Step back!

576
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:47,950
Tell them to leave.

577
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,880
Do as I say!

578
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,230
Get out!

579
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:00,040
Ms. Lin, before you check me,

580
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,190
feel that cut in your palm.

581
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,150
It hurts badly, huh?

582
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:06,670
Is it

583
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,910
also getting itchy?

584
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,430
What did you do to me?

585
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:16,320
You must've heard

586
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:18,320
that at the banquet,

587
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,350
I had recognized the Traceless Grass

588
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,190
and made flowers bloom instantly.

589
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,100
If I could've done all that,

590
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,320
I could've certainly

591
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:31,150
smeared poison on this shard.

592
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,510
You're bluffing.

593
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:37,430
Am I?

594
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,080
Believe it or not,

595
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,630
if you don't take the antidote

596
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,960
before the sunset,

597
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,800
tonight, you'll bleed

598
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,240
from the seven holes in your head and die.

599
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,280
You'll die

600
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,960
a horrible death.

601
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,400
Miss Si,

602
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,310
even if I'm coerced

603
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,390
into covering for you today,

604
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,150
Prince Yan will find out
on your wedding night.

605
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,430
My virginity won't be your concern.

606
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,110
Alright, fine.

607
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,510
I know what to say to Her Highness.

608
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:19,080
Give me the antidote now.

609
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,360
Miss Si!

610
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,800
That can wait.

611
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:23,710
Ms. Lin,

612
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,840
you've been in the Palace for decades.

613
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,760
I'd like to ask you something.

614
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,400
Ask away.

615
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,930
I'll tell you everything I know.

616
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:34,760
Which lady is

617
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:37,270
Grand Princess Rongyang the closest to

618
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:38,390
in the harem?

619
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,560
Consort Zhuang

620
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:41,350
and Empress Di.

621
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:42,670
Empress Di?

622
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,160
That's right.

623
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,560
After Empress Qingrong passed away,

624
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:47,310
the Grand Princess

625
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:48,970
nominated her first to be the next empress.

626
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:54,280
Do Consort Zhuang and Empress Di

627
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:55,440
have senior maids

628
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,860
who have served for almost 20 years?

629
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,350
I don't know exactly

630
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:00,960
how long their maids have served,

631
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,560
but the ones by their sides

632
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,240
are senior to the others.

633
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,190
Why do you ask?

634
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,320
Please give me the antidote!

635
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,270
Please, Miss!

636
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,110
Be patient.

637
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,560
Once I get out of the Jinhua Hall,

638
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,720
you'll have it.

639
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:20,020
(Prince Yan's Mansion)

640
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:30,990
Mother!

641
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,360
Qian.

642
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,320
- Mother!
- Qian!

643
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,600
Qian,

644
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,870
I thought

645
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,630
I'd never see you again.

646
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,040
You look much thinner

647
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,600
and haggard, too.

648
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:46,430
Qian,

649
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:48,520
how did you know I was here?

650
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,190
Mother,

651
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,800
what were you thinking?

652
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,040
Why did you poison them?

653
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,960
I wanted revenge.

654
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,150
Back then, Su Ke was

655
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:06,590
always better than me.

656
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:10,240
Your grandmother incited me

657
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,350
to compete against her.

658
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:13,110
I had no choice.

659
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:15,830
A while ago,

660
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,240
Prince Yan chose Jiang Si.

661
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,240
She'd become Princess Yan.

662
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:22,520
Once they got married,

663
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,590
our branch

664
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,240
would be doomed.

665
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,320
That's why I...

666
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:33,800
That was terrible.

667
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:36,110
We could've

668
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,480
led a peaceful life in the mansion.

669
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,400
Wouldn't that be nice?

670
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:40,450
Why did you do things that hurt yourself

671
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:42,350
and others?

672
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:43,560
Well, back then...

673
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,030
Back then?

674
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:47,350
What happened?

675
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,160
Never mind.

676
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,240
It was a long time ago.

677
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,400
No need to rake it up.

678
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,630
I've reflected on myself.

679
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,390
Given all those mistakes I made,

680
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,760
I owe the First Branch too much.

681
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,720
I have to pay off my debts.

682
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:07,520
Please talk to your father

683
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,760
to let me go back.

684
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:12,150
I'll be their slave to...

685
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:13,510
Mother,

686
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:17,280
I'm afraid you can't go back.

687
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,160
Perhaps Father is thinking about

688
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,520
making Ms. Ruan his wife.

689
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,190
After what happened,

690
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,830
you're dead to him

691
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,960
even if you're still alive.

692
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,160
Mother!

693
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,400
But...

694
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,190
But in this world,

695
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,720
where can I go

696
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,720
except Earl Dongping's Mansion?

697
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,000
You still have me, Mother.

698
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,150
From now on, I'll support you.

699
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,600
We don't need others.

700
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:59,040
We'll have our own home.

701
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,590
But Si...

702
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,840
Don't worry.

703
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,550
She told me to come here

704
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:10,470
to get you out.

705
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,320
I see.

706
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,350
Rumors are spreading in the Palace

707
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,960
that you're seductive.

708
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:22,430
Who knows

709
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:24,430
you're still a virgin?

710
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,910
Neither did I know

711
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,190
you'd be fooled by rumors, Your Highness.

712
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,560
Some attitude you got.

713
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,480
You're still unruly.

714
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,190
You've scolded me

715
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,600
and had me checked.

716
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,280
May I go home now?

717
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,750
This is my hall,

718
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:43,720
not somewhere

719
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:47,320
you can come and go as you please.

720
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:48,990
Servant,

721
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,570
fetch Important Principles for Girls.

722
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:53,590
Have her copy the book until she's obedient.

723
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,430
Has anyone in this house

724
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,560
ever respected me at all?

725
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,800
Who am I?

726
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,000
Do I have a name?

727
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,910
I'm merely your pawn!

728
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:22,510
I had to compete.

729
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:24,480
I had to fight

730
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,920
in order to

731
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,240
keep a foothold in this house!

732
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:34,960
But I never meant to kill anyone.

733
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:39,720
I was also tricked by others.

734
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,040
("Time passes like running water.)

735
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,040
(Life is as short as morning dew.")

736
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:47,670
(Who knows)

737
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,630
(my sworn enemy)

738
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,190
(saved my life)

739
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,520
(and gave us a way out?)

740
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:55,710
(Mother,)

741
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:58,240
(we'll forever remember her kindness.)

742
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,200
(If Si needs)

743
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,760
(our help in the future,)

744
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,630
(we'll come back at once.)

745
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:10,630
Miss Si.

746
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,360
Since you arrived,

747
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,310
you've had to kneel and copy the book.

748
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,840
I feel sorry for you.

749
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:20,520
Serve Miss Si tea.

750
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:24,030
Thanks, Princess Qi.

751
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:26,080
You've never copied this before.

752
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,960
It takes time to learn.

753
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,830
The first step is always difficult.

754
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:31,150
I'll teach you.

755
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,280
No, thanks.

756
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,150
I went through the same steps the first time

757
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,630
I paid my respects to her.

758
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:46,190
When I was a girl,

759
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,710
I was also spoiled by my parents.

760
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,920
They always indulged me

761
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,840
and pampered me.

762
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,630
I had never suffered such humiliation.

763
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,110
I cried for three days when I got back.

764
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,710
Now, I can only hope to be

765
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:00,920
a mother-in-law someday.

766
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,320
Miss Si,

767
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,400
you did much better than me just now.

768
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,360
If we have each other's backs,

769
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:09,110
it's better than suffering alone.

770
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,310
You probably don't know, Princess Qi.

771
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,560
My mother passed away a long time ago.

772
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,920
It was my aunt

773
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,790
who was in charge of our house.

774
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,560
My aunt was

775
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,040
quite pretentious.

776
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:23,920
She was stingy

777
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,230
but had to look generous.

778
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:29,030
When she finally gave us a bolt of cloth

779
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:30,030
and some coal,

780
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,480
she'd go on and on about it

781
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,360
so that everyone in town

782
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,280
would know.

783
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,750
What are you implying?

784
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,690
Are you blaming me for not helping you...?

785
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:40,830
I'd appreciate it if you did,

786
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,840
but that wasn't your duty.

787
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,440
Thank you

788
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,400
for your tea,

789
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:46,790
and thank you

790
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,510
for putting in a good word for me

791
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:49,430
with Consort Xian.

792
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,440
But after all these years

793
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,190
of dealing with

794
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:55,230
my two-faced aunt at home,

795
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,230
I can tell

796
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,230
good and bad intentions.

797
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:02,000
Consort Xian insulted me openly

798
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,240
while you

799
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:05,080
didn't actually respect me either.

800
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,920
You invited me to your banquet

801
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:08,750
but had me sit at the end of the table.

802
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,270
You spoke for me

803
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:12,190
only to put on a show.

804
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,440
Such

805
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,270
little kindness as a handout

806
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,670
isn't any better than the cloth

807
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,720
and coal

808
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:20,270
from my aunt.

809
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,960
If you expected to win me over

810
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,840
with such petty favors,

811
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,360
that'd be absurd.

812
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,080
You mistake it, Miss Si.

813
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,840
You just said it yourself.

814
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:35,400
Now that there are two of us,

815
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:36,840
you won't

816
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,310
suffer alone.

817
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:39,920
Is everything happening

818
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:41,400
as you expected?

819
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,920
I didn't know Mother

820
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,480
- would be so mad...
- Say no more.

821
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:48,000
From now on, if you don't set me up,

822
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,520
I won't mess with you.

823
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,920
You may leave.

824
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:55,600
Good luck with the copying.

825
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:04,840
Did Jiang Si really say so?

826
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,880
Yes.

827
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:09,110
I was right outside the room.

828
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:10,630
I heard it loud and clear.

829
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:12,400
Who gave her

830
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,750
such a ready tongue?

831
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,080
She barely knows Zhang's wife.

832
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:19,630
Unexpectedly,

833
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:21,590
she said all that I had meant to

834
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,550
get off my chest

835
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:24,750
all these years.

836
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,080
Zhang's wife is such a hypocrite.

837
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,840
Back then, she stood right there,

838
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:34,440
keeping her head down when I lectured her.

839
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,670
I thought she was a doormat.

840
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,360
But once she got home,

841
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:41,190
she had the Grand Preceptor

842
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:43,000
complain to His Majesty about me,

843
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:44,560
making me look like

844
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:46,520
a mean mother-in-law.

845
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,630
Alight then. She called me mean.

846
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,670
I shall act accordingly.

847
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,920
Princess Qi.

848
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,000
Prince Yan,

849
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:06,710
are you here to see Miss Si?

850
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,440
She has

851
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:12,110
suffered a lot.

852
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:13,150
What happened?

853
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,400
As obedient as Princess Qi seems,

854
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:17,360
she's deep and scheming.

855
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,790
I see

856
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,190
that although Miss Si is unruly,

857
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,400
she's candid and honest,

858
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:25,920
not the trouble-making sort.

859
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:28,520
You've kept her for too long.

860
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,920
I wonder if Prince Yan

861
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,150
will come to look for her.

862
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,230
Shall I

863
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,400
send her back now?

864
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:38,520
Do you think I'm afraid of my son?

865
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,560
You aren't, of course.

866
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,110
Sticks always work better than carrots.

867
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,960
I'm their mother-in-law.

868
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,070
Whether the two of them

869
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:49,480
are pretentious or stubborn,

870
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,630
they'll have to obey me.

871
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:53,030
Keep grinding her down.

872
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,080
Your Highness, Prince Yan came.

873
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,520
He came so soon.

874
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:57,960
Have him wait outside.

875
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,670
Consort Xian, where's Jiang Si?

876
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:24,920
Have you eaten yet, Jin?

877
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,920
Which dirty hand of yours touched her?

878
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:29,440
Your Highness, I...

879
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,360
I don't beat women.

880
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:31,840
Do it yourself.

881
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:42,590
Enough!

882
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:44,550
She simply

883
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,000
followed my order.

884
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:48,000
Do you mean to beat me, too?

885
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:50,480
All mothers-in-law train their sons' wives.

886
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:52,750
The Empress Dowager trained me

887
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,710
just like I trained

888
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:56,400
your brother, Zhang's wife.

889
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:00,000
Jiang Si will soon marry you.

890
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,440
She has to be trained beforehand.

891
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,400
After all,

892
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:06,510
I'm training her

893
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:07,480
for your sake.

894
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,670
Stop saying it's for me!

895
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:10,080
Did you abandon me also for my sake?

896
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:20,040
Where's Jiang Si?

897
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,760
Tell me!

898
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:26,880
Please come with me.

899
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,440
Would any mother

900
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,190
in the world

901
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,630
abandon her son if she had a choice?

902
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:57,470
Get out.

903
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,760
Long Dan,

904
00:40:59,030 --> 00:40:59,950
you too.

905
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:15,630
You're breaking my heart.

906
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,230
How come you're here already?

907
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,320
Did everything go well?

908
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,840
We won't come to

909
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:22,110
this dump ever again!

910
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:24,080
Sure. Not again.

911
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:26,630
Your mother...

912
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,200
Consort Xian.

913
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:30,470
Fine, Consort Xian.

914
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:33,190
We paid our respects to her today.

915
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,750
When we visit Empress Di tomorrow,

916
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,400
no one will suspect anything.

917
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:37,470
Right?

918
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:39,510
By the way,

919
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,040
I learned

920
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:42,880
that she and the Grand Princess

921
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,880
were quite close.

922
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,630
It was the Grand Princess

923
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:46,960
who nominated her empress.

924
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:48,630
In that case,

925
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,760
could they

926
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,000
be in cahoots?

927
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:57,110
If so,

928
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:59,760
it'd make sense that the Grand Princess

929
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,880
could plant Nanwu's spies

930
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,460
into the Changning Palace.

931
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:07,040
What about the Directorate of Astronomy?

932
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,440
Did you find the Annal hidden by my father?

933
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:13,400
I was so mad that I almost forgot.

934
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:16,750
(Astronomy)
"In the 3rd year of Jingming,

935
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:19,400
on the 5th day of the 5th month,
the North Star shone.

936
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,000
That was a great omen.

937
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,710
At night, the 7th Prince was born

938
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,790
with extraordinary fortune. He's blessed.

939
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:27,670
I congratulate His Majesty

940
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:30,110
(Jiang Ancheng)
on Dazhou's lasting prosperity."

941
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,230
This is the real divination

942
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:33,150
when you were born.

943
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,750
Father once told me

944
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:36,760
that such Annals

945
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,440
were made of a special material.

946
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,920
What's written on it can't be altered.

947
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:40,800
It's credible proof.

948
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:43,630
Let's present it to His Majesty.

949
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:45,590
We can't!

950
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,360
If we handed it in,

951
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,150
the Grand Princess would go after

952
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:50,070
your father first.

953
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,590
That's why
