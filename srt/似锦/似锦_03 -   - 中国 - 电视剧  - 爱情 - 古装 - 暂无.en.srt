(Capital Security Office)

12
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:46,510
I'm Sun Qiaoniang.

13
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:48,790
Greetings, Your Honor.

14
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:50,590
Sun Qiaoniang.

15
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:51,950
Let me ask you.

16
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,030
Did Ji Chongyi

17
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,120
push Jiang into the water?

18
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:58,870
Qiaoniang, speak the truth.

19
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,690
With me here, you have nothing to fear.

20
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,200
Since you want to marry Young Master Ji,

21
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,230
I'll help you.

22
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,710
Even if you marry him now,

23
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,160
you'll only be a concubine.

24
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,390
But if you're willing to testify,

25
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,360
I'll help you

26
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,320
become the respected wife

27
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,160
of Young Master Ji.

28
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,390
Will you trust me this time?

29
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,950
Your Honor,

30
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,160
that night,

31
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,230
Young Master Ji did push Jiang Si.

32
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,110
Qiaoniang, what are you saying?

33
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,550
Are you crazy?

34
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,110
Ji Chongyi,

35
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,270
if you continue
to make a scene in court,

36
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,630
I'll charge you

37
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,990
with contempt of court.

38
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,670
(Smart girl.)

39
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,210
(Turning enemies into friends.)

40
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,040
(The rival's testimony)

41
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,670
(is more believable than others'.)

42
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,040
(Jiang Si, you're truly something.)

43
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,510
Let me ask you again.

44
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,830
Did Ji Chongyi do it by accident

45
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,640
or on purpose?

46
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,510
He...

47
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,080
Don't be afraid.

48
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,110
Speak the truth.

49
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:14,710
Qiaoniang.

50
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,240
I didn't push her on purpose.

51
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,080
You saw it clearly

52
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,200
behind me.

53
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,040
It was just an accident.

54
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,950
Young Master Ji,

55
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,790
so you admit it now.

56
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,960
You did push me into the water.

57
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,800
I didn't.

58
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:26,980
I didn't push you on purpose.

59
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,150
- What an obvious lie.
- I...

60
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,360
How dare you lie to me.

61
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,500
Take him out

62
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:31,750
for ten strokes of the cane.

63
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,390
Yes.

64
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,390
Don't touch me.

65
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,760
My father is Duke An.

66
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,080
You can't touch me.

67
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,480
They've teamed up

68
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,200
to force me to break off the engagement.

69
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,470
- I'm innocent.
- Look at him.

70
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,680
- Your Honor.
- He did do it.

71
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,230
Chongli!

72
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,110
Your Honor, please show mercy.

73
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,360
Who are you?

74
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:49,880
I'm Ji Chongli, son of Duke An,

75
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,440
here to plead for Ji Chongyi.

76
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,080
Your Honor, I'm innocent.

77
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,550
Jiang Si and Qiaoniang

78
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,630
have teamed up to lie,

79
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,200
forcing me to break off the engagement.

80
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,000
Everything I said is true.

81
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,390
I'm innocent, Your Honor.

82
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,360
Hit him harder.

83
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,670
Well done.

84
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,910
- Well done.
- Well done.

85
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,320
This is the Capital Security Office.

86
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,110
Whether you're a prince

87
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,360
or a commoner,

88
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,320
I treat everyone equally.

89
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:18,320
Only right and wrong matter here.

90
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:21,630
Chongli.

91
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,320
Your Honor, I'm innocent.

92
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,880
They're framing me.

93
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,950
Qiaoniang, continue.

94
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,040
Your Honor.

95
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:44,830
He...

96
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,440
How is my acting?

97
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,800
Perfect.

98
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:04,680
It's been a long day.

99
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,520
Here.

100
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,880
Drink this antiabortifacient.

101
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,070
It's not hot.

102
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,280
Qiaoniang.

103
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,440
Qiaoniang.

104
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,830
Bring that vile woman out here.

105
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,350
Stop hiding. Come out.

106
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:18,800
Young Master Ji,

107
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,200
what are you doing?

108
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,440
You're here,

109
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,200
so Jiang Si must be here too.

110
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,590
Hurry up and bring her out.

111
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,430
Go.

112
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,720
Stay here.

113
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:27,630
I know you're here.

114
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,710
Hurry up and come out.

115
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,950
Where are they?

116
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,680
Young Master Ji,

117
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,200
it seems you haven't had enough
of the cane.

118
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,080
You can even question me here now.

119
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,040
You and Qiaoniang are truly venomous.

120
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,320
What a trick.

121
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:43,150
One acted dumb in court;

122
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,950
the other twisted the truth.

123
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,440
In the end,

124
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,730
you two teamed up to frame me.

125
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,570
You were playing two girls
at the same time,

126
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,320
trying to trick me, a pure young lady,

127
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,200
into marrying you.

128
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,910
Can't I retaliate?

129
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:55,750
You...

130
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:56,950
Duchess An,

131
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,760
is this how you teach your son?

132
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,600
Enough.

133
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,200
My son is an excellent man.

134
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,440
You should be glad if he likes you.

135
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,470
You vile woman.

136
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,120
What did she

137
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,270
do to you

138
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,720
to make you frame my son

139
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,830
in court?

140
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,680
As it has come to this,

141
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,910
none of you

142
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,560
can marry my son.

143
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,200
Duchess An, how condescending.

144
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,520
At this point,

145
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,120
you still can't face the reality, huh?

146
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,270
I never intended

147
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,270
to marry your son.

148
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,710
But Qiaoniang...

149
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,880
Qiaoniang, sit down first.

150
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:34,950
But Qiaoniang

151
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,120
is now carrying

152
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,350
your son's child.

153
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,110
This...

154
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,110
This...

155
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,080
She's pregnant?

156
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,440
She must have an ulterior motive.

157
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,270
You want to use the child

158
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,440
to threaten me.

159
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,440
You're a lowly businesswoman.

160
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,390
Who knows

161
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,150
who has frequented your shop

162
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,230
and had dealings with you?

163
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,240
How can you claim

164
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,880
the child is mine?

165
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,270
I saw

166
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,310
how eloquent you are

167
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,200
in court today.

168
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,710
You can turn black into white.

169
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,640
But I am a solitary woman,

170
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:09,680
with nothing to be threatened by.

171
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,320
Whether you accept it or not,

172
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,080
this child will bear

173
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:14,830
the Ji surname.

174
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,950
I believe Mr. Zhen

175
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,070
and the people in the city

176
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,350
can see clearly the relationship

177
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:20,370
between your son and me.

178
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,120
If anything happens to me,

179
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,320
the primary suspect will be your family.

180
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,350
It's not so easy for you

181
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,030
to marry my son.

182
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,800
You've truly opened my eyes today.

183
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,390
I thought if you knew

184
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,590
Qiaoniang was pregnant,

185
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,200
you'd care about family ties.

186
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,560
But to my surprise,

187
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,270
you're so heartless and cruel.

188
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,560
I understand.

189
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,150
If word gets out later

190
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,560
that Young Master Ji
wanted to marry Qiaoniang

191
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,710
for her wealth

192
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:45,760
instead of love

193
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,590
to repay his gambling debts,

194
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,150
no one would find it strange.

195
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,830
Why did you tell her everything?

196
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,910
You tried to trick me into marrying you

197
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,000
because you wanted to find a big fool.

198
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,080
But I'm sure

199
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:00,120
the Duke doesn't know this, right?

200
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,470
What do you want?

201
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,030
I want a Letter of Annulment.

202
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,080
Qiaoniang wants a Letter of Marriage,

203
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,240
and she wants to be the wife.

204
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,240
I think you've lost your mind.

205
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,910
She's a lowly businesswoman.

206
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,640
How could you dream of that?

207
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:17,880
Your son

208
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,030
had his eyes

209
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,150
on my wealth.

210
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,950
I can pay his debt.

211
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,800
Stop dreaming.

212
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,320
Young Master Ji,

213
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,000
you really have a good mother.

214
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,350
I truly envy you.

215
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,280
But now, it's come to this.

216
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,600
Either you two

217
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,800
agree to our terms,

218
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,230
or you'll have to tell

219
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:40,510
Mr. Zhen in court

220
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:42,040
how you tried

221
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,350
to steal from your lover,

222
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,870
how you plotted to kill your fiancée,

223
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,560
and how you turned your back on her

224
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,680
now that she's pregnant.

225
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,590
If it really comes to that,

226
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,920
your bright future as an official

227
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,510
will probably be

228
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,440
a delusion

229
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,990
for Young Master Ji.

230
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,350
What a cruel scheme.

231
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,990
You two are trying to ruin me.

232
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:11,800
Mother, save me.

233
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:19,080
You've made one mistake after another.

234
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,400
Even if I agree
to let her be my son's wife,

235
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,320
the Duke will never approve.

236
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,920
Duchess, as I know,

237
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,080
you were once a concubine too.

238
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,320
Now, aren't you also

239
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,320
the Duke's wife?

240
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,830
I believe

241
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:39,950
you'll figure something out.

242
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:00,830
Miss,

243
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,080
didn't Ms. Wei

244
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,680
agree to the annulment?

245
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,840
Why do you still look

246
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,320
so troubled?

247
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,630
Until we have the Letter of Annulment,

248
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,800
there will always be uncertainty.

249
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,800
How can I feel at ease?

250
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,960
I'm wondering how Father is doing

251
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,470
with the handover

252
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,800
at Duke An's Mansion.

253
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,680
I hope nothing unexpected happens.

254
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,400
Since falling into the water,

255
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,040
you've changed a lot.

256
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,110
Why?

257
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,160
You never painted landscape art.

258
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:38,550
Is that so?

259
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,400
Yes.

260
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:40,280
Look.

261
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,590
These, these,

262
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:42,630
and this,

263
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,320
are all flower and bird paintings

264
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,440
you used to make.

265
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,160
(After I married Ji Chongyi,)

266
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,920
(I faced so many difficulties)

267
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,230
(and ended up in the South.)

268
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,080
(It gave me a chance)

269
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,200
(to see the grand landscape
outside Ling'an.)

270
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:57,910
(If a woman)

271
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,300
(is trapped in the inner chamber,)

272
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,350
(appreciating flowers and birds)

273
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,640
(and idling away,)

274
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:04,230
(what else could she paint)

275
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,990
(but flowers and birds?)

276
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,750
But the landscape in this painting

277
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,710
is quite unique.

278
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,960
I've never seen

279
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,110
such scenery in Ling'an.

280
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,470
Miss, where is this from?

281
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,040
I painted it

282
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,350
from a dream I had.

283
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,630
- Si.
- Si.

284
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,960
- Si.
- Si.

285
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,920
Look what we brought.

286
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,900
(Ji Chongyi, Jiang Si)

287
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,920
A Letter of Annulment.

288
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,710
Yes, a Letter of Annulment.

289
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,160
Zhan, look.

290
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,590
Thank you, Father.

291
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,870
How wonderful, Zhan.

292
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,520
Withdraw the charges?

293
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,520
Yes.

294
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,110
Did Duke An's family

295
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:56,990
threaten you?

296
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,520
No, My Lord, I want this.

297
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,680
This morning,

298
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,680
my father retrieved
the Letter of Annulment

299
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,870
from Duke An's Mansion.

300
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,280
Miss Jiang,

301
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,520
I saw your composure before danger

302
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,500
in court.

303
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,980
Unlike an ordinary woman,

304
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,520
you possess the spirit of a great man.

305
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,260
Why withdraw now?

306
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,540
My Lord, you flatter me.

307
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,020
I'm just

308
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,520
an ordinary woman.

309
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,060
I simply didn't want to marry a jerk

310
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,580
and regret it for the rest of my life.

311
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,820
From the very beginning,

312
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,380
I only considered myself,

313
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,180
not any great cause.

314
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,980
Since Duke An's family

315
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,500
has written the Letter of Annulment,

316
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,700
my goal has been achieved.

317
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,780
Miss Jiang, that's not true.

318
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,140
If Qiaoniang's testimony is true,

319
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,220
I could charge Ji Chongyi

320
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,140
with attempted murder.

321
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,060
Marriage is the union of good families.

322
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,700
According to our law,

323
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,460
if one party commits a crime,

324
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:17,900
the other party

325
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,460
may break the engagement.

326
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,620
No, My Lord.

327
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,260
Ji Chongyi never meant to harm me.

328
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,020
It was just an accident.

329
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,140
I heard

330
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,780
Duchess An recently

331
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,180
went to see Sun Qiaoniang.

332
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,620
Did she bribe Qiaoniang?

333
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,020
Bribing a witness

334
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,380
is also against the law.

335
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,780
No, My Lord.

336
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,700
It was just an accident.

337
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,060
How is it, Father?

338
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:58,900
Is it tasty?

339
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,140
Your cooking

340
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,020
is getting better and better.

341
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,940
I'll make more delicious food for you.

342
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,340
Good, good.

343
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:08,820
Father,

344
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,660
did everything go smoothly

345
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,260
at Duke An's Mansion yesterday?

346
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,940
They were immoral

347
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:14,980
and disrespectful.

348
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:15,880
After my arrival,

349
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,580
I didn't want to talk with them.

350
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,220
I just took the Letter of Annulment

351
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,060
and left.

352
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,300
But

353
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,860
when your grandmother found out

354
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,980
about the Letter of Annulment
and the withdrawal,

355
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,780
she punished me
by kneeling in the ancestral hall.

356
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,380
Grandmother punished you?

357
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,540
It's nothing.

358
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,060
As long as you're happy,

359
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,100
it's all worth it.

360
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,700
You're not young anymore.

361
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,040
She shouldn't have done that.

362
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,780
Si.

363
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:40,940
What's wrong?

364
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,500
I've invited Yu and Mr. Zhen

365
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,500
to our house for dinner.

366
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,140
They'll be here soon.
I'll go greet them.

367
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,380
You should tidy up.

368
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,960
Father, you should tidy up too.

369
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,660
What did he just say?

370
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,500
I should tidy up too?

371
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:02,980
Miss,

372
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,660
there's a pattern

373
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,020
on the back of your neck.

374
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,140
What about my neck?

375
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,540
Miss, sit down.

376
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,420
Raise it higher so I can look.

377
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,620
This side, this side.

378
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,060
Can you see it, Miss?

379
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,800
- (The Saintess's Totem?)
- I don't think

380
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,180
you had it before.

381
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,300
(Is it because I once lived)

382
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,700
(in Nanwu?)

383
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:35,100
(Border between Dazhou and Nanwu)

384
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,060
- Wake up.
- Water.

385
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:48,940
What?

386
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,620
- Water.
- Water?

387
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,500
Here.

388
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,020
How do you feel?

389
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,580
Are you from Dazhou?

390
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,660
I am.

391
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,100
But don't worry.

392
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,940
I won't report this.

393
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,980
This medicine can stop the bleeding.

394
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,900
I've left the water

395
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,700
and medicine here for you.

396
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,260
This is all I can do.

397
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,420
Be careful.

398
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:50,140
(Several months later)

399
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:56,060
(Nanwu)

400
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,000
There seems to be someone here.

401
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,460
She's from Dazhou.

402
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,180
Did she fall

403
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,860
from the cliff?

404
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,580
She's lucky to be alive.

405
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:17,940
She once saved me.

406
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,460
Now, she's gravely injured.

407
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:20,820
Let's take her back.

408
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,620
(Grand Elder, Nanwu)
Today,

409
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,140
I will accept you as my disciple.

410
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,220
I was forced to jump off the cliff,

411
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,180
and it was you who saved me.

412
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,260
Ignoring the grudges,

413
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,620
you accept me as a disciple

414
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,220
and teach me your skills.

415
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,780
Please accept this.

416
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,940
The Nanwu people

417
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,260
do not usually save people
from Dazhou,

418
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,660
but you saved Du'er

419
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,340
despite the grudges.

420
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,940
Now, we're even.

421
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,540
From now on,

422
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,180
you cannot have any contact
with Dazhou.

423
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,620
I have no place

424
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,380
in Dazhou anymore.

425
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,500
I'm willing to stay in Nanwu.

426
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,780
Mr. Zhen, Yu.

427
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,620
Please come in.

428
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,060
It's truly an honor

429
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,300
to have you both here.

430
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,900
Father, Si.

431
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,420
Mr. Zhen and Yu are here.

432
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,300
Welcome, welcome.

433
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,140
Please come in.

434
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,060
I must thank Mr. Zhen for judging fairly

435
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,860
on my daughter's annulment.

436
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,260
Mr. Yu, thanks for finding witnesses

437
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,540
for my daughter.

438
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,620
Thank you, thank you.

439
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,020
You embarrass me now.

440
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,420
I didn't help much.

441
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,140
Your Grace,

442
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,940
I was just doing my duty.

443
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,840
If I had not judged fairly,

444
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,020
it would've broken the hearts

445
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,780
of the people of Ling'an.

446
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,540
Miss Jiang,

447
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,220
whenever you change your mind,

448
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,540
I'm still willing to help you pursue

449
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,720
the charge of attempted murder
against Duke An's son.

450
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,340
Thank you for your efforts, My Lord.

451
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,420
It's quite hot today.

452
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,620
We've prepared some cool tea

453
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,620
and snacks at home.

454
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,180
Why don't we go

455
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,220
and enjoy them?

456
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,540
- Yes.
- You're too kind.

457
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:30,740
No need for that.

458
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,380
You're too kind.

459
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,820
Did you just say it was hot

460
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:35,780
and you wanted to buy

461
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,180
some fruit?

462
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,540
Thank you, Miss Jiang.

463
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,180
Please come inside.

464
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:45,060
(Morning Drizzle)

465
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,620
(Haitang Chamber)

466
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,100
Mount Shenjian in Nanwu?

467
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,460
But from what I've heard,

468
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,780
Miss Jiang and her brother

469
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,060
have never left Ling'an,

470
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,260
let alone gone to Mount Shenjian.

471
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,540
So, why does she know about it?

472
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,040
She even drew herself in the painting.

473
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,660
Are you saying the girl
in the painting is Miss Jiang?

474
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,500
Yes.

475
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,060
Why can't I tell

476
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,080
that this is Miss Jiang?

477
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,900
You don't need to tell.

478
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,240
You won't be able to tell.

479
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,400
Chief,

480
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,620
I think we should be careful

481
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,420
not to get entangled
in this investigation.

482
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,580
She must've been to Mount Shenjian

483
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,020
to paint it so clearly.

484
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,060
Chief, look here.

485
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,140
There are two horses in the painting,

486
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,780
yet only one person is riding one.

487
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,180
We need to find

488
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,220
more clues

489
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,420
to solve this mystery.

490
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:10,660
Aman.

491
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,220
Aman.

492
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:13,980
Coming, Miss.

493
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,860
Did you see the painting on the table?

494
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,940
No.

495
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,380
Help me with something.

496
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:33,940
(Maybe Yu Qi)

497
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,660
(has been trying to get close to me)

498
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,900
(to investigate my identity
as the Saintess.)

499
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,540
Miss, the pattern is gone.

500
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,940
Si.

501
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,380
Zhan, what's wrong?

502
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,660
Si, Yu has moved in.

503
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,020
Let's go congratulate him.

504
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,940
You can go by yourself.

505
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,580
- Aman, get some paper for me.
- Yes.

506
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,580
Si.

507
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,540
Yu is new here.

508
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,940
He doesn't know anyone,

509
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,900
and he hasn't made any friends.

510
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,700
He specially

511
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,660
invited me.

512
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,260
What an honor this is.

513
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:09,860
Besides,

514
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,100
he just saved

515
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,780
our lives.

516
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,580
Just go without me.

517
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,420
Well...

518
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,140
I can go on my own.

519
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,700
But if we go together,

520
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,540
won't that show

521
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,260
how prestigious

522
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,140
and impressive our family is?

523
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,780
Zhan, stop persuading me.

524
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,060
I'm going to start painting.

525
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,220
Si.

526
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,260
Tell me the truth.

527
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,780
Did that Yu ever bully you?

528
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,220
What are you saying?

529
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,280
What gives you that idea?

530
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,380
I just feel

531
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,600
you have hostility towards him,

532
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,700
but I can't figure out

533
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,820
what he's done to offend you.

534
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,660
Is it because

535
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,160
he's an uncouth fighter?

536
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,800
So you don't want to associate with him?

537
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,740
Since when have I ever
looked down on fighters?

538
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,940
You must tell me the truth.

539
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,740
Even if he saved my life,

540
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,820
this is different.

541
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,780
If he bullies you,

542
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,260
I'll go beat him today.

543
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,900
Who are you going to beat?

544
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,460
You don't believe me?

545
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,420
I believe you.

546
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:11,820
Let's go, Aman.

547
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,660
Let's go out.

548
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,780
- Yes.
- Great.

549
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,260
This flower is beautiful.

550
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,820
Si, you can add it to the gift list.

551
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:22,740
Give it to me.

552
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,140
Young Master Zhan,

553
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,340
you can give favors,

554
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,420
but why use my lady's treasure for it?

555
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,580
Miss Jiang planted this begonia.

556
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,580
Si,

557
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,580
I've chosen quite a few treasures,

558
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,940
but however exquisite tools are,

559
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,780
they are still vulgar.

560
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,300
Look at this flower.

561
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:42,060
You've arranged it so elegantly.

562
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,380
If we add this to the gift list,

563
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,020
it combines both elegance
and simplicity.

564
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:45,900
That would be perfect.

565
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,740
Young Master Zhan,

566
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,900
since you've prepared gifts,

567
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,200
please leave this begonia alone.

568
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,600
My sister hasn't said anything...

569
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,500
Si,

570
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,980
the gift I chose is my gesture.

571
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,060
You can't go empty-handed.

572
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,700
For now,

573
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:01,740
it seems

574
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,020
there's no more fitting gift.

575
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,660
Miss...

576
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,180
We'll have to make do for now.

577
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,580
Just do as Zhan says.

578
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,300
Yu, congrats on moving in.

579
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,060
Thank you.
It's even livelier with you here.

580
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,460
I've picked out some items for you

581
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,780
to decorate your new home.

582
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,780
You're too kind.

583
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,860
We're friends after all.

584
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:21,660
Thank you.

585
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,780
Yu, you don't know this.

586
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,940
My sister and I

587
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:26,820
are very happy

588
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,220
to be neighbors with you.

589
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,500
I feel the same.

590
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,860
It's made everything convenient.

591
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,060
My sister prepared a gift for you.

592
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,220
This is far from small.

593
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,940
Even in our lady's courtyard,

594
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,620
it's of the finest quality.

595
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,180
Let me see.

596
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,780
Isn't this just a flower?

597
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,860
You don't know this.

598
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,300
This begonia

599
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,940
was planted by our lady,

600
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,180
carefully nurtured day and night.

601
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,140
Even the trimming style

602
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,940
was designed

603
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,100
before it was cut.

604
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,160
Our chief has seen

605
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,420
various precious flowers...

606
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,900
Miss, I told you not to give it to them.

607
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,800
Alright, Aman.

608
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:14,780
Put the flower down.

609
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:16,820
Goodbye.

610
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:19,780
Si...

611
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,740
Yu, don't take offense.

612
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,940
It's okay.

613
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,340
Chief.

614
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,380
It's really nice.

615
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,740
Yu, there's more.

616
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,060
- Come here.
- There's more?

617
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,500
Yes, there's plenty more.

618
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,380
What's so good about it?

619
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,060
You brought so many gifts.

620
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,220
How nice.

621
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,100
The items I brought

622
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,380
are all useful, Yu.

623
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,380
Ji,

624
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,900
bring over the loong

625
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,740
and phoenix vase.

626
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:46,700
Yu,

627
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,900
if you place

628
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,820
this vase here,

629
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,220
it may look vulgar.

630
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,940
- But actually...
- How elegant.

631
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,660
It not only

632
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,860
looks beautiful here

633
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:55,820
but also

634
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,500
brings good fortune.

635
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,100
Place it here.

636
00:26:59,100 --> 00:26:59,940
Alright.

637
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,660
Er'niu, you're here to help, right?

638
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,860
Give it to me.

639
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,340
Good dog.

640
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,680
Why do the brushstrokes in this painting

641
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,180
look so much like my sister's?

642
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:16,820
Really?

643
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,540
Does Miss Jiang

644
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,700
have such talent?

645
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,060
But my sister only paints
flowers and birds,

646
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:24,900
not landscapes.

647
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,540
Yu,

648
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,820
who is the woman in this painting?

649
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,380
How would I know?

650
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,100
She's not your lover?

651
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,140
No.

652
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:35,980
No?

653
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,020
Don't be shy.

654
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,060
The token of Tianxiang House.

655
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,180
Don't deny it.

656
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,220
Tianxiang House?

657
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,860
The best brothel in Ling'an.

658
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,500
Long Dan,

659
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:02,780
don't put your things on my table.

660
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,380
They're not yours?

661
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,460
Got it, got it.

662
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,780
Come on, let's look at the vase.

663
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,400
This morning,

664
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:15,140
someone from Cixin Hall
came to invite you.

665
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,160
It can't be anything good.

666
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,020
If you ask me,

667
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,500
you might as well find an excuse

668
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,140
and not go.

669
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,780
Grandmother sent someone to invite me.

670
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,180
If I don't have a valid reason,

671
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,860
as a granddaughter,

672
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,220
I don't have the right to refuse.

673
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,060
Moreover,

674
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,500
Grandmother is still upset

675
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,500
about the annulment,

676
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,220
waiting to take it out on us.

677
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,700
So, are we going?

678
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,500
If we go, we'll definitely be mocked.

679
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,580
I don't mind

680
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:40,880
how Grandmother treats me.

681
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,780
I just don't want Grandmother

682
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:45,020
to punish Father because of me.

683
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,500
He's not young anymore.

684
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,920
Grandmother should be happy.

685
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,700
Nothing is more important
than your health.

686
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,540
Miss,

687
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,940
sounds like Ms. Jiang Qian's voice.

688
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,020
You're so sweet.

689
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,380
Ms. Jiang Qian,

690
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,700
you should come back often.

691
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:03,740
When you're back,

692
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,420
Lady Jiang's mood improves.

693
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,860
(Jiang Qian)
I'll often come

694
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:09,120
(Wife of Marquis Changxing's heir)
to visit Grandmother.

695
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,920
Grandmother, have some tea.

696
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:13,980
Greetings, Grandmother.

697
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,020
(Jiang Qian...)

698
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,060
(Why?)

699
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,860
Why are you coughing again?

700
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,460
Miss, the medicine is ready.

701
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,140
Give it to me.

702
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:40,980
Yes.

703
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:45,700
Qian, drink the medicine

704
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,620
while it's hot.

705
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,180
It's not bitter.

706
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,300
Then I'll get you

707
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,380
some fruit.

708
00:29:58,980 --> 00:29:59,820
Xingyu.

709
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,100
Xingyu.

710
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:11,500
Qian!

711
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,860
Why are you calling your sister?

712
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,300
She's sleeping.

713
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,660
I'll keep you company.

714
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,180
Qian!

715
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,060
Stop shouting.

716
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,260
What took you so long?

717
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,700
Let go of me, let go of me!

718
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:22,740
Don't shout.

719
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,480
Help!

720
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,580
I told you to come earlier.

721
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,500
Qian.

722
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,740
Qian.

723
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,100
Let go of me.

724
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:37,820
Qian.

725
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:44,780
Jiang Si,

726
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,020
I've waited for you so long.

727
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,380
You can't escape.

728
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,620
Qian.

729
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:55,260
Can't you see your sister is helping me?

730
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:57,900
Come here.

731
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:00,660
Qian.

732
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,660
If you don't come,

733
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,420
I'll go to you.

734
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,780
Qian!

735
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,740
Let go of me.

736
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,580
You smell so good.

737
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:16,700
Let go of me.

738
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,540
Still want to run?

739
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:18,660
(Why?)

740
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,780
(Why would a woman help her husband)

741
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,340
- (hurt her sister?)
- Your sister

742
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,700
specifically came to see you.

743
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:25,780
Si.

744
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,420
Where are your manners?

745
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,860
You don't even greet

746
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,660
your sister?

747
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:32,900
Qian.

748
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:34,820
Don't stand there.

749
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,780
Come and sit down.

750
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,780
Si, long time no see.

751
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:45,980
I've really missed you.

752
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,660
Sorry for making you suffer.

753
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,620
I didn't suffer.

754
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,380
You don't need to pity me.

755
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,020
Si.

756
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,340
Grandmother, don't be angry.

757
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,620
Si feels upset

758
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,180
because of the annulment.

759
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:03,110
No.

760
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,260
I'm actually fine.

761
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,620
It's you

762
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,340
who keeps bringing it up

763
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,220
that makes me upset.

764
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,620
Si,

765
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,620
why can't you appreciate
someone's kindness?

766
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,700
After Qian knew about your situation,

767
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,220
she immediately came to see you.

768
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,060
But you

769
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:19,860
aren't grateful at all.

770
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,940
Hurry and apologize to Qian.

771
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,060
Grandmother,

772
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,420
I haven't fought

773
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,820
or argued with her.

774
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,420
Why should I apologize to her

775
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,220
for no reason?

776
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,460
Qian,

777
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,140
did I offend you?

778
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:33,580
No.

779
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,420
Have I reminded you

780
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,580
of Yi?

781
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,140
Is that why you're upset?

782
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,860
If I miss Yi,

783
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,340
I'd go see her.

784
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,060
It's between Yi and me.

785
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,380
No need for you to worry.

786
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,420
Si,

787
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,380
you're lacking manners,

788
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,020
always targeting Qian.

789
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,540
Should I bring down the family penalty?

790
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,760
Grandmother, please calm down.

791
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,900
It's getting late.

792
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:59,140
I'm busy back home.

793
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:00,780
I should return.

794
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,340
You should return to work.

795
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,660
You're married now,
not as free as before.

796
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,660
I'll leave first.

797
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:08,580
Take care of yourself.

798
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,940
Live well.

799
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,860
Si, please walk me out.

800
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,260
After this time apart,

801
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,580
I feel like

802
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,060
you've become distant.

803
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,980
Qian, you must be mistaken.

804
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:28,660
That's good.

805
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,780
Glad we're still close.

806
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:34,220
I know you've been feeling down lately.

807
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:35,860
How about this?

808
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,500
I'll send you an invitation,

809
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,220
and you can stay with me for a few days.

810
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:40,060
What do you think?

811
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,980
I'll invite the other sisters too.

812
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,820
Why are you looking at me like that?

813
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,780
Do I have something on my face?

814
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,100
During the fighting match days ago,

815
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,020
my husband accidentally injured Zhan.

816
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,180
I've heard about it.

817
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,940
Si, are you angry?

818
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:11,180
People can get out of control
in contests,

819
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,500
let alone Xingyu.

820
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,500
Perfect timing.

821
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,380
If you come to our place,

822
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:17,900
I'll have Xingyu

823
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,180
apologize to you.

824
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:20,580
No need.

825
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,140
Yi will be back soon.

826
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,620
I'll stay at home waiting for her.

827
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:28,620
Come to my place for now.

828
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:29,980
Once Yi arrives,

829
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,580
I'll send you back. How about that?

830
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,940
Didn't you just say

831
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,020
you're busy

832
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:34,900
back at home?

833
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,260
If you don't return,

834
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,780
Xingyu will get worried.

835
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,940
Ma'am, the things are packed.

836
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:40,980
We can leave now.

837
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:46,580
Alright then.

838
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:47,900
If you want to come,

839
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,180
you're always welcome.

840
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,660
Your younger sister's looks

841
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,100
are truly extraordinary.

842
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,860
She's so delicate.

843
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,300
Such a beauty.

844
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,300
How unlucky Ji Chongyi is.

845
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,700
Tomorrow, go to your maiden home,

846
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,860
visit Miss Si,

847
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,580
and invite her to our home

848
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,180
to relax.

849
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:42,820
What do you want?

850
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,300
She's my sister.

851
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,340
What?

852
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,420
Are you refusing me?

853
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,100
I'll ask you one last time.

854
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:20,340
Will you go or not?

Everything is sent by Ms. Jiang Yi.

866
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,900
To Si, my dear sister:

867
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:39,260
All things are peaceful
when you feel calm.

868
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,260
Don't waste time crying

869
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,700
for unworthy people.

870
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,220
The man for you will come

871
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:45,780
with a bright future.

872
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,140
You should wait.

873
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,780
Sorry for not coming in person.

874
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,340
I feel guilty.

875
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:52,940
Please don't blame me.

876
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,460
(Jiang Yi, Jiang Si's eldest sister)
When we meet,

877
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,620
we can talk about everything.

878
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,700
May you be healthy.

879
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,580
(Last time,)

880
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,380
(soon after Yi got divorced)

881
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,820
(and returned home,)

882
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,140
(she poisoned herself and died.)

883
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,620
(She was only 20)

884
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,100
(when she died.)

885
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:16,980
(Yi,)

886
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:18,780
(this time,)

887
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,300
(no one can hurt you.)

888
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,700
- Did you see a child like this?
- No.

889
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,340
Hey, have you seen my daughter?

890
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,300
- She's Niuniu.
- No.

891
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,140
Have you seen Niuniu?

892
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,400
- Is she that mad woman?
- No.

893
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,700
It seems like Ms. Xiu.

894
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:41,460
She's looking for her child every day.

895
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:43,100
- She's gone mad.
- Niuniu.

896
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,300
This mad woman

897
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:45,660
- is a tofu seller.
- Niuniu.

898
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:46,920
People call her the Tofu Beauty.

899
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,480
- She's a widow.
- Have you seen her?

900
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,580
- She raised her daughter alone.
- She's this tall.

901
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,350
But her daughter

902
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,290
- went missing.
- Sir.

903
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:53,380
- Have you seen her?
- No.

904
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,220
She's so pitiful.

905
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,300
Niuniu.

906
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:06,660
Niuniu.

907
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:07,940
You're Niuniu.

908
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,060
She's not your daughter.

909
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,360
- This is my lady.
- Step aside.

910
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,620
- Aman.
- Niuniu.

911
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,180
Niuniu.

912
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,660
Where did you go?

913
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,100
Ma'am,

914
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:18,860
you got it wrong.

915
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,820
(Ms. Xiu)

916
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:22,900
You look just like her.

917
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,540
You look just like her.

918
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,500
When other kids

919
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,660
went out to play,

920
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,460
she never joined them.

921
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:32,420
She was always making tofu with me.

922
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,940
Before she went missing,

923
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,260
she never got to enjoy herself.

924
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,860
She said she'd come back
after selling tofu

925
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,620
at Marquis Changxing's Mansion.

926
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,340
Where did she go?

927
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:44,700
Niuniu.

928
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,580
Niuniu.

929
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:49,580
Niuniu.

930
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,900
Where are you, Niuniu?

931
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:53,740
I'm not her.

932
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,340
Niuniu.

933
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,540
Have you seen a child like this?

934
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,380
No.

935
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,580
Marquis Changxing's Mansion.

936
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,380
Aman, get me paper and an envelope.

937
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:13,620
Yes.

938
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,300
(Niuniu looks a little like me.)

939
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,980
(The last place she went)

940
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,740
(was Marquis Changxing's Mansion.)

941
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,340
(If I'm not mistaken,)

942
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,100
(that innocent girl)

943
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,420
(must've gone missing)

944
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,180
(at Marquis Changxing's Mansion)

945
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,320
(because she looks like me.)

946
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,980
(Cao Xingyu is a vile man.)

947
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:45,580
(I can avoid him,)

948
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:46,820
(but I can't stop him)

949
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:47,980
(from hurting others.)

950
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:51,940
(Qian)

951
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:02,220
Aman,

952
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,340
send this letter

953
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:04,820
to Marquis Changxing's Mansion.

954
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:07,620
But didn't we just refuse Ms. Jiang Qian?

955
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,300
Do we have to go
to Marquis Changxing's Mansion?

956
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:11,780
The refusal is for now.

957
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,460
- Go ahead.
- Yes.

958
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:35,380
Jiang Si, do you know?

959
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:36,940
The more you struggle,

960
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:39,180
the more excited I get.

961
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:49,660
(That place is scarier
than a nightmare.)

962
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,420
(However dangerous it is,)

963
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,020
(I still have to go.)

964
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:54,260
(This time,)

965
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,500
(the evil should get)

966
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:56,820
(their just deserts.)

967
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,700
(Earl Dongping's Mansion)

968
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:03,820
Si.

969
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,820
- Zhan.
- Are you going out?

970
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:11,020
Some fragrances are left
at Qiaoxiang Shop.

971
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,810
- I'll go get them.
- What a coincidence.

972
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:14,420
I was just about to leave.

973
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:15,500
Let me go with you.

974
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:16,660
Sure.

975
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:17,500
Young Master Zhan,

976
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:19,260
didn't we just return?

977
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:20,180
Let's go.

978
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:21,380
(West Market)

979
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:22,220
Is it nice?

980
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,380
Yes.

981
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:24,940
Candied hawthorn.

982
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:26,140
Candied hawthorn.

983
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:27,260
Would you like one?

984
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:28,660
Do you want candied hawthorn?

985
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:30,180
Aman, do you want some?

986
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,420
A little.

987
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:32,540
- Here.
- Here, Si.

988
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,100
Thank you, Miss.

989
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:39,180
Young Master, you don't want it?

990
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,300
What a joke.

991
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:42,420
What man eats candied hawthorn?

992
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:45,180
(Qiaoxiang Shop)
It's closed.

993
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:46,780
Shall we change to another one?

994
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,380
No need, Qiaoniang
left the door open for me.

995
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:50,540
You go in first.

996
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:51,380
I'll wait outside.

997
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:52,420
Okay, Zhan.

998
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:57,940
(Miss Jiang Si, always available)

999
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:05,060
