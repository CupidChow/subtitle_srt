00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,360
(Peace and Prosperity)
She's well-informed.

12
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,360
The Grand Princess will soon receive the news

13
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:45,100
that Princess Fuqing can see again.

14
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,260
What are you going to tell her?

15
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:49,770
Rest assured, Saintess.

16
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:51,290
I know what to say.

17
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,740
I have a question.

18
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:57,610
Was my mother,

19
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,460
Earl Dongping's wife,

20
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,380
Su Ke,

21
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,660
killed by you?

22
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,130
The Grand Princess killed her

23
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,500
with the Slumber Flower from Nanwu.

24
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:23,460
(Peace and Prosperity)

25
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:25,850
Wait, Your Highness.

26
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,010
Your eyes have just recovered.

27
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:29,530
They should avoid bright light.

28
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,040
Wait a few more days to take it off.

29
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,620
Ms. Hua,

30
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:36,410
I'd like some space, please.

31
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:38,290
Yes.

32
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,260
What about Princess Fuqing?

33
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,940
Back then, she was a little girl.

34
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:04,890
Why poison her?

35
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,780
She knew the Grand Princess's scheme.

36
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:27,610
(Peace and Prosperity)

37
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,180
Go back and rest, Your Highness.

38
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,700
Your eyes are fine now.

39
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,260
You'll have plenty of time

40
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,620
to see everything.

41
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,140
If I don't see it now,

42
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,100
what if I...?

43
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,020
It won't happen.

44
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,420
Don't be afraid.

45
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,020
Your Highness,

46
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,260
I can cure your eye disease

47
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,100
but not your fear.

48
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,900
You can only overcome it yourself.

49
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,460
To get rid of nightmares,

50
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,140
we have to be brave and face the truth.

51
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,260
(Grand Princess's Mansion)

52
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,180
What did you do?

53
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,260
Why is Jiang Si still alive?

54
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,740
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

55
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,820
Just when my plan was

56
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,180
about to succeed,

57
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,660
His Majesty and Prince Yan

58
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:16,940
came to the Changning Palace.

59
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,380
Had I proceeded with it,

60
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,820
they would've got suspicious.

61
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,900
I've had you work for me for so long

62
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,700
because you can get things done neatly.

63
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,380
But this time, you failed

64
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,020
while Jiang Si recognized the Mang Worm

65
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,300
and helped Fuqing recover her eyesight.

66
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,060
How was that possible?

67
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,940
Don't worry, Your Highness.

68
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,020
Prince Yan must've learned

69
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,780
some skills from Nanwu in the South,

70
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,060
which cured Princess Fuqing.

71
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,020
They told His Majesty that they had

72
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,100
found a folk prescription.

73
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,420
They didn't mention anything about Nanwu.

74
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,940
In that case,

75
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,700
they didn't suspect you?

76
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,100
No.

77
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,060
Mother, Si is right.

78
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,300
If I refuse to face the truth,

79
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,140
even if I can see again,

80
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,900
I'll still be shadowed

81
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,100
by fear.

82
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:05,740
Mother,

83
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,780
my blindness

84
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,100
was man-made!

85
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,540
Really?

86
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,180
What happened?

87
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,140
I saw something

88
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,780
I shouldn't have.

89
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,020
(13th Year of Jingming)
I was locked in a closet

90
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,580
when playing hide-and-seek.

91
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,180
Empress Qingrong

92
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,500
acts against me in everything.

93
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,660
She even talked wildly

94
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:34,380
that I'd better move out of Ling'an.

95
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,780
Once the Crown Prince ascended the throne,

96
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,740
it'd be too late for me to leave.

97
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,540
Alright then.

98
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,940
I'll make sure

99
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,700
she won't make it to that day

100
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,180
or be buried in the Imperial Mausoleum.

101
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,180
Are you sure the poison you said

102
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,140
can make people look like

103
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,340
they die of leprosy?

104
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,140
Yes.

105
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,340
Good.

106
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,940
When others are up there tonight
for the Chongyang Festival,

107
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,780
you slip in the poison.

108
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,220
Fuqing,

109
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,700
what did you just see?

110
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,300
Did you hear anything?

111
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,940
I... I fell asleep.

112
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,900
I didn't hear or see anything.

113
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,540
Good girl.

114
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,980
Aren't you a sweetie?

115
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,820
I wish Mingyue

116
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,420
could be as good as you.

117
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,540
Tonight, your father

118
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,900
will fly a lantern from the Zhengyang Tower.

119
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,180
Come on. Let's go and look.

120
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,500
I... I'm not going.

121
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,060
I want my mother.

122
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,180
She's on the way.

123
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,860
You'll see her in a moment.

124
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,460
A good girl like you deserves

125
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,460
a reward.

126
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,820
Do you want your mother

127
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,540
to be the new Empress?

128
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,740
Fuqing, come here.

129
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,220
May Dazhou be blessed

130
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,460
with good weather, peace, and prosperity.

131
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,380
May Dazhou be blessed

132
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:44,660
with good weather, peace, and prosperity.

133
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,340
So that's why I was appointed

134
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,620
empress.

135
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,220
I thought His Majesty chose me

136
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,260
because of your condition.

137
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,540
Being the Empress

138
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,180
or the head of the harem

139
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,380
means nothing to me.

140
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,980
I'd rather see you

141
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,700
forever safe

142
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,220
and healthy.

143
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,580
Don't blame yourself, Mother.

144
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:13,940
The one who harmed me

145
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,340
was Grand Princess Rongyang.

146
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,220
You're her niece.

147
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,100
How could she be so heartless?

148
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,620
Your Highess,

149
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,020
she's not half as kind

150
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:23,940
as you.

151
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,580
She harmed not only Fuqing

152
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,380
but also me.

153
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,940
To prevent Cui Xu from being punished

154
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,860
and my mother from being promoted,

155
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,220
she had those of Astronomy

156
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,660
paint me as a cursed prince.

157
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,140
Right after I was born,

158
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,740
I was sent away to the South.

159
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,660
What?

160
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,860
She even dared frame a prince?

161
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,820
How wildly audacious!

162
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,500
I shouldn't have listened to you

163
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,980
to be lenient.

164
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,860
Instead of killing that girl,

165
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,620
I simply ruined her eyes,

166
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,020
but I also made her mother

167
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,460
the Empress

168
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,060
as compensation.

169
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,460
But now,

170
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,780
they might bite the hand

171
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,580
that feeds them.

172
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,900
If that girl lets out

173
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,060
what I did...

174
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,500
Your Highness,

175
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,860
Empress Qingrong died years ago.

176
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,660
Besides,

177
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,820
who'd believe

178
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,420
what a blind girl saw?

179
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,380
Isn't that why

180
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,260
she was blinded in the first place?

181
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,380
I've served Empress Di for decades.

182
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,460
I know her all too well.

183
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,220
Had she known the truth back then,

184
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,020
she would've

185
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,860
had her daughter suffer in silence.

186
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,580
Between blindness and death,

187
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,620
she knew what to choose.

188
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,220
But things have changed.

189
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,380
However weak she is,

190
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,900
she's been the Empress for so long.

191
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,220
Power

192
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,180
changes people the most,

193
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,060
making them forget who they are.

194
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,500
Compare her

195
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,460
with the late empress

196
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,380
at her peak,

197
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,500
is she any better?

198
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,500
You're right.

199
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,220
I lost my head for the moment.

200
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,820
I'll show them

201
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,860
who my brother cherishes

202
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,540
and trusts the most.

203
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,380
The Empress, Yu Jin?

204
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,540
They're worthless!

205
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,700
We must stop the Grand Princess

206
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,300
from wreaking havoc in the harem

207
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,300
and harming the innocent.

208
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,340
If we report her

209
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,580
to His Majesty together

210
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,340
and reinvestigate the late Empress's death,

211
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,620
the Crown Prince will no longer support her.

212
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,420
Only if she's brought to justice

213
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,580
will Princess Fuqing

214
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,020
find security and be freed

215
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,620
from nightmares.

216
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,540
No.

217
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,380
Mother!

218
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,860
Fuqing was blind for 10 years!

219
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,220
Are you going to let it slide?

220
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,740
As long as she's safe,

221
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,460
I'll swallow it.

222
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,420
When the late Empress fought her

223
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,660
with the Crown Prince's help,

224
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,220
did she win?

225
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,820
Such a powerful woman

226
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,860
died a horrible death.

227
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,180
I've lived in the Palace

228
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,420
for so long.

229
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,660
I might not be capable,

230
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,140
but I'm certain

231
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,860
about one thing.

232
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,900
That is the Grand Princess

233
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,580
is special to His Majesty.

234
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,740
Although they aren't of the same mother,

235
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,860
they grew up together

236
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,020
through thick and thin.

237
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,740
When Prince Xiang rebelled,

238
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,900
she guarded the state

239
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,460
and risked her life

240
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,860
to save His Majesty.

241
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,380
Put Fuqing aside.

242
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,300
Even the Crown Prince and Prince Qi

243
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,420
aren't as important as her

244
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,580
to His Majesty.

245
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,340
It's better to swallow it

246
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,020
if it's not life-and-death.

247
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,260
Once you get married

248
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,820
and have children,

249
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,020
live your life and look after your family.

250
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,260
Don't challenge her.

251
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,180
But Your Highness...

252
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,380
We understand your concern,

253
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:04,820
Your Highess.

254
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:10,940
Mother!

255
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,300
Did you hear

256
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,280
that Jiang Si had found a folk prescription

257
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:18,060
and cured Princess Fuqing's eye disease?

258
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,260
She was blind for so long,

259
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:21,940
and now, my uncle

260
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,100
will favor her even more!

261
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,300
Do you have other ways to change his mind?

262
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,540
Am I not able to marry Yu Jin?

263
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,460
If I can't marry him,

264
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,900
I'd rather die!

265
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,180
Is he all you care about?

266
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,380
Do you even remember

267
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,500
my birthday is coming?

268
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,140
I...

269
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,140
Uncle

270
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,020
comes every year

271
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,140
to celebrate it with you.

272
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,740
I've never bagged anyone,

273
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,780
not even your uncle,

274
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,820
but this time, I'll do it for you.

275
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,660
Thank you, Mother.

276
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,140
Bringing down the Grand Princess

277
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,940
once and for all

278
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,700
isn't as easy as I thought.

279
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,660
Had I not been made in front of Ms. Duo,

280
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,500
we wouldn't have had to

281
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,620
walk on eggs like this.

282
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,540
You've done well enough.

283
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:24,900
Don't beat yourself up.

284
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,660
Given Her Highness's attitude,

285
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,780
even if we

286
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,260
handed Ms. Duo to her

287
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,500
on a plate,

288
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,580
she wouldn't fight the Grand Princess.

289
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,700
But someone has to take the first step.

290
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:40,260
Something has to be done.

291
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,260
I agree with one thing

292
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,300
she said, though.

293
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:46,980
What was it?

294
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,940
Live our life and look after our family.

295
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,460
We can't think about

296
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,810
fighting the Grand Princess all day

297
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,560
and forget about our wedding.

298
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,540
The Rites Office is

299
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,700
preparing everything.

300
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,620
They've done it more than once.

301
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,860
Do we have to

302
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,020
work on it ourselves?

303
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,420
Have you learned the etiquette?

304
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,020
Isn't that a mere formality?

305
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,300
Besides,

306
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,380
if I get down to it,

307
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,740
I'll master everything in no time.

308
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:08,940
Have you tried the gown?

309
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:11,900
No.

310
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,260
Have you checked the furnishings?

311
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,660
You'll be the mistress of our mansion.

312
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,500
Do I have to check them myself?

313
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,860
The mansion looks

314
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,820
good enough as it is.

315
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,700
Do you need to ask?

316
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,060
Clearly, you're being lazy.

317
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,300
This is our wedding.

318
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,620
It's the biggest event

319
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,420
in our life.

320
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,740
I have to make sure

321
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,180
you like everything in our mansion,

322
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,460
the food to be served at the wedding,

323
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,500
and the wedding gown you'll be wearing.

324
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,540
But most importantly,

325
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,420
I love the man I'm going to marry.

326
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,580
(Crown Prince's Mansion)

327
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,500
Your Highness,

328
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:51,940
I copied the Vajra Sutra

329
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,180
after being on a vegetarian diet

330
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,140
for three days.

331
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,340
It's the thought that matters
for her birthday.

332
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,340
(Vajra Sutra)
Sutra?

333
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,700
Aunt's never

334
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,620
into Buddhism.

335
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:02,900
I don't think

336
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,700
this gift is to her taste.

337
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,380
Take a look at this.

338
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,860
The Tree of Fortune and Wealth

339
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,060
(Crown Princess)
from the Commander of Xiling.

340
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,620
It's most auspicious.

341
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,780
You probably forgot

342
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,340
we had given her

343
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,620
that gift three years ago.

344
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:19,860
It's too perfunctory.

345
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:25,660
Nothing is perfect.

346
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,580
Take them away.

347
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:31,940
Your Highness,

348
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,900
it's just a birthday gift.

349
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,620
If you don't like those,

350
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,140
I'll prepare something else.

351
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,740
Don't worry too much.

352
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,980
Don't worry?

353
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,380
Ever since Mother left,

354
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,900
how many times has Consort Xian

355
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,820
set me up

356
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,460
to bring me down for her son, Zhang?

357
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,850
Have you forgotten all that?

358
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,540
I wouldn't dare.

359
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,260
You're allergic to walnuts,

360
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,780
but she once

361
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,380
slipped chopped walnuts

362
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,420
into your desserts,

363
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,260
which almost killed you.

364
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,180
Grand Princess saved your life

365
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,740
and told His Majesty about it

366
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,900
to have Consort Xian punished.

367
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,220
Indeed!

368
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,020
Despite the past between her and Mother,

369
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,300
she helped me keep my post.

370
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:10,980
Over the years,

371
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,740
Zhang's never stopped fighting me

372
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,460
but he's never won.

373
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,540
Why?

374
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,460
Because I have

375
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,060
Aunt's full support!

376
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,020
You're right, Your Highness.

377
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,500
I'll always remember that.

378
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,740
Your Highness,

379
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,470
the Grand Princess said

380
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,500
there'd be no banquet

381
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,550
for her birthday this year.

382
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,780
No banquet?

383
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,180
It was held every year.

384
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,700
Her mood must've been spoiled

385
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,020
by Mingyue.

386
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,380
It's Jin's fault!

387
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,620
In that case,

388
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:45,740
Your Highness,

389
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,820
do we still need to prepare a gift?

390
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,900
Without the banquet,

391
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,900
the gift has to be even better!

392
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,900
Never mind. I'll prepare it myself.

393
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,380
He only remembers his aunt's birthday,

394
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,900
but he's long forgotten

395
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,380
the day his mother died.

396
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:11,340
(Grand Princess's Mansion)

397
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,940
Where's everyone?

398
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,780
It's her birthday.

399
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,660
Why is it so quiet?

400
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,460
Her Highness is in the pavilion.

401
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,140
Rongyang.

402
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,020
Brother.

403
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,100
Today is your birthday.

404
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,100
Why are you drinking cold liquor here alone?

405
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:55,740
Brother,

406
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,140
to this day, only you

407
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,940
still remember my birthday.

408
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,500
Not just me.

409
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,740
So do your husband,

410
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,700
your daughter,

411
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,220
and everyone else in this house.

412
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,660
I've lost everything.

413
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,180
Cui Xu left.

414
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,820
Mingyue let me down.

415
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,980
She threatened me

416
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,220
with her life to marry a man.

417
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,700
People only see my wealth and glory

418
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,060
but not my sadness and loneliness inside.

419
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,580
Here,

420
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,180
Brother,

421
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,700
let's drink.

422
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,060
Do you remember this robe?

423
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,380
Of course.

424
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,060
Back then, you put on

425
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,380
that robe to drive away

426
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,400
Prince Yan's rebel forces.

427
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,020
I seized

428
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,780
the throne at the risk

429
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,740
of your life.

430
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,620
Without you,

431
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:07,740
the one

432
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,820
sitting in that chair now

433
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,300
would be Prince Xiang.

434
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,460
I've never regretted it,

435
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,420
not even when he

436
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,780
had me hung on the city wall

437
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:18,940
for three days and nights.

438
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,740
I've had no regrets whatsoever.

439
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,940
I didn't do it for Dazhou

440
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,020
or the throne

441
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,500
but for you because you were

442
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,580
my only brother and dearest family.

443
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,500
Rongyang,

444
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,500
in this world,

445
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,180
only you truly care about me.

446
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,660
You're my dearest family, too.

447
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,980
I'll die for you

448
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,940
with no regrets.

449
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,380
- Stop!
- Stop!

450
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,540
Who's inside?

451
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:06,400
(Changning Palace)
I'm on a mission

452
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,020
for the Empress.

453
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,260
It's confidential.

454
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,340
Your Highness, we're out.

455
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,780
Please sit tight.

456
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,330
The Empress didn't tell His Majesty

457
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:18,460
that she let you hang out.

458
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,980
She told me repeatedly

459
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,070
to keep a low profile
and put your safety first.

460
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,380
I know.

461
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,700
Fried dough sticks. Want some?

462
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,500
Here, Miss.

463
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:28,940
Watch out.

464
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,100
Look, Ms. Duo!

465
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,540
Amazing!

466
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,140
Good! Great!

467
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,060
Careful.

468
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,820
Hand-knitting amulets!

469
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,340
Take a look!

470
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,380
No!

471
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,540
Don't prick your hand.

472
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,820
For safety, fortune, and marriage.

473
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,900
Which color do you prefer, Miss?

474
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,140
- I like this one.
- Buy no one.

475
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,620
Everything's poorly made

476
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,980
and way beneath you.

477
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:58,820
Let's go.

478
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,980
Freshly made ice yuanzi.

479
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:03,740
Come and take a look.

480
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,980
(Cold Noodles)
Ice yuanzi!

481
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,100
(Purple Perilla, Cold Bean)

482
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,860
I want the Cream Curd,

483
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,820
Snow Ice Yuanzi,

484
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,180
- and...
- No.

485
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,740
Street snacks aren't healthy.

486
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,300
What if they

487
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,420
give you diarrhea?

488
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,220
I've been hanging out for so long.

489
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,580
I'm hungry.

490
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,140
Have some of these.

491
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,740
We'll go back to have dinner.

492
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,060
I'll fetch some hot water.

493
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,320
Please wait for me inside.

494
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,700
Is it the first time he's come to us?

495
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:13,860
Yes.

496
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,700
Where's he?

497
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,220
There he is, Mr. Zhen.

498
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,300
I, Zhen Heng...

499
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,340
I know a kite that sounds.

500
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,740
Even if you can't see it,

501
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,380
you'll know where the kite goes.

502
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:31,740
Mr. Zhen!

503
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,930
What are you doing here?

504
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,460
You...

505
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:56,580
You can see now.

506
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,220
Who cured

507
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,260
your eye disease?

508
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,100
It was Jiang Si.

509
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,740
Did you come out alone?

510
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:09,700
No.

511
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,260
Ms. Duo escorted me.

512
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,700
She went to get hot water.

513
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,300
She'll be back soon.

514
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,180
Hot water?

515
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,340
She must've gone to the shops nearby.

516
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,420
Guard.

517
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,540
Help Her Highness find Ms. Duo.

518
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:25,980
Yes.

519
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,620
It's not safe to be alone.

520
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:31,980
Your mother will be worried.

521
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,500
How about

522
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,220
I escort you back first?

523
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,660
May I stay a bit longer?

524
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,540
My mother finally

525
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,740
let me out.

526
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,460
I want to walk around

527
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,520
and see as much as possible

528
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,300
so that I can recall it

529
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,980
when I get back to the Palace.

530
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,420
Besides, I'm not alone.

531
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,860
Aren't you here with me?

532
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:08,940
Alright then.

533
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,440
I'll take you to a place.

534
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,180
Thanks, Master.

535
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,500
Where are we?

536
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,300
So many fish!

537
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:22,860
Be careful, though.

538
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,820
This is

539
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,540
my secret place to relax.

540
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,540
Whenever I become too tired,

541
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,460
I'll come here.

542
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,660
Look!

543
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,540
Take a break from work

544
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,660
and clear my head.

545
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,190
Then go back to solve more cases.

546
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,020
I thought

547
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,380
you could do anything.

548
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,180
Turns out, even you'll feel down sometimes.

549
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,020
Of course.

550
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,860
You know, everyone

551
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,620
and everything

552
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,340
has two sides:

553
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,580
the bright one

554
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,180
and the dark one.

555
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,740
Now that you're free to come out,

556
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,220
and your eyes are fine,

557
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,860
you'll see all the good things

558
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,100
in the world

559
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:18,780
as well as

560
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:22,020
those that aren't so good.

561
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:25,700
Your Highness,

562
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,700
when you see the latter,

563
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,220
don't be afraid.

564
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,740
I believe

565
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,660
if you can

566
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,940
get to the bottom of everything,

567
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,180
it won't be a problem.

568
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:39,940
Don't you agree?

569
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,420
Others say

570
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,820
you're stubborn and rigid,

571
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,500
but it's not until now

572
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,780
that I know more about you.

573
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:52,260
You're determined to make

574
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,900
this world a better place

575
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:54,860
where everyone

576
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,500
will live in bright light,

577
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,700
so you have to be tough enough

578
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,700
against darkness, right?

579
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:04,980
To me,

580
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:07,980
the law is the light

581
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,940
to shine on justice and fight darkness.

582
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,620
What are these?

583
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,460
They're luminous!

584
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,740
They're fireflies.

585
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,420
It's said that when it's dark,

586
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,900
they'll guide people through darkness.

587
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,820
They use themselves

588
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,060
to light up others.

589
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,820
It stays in your hand.

590
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,380
This is called

591
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:01,580
your heart gets what it wants.

592
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,420
Here you are.

593
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,620
Try to hold it.

594
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:37,220
Where did Mr. Zhen take Her Highness?

595
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,700
The palace gates are about to close.

596
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,740
Why isn't she back yet?

597
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,220
Ms. Duo.

598
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,100
Your Highness,

599
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,740
there you are.

600
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,940
We should thank Mr. Zhen.

601
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,380
Thank you, sir.

602
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,760
The gates will soon close.

603
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,140
We have to go back.

604
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,260
Sure.

605
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,860
Thanks, Ms. Duo.

606
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,300
Good night, Your Highness.

607
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,340
Ms. Duo,

608
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,340
what took you

609
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,660
so long this afternoon?

610
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,020
I waited and waited.

611
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,580
I broke a ceramic bottle.

612
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,420
The shop owner meant to rip me off

613
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,020
and wouldn't let me go.

614
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,780
Close the gate!

615
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,940
(Prince Yan's Mansion)

616
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,620
I'm surprised.

617
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:48,700
No one but Prince Yan

618
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,900
would suggest a rehearsal.

619
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,660
The couple shall bow!

620
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,620
Bow once.

621
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,700
Bow again.

622
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,020
Bow to each other.

623
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:08,940
Rise.

An imperial edict

636
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:03,420
for Prince Yan, Yu Jin!

637
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,740
"Prince Yan, Yu Jin,

638
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:10,500
is virtuous, talented, and devoted.

639
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,340
He's made great achievements as the head

640
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,140
of the Chiyu Cavalry and Capital Security.

641
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,260
Also, he's a filial son

642
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,380
and a wonderful brother.

643
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,260
Prince Yan didn't grow up in the Palace

644
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,820
with me.

645
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,660
I feel guilty about that.

646
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:28,860
I've betrothed Jiang Si,
Earl Dongping's lineal daughter,

647
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,700
to you as your wife,

648
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,420
but the Jiang Clan is humble.

649
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,100
Now, I've selected

650
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,940
Grand Princess Rongyang's lineal daughter,

651
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,300
Princess Mingyue,

652
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:39,540
for you.

653
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,820
She and Jiang Si are equals as your wives.

654
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,860
They shall obey you."

655
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,940
Please accept the edict.

656
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,540
Long Dan, get my horse!

657
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,460
Yes, Chief.

658
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,540
Trust me.

659
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:02,060
I'll marry you and you alone.

660
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,740
Wait for me.

661
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,100
Danger! He's breaking in!

662
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,900
Beat the drum to alert all!

663
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,940
Stand down. It's Prince Jin!

664
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,580
Prince Jin has rushed through five gates

665
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,200
(Tiande Hall)
to your hall, Your Majesty.

666
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,180
(Zhengyang Gate)

667
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,460
(Tiande Hall)

668
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:46,220
Sorry, His Majesty's occupied.

669
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,060
Please take this back, Father!

670
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:50,060
Your Highness, an edict shows heaven's will.

671
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,620
It can't be taken back!

672
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:54,220
Please take this back, Father!

673
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,060
It's a great honor for you

674
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,060
to have two princesses together.

675
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:03,460
Please take this back, Father!

676
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,380
Your Highness!

677
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:06,340
- Who summoned you?
- You can't say that!

678
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:13,180
Please take this back, Father.

679
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,340
You rushed through five gates.

680
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,140
What do you think you're doing?

681
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,660
No one has ever done that

682
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,220
since Dazhou was founded.

683
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,940
They're palace gates, not your doors.

684
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,490
You can't go through them as you please!

685
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,780
I was

686
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:26,620
in a rush

687
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,060
and forgot the rules.

688
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,020
What you forgot

689
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,180
is your identity.

690
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,580
Do you still think

691
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,100
you're Yu Qi in the South?

692
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,020
Not anymore!

693
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,820
You're a prince with a title!

694
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:38,820
Officials are

695
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,620
watching everything you say and do.

696
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:41,940
If this matter gets out,

697
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,220
what will they think of me?

698
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,060
If I can't keep my own son in check,

699
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,140
how can I rule a state?

700
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,820
Look what you did.

701
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,140
You broke through

702
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,180
five palace gates

703
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,940
simply because of your marriage.

704
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,860
Others might think you meant to rebel!

705
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,060
I wouldn't dare.

706
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,660
Baoping, what's the penalty for his breach?

707
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,620
Say it.

708
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:10,740
Say it!

709
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,100
Your Majesty,

710
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:15,260
it's the death penalty on him

711
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,580
and his entire clan!

712
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:17,940
His entire clan, huh?

713
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,140
Yu Jin,

714
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,940
did you mean to have me killed, too?

715
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:21,860
No, Father!

716
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,220
I acted on impulse.

717
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,700
Please retract the edict.

718
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,580
Would you rather see Jiang Si

719
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,500
die for you, too?

720
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,060
Baoping,

721
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,960
how many days are left until the wedding?

722
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,020
Your Majesty,

723
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,500
four days are left.

724
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,380
I see.

725
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,340
Wait four days

726
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,060
and marry as planned!

727
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,060
Father, Father, Father!

728
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,460
Father, I can't!

729
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,660
I won't marry Mingyue!

730
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,820
Please retract the edict, Father...!

731
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:49,140
- Let go, Your Highness!
- Please, Father!

732
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:52,460
- Retract the edict!
- Your Highness, let go!

733
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,220
Father,

734
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,620
do you think

735
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:59,100
you can force it on me?

736
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,780
I'd rather die

737
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,340
than marry her!

738
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,740
You'd rather die?

739
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,300
Fine.

740
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,740
I'll grant it.

741
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:26,540
I can be

742
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,780
an idle prince.

743
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,340
We'll close the gate

744
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,420
and live our own life

745
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,300
in peace at leisure.

746
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,380
I fear our wish won't come true.

747
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:01,540
Miss Si!

748
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,520
What happened, Long Dan?

749
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,300
What did you find?

750
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,760
Chief broke through five palace gates

751
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:06,780
to refuse the betrothal.

752
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,140
Where is he now?

753
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,020
He's kneeling in front of the Tiande Hall.

754
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,690
He said he'd rather die than accept it.

755
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:13,720
What did His Majesty say?

756
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:15,940
He said

757
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,340
he'd grant it.

758
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,260
- Miss!
- Miss!

759
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,500
(Peace and Prosperity)

760
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:31,740
Your Majesty,

761
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,780
I had the kitchen

762
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,340
make your favorite dishes

763
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,220
and other refreshing food.

764
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:40,460
If you mean to speak for Yu Jin,

765
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,660
don't bother.

766
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,300
Let's eat.

767
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,100
A banquet is going to be held.

768
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:53,500
I'll make sure

769
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,500
you're invited to it.

770
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,060
At that banquet,

771
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,820
I'll tell everyone

772
00:35:58,820 --> 00:35:59,740
in public

773
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,220
that I'll marry you.

774
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,940
I'll win at the banquet.

775
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,620
Your love

776
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,020
can only be me.

777
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,060
Jin,

778
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,660
why are you doing this?

779
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:49,340
Mingyue is a Commandery Princess.

780
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,940
She ends up as equal as the daughter

781
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,500
of a humble earl to marry you.

782
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:56,220
Do you know how much she's suffered?

783
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,180
I didn't have Mingyue

784
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,420
replace Jing Si

785
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:03,220
but let her stay for your sake.

786
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,500
Why can't you

787
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,140
marry Mingyue

788
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,620
for my sake in return?

789
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,300
When you put it that,

790
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,660
it was as if I begged Mingyue

791
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:14,580
to marry me.

792
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,820
Whether or not I'll marry,

793
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:17,740
who I'll marry,

794
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:18,940
that's my freedom.

795
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,940
Don't make decisions for me, Aunt.

796
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,820
Growing up in the wilderness

797
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,940
you've always been wild.

798
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,260
But I shall remind you

799
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:33,140
that in the imperial clan,

800
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,420
there's no such thing as freedom.

801
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,220
We check and balance each other

802
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,380
and follow orders.

803
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,540
Even my brother,

804
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,580
the Emperor, can't do as he wishes,

805
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:47,700
let alone you, his son.

806
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,740
That's the price you have to pay

807
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:52,060
to indulge in

808
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,420
a privileged life in Ling'an.

809
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,220
You altered the divination.

810
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,380
Who gave you that order?

811
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,500
What nonsense is that?

812
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,090
You had killed
Earl Dongping's wife with poison.

813
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,940
Then you tried to do the same to Jiang Si.

814
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,940
Whose order was that?

815
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,140
There's only one person

816
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,180
above you.

817
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,540
Did my father order you to do so?

818
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:25,380
Feel free to report me to him.

819
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,020
Let's see if he trusts you

820
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,660
or me.

821
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:33,340
The wages of sin is death.

822
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:34,980
That's your karma.

823
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,860
Even my father can't shield you.

824
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:41,980
Jin,

825
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,700
once you're married,

826
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,100
you and me

827
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,180
will be bound together for good or ill.

828
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:49,060
You're smart.

829
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,100
Do what's right.

830
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:04,940
It's raining.

831
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,500
Go back to wait for him, Miss.

832
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,620
I'll stay here.

833
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,500
If anything happens, I'll let you know.

834
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:11,820
He's kneeling in the Palace

835
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,540
while I can't do anything

836
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:17,540
but wait outside

837
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,340

848
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,420
annoyed His Majesty,

849
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,700
he's been punished.

850
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:14,740
His Majesty won't

851
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,780
stay mad at him tomorrow, right?

852
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,180
Mother,

853
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:20,820
it's not as easy as you think.

854
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:23,060
Breaking into the Palace alone

855
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:25,060
can cost him his life.

856
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:26,620
Not to mention,

857
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,660
he refused His Majesty's betrothal.

858
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:31,940
Seek help from the officials

859
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,260
who are still close to us.

860

861
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,540
a good word for him with His Majesty.

862
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,220
It's a highly sensitive matter.

863
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,100
They can't wait to avoid it.

864
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,660
Who'd help us?

865
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:43,420
Anmou, what do you think

866
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:45,500
we should do to help Prince Yan out?

867
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,740
Did he really

868
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:49,180
hit a dead end?

869
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:51,500
Mother,

870
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,740
it is now, indeed.

871
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:02,860
What to do...?

872
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:06,900
(Tiande Hall)

873
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:13,500
Your Highness, you've been kneeling here

874
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,180
for a day and a night without eating.

875
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,740
If you keep it up,

876
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,060
what if you collapse?

877
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,460
Take a step back.

878
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,780
The Grand Princess is

879
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,260
His Majesty's closest sibling,

880
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,580
and she guarded the state.

881
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,140
She begged His Majesty with her life.

882
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,060
That's why he betrothed

883
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:30,300
her daughter to you.

884
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:33,660
His Majesty had no choice.

885
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:35,820
Eunuch Liu,

886
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:38,340
say no more.

887
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:42,500

Have you heard anything?

892
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:16,020
Go home first.

893
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,100
He's still kneeling there.

894
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:19,900
He is?

895
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,140
So he's still alive.

896
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:23,700
