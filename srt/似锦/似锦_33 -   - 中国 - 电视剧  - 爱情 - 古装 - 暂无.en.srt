(Tiande Hall)

12
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,430
Everyone,

13
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,670
is there anything else to report?

14
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:46,870
Your Majesty,

15
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,950
I, Zhen Heng, have a matter to report.

16
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,560
Prince Yan...

17
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,790
Since there is nothing else,

18
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,280
let's dismiss the court.

19
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,990
The court is dismissed.

20
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:13,080
I take my leave.

21
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,040
Mr. Zhen.

22
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,510
You may leave.

23
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,200
I take my leave.

24
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,200
Your Majesty,

25
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,810
if he keeps kneeling like this,

26
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,360
how will he get married?

27
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,640
Even if I let him go,

28
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,110
he won't agree to it.

29
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,480
Doesn't he want to die?

30
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,110
Fine, let him be.

31
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,080
Let him kneel for a few more days.

32
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,510
Once the time comes,

33
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,430
send him straight to the wedding.

34
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:21,960
Jin, I understand

35
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,950
your thoughts,

36
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,980
but an imperial edict cannot be defied.

37
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,760
Miss, Miss Chuchu is here.

38
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,680
One is starving in the Palace;

39
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,830
the other is starving here.

40
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,440
Isn't that exactly

41
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:16,880
what Cui Mingyue wants?

42
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,640
Come on, eat something.

43
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:23,990
Chuchu,

44
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,890
is there truly no one in the Palace

45
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,120
who can help him?

46
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,760
What should I do?

47
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:33,910
What should I do?

48
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,380
(Grand Princess's Mansion)

49
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,240
Your Grace,

50
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,350
this is the wedding robe
from the Palace.

51
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,680
Is this for the Princess Consort?

52
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,040
Yes.

53
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,200
So, Jiang Si's attire
is the same as mine?

54
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,590
It should be.

55
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,100
How could she deserve to wear

56
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:04,330
(Dignified and Delicate)
the same wedding dress as me?

57
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,960
Mother,

58
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,390
at the blossom-viewing banquet,

59
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,000
Jiang Si already imitated my outfit.

60
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,920
On my wedding day,

61
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,640
I cannot suffer such humiliation.

62
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,630
Have the embroiderers

63
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,150
alter this wedding robe.

64
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,760
Use the jewels bestowed by His Majesty

65
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,030
to decorate it further.

66
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,160
Yes.

67
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,830
Mother, you are the best.

68
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,200
Are you happy now?

Miss,

71
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,590
Mr. Zhen said he'd inform us

72
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,080
as soon as there is news.

73
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,640
Let's go home and wait.

74
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,950

No.

100
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,560
I asked Mother

101
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,880
to plead with Father,

102
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,640
but he refused.

103
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,150
I already guessed as much.

104
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:34,040
In the blink of an eye,

105
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,830
Princess Mingyue is about to marry.

106
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,160
Two hairpins on one head?

107
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,870
Isn't that too much?

108
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,160
Then I'll wear just one.

109
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,680
Mother, don't worry.

110
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,550
Let Jiang Si

111
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,570
enjoy her moment for now.

112
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,150
After the wedding,

113
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,320
under the same roof,

114
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,680
I'll make sure to get rid of her.

115
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,080
Is Jiang Si

116
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,920
that easy to deal with?

117
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,870
Mother, you overestimate her.

118
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,160
Look.

119
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,040
Once Uncle's decree is issued,

120
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,680
won't she have to obey?

121
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,200
After the wedding,

122
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,550
I don't believe

123
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,440
that Yu Jin will protect her every day.

124
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,200
You are too naive.

125
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,430
Mr. Zhen.

126
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,080
Mr. Zhen.

127
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:25,790
Miss Jiang,

128
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,320
you look a bit weary.

129
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,580
Please take care of yourself.

130
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,940
Even I did not expect

131
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,580
that Prince Yan

132
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,420
would risk his life to defy the edict.

133
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,700
His devotion is unwavering.

134
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,740
Miss Jiang, your heart remains

135
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,740
with him even outside the Palace.

136
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,660
Through trials and hardships,

137
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,580
you stand by his side.

138
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,060
I truly admire you.

139
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:52,980
Miss Jiang,

140
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,540
even these towering walls

141
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,020
can't keep apart

142
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,660
your love for each other.

143
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:05,780
Take care.

144
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,820
Jin's condition is very bad.

145
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,940
I've tried many ways,

146
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,040
but I don't know
how to help him and Miss Jiang.

147
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,140
Mr. Zhen,

148
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,700
you are their close friend,

149
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,020
so you must understand them.

150
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,780
Do you have any way

151
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,780
to help them

152
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,140
meet each other?

153
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,180
Your Highness,

154
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,500
how about using a kite?

155
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,060
A kite?

156
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,660
Miss Jiang.

157
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,700
Ms. Hua.

158
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,500
The Empress has sent me to escort you

159
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,140
to the Imperial Garden for a stroll.

160
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:04,860
Alright.

161
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,780
Help Miss Jiang.

162
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,220
I'll stay here.

163
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,020
Your Highness.

164
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,660
Greetings, Your Highness.

165
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,780
Miss Jiang, you may not know

166
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,700
why I summoned you here.

167
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,940
Come here.

168
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:44,980
Though the Imperial Garden
is in the inner Palace,

169
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,500
it is just one wall away

170
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,340
from the Tiande Hall.

171
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,580
This is the closest you can get to him.

172
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,540
Thank you, Your Highness.

173
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,620
Jin,

174
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,340
you've been kneeling for three days.

175
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,160
Father hasn't relented in the slightest.

176
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,660
Are you going to keep kneeling?

177
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,380
Yes.

178
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,780
If you keep kneeling,

179
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,180
your body will collapse.

180
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:40,860
Have you forgotten

181
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,100
who you are?

182
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,540
If I can't even control my son,

183
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,580
how can I rule my country?

184
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:46,700
(Father,)

185
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,980
(I have never forgotten who I am.)

186
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,540
(I also understand)

187
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,700
(that as Emperor,)

188
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,060
(you cannot take back your edict.)

189
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,220
(But I only love Jiang Si.)

190
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,500
Jin,

191
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,980
do you miss Miss Jiang?

192
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:04,900
Of course.

Jin, look.

194
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:13,980
Look over there.

195
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,700
Miss Jiang is right there.

196
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,240

00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,740
Alright.

224
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:45,980
Thank you, Ma'am.

Thank you.

Father.

227

Mother,

228
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,220
is that Father?

229
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,420
Yan, you're mistaken.

230
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,220
That is not your father.

231
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:09,940
Let's go home.

233
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,500
Hold on tight, Yan.

234
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,420
Sure.

235
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,580
Mother,

236
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,180
was that man I just saw

237
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,060
my father?

238
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,100
No.

239
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,420
He's just a madman.

240
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,460
Thank you, Ma'am. Thank you.

241
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,580
Zhu Ziyu.

242
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,980
It's not me. You have the wrong man.

243
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,780
How did you end up like this?

244
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,060
Not long after our divorce,

245
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,860
my family was confiscated and exiled.

246
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,260
On the way, the Grand Princess

247
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,300
sent people to silence us.

248
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:46,180
83 people of my family

249
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,300
were slaughtered on the road.

250
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,620
I was the only one

251
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,060
who survived.

252
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:08,420
You should never have trusted
Cui Mingyue.

253
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,900
Day and night,

254
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,780
I have been tormented by guilt,
wishing for death.

255
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,780
But I know

256
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,220
I do not deserve release.

257
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,460
I must suffer through regret

258
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,740
to atone for my sins.

259
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,020
Those two have always been ruthless.

260
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,580
You were not their only victim.

261
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,220
My mother was also killed

262
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,820
by the Grand Princess.

263
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,980
And now they want to ruin Si's marriage.

264
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,460
Cui Mingyue destroyed your family,

265
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,220
and now she'll become Princess Yan.

266
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,660
They are so cruel and heartless.

267
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,380
Must we rely on heaven

268
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,420
to punish them?

269
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:05,980
Azhu.

270
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,460
Take this money.

271
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,460
I can't accept it.

272
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:14,700
Take it.

273
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,740
Buy yourself a meal,

274
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,060
and get some clean clothes.

275
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,940
Though we are divorced,

276
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:25,060
you are still Yan's father.

277
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,200
I won't stop you
from seeing your daughter.

278
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:30,940
I don't want Yan

279
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,220
to see her father

280
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,220
like this.

281
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,700

295

Jin has collapsed in front of the hall,

296
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,340
but Father has shown no mercy.

00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,460
are you alright?

301
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,340
It seems that Father

302
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,540
has made up his mind this time.

303
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,060
My eyes

304
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,060
were cured

305
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:42,980
because of you and Jin.

Jin always listens to you.

308
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,700
Perhaps now,

309
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,180
only you can save him.

310
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,220
I want you to be my wife

311
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,700
and be with you forever.

312
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,820
Everyone I care about

313
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,620
has died tragically.

314
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:07,940
I'm afraid you will too.

315
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:13,860
Aman,

316
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,980
do you think I am truly a jinx?

317
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,860
He could once ride freely

318
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,700
and live a carefree life,

319
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,900
but now, because of me,

320
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,540
he almost died in front of the hall.

321
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,100
I don't want to share my husband,

322
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,420
but how can my grievances

323
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,100
compare to his life?

324
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,200
I don't understand anything,

325
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,020
but I can tell

326
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,340
that Prince Yan

327
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,260
values your grievances

328
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,180
more than his life.

329
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,140
Of course, I know that.

330
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:47,900
So,

331
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,660
I can't let anything happen to him.

332
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,820
Your Highness,

333
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,540
could you please think of a way

334
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,420
to bring me to His Majesty?

335
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:03,780
It's bad.

336
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,380
It's bad, Your Majesty.

337
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,580
It's bad.

338
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,340
What's the rush? Speak.

339
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,620
The 7th Prince...

340
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:11,540
What's wrong with Jin?

341
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,460
The 7th Prince

342
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,740
has fainted.

343
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,260
Your Majesty,

344
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,460
please let someone

345
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,820
take Jin back to his room

346
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,860
to rest.

347
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,340
If he can't understand

348
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,260
my intention,

349
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,820
he'll certainly repeat the mistake.

350
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,700
If he makes an even greater mistake

351
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,420
that even I can't protect him,

352
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,620
what should he do then?

353
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:32,860
Report.

354
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,380
Your Majesty,

355
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,380
Miss Jiang Si requests an audience.

356
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,140
Summon her in.

358
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,060
Miss.

359
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,580
Miss.

360
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,540
What's wrong? Why so panic?

361
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,980
Have you packed up the things

362
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:19,900
for Si?

363
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,700
Miss, Zhu Ziyu is here.

364
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,180
Let him in.

365
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,500
Yes.

366
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,540
Yi.

367
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,260
Why are you here?

368
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,060
- Yu Jin, Yu Jin.
- Jin.

369
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,220
- Yu Jin, wake up.
- Jin.

370

Miss Jiang has already

375
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,100
agreed to the marriage.

376
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:33,940
Come on.

377
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:34,860
Come on, Fuqing.

378
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,300
I don't believe it.

379
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,540
Why would I lie to you?

380

Miss Jiang went
to meet with His Majesty.

381
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,740
She said she'd share her husband
with Princess Mingyue

382
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,920
and only wanted His Majesty

383
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,860
to forgive you for trespassing
into the Palace.

384
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:51,940
I refuse.

385
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,020
I refuse.

386
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,100
Yu Jin,

387
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,660
I know

388
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,220
you'd risk your life

389
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,860
for Miss Jiang,

390
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,980
but you've forgotten

391
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,660
you are ultimately a Prince.

392
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,820
Even if His Majesty is furious with you,

393
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,260
he doesn't truly want to kill you.

394
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,620
What about Miss Jiang?

395
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,660
If she

396
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,260
and her family

397
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,900
angered His Majesty over this,

398
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,780
the consequences would be unimaginable.

399
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:28,420
(Haitang Chamber)

400
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,240
(Now, the only way to break the deadlock)

401
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:47,060
(is with the evidence
in Zhu Ziyu's hands.)

402
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,540
(Everything depends on his actions today.)

403
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,180
(I hope things go as planned.)

404
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,420
Prince Yan, the time has come.

405
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,640
You should dress up now.

406
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:05,980
Your Highness?

407
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,020
(My daughter is 16 now.)

408
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,660
(You're pretty and graceful,)

409
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,420
(elegant and refined.)

410
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,060
(Today, you are getting married.)

411
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:07,260
(May your life be smooth and safe,)

412
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,820
(full of happiness.)

413
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,700
Mother,

414
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,620
I've always wanted to know

415
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,860
what it feels like to have a home.

416
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,340
Today,

417
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,100
I will finally have my home.

418
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,140
Once married,

419
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,940
you can no longer be headstrong.

420
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,740
I can't always

421
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,100
be by your side, guiding you.

422
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,900
Whatever you do,

423
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,420
you must think carefully.

424
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,460
Mother,

425
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,220
I am getting married today.

426
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,580
In the future,

427
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:27,060
I won't be able to serve you.

428
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:32,900
I hope you'll be safe and healthy,

429
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,700
and all things will go well.

430
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:09,060
(Wedding Joy)

431
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,540
(Double Happiness)

432
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,940
(Wedding Joy)

433
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:37,420
(Double Happiness)

434
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:09,780
Your Grace,

435
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,780
Prince Yan is waiting for you ahead.

436
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,020
We'll arrive soon.

437
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,980
Look, that's Prince Yan.

438
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,540
Prince Yan is so handsome.

439
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,900
And so young.

440
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,620
Princess Yan is truly fortunate.

441
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,820
Yes.

442
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,340
Your Highness.

443
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:23,060
I, Yu Jin, as the 7th Prince,

444
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,580
trespassed into the Palace,
which is unforgivable.

445
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,430
Your Highness...

446
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:28,380
Today, I voluntarily renounce

447
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,600
my position as the 7th Prince.

448
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,740
Eunuch Liu, please ask the Emperor

449
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,860
to strip me of my title.

450
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,860
Your Highness, you can't say that.

451
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,260
I have made up my mind.

452
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,560
It is because of my identity
as the 7th Prince

453
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:56,460
that I must do things against my will.

454
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:57,940
If this continues,

455
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,860
I will only hurt the one I love.

456
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,420
I don't want to give

457
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,380
this kind of love.

458
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,300
Your Highness!

459
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,720
Your Highness,

460
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,580
you can't just leave like this.

461
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:14,380
How should I explain it to the Emperor?

462
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,300
Yu Jin.

463
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:17,980
What do you take me for?

464
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,580
This marriage was granted

465
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,540
by the Emperor.

466
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,020
We're engaged.

467
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,500
It's us who're engaged.

468
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,100
Who is this?

469
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,740
Who is this man?

470
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:31,820
Yes.

471
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,460
How could he be engaged

472
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,460
to Princess Mingyue?

473
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,090
That's right.

474
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,740
What's going on?

475
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,340
He's engaged to Princess Mingyue?

476
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,060
Princess Mingyue.

477
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:53,100
Princess Mingyue and I are in love

478
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,540
and have long been secretly engaged.

479
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,200
Even if the Emperor has an edict,

480
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,040
he should not take another man's wife.

481
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:58,980
Who are you?

482
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,380
The Princess promised me

483
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,740
that if I divorced my wife,

484
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:03,940
she'd marry me.

485
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:05,900
If she breaks her word,

486
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,300
she deserves to be punished by cuts.

487
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,420
Is this true?

488
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,460
Absolutely true.

489
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,860
I have the Letter of Marriage

490
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,160
handwritten by Princess Mingyue.

491
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,180
How shameless.

492
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,660
- I'm a Commandery Princess.
- Hurry.

493
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:18,240
- How could we be engaged?
- Go report.

494
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,760
Don't think you can ruin my marriage

495
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,620
and destroy my future

496
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:21,580
with a few mad words.

497
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,180
Someone, take him away.

498
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,260
Kill him!

499
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,220
She wants to kill him?

500
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,660
Your Highness, this is what's happened.

501
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,860
Please save Princess Mingyue.

502
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:45,300
There's even a contract?

503
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,620
Why wasn't this reported to me?

504
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:49,780
It's my incompetence.

505
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:51,520
I didn't investigate thoroughly.

506
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:54,180
Jiang Si and Yu Jin

507
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,540
have put on such a good show

508
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,140
and deceived me.

509
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,500
How shameless.

510
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,060
I'm a Commandery Princess.

511
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,660
How could I be secretly engaged to you?

512
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,780
Someone,

513
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,220
get him out.

514
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,420
Kill him!

515
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,740
Kill him!

516
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,020
Stop it.

517
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,700
Where do you think this is?

518
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,220
This is the Tiande Hall.

519
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:35,980
Do you want to kill him

520
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,060
in front of me?

521
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,540
Uncle,

522
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:40,220
I've been humiliated and smeared

523
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,140
in the street.

524
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,140
You must stand up for me.

525
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,300
Have you forgotten our oath?

526
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,720
- Don't touch me.
- I am devoted to you.

527
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,980
I divorced my wife for you.

528
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,260
How could you treat me like this?

529
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:52,740
Uncle, I don't even know him.

530
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,540
It must be Jiang Si.

531
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,480
Jiang Si was dissatisfied
with your decree

532
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,380
and asked this man

533
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,260
to smear me in public

534
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,260
and ruin my reputation.

535
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:02,820
Zhu Ziyu,

536
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,160
do you know slandering

537
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,560
a Commandery Princess is a felony?

538
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,060
You're falsely accusing me.

539
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,380
According to the law,

540
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,980
he should be sliced slowly, right?

541
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,180
Zhu Ziyu,

542
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,700
let me ask you.

543
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,620
Do you have evidence?

544
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,180
Your Majesty,

545
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,740
I am not without evidence.

546
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:31,660
This contract was

547
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,460
personally written by Princess Mingyue.

548
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:35,940
I've already...

549
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,460
Mingyue,

550
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:49,300
did you write this contract?

551
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,300
No, I didn't write it.

552
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,500
How could I write

553
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,460
such a contract?

554
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,540
It wasn't me.

555
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,620
Your Grace,

556
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,260
sorry for disappointing you.

557
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,580
The contract you burned

558
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:00,860
was fake.

559
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,900
How could I let you burn the real one?

560
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,300
Every word, every sentence,

561
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,860
is filled with your deep affection
for me.

562
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,100
I'll treasure it for a lifetime.

563
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,140
Is this contract true or not?

564
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,060
It's not true.

565
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,380
He's lying.

566
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,540
I didn't write it.

567
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:25,060
I didn't write it.

568
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,180
He's lying, Uncle.

569
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,140
Your Majesty,

570
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:29,260
it's not difficult
to determine the authenticity

571
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,180
of the contract.

572
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,100
We just need Princess Mingyue

573
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,260
to write a new one,

574
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:36,140
and I will compare them.

575
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,500
Alright.

576
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:47,860
My name is Cui Mingyue,
with a courtesy name Yazhi,

577
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,380
eldest daughter
of Grand Princess Rongyang.

578
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,820
I was born three quarters
after the Chou hour

579
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,440
on the 18th day of of the 5th month,
8th year of Jingming.

580
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,300
I'm in love with Zhu Ziyu,
Gentleman-Confucian.

581
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,940
However, he is already married.

582
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,940
I should have cut off my feelings,

583
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,820
but Zhu claims his wife, Jiang,

584
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:09,820
has met one
of the Seven Criteria for Divorce,

585
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:13,300
and he intends to divorce her
and remarry.

586
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:16,140
So, I set this down in writing

587
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,420
that the day Zhu divorces his wife

588
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:22,060
will be the day I marry him.

589
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:24,980
(will be the day I marry him)

590
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:39,780
(Contract)

591
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:46,580
Your Majesty, please take a look.

592
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,100
Rongyang,

593
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:51,580
take a look.

594
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:54,060
Is the handwriting the same?

595
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:57,140
(Signed by Cui Mingyue,
Grand Princess Rongyang's daughter)

596
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:06,740
The handwriting

597
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,260
does seem similar.

598
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,540
Your Majesty,

599
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:12,660
after my examination,

600
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,700
the handwriting is identical.

601
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:17,420
They were written by the same person.

602
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,340
(Contract)

603
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,260
Your Majesty,

604
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:23,040
there are many people in the world

605
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,480
who can imitate others' handwriting

606
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,600
and pass off fakes as real.

607
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,060
If this contract were genuine,

608
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:29,260
why did Zhu Ziyu wait until now

609
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,780
to stop the ceremony in public?

610
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:33,660
You should ask him

611
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:36,620
who is behind all of this.

612
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,140
Your Majesty,

613
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:42,700
I didn't deliberately wait until today.

614
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:45,060
My father was the Household Manager
of Lingshui,

615
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:47,560
but he was falsely accused
of accepting bribes.

616
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,740
My entire family was exiled.

617
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,340
On the way into exile,

618
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,580
we were attacked by bandits.

619
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,060
Of the 83 people in our family,

620
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:59,380
I was the only one who survived.

621
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:00,620
What does that

622
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,980
have to do with the current situation?

623
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,380
After escaping death,

624
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,420
I was despairing,

625
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,220
only wanting to follow my family.

626
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,380
It was Princess Mingyue's promise

627
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,620
that gave me the hope to keep living.

628
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,080
I traveled a long way to Ling'an,

629
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,260
only to find that Princess Mingyue
was about to marry.

630
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,540
- I was...
- Nonsense!

631
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,560
Your family's disaster happened
over a month ago.

632
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,500
Why did you wait until now
to arrive in Ling'an?

633
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,340
Stopping a Prince's wedding alone

634
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,060
is enough to sentence you to death.

635
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,260
Rongyang,

636
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:28,420
how do you know

637
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,140
that it happened over a month ago?

638
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,020
Your Majesty,

639
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,460
I only found out

640
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:44,020
right before entering the Palace.

641
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:48,940
Zhen Heng,

642
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:49,950
how do you think

643
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,380
this case should be handled?

644
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:52,740
Your Majesty,

645
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,380
this contract is genuine.

646
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,020
According to the law,

647
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,020
Princess Mingyue

648
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:00,060
should honor her agreement

649
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,060
and marry Mr. Zhu.

650
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,820
I don't want to, Uncle.

651
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,660
I have deep feelings
for Princess Mingyue.

652
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,040
Your Majesty, please grant my wish.

653
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,020
Uncle.

654
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,300
Mother, I won't marry him.

655
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:12,980
Rongyang, look.

656
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,500
As the Emperor,

657
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,540
I cannot go against the law.

658
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,660
Moreover, keeping one's word

659
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:21,340
is the imperial way.

660
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,300
Since it is genuine,

661
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,900
Mingyue must keep her promise

662
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,580
and marry Zhu Ziyu.

663
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,260
No, Mother.

664
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,420
I don't want to.

665
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,420
I don't want to marry Zhu Ziyu.

666
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,300
I want to marry Yu Jin.

667
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,220
Shut up.

668
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:39,260
If I'd known you'd been secretly engaged
to another man,

669
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,140
how could I have shamelessly asked

670
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:42,540
the Emperor for a marriage edict?

671
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,680
The sins you've brought upon yourself

672
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:46,100
are yours to bear.

673
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:49,700
The country has its laws;
the family has its rules.

674
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:51,580
Baoping,

675
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,420
I just remembered

676
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,900
the auspicious time has been set.

677
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:58,100
Can they still marry today?

678
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,300
Your Majesty,

679
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:00,900
the auspicious time is near.

680
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,860
It'd be perfect to start
the wedding ceremony now.

681
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:04,780
Alright.

682
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,980
Bring them both here.

683
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:08,660
Today, I will witness it myself.

684
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:10,220
Let these two couples

685
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,880
have their wedding ceremony
in the Palace.

686
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:12,980
Mother...

687
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:15,340
Mother, please beg Uncle.

688
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:17,420
Uncle, I beg you.

689
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:19,860
I don't want to marry Zhu Ziyu.

690
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:20,780
Uncle.

691
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:23,020
- Mother, speak.
- Congratulations, Your Highness.

692
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:24,380
Your Highness,

693
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:26,500
His Majesty has approved your marriage.

694
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:27,540
Go in now.

695
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:28,700
I won't go in.

696
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:31,180
I'm content with standing here

697
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,020
listening to that.

698
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:32,940
Let's go.

699
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:46,180
(Grand Princess's Mansion)

700
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:47,100
Your Grace,

701
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:48,660
go apologize

702
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:49,780
to the Grand Princess.

703
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,260
Mother,

704
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:54,020
I'm sorry.

705
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:57,120
I shouldn't have hidden
the contract from you,

706
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:59,220
but I really have burned it.

707
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:00,780
What use is there in saying this now?

708
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:04,540
