11
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,850
Years ago, a fortune-teller

12
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,370
once declared me ill-fated,

13
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,290
destined to bring calamity upon my family.

14
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,400
Fearing implication and loss of favor,

15
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,210
she devised a scheme

16
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,680
to convince my father

17
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,240
to send me away,

18
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:56,370
just like that.

19
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:57,950
(In the past,)

20
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,490
(he seldom spoke of his past.)

21
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,920
(All I knew was his kin's disdain)

22
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,240
(that exiled him to guard the borders.)

23
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,290
(I never imagined)

24
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,400
(he shared a fate similar to mine,)

25
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:07,570
(branded an ill omen)

26
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,240
(from our birth.)

27
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,560
But what if that fortune-teller

28
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,770
was a fraud,

29
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,400
spouting doom just to

30
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,400
seek fame and fortune?

31
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,960
So what if he's a fraud?

32
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,160
There's no point

33
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,280
in digging deeper now.

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,090
Ultimately,

35
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,800
the decision

36
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,840
lies with our parents.

37
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:29,890
You think it's pointless,

38
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,050
but I think

39
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,680
it is necessary.

40
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,250
If the vulnerable

41
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,050
are saddled

42
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,090
with all sorts of false charges

43
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,240
by people in the world

44
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,600
without question

45
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,720
or resistance,

46
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,090
doesn't that

47
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:42,330
validate the wicked's lies

48
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,050
and make themselves accomplices?

49
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,650
If you were

50
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,620
falsely accused,

51
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,900
would you seek justice?

52
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,940
If it were me,

53
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,940
I would make

54
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:02,580
the accuser pay.

55
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,020
Mr. Yu,

56
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,620
after all these years,

57
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,340
don't you want to know the truth?

58
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,500
One Capital Security Office,

59
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,140
two people giving me a headache.

60
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,620
But who reported the buried bodies

61
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,460
at the Marquis's Mansion?

62
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,620
It was the fourth daughter

63
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,460
of Earl Dongping's household,

64
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,740
Jiang Si.

65
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,180
Cao Xingyu

66
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,460
is her second sister's husband.

67
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,000
That day,

68
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,300
the second daughter of the Jiang Family

69
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,740
invited her sisters to

70
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,740
the Marquis's Mansion.

71
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,220
Late that night, Jiang Si, sleepless,

72
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,660
went to the garden

73
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,340
and stumbled upon servants burying a body.

74
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:42,940
She reported it

75
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,940
to the Capital Security.

76
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,020
But later,

77
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,900
Cao Xingyu, the villain, struck first,

78
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,460
accusing his wife

79
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,060
of ordering the killing.

80
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:51,900
Jiang Si

81
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,180
then came forward to testify.

82
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,620
Jiang Si

83
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,180
is no ordinary soul,

84
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,140
daring to cross Marquis Changxing.

85
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,620
Each bolder than the last,

86
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,620
none of them are ordinary.

87
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,220
Thank...

88
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,660
Thank you, Your Majesty.

89
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,660
(Grand Princess's Mansion)

90
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,500
Your Highness,

91
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,300
the Speed Guards

92
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,420
have mentioned Cao Xingyu

93
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,060
for collaborating with Nanwu.

94
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:19,940
Luckily,

95
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,420
His Majesty didn't bring it up this time.

96
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,620
So

97
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,300
I guess it's over.

98
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,060
My brother's mind

99
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,780
is a labyrinth of thoughts.

100
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,060
He keeps everything bottled up,

101
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,660
which will only lead to disaster.

102
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,020
Your Majesty,

103
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,300
I have seized all documents

104
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,460
related to the Surreal Wander

105
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,340
(Two bottles of Surreal Wander)
and Nanwu

106
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,420
from Marquis Changxing's Mansion.

107
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:49,860
Put them away.

108
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:51,980
Don't mention it again.

109
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,220
Your Majesty, knowing well something's wrong,

110
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,100
you set it aside for now.

111
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,540
What is your intention behind this?

112
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,980
Nanwu spies seep through every crack,

113
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,220
their infiltration so deep

114
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,420
it chills the bone.

115
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,100
They'll inevitably scheme

116
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,860
to ensnare the pillars of our court.

117
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,220
We have to be on our guard.

118
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,460
The Crown Prince is here!

119
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,300
Your son kneels in contrition, Father.

120
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,420
Prince Qi is here!

121
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,660
Your son kneels in contrition, Father.

122
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,540
The 1st and 3rd Princes are here!

123
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,740
The 5th Prince is here!

124
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,100
The 6th and 8th Princes are here!

125
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,860
Your sons kneel in contrition, Father.

126
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,660
Why did you come so late

127
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,900
to kneel in contrition?

128
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,180
(Yu Lang, Crown Prince)
Father, though I had

129
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,300
a few encounters with Marquis Changxing's,

130
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,300
no, Cao Xingyu, the criminal,

131
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,460
our acquaintance was merely superficial.

132
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,900
I truly had no knowledge

133
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,660
of his murderous deeds.

134
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,780
Father, Marquis Changxing has been

135
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,540
(Yu Zhang, Prince Qi)
at odds with me,

136
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,660
but Ling'an hasn't witnessed

137
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,980
such a heinous murder in decades.

138
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,980
Your personal trial of Cao Xingyu

139
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,660
has been universally praised by the people.

140
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,420
Father is wise.

141
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,900
Father is wise.

142
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,420
Turns out you're all here

143
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,060
for Cao Xingyu's case.

144
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,180
All right, all rise.

145
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,540
Thank you, Father.

146
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,300
Since you're all here,

147
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,860
I'd like to ask you

148
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,780
if you think

149
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,500
I'm usually

150
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,900
too strict with you.

151
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:52,780
Yu Lang, you tell me.

152
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,620
Father,

153
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,980
your strictness towards me

154
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,300
is for my own good

155
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,780
and to secure the realm's future.

156
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,540
So you think I'm strict?

157
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,100
No, no.

158
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,420
No, you're not.

159
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,300
You're so scared.

160
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,340
Yu Zhang, you tell me.

161
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,020
Father,

162
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,980
as princes

163
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:15,980
supported by the people,

164
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,540
we must be strict with ourselves.

165
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,340
All right. Stop.

166
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,740
You're not answering the question.

167
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,420
I have eight sons and six daughters.

168
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,220
With busy government affairs,

169
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,660
I don't have much energy

170
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,780
to teach most of you.

171
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:34,900
Of course,

172
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,980
Yu Lang is the crown prince.

173
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,340
I'm naturally more strict with him.

174
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,500
If you have

175
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,740
anything to say,

176
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,740
speak freely tonight.

177
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,980
Don't hold it back.

178
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,740
People holding their feelings in for too long

179
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,780
will inevitably lose their rationality

180
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,460
and come up with devious ways

181
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,980
to relieve their emotions.

182
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,340
Do you understand?

183
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,660
We will follow your instructions.

184
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,220
Still, there is one missing.

185
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,020
Your Majesty,

186
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,540
it's windy today.

187
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,900
(Tiande Hall)
Please return to your chamber.

188
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,780
Your Majesty, in your wisdom,

189
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,500
know that Zhang and I are innocent.

190
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,260
Do not penalize us

191
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,500
because of Qi.

192
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,300
The ministers say

193
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,660
he brought disaster to Dazhou.

194
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,820
Then send him away,

195
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,300
(Consort Xian, Yu Qi's birth mother)
away from

196
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,300
the Imperial City and Dazhou.

197
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,420
Qi is the child you carried for ten months.

198
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,300
Can you bear to part with him?

199
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,780
Even if I can't, what can I do?

200
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,780
He was fated

201
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,300
with ill omen from his first breath.

202
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,500
Qi was sent to the South

203
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,540
in swaddling clothes.

204
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,020
Left on the war-torn frontiers

205
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,540
to grow up alone without his parents,

206
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,580
who knows what he's become.

207
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,020
The boy is wayward.

208
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,060
Every time Cui Xu went on an inspection tour,

209
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,300
I sent him to check on him,

210
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,660
but he always avoided meeting him.

211
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,420
He must hold a grudge against me.

212
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,620
Your Majesty,

213
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,020
if you miss the 7th Prince,

214
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,420
why not summon him back to Ling'an?

215
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,380
The Nanwu uprising

216
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,780
that began with his birth

217
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,060
has yet to be quelled.

218
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,660
With the Nightingale Division's shadow

219
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,900
creeping across Dazhou these past years,

220
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,060
his return will make him

221
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,540
the target of public criticism again.

222
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,140
However, Your Majesty,

223
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,660
the 7th Prince

224
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,540
has inherited your valor in battle,

225
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,820
leading the Chiyu Cavalry

226
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,300
to countless victories.

227
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,940
Does this not prove

228
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,060
he is no foe

229
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,660
to the country?

230
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,300
It's not time yet.

231
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:28,020
I need to think about it.

232
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:36,620
Chief.

233
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,180
What are you looking at?

234
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,540
Go investigate the Directorate of Astronomy.

235
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,140
Haven't you

236
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,580
been reluctant to look into

237
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,540
what happened back then?

238
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,700
I've changed my mind.

239
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,020
I want to know

240
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,820
who framed me.

241
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,620
Miss Chi,

242
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,380
this is the busiest street in town.

243
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,260
Yes.

244
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,660
Look at this shop, Miss Jiang.

245
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,060
It's been in business for years.

246
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,060
It's very famous.

247
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,540
A snack spot up ahead is famous too.

248
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,140
Miss Chi, how's the location

249
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,060
of this shop?

250
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,780
(Qiaoxiang Shop)
With so many shops around,

251
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:26,740
opening a shop here

252
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,020
ensures a steady stream of customers.

253
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,820
I think so too.

254
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,780
Once I get the shop up and running,

255
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,540
(Qiaoxiang Shop)
I'll need all hands on deck.

256
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,620
Miss Chi,

257
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,780
I find you smart and resourceful.

258
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,940
Would you consider joining me?

259
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,380
Miss Jiang,

260
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,060
you've already saved me from dire straits.

261
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,060
I don't know

262
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,180
how to repay you.

263
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,700
Now you extend another generous offer,

264
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,180
but I can't be in your debt.

265
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,500
What are your plans then?

266
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,140
I plan to return home

267
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,300
and start a school in the countryside

268
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,460
to teach girls who cannot afford education

269
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,540
literacy and reason.

270
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,060
I'll teach them not to be

271
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,420
as muddle-headed as I used to be.

272
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,780
I hope they will be like you,

273
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,380
who aspire to hearts holding vast horizons

274
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,940
and eyes perceiving greater justice.

275
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:08,780
I'm flattered.

276
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,540
Miss Chi,

Every day

279
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,780
will be a new beginning.

280
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,020

that you want to buy a shop.

How can you just pawn them off?

317
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,020
I'll find a way to buy the shop.

318
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,180
What can an unmarried girl like you

319
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,060
possibly do?

320
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,420
Father, here's my plan.

321
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,540
I will

322
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,580
rent the shop first.

323
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,900
It won't cost much.

324
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,460
Then I'll use

325
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,780
some of my dowry Mother left me,

326
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:19,700
and that should be enough.

00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,580
Once the business picks up,

328
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,900
I'll buy the shop.

329
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,060
No renting. Buy it directly.

331
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,940
shouldn't her father

332
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,300
buy her a shop?

cared for them in years.

344
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,540
and then threw them in the study

once home,

351
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,380

If he breaks anything,

360
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,380
we won't get a good price.

362
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,380
are you really that sure

363
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,580
I can run this shop well?

364
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,140
Of course.

By the way, Si,

380
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,900
you mustn't let your grandma

381
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,940
find out about your business venture.

382

Like most Ling'an folk,

383
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,180
she looks down

384
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,420
on merchants,

385
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,900
and would never allow the Earl's

386
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,900
legitimate daughter to engage in trade.

387
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:08,900
Understood?

388
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,500
I understand.

389
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,100
Father,

390
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,900
see how effective

391
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,180
this Yunxiang Herb is.

392
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,380
The books

393
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,420
show no insect damage

394
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,580
after a full year,

395
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,420
still perfectly intact.

396
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,500
My daughter knows so much.

397
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,300
By the way, Father,

398
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,580
I've rarely heard you mention

399
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,020
the Directorate of Astronomy.

400
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,780
And you seldom associate

401
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,300
with your former colleagues either.

402
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,060
Since your mother's passing,

403
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,260
I've lost the heart for official duties,

404
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,380
so I resigned from my post.

405
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,300
I've always thought

406
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,900
reading the night skies

407
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,180
is mysterious,

408
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,300
predicting weather

409
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,820
and divining fortunes.

410
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,540
While celestial study

411
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,300
holds endless wonders,

412
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,060
the Directorate of Astronomy

413
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,700
is not just about astronomy and geography.

414
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,500
There are more

415
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,780
social climbers

416
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,540
and forced compromises.

417
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,580
Father,

418
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,220
do you recall those copybooks

419
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,540
you kept drilling me on as a child?

420
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:22,700
Look,

421
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,620
this one slipped through the cracks.

422
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,860
I vividly recall these copybooks.

423
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,380
Back then,

424
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,980
every time I bought one,

425
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,740
it would go missing.

426
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,220
It was strange.

427
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,860
I threw them all away secretly.

428
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,220
I threw a lot away for you.

429
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,460
No wonder your handwriting

430
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,100
is pure chicken scratch.

431
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,460
This isn't for sale.

432
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,540
Drill those strokes.

433
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,260
No, I'll sell this one first.

434
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,420
Ji, hurry up.

435
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,020
- Sell this copybook first!
- Stop there!

436
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,100
You can't sell it.

437
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,020
If you sell it,

438
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,100
you'll face month-long house arrest.

439
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:51,940
Don't sell it!

440
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,060
Stop right there!

441
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,020
(Fragrance Shop)

442
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:00,860
Miss,

443
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:01,980
no one is willing

444
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,600
(Fragrance Shop)
to come and help in our shop.

445
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,100
Ling'an women all balk

446
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,780
at being called businesswomen.

447
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,980
The opening day is looming,

448
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,500
but we're still short of staff.

449
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,740
What should we do?

450
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:13,980
Miss Chuchu!

451
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,540
Chuchu.

452
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,620
Jiang Zhan told me

453
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,460
you're hiring,

454
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,660
so I brought a candidate.

455
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,860
(Rou'er)
Miss Jiang, how do you do?

456
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,260
Miss Jiang, congratulations

457
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,180
on your new shop's opening.

458
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,260
How do you do?

459
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:25,740
Chuchu,

460
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,540
you've truly saved me in my hour of need.

461
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,620
Rest assured, Rou'er is definitely reliable.

462
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,180
She's from my hometown,

463
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,020
once a rouge shop owner herself.

464
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,140
Chief, after cracking the case

465
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,500
with His Majesty's backing,

466
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,300
sycophants are eager to curry favor with us.

467
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,620
Mr. Zhao from the Grand Council...

468
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,460
No. I'm busy.

469
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:43,530
Yes.

470
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:44,430
Mr. Yu.

471
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,660
- Mr. Jiang.
- What a coincidence.

472
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,540
- Are you rich?
- Come on.

473
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,700
You bought so much stuff.

474
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,480
My sister's fragrance shop

475
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,420
opens the day after tomorrow.

476
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,480
I bought her some opening gifts.

477
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,540
Fragrance shop?

478
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,460
Perfect timing.

479
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,700
I was going to deliver your invitation.

480
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,660
Be sure to come support the opening.

481
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,660
I'm sorry, but he isn't available that day.

482
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,500
I am.

483
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,740
I'll adjust my schedule.

484
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,580
I'll come, definitely.

485
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,500
That's good.

486
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,860
Fragrance Shop?

487
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,300
Good name.

488
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,660
Long Dan!

489
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,580
Long Dan!

490
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,180
What's up, sir?

491
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,420
Where did you put it?

492
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:28,700
Where did I put what?

493
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,100
Where did you put the thing

494
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,060
I asked you to get?

495
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,420
You didn't ask me to get anything.

496
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,060
Where's my bronze mirror?

497
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,300
Where did you put it?

498
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,780
We don't have a bronze mirror.

499
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,580
Go borrow one from the neighbor.

500
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,020
- Go, go, go!
- I have to...

501
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:07,780
Chief. Chief.

502
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,940
Mirror, mirror.

503
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,180
The mirror is here.

504
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,780
- Take it easy.
- Here.

505
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,980
Chief, you're dressed like this

506
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,020
to meet Miss Jiang?

507
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:28,740
What do you think?

508
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,420
With such...

509
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,020
With such striking poise,

510
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,100
you're sure

511
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,260
to impress her.

512
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,260
Haven't I always been like this?

513
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,140
Sure, sure.

514
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,020
Ring the gong, prosper the business.

515
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,220
Grand opening,

516
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,540
great fortune.

517
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:54,580
Mirror the heart for clarity.

518
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,570
Act with integrity, discipline strictly.

519
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,140
Subtle scents through seasons;

520
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,700
fragrant trails on every journey.

521
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,860
Gourds displayed,

522
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,020
fortune conveyed.

523
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,660
New business, thriving fortunes.

524
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,260
Look how handsome

525
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,140
those gentlemen are.

526
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,460
Mr. Yu, not bad.

527
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:20,060
You look dashing today.

528
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,940
- Mr. Zhen, thank you for coming.
- Jiang...

529
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:24,780
Thank you.

530
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,900
Mr. Zhen, don't you always advocate

531
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,100
unwavering duty

532
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,220
and attendance on official leave?

533
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,020
Yes.

534
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,300
But Miss Jiang

535
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,660
personally delivered the invitation

536
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,980
to my door yesterday.

537
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,940
With such an honor,

538
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,180
you know I can't possibly decline.

539
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,220
Thanks a lot.

540
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,500
Really?

541
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,140
Why?

542
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,780
Didn't you receive

543
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,980
Miss Jiang's invitation?

544
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,500
Of course I did.

545
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,940
That's why I'm here.

546
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,260
Before she had the chance to deliver it,

547
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,540
we happened to meet on the road,

548
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,860
so it saved her the trouble

549
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,020
of making a trip.

550
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:01,700
I see.

551
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,980
What a coincidence.

552
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,460
Chief, didn't you say Jiang Zhan...

553
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,720
Miss Jiang, prepare for the unveiling.

554
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,140
(Fragrance Shop)

555
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,420
Great!

556
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,260
- Great!
- Bravo!

557
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:24,060
Share fragrance, gather blessings.

558
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,940
Perfect!

559
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,860
Here, one for each.

560
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,300
- It's all inside.
- Take a look inside.

561
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,500
Come in and take a look.

562
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,180
Thanks for coming and supporting us.

563
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,340
Come on inside.

564
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,180
Have a look inside.

565
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,580
- Come on.
- One for each.

566
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,740
Is this yours?

567
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,340
- Thanks.
- Thanks a lot.

568
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,540
Have a look inside, guys.

569
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,700
Come on.

570
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,300
- Si.
- Have a look inside.

571
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,580
- Si.
- Come on in.

572
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,670
Good luck with your business.

573
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:47,940
(Wealth from all directions)
Come on in.

574
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,460
Thanks, Zhan.

575
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,700
Miss Jiang.

576
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,220
Congratulations on your opening.

577
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,500
(Auspicious opening, customers surge)

578
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,180
Thanks, Mr. Zhen.

579
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,420
Miss Jiang!

580
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,500
May your business thrive and prosper.

581
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,060
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

582
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,020
Today, our opening

583
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,460
is honored by your presence.

584
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,260
We specially prepared 100 red vouchers

585
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,980
to grant you half-price access.

586
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,500
Anyone who spends 20 taels or more

587
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,540
gets a Duck Incense Burner.

588
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,660
Come on in, please.

589
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,020
- That's great.
- Come on.

590
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:27,020
Jiang Si, this is my congratulatory gift.

591
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:30,100
Chuchu, you've helped me a lot today

592
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,260
and even got me a gift.

593
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,580
I carved this myself.

594
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,180
It's a talisman, proven powerful.

595
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,620
What a cute little horse!

596
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,060
Little horse!

597
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,700
- Jiang Zhan!
- Did you make this?

598
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,350
Who knew you had

599
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,610
such a hidden skill?

600
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:42,740
Give it back. It's for Jiang Si.

601
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,820
My sister is busy.

602
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,900
Why don't I keep it for her?

603
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:45,740
Give it back.

604
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,020
Miss, you're amazing.

605
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,380
Just the scents of monthly perfumes

606
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,060
are enough to pique everyone's curiosity.

607
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,540
This is just the beginning.

608
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,180
When we debut limited-edition perfumes

609
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,300
one after another,

610
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,260
the real game begins.

611
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,580
Ji, Long Dan, come and help!

612
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,460
Coming.

613
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,660
Everyone.

614
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,700
Aman, take it easy.

615
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,100
Miss Jiang, you have affection and faith,

616
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,220
courage and wit.

617
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,620
Independently,

618
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,060
you've opened such a big fragrance shop.

619
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,700
I truly admire you.

620
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,340
I'm flattered, Mr. Zhen.

621
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,180
Miss Jiang,

622
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,980
would you please introduce

623
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,220
these perfumes?

624
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:19,100
These are gentlemen's perfumes.

625
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,100
For gentlemen's perfumes,

626
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,100
I substituted florals

627
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,020
with mint, cedar,

628
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,500
ebony, and eaglewood,

629
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,860
essences long cherished

630
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,900
by refined scholars,

631
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,380
most befitting your eminences.

632
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:29,860
Remarkable,

633
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,500
truly remarkable!

634
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,700
Miss Jiang is ingenious

635
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,420
to come up with such a brilliant idea.

636
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,340
Allow me

637
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,460
to introduce the perfumes.

638
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,740
This one is called Autumn Grove,

639
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,660
crafted with citrus, ebony,

640
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,820
amber, and other spices.

641
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,460
Its rich and generous aroma

642
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:50,300
mirrors modest scholars' unbound spirit,

643
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,500
particularly befitting Mr. Yu.

644
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,500
Mr. Yu,

645
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,420
this bottle of perfume is for you.

646
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,140
Thank you, Miss.

647
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,860
As a mere martial artist,

648
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,260
I don't do perfumes.

649
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,140
Don't waste it.

650
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,540
Then allow me to present another one.

651
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:03,940
This one is crafted

652
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,540
with ebony, eaglewood,

653
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:08,380
(Scrolls Slumber)
bergamot, and angelica.

654
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,980
Its calming fragrance

655
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,420
crystallizes the mind.

656
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,300
It's called Scrolls Slumber.

657
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,340
Mr. Zhen,

658
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,980
this one suits you very well.

659
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,220
Please accept it.

660
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,060
Thank you, Miss Jiang.

661
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,300
Scrolls Slumber.

662
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,980
What a good name.

663
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,420
Looks like

664
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,700
you know me well.

665
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,460
Let me see.

666
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,700
It's a good name, indeed.

667
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,260
I never had the habit of using perfume,

668
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,020
but your words convinced me.

669
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,780
(Autumn Grove)
I might as well try both.

670
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,420
Perfect.

671
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,580
Unbelievable.

672
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,660
Miss,

673
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,860
the perfumes over there are sold out.

674
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:47,940
I need to get some more.

675
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,300
All sold out?

676
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,740
Ok, go get more.

677
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,580
Yes.

678
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:55,420
Take a whiff.

679
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,380
Do you feel

680
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,620
the gallop across endless grasslands,

681
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,180
wind roaring

682
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,620
past your ears?

683
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,620
So many perfumes.

684
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,980
Can you remember all their names?

685
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,660
This is Wanderer's Odyssey.

686
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,740
Unfettered grace and swift reckonings.

687
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,220
That sounds perfect for me.

688
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,180
I think this one suits you better.

689
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,020
What's this?

690
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,660
Warm Sun.

691
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,260
It suits you.

692
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:28,900
I am

693
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,460
the warm sun?

694
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:37,460
(Haitang Chamber)

695
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,780
Si.

696
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,140
Si.

697
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,260
Father,

698
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,620
you're here.

699
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,740
First day of business.

700
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:50,700
Tired?

701
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,460
Looks like you're doing well.

702
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,460
Your grin is splitting your face.

703
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:00,500
Father, you're making fun of me again.

704
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:02,620
Look what I brought you.

705
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:04,700
What?

706
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:09,980
Milk Cakes!

707
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:11,940
There's more.

708
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,500
Spring tea.

709
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,740
Father knows me best.

710
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,220
Spring tea paired with Milk Cakes,

711
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,900
- ultimate treat of Ling'an.
- Ultimate treat of Ling'an.

712
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,140
Tasty.

713
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,900
Si,

714
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,780
I didn't give you enough care.

715
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,820
Now you have to

716
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,060
hold up this family alone.

717
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,740
It's too much for you.

718
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,340
Father, now I'm doing

719
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,740
all the things I like.

720
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:40,780
I'm happy.

721
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:41,980
I know.

722
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,540
My daughter is the most capable.

723
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,380
That's right.

724
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:47,940
By the way,

725
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,100
I was going to tell you

726
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,380
a few words,

727
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,860
but seeing that you were busy,

728
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,620
I never got the chance to say them.

729
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,220
What is it, Father?

730
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,460
What do you think

731
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,180
about your second sister?

732
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,940
She has been ill-fated in love.

733
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,140
Luck hasn't been on her side.

734
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,020
We can't control

735
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,220
our luck,

736
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,100
but when

737
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,780
misfortune strikes,

738
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:21,380
we can still choose wisely.

739
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,140
If your future husband treats you badly,

740
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,900
never mind whatever the impact

741
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,780
it may have on your in-laws or us,

742
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,020
come home at once.

743
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,220
Yes, Father.

744
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,220
But I don't want to

745
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,700
get married yet.

746
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,460
Don't marry unless you're ready.

747
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,700
I'm not pushing you.

748
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,780
Life is too long

749
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:48,300
for a half-hearted union.

750
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,100
You know,

751
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:53,580
finding someone who truly stirs your soul

752
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,940
is rare magic.

753
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,300
I want my daughter

754
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,740
to meet such a man.

755
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,180
Of course,

756
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,340
he must feel the same

757
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,620
for my daughter.

758
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,980
Otherwise, I won't give my consent.

759
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:11,020
Your daughter asks for nothing more.

760
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,980
There is

761
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,300
no greater happiness

762
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,020
than living a peaceful life

763
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,500
with my father and brother.

764
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:22,100
Having the whole family together

765
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,460
is better than anything else.

766
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,900
These are your favorites.

767
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,740
Sit down.

768
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,220
Thank you, Mother.

769
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,220
You're the best cook.

770
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,740
(Mrs. Zhen)

771
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,580
Heng,

772
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:36,940
you keep

773
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,500
skipping meals.

774
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,020
I think you've

775
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,300
lost weight again lately.

776
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,940
The caseload has been crushing lately.

777
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,420
Once I'm done with it,

778
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,620
everything will be fine.

779
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,980
I mean it's about time

780
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,420
you get a wife

781
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,740
to remind you to eat regularly.

782
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,580
Don't bother.

783
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,060
Look at my days,

784
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,980
swamped with official duties.

785
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:56,940
My time has

786
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:57,780
stretched thin already.

787
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,100
Register of Brides-to-Be.

788
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:06,940
I realize that your ability

789
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,260
to gather information

790
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,220
is almost as good as ours.

791
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,540
You know what,

792
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,220
I paid a lot of money for this

793
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,940
at the Matchmaker's Hall.

794
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,540
Since you paid so much money,

795
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:17,940
I will

796
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,580
read it carefully later.

797
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,340
I don't believe you.

798
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,300
Read it now.

799
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,220
Whichever girl you're interested in,

800
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,060
leave it to me.

801
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:35,020
(Fragrance Shop)

802
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:43,980
(Jade Bloom Aroma)

803
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,620
I'll take this one.

804
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,220
Ok, here you are.

805
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,140
Here, take a look.

806
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,420
Rou'er, here.

807
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,340
- Ok.
- Have a cup of tea.

808
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,580
Take a break.

809
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:56,180
Miss, have some tea.

810
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,020
Chuchu.

811
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:57,940
Come here.

812
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,740
You've been busy today.

813
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:00,860
Have some tea.

814
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,340
This tea smells good.

815
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,300
It's jasmine tea.

816
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,780
How is it today?

817
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,100
Jiang Si,

818
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:07,980
you know what,

819
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,220
your perfumes are amazing.

820
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,420
Every perfume here

821
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,460
transports me

822
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,940
to a different world.

823
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,620
When I paint the visions in my mind

824
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:16,620
for our customers,

825
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,060
they reach for their wallets every time.

826
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,020
Fragrance Shop?

827
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,100
I've never seen you

828
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,300
use these before.

829
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,540
Well,

830
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,380
a new fragrance shop

831
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,780
opened in town lately.

832
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,140
I went there to take a look.

833
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,100
The shopkeeper said

834
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:37,300
this perfume can refresh my mind,

835
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,140
so I bought it to try.

836
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,460
Scrolls Slumber?

837
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,100
To refresh your mind?

838
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:46,220
I could be mistaken, probably.

839
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,100
Tell me.

840
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,060
Who did you buy this for?

841
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,540
I bought it for myself.

842
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,060
Which girl?

843
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,020
Mother,

844
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:01,100
it doesn't involve any girl.

845
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,660
I know my son best.

846
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,620
How dare I lie to you?

847
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:04,980
If you don't tell me, I'll be angry.

848
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,980
Fine, it's Jiang Si,

849
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:17,780
fourth daughter of Earl Dongping's household.

850
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,780
We just know each other.

851
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:21,980
That's all.

852
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,300
She is the owner

853
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:24,500
of Fragrance Shop.

854
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,100
(The same Jiang Si who set the city abuzz)

855
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,140
(by breaking her engagement?)

856
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,580
(Fragrance Shop)

857
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,540
Fragrance Shop.

858
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,140
While other shops

859
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,180
deploy pretty girls

860
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,540
to coax customers,

861
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:45,660
we neither

862
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,580
coax nor grovel.

863
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,820
It will help us to earn gentlemen's respect.

864
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,340
Then, they'll be more convinced

865
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,820
by the visions you paint.

866
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,220
Miss,

867
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,700
could you recommend some fragrances?

868
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:00,830
Chuchu,

869
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,140
I'll do it. You take a break.

870
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,780
What kind of fragrance would you like?

871
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,460
Used for gifts.

872
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,780
My niece

873
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,100
is visiting soon.

874
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:18,020
I'll prepare two welcome gifts for her.

875
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,420
She is

876
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,540
about your age.

877
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,340
Allow me to recommend some to you.

878
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,780
You can try this one first.

879
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,020
This is Angelica Balm.

880
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,180
Apply it

881
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,980
to your wrists and behind your ears.

882
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,140
As your body warmth activates it,

883
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,500
the fragrance will diffuse

884
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,620
through your garments.

885
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,060
It's elegant.

886
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:42,300
Do you have any other aromas?

887
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,940
You can try this one too.

888
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,340
This balm

889
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,100
is crafted with lychee rind

890
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,620
blended into fruit notes.

891
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:53,140
It's always raining

892
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,300
this time of year in Ling'an.

893
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,820
(Fragrance)

894
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:17,940
Fresh and elegant.

895
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,420
Thank you for your recommendation.

896
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,340
I'll take both.

897
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,340
Would you like to see more?

898
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:26,060
I will come again.

899
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:27,540
Thank you, Ma'am.

900
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:33,980
Ma'am.

901
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,700
Please wait.

902
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:39,540
Ma'am,

903
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,380
(Fragrance Shop)
you forgot your wallet.

904
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,100
I'm so forgetful.

905
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,340
Thank you, Miss.

906
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,180
You're welcome.

907
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,740
You're a beautiful girl with a kind heart.

908
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,700
I'm flattered, Ma'am.

909
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,820
Qi, what are you doing here?

910
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:56,940
Why don't you get in?

911
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,260
Why is Mrs. Zhen here?

912
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,380
Mr. Zhen's mother?

913
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,540
It's her.

914
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:03,780
No wonder

915
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,740
she seems to

916
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,100
like Jiang Si very much.

917
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,380
She dismissed others' recommendations

918
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,380
without a glance,

919
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,660
yet listened carefully

920
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,140
to Jiang Si's every word.

921
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,860
I get the sense she's not here for perfumes.

922
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,060
Instead, she seems to come to see Jiang Si.

923
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:18,380
Qi, do you think

924
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,620
she is here to check out

925
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,460
a potential daughter-in-law?

926
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,460
No way.

927
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,660
Definitely not.

928
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,660
Take care, Ma'am.

929
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,340
Come back again.

930
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:40,900
Mr. Yu!

931
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:43,940
Miss Jiang, you're here.

932
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,620
What are you doing here, Mr. Yu?

933
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,740
Are you going on a case?

934
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,740
No, I was just passing by

935
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:51,980
and brought some food for my sister.

936
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,220
I, this...

937
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,300
Go ahead.

938
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,380
Wash it before eating.

939
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,540
I've washed it.

940
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,580
Wash it well.

941
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,720
I...

942
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:02,620
How careless she is!

943
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,220
Mr. Yu,

944
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,980
as a martial artist,

945
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,460
do you wear Autumn Grove too?

946
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:11,620
Martial artists love Autumn.

947
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,020
It's summer.

948
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,220
Mr. Yu, wait a minute.

949
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,740
(Invitation)

950
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,580
I was planning

951
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,100
to visit your residence today.

952
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,420
My grandma's birthday is coming soon.

953
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,900
On behalf of Earl Dongping's Mansion,

954
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,140
I cordially invite you

955
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,580
to attend her celebration banquet.

956
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:42,780
Thank you, Mr. Yu,

957
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,180
for all your previous assistance.

958
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,540
Ok, I'll be there.

959
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,340
Wait.

960
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:10,860
Sit down, honey.

961
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:11,700
Thank you, darling.

962
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,540
What would you like to drink?

963
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,220
It's scorching today.

964
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,140
Get us some cold tea, will you?

965
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,380
- Yes.
- Wait.

966
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,180
No cold drinks for her cold constitution.

967
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,260
Floral tea would be better.

968
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:24,940
That's her favorite.

969
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,340
Yes.

970
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:32,980
(Zhu Ziyu, Jiang Yi's husband)

971
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,260
Look at you, all sweaty.

972
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,820
You don't always have to indulge me.

973
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:38,780
No worries.

974
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,580
The journey must have

975
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,820
worn you out, darling.

976
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,620
Visiting your parents' home is a rare joy,

977
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,500
no hardship at all.

978
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,980
Because your safety and happiness

979
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,540
are my greatest wish.

980
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,180
Here's your tea!

981
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:58,700
Thank you.

982
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,140
Enjoy your tea.

983
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,540
By the way,

984
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:15,460
tomorrow is your grandma's birthday.

985
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,420
When you see your elder sister,

986
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,860
talk to her.

987
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:19,980
Ask her

988
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:21,380
how she's been getting along lately.

989
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:22,540
Yes, Father.

990
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:23,900
I miss her too.

991
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,260
I've failed

992
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:28,420
your eldest sister.

993
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:31,060
When she was born,

994
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,500
I was young and my world

995
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:35,140
revolved around your mother.

996
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,420
I had little

997
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,540
left for her.

998
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,740
She has been nothing

999
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,420
but thoughtful and capable

1000
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:46,260
and never demanded more than I could give.

1001
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,420
Thankfully,

1002
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,540
she married well.

1003
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,700
Her husband

1004
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,700
is good-natured

1005
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,860
who treasures her.

1006
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:56,380
Don't worry, Father.

1007
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,100
She is so kind-hearted.

1008
00:38:58,740 --> 00:38:59,940
She will surely lead a good life.

1009
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:04,060
All right, I'm leaving.

1010
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,540
Take care, Father.

1011
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:20,860
(Capital Security Office)

1012
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,540
Mother, why are you here?

1013
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,300
Heng,

1014
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,980
I brought you a new gown.

1015
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,220
What's the occasion?

1016
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,940
I hear today is the birthday

1017
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:32,460
of the old lady of Earl Dongping's Mansion.

1018
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,060
You'll go with me

1019
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,020
to pay our respects.

1020
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:36,820
Oh?

1021
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:40,180
You have a great eye.

1022
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,060
I also like the fourth young lady

1023
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,380
of the family.

1024
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,140
Mother,

1025
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,460
since when did you know her?

1026
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,580
Enough dilly-dallying.

1027
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,780
Go try it on.

1028
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:53,620
Quickly.

1029
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:58,380
(Earl Dongping's Mansion, Jiang)

1030
00:39:58,940 --> 00:39:59,780
Miss,

1031
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:01,100
what's the hurry to get to the main hall?

1032
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:02,900
Today is Grandma's birthday banquet,

1033
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,210
and Mother is busy making arrangements.

1034
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,900
I must do a good job

1035
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,260
so that Mother

1036
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,700
will stop being mad at me

1037
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:09,700
over what happened to Qian

1038
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,060
and focus on arranging me

1039
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:11,900
a good marriage.

1040
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,540
Miss, you're quick-witted as always.

1041
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:14,620
Right?

1042
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,860
- Hurry up.
- Yes.

1043
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:19,740
Watch out, Miss.

1044
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,580
Miss, are you all right?

1045
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:36,060
Are you Mr. Zhen?

1046
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:37,740
Yes, I am.

1047
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,540
What a pretty young lady.

1048
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:42,780
We're here

1049
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,380
to celebrate Mrs. Jiang's birthday.

1050
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,980
Grandma should be

1051
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,180
in the backyard right now.

1052
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:49,620
Are you her granddaughter?

1053
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:52,500
You're beautiful and kind-hearted.

1054
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,340
I'm flattered, Mrs. Zhen.

1055
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:55,900
Mr. Zhen,

1056
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,540
may I show you the way?

1057
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,020
Thank you, Miss.

1058
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,540
This way, please.

1059
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,620
Why hasn't Yi come yet?

1060
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,900
Is her husband preventing her from coming?

1061
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,460
We haven't seen her in ages.

1062
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,380
Today is Grandma's birthday.

1063
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,340
(Earl Dongping's Mansion)
She must come.

1064
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,740
The Zhu Family has no reason to stop her.

1065
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:24,900
Exactly.

1066
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,540
Lingshui is a long way from Ling'an.

1067
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,220
Let's wait a little longer.

1068
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:37,220
Si, Zhan.

1069
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:38,780
Yi.

1070
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:53,940
It's Yi.

1071
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:55,260
Yi.

1072
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:57,660
Yi.

1073
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,060
Si.

1074
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:08,020
Yi.

1075
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:13,820
Yi!

1076
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:22,340
(It's good to see her)

1077
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,140
(again.)

1078
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:26,180
You must have suffered.

1079
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:31,940
Last time when you

1080
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:32,940
broke off your engagement,

1081
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,500
I couldn't make it back to support you.

1082
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:35,980
It's all my fault.

1083
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,060
You don't blame me, right?

1084
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,260
It's ok, Yi.

1085
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:43,100
I just miss you so much.

1086
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:44,820
I miss you too.

1087
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,380
I'm always worried you're not doing well.

1088
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,100
But seeing that

1089
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,020
you look great,

1090
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,100
I can finally feel at ease.

1091
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:53,380
You two are so close.

1092
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,180
Yi always talks about you at home.

1093
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:57,220
Before coming back for Grandma's birthday,

1094
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,380
she started preparing gifts

1095
00:42:58,380 --> 00:42:59,460
half a month in advance.
