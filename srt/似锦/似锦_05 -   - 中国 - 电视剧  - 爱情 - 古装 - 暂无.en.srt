It's too dangerous here.

12
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:41,480
I'll take you home now

13
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,760
and report it to the Capital Security.

14
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,200
Yu Qi!

15
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,040
I've found the witness.

16
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,480
That's the crime scene.

17
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,470
If I bring my men here,

18
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:51,600
we'll find the evidence.

19
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,440
It won't work.

20
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,310
You have to be well prepared,

21
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,240
or the evidence will be eliminated

22
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,470
and the witnesses will disappear.

23
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,200
Have you done something already?

24
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,470
Anyway, you have to trust me.

25
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:01,480
I can't leave, really.

26
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:02,600
Marquis Changxing's Mansion

27
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,920
is no ordinary place.

28
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,230
You must plan the whole thing carefully.

29
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,870
You can't be impulsive.

30
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,110
What's wrong?

31
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,950
Are you always like this?

32
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,710
Like what?

33
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,550
So annoying.

34
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,710
But I can't be mad at you right now.

35
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,710
You have a point.

36
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,110
I didn't think it through.

37
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,800
But I just got you out of there.

38
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,120
I can't just stand by

39
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,640
and watch you take a risk.

40
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,520
It requires strategy and tactics

41
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,960
to fight a war.

42
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,480
You can't just clash head-on.

43
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,550
How about this?

44
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:43,670
Let's work together

45
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,360
to bring this villain to justice

46
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,270
and avenge the deaths of those women.

47
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:48,950
Can you trust me?

48
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,200
Yes, I trust you.

49
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,710
Take care of yourself.

50
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,110
I'll be back as soon as I can.

51
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,360
(I know)

52
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,390
(you approached me)

53
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,390
(with an agenda,)

54
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,230
(but I believe)

55
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,320
(you're a good official for the job.)

56
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,320
Make sure

57
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,640
she isn't in any danger.

58
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:29,660
(Marquis Changxing's Mansion)

59
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:33,300
(Blessings from Heaven)

60
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,270
This is Miss Si, right?

61
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:40,200
I remember when Xingyu got married,

62
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,790
you were still young.

63
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,840
But I could tell

64
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,230
you were going to be a beauty.

65
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,270
I didn't expect that you've

66
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:50,200
(Marquis Changxing's wife)
become so beautiful.

67
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,670
I'm flattered, Ma'am.

68
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,640
Looks are a gift from my parents.

69
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,600
It has nothing to do with my efforts.

70
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,710
I don't think

71
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,440
it's worth mentioning.

72
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,590
It's surprising that you're so insightful

73
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,990
despite your young age.

74
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,830
I like her from the bottom of my heart.

75
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,670
Mother, if you don't mind

76
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,230
my sisters disturbing you,

77
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,480
let them stay with you for a few more days.

78
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,030
Good idea.

79
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,830
Greetings, Mother.

80
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,320
Sit down.

81
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,920
Xingyu,

82
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,000
why do you look so tired?

83
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,310
Did your father punish you by making you

84
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,470
practice swordsmanship last night?

85
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,000
Father is hard on me

86
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,200
for my own good.

87
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,840
By the way,

88
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,790
did you girls

89
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,880
sleep well last night?

90
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:51,550
We did.

91
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,590
Good for you.

92
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,560
Qian cares about us very much.

93
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,350
And you are so kind, Ma'am.

94
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,960
I feel

95
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,880
more comfortable here than at home.

96
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,390
I didn't

97
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,320
sleep well.

98
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,440
I'm picky about the bed.

99
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:16,550
Really?

100
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,930
You're so pampered, Si.

101
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,450
Isn't the bed at the Marquis's mansion

102
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:21,690
better than that at the Earl's mansion?

103
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,940
I'll see what I can do

104
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,420
for your bed tonight.

105
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,340
So, help yourselves, girls.

106
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:32,940
Mother,

107
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,820
I'm leaving.

108
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,220
Miss Si,

109
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,300
we didn't say anything.

110
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,460
Neither did Anzi.

111
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,300
Young Master...

112
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,380
Don't be afraid.

113
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,340
I wasn't going to turn you in.

114
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,980
And I know

115
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,580
you're more tenderhearted than Anzi.

116
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,420
You're kind.

117
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,940
You didn't put much effort

118
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,540
into strangling me last night.

119
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,300
So I think

120
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,340
you've long been reluctant

121
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,260
to do such outrageous things, right?

122
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,020
I have no choice.

123
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,900
I'm just a servant.

124
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,620
I have to do whatever

125
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:33,820
Young Master tells me to do.

126
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,260
But have you ever thought

127
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,380
that with his temperament,

128
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,540
how long he will let you live

129
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,700
if you know such a secret about him?

130
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,780
What should I do then?

131
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,700
Miss Si, can you help me?

132
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,460
I can,

133
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,500
but you must tell me something.

134
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,210
Last night I heard you say

135
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,580
there was another girl being held captive,

136
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,700
- right?
- Yes.

137
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,780
You should tell me

138
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,060
where she's being held.

139
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,620
This is Niuniu's.

140
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,500
Take a good look at it.

141
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,460
Don't make a mistake.

142
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,940
I bought her the hairpin.

143
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,620
How could I be wrong?

144
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:13,980
Where is Niuniu?

145
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,260
Where is she?

146
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,700
Don't be scared when you get in.

147
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:02,900
Miss.

148
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:14,700
(Modest Gentleman)

149
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,340
(The Map of Ling'an)

150
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,210
In the past five years,

151
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,420
(Missing cases in Ling'an)
in Ling'an,

152
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,620
there have been 15 cases

153
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,580
of missing women.

154
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,020
How can you conclude

155
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,380
that they are all done by the same suspect

156
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,460
and are serial crimes?

157
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,980
Isn't that a bit arbitrary?

158
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,580
These missing women

159
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,180
are between 16 and 20,

160
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:43,620
all pretty

161
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,580
and from modest families

162
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,860
or merchants.

163
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,460
Long Dan and I discovered

164
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,340
that the last place they appeared

165
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,300
(White Tiger Bridge)
was here.

166
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,900
Marquis Changxing's Mansion?

167
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,780
These are the clues we've gathered.

168
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,460
Basically, the testimonies

169
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,660
all point

170
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,500
to the same man,

171
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:03,820
Cao Xingyu.

172
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:07,780
Mr. Zhen,

173
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,060
do you still think I'm being arbitrary?

174
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,940
There is indeed something suspicious,

175
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,620
but after all, this is just conjecture.

176
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,500
Without solid evidence,

177
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,300
we can't combine the cases.

178
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,500
Ok.

179
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,660
I have other evidence.

180
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,100
There's another missing woman

181
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:24,980
named Niuniu.

182
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,900
Her hairpin was found

183
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,820
in the backyard

184
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,380
of Marquis Changxing's Mansion.

185
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,220
The informant

186
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,380
said that her body

187
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,020
was buried underground in the yard.

188
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,260
Is that accurate?

189
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,740
We can find out if it's accurate.

190
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,700
- Wait.
- Mr. Zhen,

191
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,820
are you still going to stop me?

192
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,220
All the evidence is pointing

193
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,700
to Marquis Changxing's Mansion.

194
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,780
I know it's a tough case,

195
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,300
so I need you

196
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,500
to help me, Mr. Zhen.

197
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,300
(White Tiger Bridge)
Throughout the country,

198
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,300
everyone reveres you

199
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,940
as the model for all civil officials,

200
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,220
fearless of power and upright.

201
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,260
If you hesitate now,

202
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,140
who would step up to handle the case?

203
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,420
As long as this case remains unsolved,

204
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,700
all the women in the country

205
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,020
will be at risk.

206
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,620
We can't wait any longer, Mr. Zhen!

207
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,700
Calm down, Mr. Yu.

208
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,460
I just have one thing to ask.

209
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,620
Go ahead.

210
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,860
Marquis Changxing holds military power

211
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,180
and commands the combat troops.

212
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,540
When Nanwu invaded,

213
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,700
he protected our country.

214
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,940
Aren't you afraid of offending him?

215
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,100
The law applies to everyone.

216
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,060
What do I have to fear?

217
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:26,900
Good!

218
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,620
You truly have extraordinary courage.

219
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,460
Finally, the Right Section got a capable man.

220
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,860
Come on. I'll go with you.

221
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:00,860
Miss.

222
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:02,940
Miss.

223
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,340
Is she dead?

224
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,660
Miss. Miss!

225
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,180
Don't hit me. Don't!

226
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,700
(Miss Chi)
I'll behave.

227
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,980
- Have you got the key?
- Yes.

228
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,780
Don't be afraid.

229
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,460
We're here to save you.

230
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:26,260
I'll behave. I will.

231
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:34,940
Fall in!

232
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,020
Chief, Rapid Response Division all set.

233
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,060
Let's set off.

234
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,260
Set off!

235
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,140
Yes!

236
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:12,820
Er'niu!

237
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,340
- Why haven't you done
- Master!

238
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,220
Master.

239
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,420
What I told you

240
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,900
- to do?
- Master.

241
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,020
Master,

242
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,700
we've heard from the Capital Security

243
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,060
that Yu Qi is coming

244
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,340
to search our mansion with a team.

245
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,220
What did you say?

246
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,300
He's coming to search my mansion?

247
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,780
What guts does this guy have

248
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,420
to do such a thing?

249
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,260
What is he searching for?

250
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,220
He said he's looking for

251
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,380
missing women.

252
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,820
You wretch,

253
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,540
what trouble have you made this time?

254
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,740
Spit it out!

255
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:02,300
He is a monster!

256
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:03,980
Don't be afraid.

257
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,700
I used to have a hard life.

258
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,500
I thought he was Marquis Changxing's heir.

259
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,340
Even without

260
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,860
a formal status,

261
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,380
I'd live a good life with him.

262
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,180
Had I known...

263
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,220
Had I known, I would never

264
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,740
have followed him here.

265
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,820
I should have jumped into a river.

266
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,220
Keep it down, Miss.

267
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,060
And saved myself

268
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,700
all this torment.

269
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,540
Miss, don't worry.

270
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,980
I will help you.

271
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,940
I'll get you out of this snake pit.

272
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,740
- Really?
- By the heavens,

273
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,100
I already

274
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,820
took a huge risk to bring you here.

275
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,180
Guards are everywhere outside.

276
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,220
How can we help her?

277
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,900
If they catch us,

278
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,340
we're both dead meat!

279
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,820
(Talents Galore on Blessed Land)

280
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,980
(Marquis Changxing's Mansion)

281
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,260
You've got

282
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,340
a lot of nerve

283
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,900
to barge into my mansion.

284
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,780
I'll impeach you in front of His Majesty

285
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,580
for disrespecting your superior

286
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,740
and abusing power.

287
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,300
Do whatever you like, sir.

288
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,580
Even if you bring it to His Majesty,

289
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,100
I have to act in accordance with the law.

290
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,300
I command the Combat Troops.

291
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,940
As a 1st Rank official,

292
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,820
I hold the title of 1st Class Marquis.

293
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,460
As a civilian official

294
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,100
of Sub-4th Rank,

295
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,460
aren't you offending

296
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,620
your superior?

297
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,420
The Capital Security

298
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,580
oversees public security of Ling'an.

299
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,540
Except for the Imperial Palace,

300
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,060
all 14 streets

301
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,180
and 108 blocks within the city

302
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,100
are under our jurisdiction.

303
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:39,620
Why?

304
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,140
Sir,

305
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,060
isn't your mansion

306
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,180
under this jurisdiction?

307
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,100
Mr. Zhen really

308
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,660
has a way with words.

309
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,740
Why else would I bring him here?

310
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,020
You've got a ready tongue, Mr. Zhen.

311
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,100
You have your hands in a lot of things.

312
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,900
Even if I'm under your jurisdiction,

313
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,180
you're being lawless

314
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,620
and breaking into a civilian house.

315
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,140
You really know how to adapt.

316
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:09,220
One moment you're a 1st Rank official,

317
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,500
and the next this is a civilian house.

318
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,340
Since we're here to search,

319
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,140
there must have been

320
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,220
a murder here.

321
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,260
This may be my fate.

322
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,620
I don't want to drag anyone into this.

323
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,500
Who said that?

324
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,100
Were you born

325
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,540
to be tortured by that villain?

326
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,740
Miss, listen to me.

327
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,500
The Capital Security will come

328
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,740
to search the mansion today.

329
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,460
By then, the backyard

330
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,380
will attract the attention

331
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,420
of the entire mansion.

332
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,540
Even if there is noise in the western yard,

333
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,940
no one will notice it.

334
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,340
Fulu, take Miss Chi to the back door

335
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,660
while things are in chaos.

336
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:46,900
My maid Aman

337
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,020
will meet you there.

338
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,820
I don't think I can make it.

339
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,700
Fulu, we're

340
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,820
in the same boat now.

341
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,100
You should give it a shot,

342
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,340
try to live a new life,

343
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,660
and get yourself a way out.

344
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,860
Miss, look.

345
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,940
You can crush this into powder.

346
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,060
It'll make people sleepy.

347
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,140
- You'll need it.
- Enough.

348
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,420
We should go,

349
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,260
or the guards will be suspicious.

350
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,380
Miss,

351
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,340
will the Capital Security really come?

352
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,020
Sure.

353
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,540
Miss,

354
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,460
I can't thank you enough for your kindness.

355
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:22,500
Remember,

356
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,420
Heaven helps those who help themselves

357
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:27,060
and abandons those who abandon themselves.

358
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,460
Understand?

359
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,700
- Let's go.
- Go.

360
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,420
Sir,

361
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,820
I've been investigating

362
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,860
the case of the missing women in Ling'an.

363
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,180
According to the witness,

364
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,820
they all had contact with your son

365
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,700
before they went missing.

366
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,820
Witness?

367
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,780
Which witness?

368
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:02,860
Summon him forth

369
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,940
to confront me face to face.

370
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,700
I didn't realize you were here.

371
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,180
If I summon him forth,

372
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,740
are you going to threaten him

373
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,500
with your coercive power?

374
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,500
Can you

375
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,220
accuse me of murder

376
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,660
on the basis of a false tip?

377
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,660
I didn't say you killed anyone.

378
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,700
Are you confessing

379
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,100
because you have a guilty conscience?

380
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,220
Ridiculous.

381
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,780
Do you have any evidence?

382
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,620
If not,

383
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:39,180
don't even think about stepping in here.

384
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,100
Of course,

385
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,700
we have evidence.

386
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,700
This brass hairpin is the evidence.

387
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,660
The witness also stated

388
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:54,180
that you are bloodthirsty, cruel,

389
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,620
and intolerable to the principles of heaven.

390
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,340
You abused and killed several women,

391
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,860
and hid their bodies

392
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,580
in the backyard of the mansion.

393
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,660
You are...

394
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,540
As a reasonable man,

395
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,740
I'll allow your search today.

396
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,740
But let me be clear,

397
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,780
if no body is found,

398
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:17,860
I will

399
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,660
by no means let this matter rest.

400
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,660
Please.

401
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:24,900
Search!

402
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,260
(Marquis Changxing's Mansion)

403
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,540
Why are there so many officers?

404
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,260
What's going on?

405
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,620
Mr. Zhen,

406
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,860
why don't you have some tea?

407
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:48,980
It doesn't feel right.

408
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,300
Cao Xingyu surprisingly

409
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,980
doesn't show the slightest hint of panic.

410
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,700
Were the bodies moved last night?

411
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:58,940
Last night?

412
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,140
What happened last night?

413
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,340
Nothing.

414
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,300
Sir, there's something underneath!

415
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,540
Hurry!

416
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,260
I hear your wife was mad at you again?

417
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,620
That's right.

418
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,140
- I think if you
- It's a headache.

419
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,500
buy her a flowery cloth off duty,

420
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,220
- you'll be able to coax her.
- Good idea.

421
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,700
Sir, it's a coffin!

422
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,100
Open it!

423
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,140
Guys, come on!

424
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,620
Sir, the coffin...

425
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:32,860
Chief,

426
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:33,900
there are only books.

427
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,740
Gentlemen,

428
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,340
this is just the place

429
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,900
where I bury the junk in my study.

430
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,540
How could there be a body?

431
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,100
Don't frame

432
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,620
an innocent man like me.

433
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,260
We were misinformed

434
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,460
and offended you, sir.

435
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,460
It doesn't matter, Mr. Zhen.

436
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,740
I'm magnanimous enough

437
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,420
to let this go.

438
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,660
Does he let it go so easily?

439
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,820
There must be something fishy.

440
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:12,420
The bodies must be stashed in the mansion.

441
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,940
I'm well aware,

442
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,780
but we need proof.

443
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,860
We've searched and found nothing.

444
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,100
If we push further

445
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,620
and he takes this to His Majesty,

446
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,780
we're both guilty of breaking the law.

447
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,600
Enough, let's call it a day.

448
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,580
We need to plan this carefully.

449
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,540
Are you kidding me?

450
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,300
If we leave now,

451
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,580
we won't get a second chance.

452
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,020
If we have to break the law,

453
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,060
I'll take the blame.

454
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,060
Long Dan, keep searching!

455
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:38,900
Yes.

456
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,460
Er'niu.

457
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:50,220
Mr. Zhen, don't go too far.

458
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,660
I can't stand you

459
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:52,980
fooling around in my mansion!

460
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,500
Someone, walk them out!

461
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,340
Don't obstruct our official duties.

462
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,180
Yu Qi,

463
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,980
rein in your impertinence.

464
00:22:58,980 --> 00:22:59,820
Sir,

465
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,700
if your son is innocent,

466
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,940
why are you afraid of a dog?

467
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,300
Ridiculous.

468
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,220
How could I be afraid of a dog?

469
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,060
Release the dog!

470
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:11,940
Go!

471
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,460
What are you waiting for?

472
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,300
Stop them!

473
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,300
Xingyu!

474
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,660
Yu Qi,

475
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:38,740
don't be reckless.

476
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,100
- Move it.
- Yes.

477
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,100
- Watch it.
- Yes.

478
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,100
Chief!

479
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,020
Chief, we've found the bodies.

480
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,220
Bodies! Bodies!

481
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,060
They all match.

482
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,340
Take Cao Xingyu, the suspect,

483
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,220
back to the Capital Security Office.

484
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,300
- Yes.
- Wait.

485
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,580
I didn't kill them.

486
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:42,820
He did.

487
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,100
Come out.

488
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,260
Come out.

489
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:48,860
Anzi.

490
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,340
Come out!

491
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,380
Does he think

492
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:59,740
we look like idiots?

493
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,180
He's trying to pin the blame on a servant.

494
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,940
How can you say

495
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,340
I killed these women?

496
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:07,980
Just on the basis of a tip

497
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,700
you don't know if it's true?

498
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,580
Let me ask you,

499
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,740
what's your name?

500
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,140
My name is Anzi.

501
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,300
Your master said

502
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:23,380
you killed all these women?

503
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,500
I...

504
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,940
Confess to it.

505
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:33,500
We've treated you well.

506
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,860
We've arranged your marriage

507
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,380
and secured your lineage.

508
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,020
Cao Xingyu,

509
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,540
stop threatening him.

510
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:46,140
Anzi, don't be afraid.

511
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,940
Tell us everything.

512
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,940
This case spans too wide to ignore.

513
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:52,460
I can report it directly to His Majesty.

514
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,620
No matter their rank,

515
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,180
they dare not touch your family.

516
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,380
Trust me.

517
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:06,100
Anzi, look at me.

518
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,620
Your family has been our servants

519
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,380
for three generations.

520
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,780
You know

521
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,260
my character and strength.

522
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:19,300
If you confess to your crime,

523
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,220
I can guarantee

524
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,940
that your family won't be implicated.

525
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,580
Understand?

526
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,060
Yes.

527
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,260
I killed them.

528
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,180
I killed them all.

529
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,820
Have you thought it through?

530
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,500
If you confess to it,

531
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,900
it won't be easy

532
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,140
to go back on your word later.

533
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,740
I'm the murderer.

534
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,060
I was blinded by lust

535
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,020
and gave in to my desires.

536
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,060
I killed those girls with my own hands

537
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:59,100
and threw their bodies into the dry well.

538
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,180
It has nothing to do

539
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,300
with Young Master.

540
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,220
Master,

541
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,980
I beg you to treat my family kindly.

542
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:12,940
Master!

543
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,780
I'm glad

544
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,820
you admitted your guilt.

545
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,140
Don't worry.

546
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:20,660
I will treat your family well.

547
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:27,900
Marquis Changxing,

548
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,620
you dare to silence him in public.

549
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,540
You have no regard for the law!

550
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:34,300
I've always managed my family like an army.

551
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,180
Now that

552
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,140
a wicked servant

553
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,860
tarnished Marquis Changxing's reputation,

554
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,540
isn't it better for me

555
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:42,500
to execute him

556
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,340
on your behalf?

557
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,780
It saves you the trouble of holding a trial.

558
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,860
According to the law of Dazhou,

559
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:50,020
killing a servant is a crime.

560
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:50,900
Mr. Zhen,

561
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,620
don't think

562
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,220
you're the only one who knows the law.

563
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,260
Killing a servant for no reason is a crime.

564
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,100
But he committed a capital offense.

565
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,820
What's wrong with my father killing him?

566
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,260
Even if he committed a capital offense,

567
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,740
you should have reported to the authorities

568
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,700
for approval before executing him.

569
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,900
He was just a lowly servant.

570
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,340
I could kill him if I wanted to.

571
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:11,740
It's not your turn

572
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,300
to approve it.

573
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,980
If you act without official approval,

574
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,600
it's a legal violation.

575
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,580
According to the law of Dazhou,

576
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,660
unauthorized execution of a servant

577
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,420
warrants 100 floggings.

578
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:29,100
What, Mr. Zhen,

579
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:32,100
are you going to flog me?

580
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:33,740
Dare you?

581
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,620
You, I!

582
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,780
I'm sorry to bother you.

583
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,220
Do as you please, sir.

584
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,860
Suit yourselves.

585
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,530
I have military affairs to attend to

586
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:50,940
and don't have the mood

587
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,660
to waste time with you.

588
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:09,980
Stop looking.

589
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,260
Go back.

590
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,020
Why did you stop me?

591
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,740
Are you going to let them go?

592
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:17,820
We're here not to prosecute Cao Yong

593
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:20,020
for killing his servant,

594
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,780
but to find these bodies.

595
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,380
The bodies are all here,

596
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,460
not a single one missing.

597
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,580
But the evidence died with them.

598
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,340
I won't let that happen.

599
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,100
Who's been getting to you?

600
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,020
You're all jittery

601
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,180
out of nowhere.

602
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,140
You are rather young.

603
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,660
Does it have anything to do

604
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,500
with being young?

605
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,260
The servant

606
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,340
didn't kill the girls.

607
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,180
He didn't have the guts.

608
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,380
Was it Qian?

609
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,740
No, Cao Xingyu killed them.

610
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,300
You're not too stupid.

611
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,460
Did you know it all along?

612
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,220
Why didn't you warn me?

613
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,210
How could I warn you?

614
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:01,340
You kept calling him brother-in-law

615
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,580
intimately.

616
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,020
Would you listen if I warned you?

617
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,740
Cao Xingyu was so cruel

618
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,900
and killed so many people.

619
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,780
Does Qian know about this?

620
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,500
She knows too?

621
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,660
Why did she still invite us over?

622
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,300
How could she do this to me?

623
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,940
Though we weren't born of the same mother,

624
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,460
I'm the closest to her.

625
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,500
Who told you to let Jiang Si go?

626
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,820
After seeing so many dead women,

627
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,540
they were so scared that they asked

628
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,860
the Capital Security to take them out.

629
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,420
How could I stop them?

630
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:40,540
How dare you talk back to me, wench!

631
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,700
How dare you?

632
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,580
If my mother

633
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,340
weren't happy with you,

634
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,740
I'd kill you

635
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:49,780
like I killed

636
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,660
those filthy women.

637
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,620
Worthless wench!

638
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:53,700
Young Master.

639
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,020
Young Master,

640
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,820
for your mother's sake...

641
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:57,860
Go!

642
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,780
Hit me! Kill me!

643
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,460
Besides hitting and killing women,

644
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,340
what else do you have the guts to do?

645
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:10,300
Your dad hit you, so you take it out on me.

646
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:11,460
If you're so tough,

647
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,300
why don't you dare

648
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,060
make a peep in front of him?

649
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,860
As a lowly woman from a humble family,

650
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,900
how dare you look down on me?

651
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:30,820
Where's the eagerness you had when you

652
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,700
took your cousin's place to marry me?

653
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,740
You brought this

654
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,540
on yourself.

655
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:49,940
Yes,

656
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,100
I did it.

657
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:53,900
I deserve it.

658
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,300
Go ahead, kill me!

659
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,140
Give the Capital Security

660
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,180
another body to handle.

661
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,060
Let's see if you'll find another Anzi

662
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,420
to pin it on.

663
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,060
I'll kill you!

664
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,340
I will kill you!

665
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,460
I'll spare you today.

666
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,220
When things calm down,

667
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,860
I'll come back for your cheap life.

668
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,260
Ma'am.

669
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,100
Ma'am.

670
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,540
Ma'am,

671
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,340
are you alright?

672
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:32,780
Cui'er,

673
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,580
I don't want

674
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,940
to spend another day like this.

675
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,220
Ma'am,

676
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:49,820
let's run away.

677
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,020
Run?

678
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,980
Where to?

679
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,220
When Miss Si left, she told me

680
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,300
she left a small palanquin

681
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,500
in the alley at the back door

682
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,420
in case you want to go home.

683
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,580
If you don't go,

684
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,860
I'm afraid you'll die.

685
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:26,780
Ma'am.

686
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,180
I can't just sit around waiting to die.

687
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:32,700
Go home.

688
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,580
Let's go home.

689
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,020
Go home.

690
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:53,460
(Morning Drizzle)

691
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,660
(Haitang Chamber)

692
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,020
Heaven must be blind

693
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:57,100
to let that murderous demon

694
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,220
walk free.

695
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,220
Commandant Yu

696
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,300
vowed to keep digging,

697
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,620
but it's a dead end with the witnesses dead.

698
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,380
I don't think so.

699
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,020
Have you forgotten Miss Chi?

700
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,060
She was so grateful when you asked me

701
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,100
to send her out of town.

702
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,700
Just say the word,

703
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:13,980
and she'll come testify.

704
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,500
But her life has been so hard,

705
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,060
and she barely managed to escape.

706
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,220
If I ask her

707
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,500
to identify Cao Xingyu,

708
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,300
her days of detention

709
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,380
will become public.

710
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,860
How can a young woman

711
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,220
survive such a thing?

712
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,620
Wouldn't that

713
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,940
push her back to the edge?

714
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,660
If she doesn't testify,

715
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:33,060
the criminal will walk free.

716
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,540
Do you think she can live in peace?

717
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,100
I'll visit her tomorrow.

718
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:39,860
Si.

719
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,300
- Si.
- At this hour?

720
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,620
Is she here to make trouble?

721
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:44,460
Go and take a look.

722
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,140
Miss Pei, what are you doing?

723
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,420
- Si.
- What's up?

724
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,260
Qian,

725
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,860
Jiang Qian is home.

726
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,020
She's at Grandma's now.

727
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,780
(Cixin Hall)

728
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,380
Qian,

729
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:06,340
stop crying.

730
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,420
You need to tell Grandma

731
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,060
why you ran back home

732
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,460
in the middle of the night?

733
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,060
Rumors say there was a murder

734
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,620
at Marquis Changxing's Mansion.

735
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,180
Several people died.

736
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,980
That's a murder case!

737
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,420
Has your husband been implicated?

738
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:22,500
Did something happen to him?

739
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,660
With a father who rules the roost,

740
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,140
what's a murder case to him?

741
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,500
Whatever the mess, his father will fix it.

742
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,340
I'm not criticizing you,

743
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,620
but you're husband and wife.

744
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,540
You should share honor and disgrace.

745
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,020
Running back whenever you have a problem

746
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,340
isn't good.

747
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,860
Tell Mother what's wrong.

748
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,100
Did you have a fight with your husband

749
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,140
or did he bully you?

750
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:46,740
Physical fights

751
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:49,420
between couples are common.

752
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,540
Ask your mother.

753
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:52,180
Now that you're married,

754
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,500
you can't be so headstrong.

755
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,660
It's late tonight.

756
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:57,700
You can stay here.

757
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,740
Go home and apologize

758
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,260
to your husband's family tomorrow morning.

759
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,900
Tell them that Grandma was sick

760
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,300
and called you back tonight.

761
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,260
Qian,

762
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,860
now that you've made it back,

763
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,300
you should tell them everything.

764
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,500
Yes, Qian.

765
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,420
You knew that mansion

766
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,500
was a den of wolves,

767
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,340
yet you dragged your sisters into its jaws.

768
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,540
What's your scheme?

769
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,060
With Grandma here,

770
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,340
lay it all out now.

771
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,180
Shut your mouth!

772
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,660
Den of wolves?

773
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:22,980
Who gave you the right to speak?

774
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,180
Qiao, tell Grandma

775
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,540
what's going on.

776
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:27,780
It's Cao Xingyu.

777
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,860
He harbors ill intentions toward Si.

778
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,220
What?

779
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:34,460
He harbors ill intentions toward Si?

780
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:35,580
What...

781
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,300
What an enormous joke!

782
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:39,740
What kind of girl

783
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:40,620
hasn't he seen?

784
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:41,980
You, you, and you,

785
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,100
go back now.

786
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,980
Mrs. Li, take them back to their rooms.

787
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,780
Ladies, please return.

788
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:56,380
Qian, stop crying.

789
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:58,940
Were you kept in the dark,

790
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:01,380
so you ran back in anger?

791
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,780
I know everything.

792
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,620
What are you talking about?

793
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,380
What do you mean?

794
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:14,700
This...

795
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,420
My goodness!

796
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:25,100
Qian, did he hit you?

797
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,620
He hit you so hard.

798
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:30,460
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

799
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,460
Tell you?

800
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,740
How could I?

801
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,540
Mother taught me since childhood

802
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,540
and Grandma reminded me day and night

803
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:41,220
that I'm the finest young lady

804
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,500
in this family.

805
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,540
Our family's fate

806
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,940
rests entirely on me.

807
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:50,700
I've been studying the four arts

808
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,420
and household management since young,

809
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,340
never slacking for a moment,

810
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:57,820
all to marry into a marquis's family

811
00:38:58,660 --> 00:38:59,700
and secure a prosperous future

812
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,300
for myself and our family.

813
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,580
But what happened?

814
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:03,780
I did everything

815
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,180
you said.

816
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,460
Why have I ended up

817
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,700
in this situation?

818
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,740
What did I do wrong?

819
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:16,180
Four years,

820
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,060
two months,

821
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,460
and seven days married to Cao Xingyu,

822
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:23,220
every day a living hell.

823
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:25,580
Fists,

824
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,220
slaps,

825
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:28,580
whips,

826
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,020
I've tasted them all.

827
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:32,940
I begged him,

828
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:34,660
but it was useless.

829
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,060
Then, I tried to fight back,

830
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:40,500
but that only made him beat me harder.

831
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:44,980
After enough beatings,

832
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,620
I learned

833
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,460
the most useful trick.

834
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:50,980
I would play dead

835
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,220
and let him hit a corpse

836
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,580
that gave him nothing.

837
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:55,980
The more numb I was,

838
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,020
the faster he got bored.

839
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,060
Soon enough,

840
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,740
he would move on to some new fun.

841
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:13,100
Qian.

842
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,220
Qian, don't be afraid.

843
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:17,820
Mother will take you back now

844
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,420
to seek a divorce from him.

845
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,260
Nonsense!

846
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,100
If I hadn't come,

847
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,740
you would've turned the place upside down.

848
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:24,820
Mother,

849
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,780
why didn't you stop them?

850
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:28,460
How could you let them do this?

851
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:29,740
Look how

852
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:31,020
she's been beaten!

853
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,580
Darling, you're finally back.

854
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:36,420
Take a look at our daughter!

855
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,140
There are bruises

856
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:40,500
all over her body.

857
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,980
Isn't there justice under the sky?

858
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:43,820
Tomorrow morning,

859
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,180
we'll go to Marquis Changxing's Mansion

860
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,580
to divorce him!

861
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,740
They really have no regard for the law.

862
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,940
Tomorrow, I'll go to Marquis Changxing

863
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:54,780
to demand an explanation.

864
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,140
I'll ask him

865
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,220
why his good-for-nothing son

866
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,140
bullied my Qian

867
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:00,140
like this.

868
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,660
Son, you're right.

869
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:02,780
They can't

870
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:04,860
bully Qian anymore.

871
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:08,300
We have to handle this properly

872
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:12,060
as it concerns our relationship.

873
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:15,300
Mother,

874
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,540
I see.

875
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,420
Look,

876
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:26,100
what's the point of telling you?

877
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:29,420
Father,

878
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:34,620
why do you think Cao Xingyu

879
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,460
dares act so brazenly?

880
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,260
Simply because he knows

881
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:41,780
I've got no family to back me up.

882
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,700
Even after such a beating,

883
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:46,220
all you will do is give him

884
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:49,100
a half-hearted scolding!

885
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,300
Qian,

886
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,740
how can you say that?

887
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:54,820
Aren't we going to

888
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,020
ask for an explanation?

889
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:56,940
So what?

890
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,900
He is Marquis Changxing

891
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,260
who holds untouchable power.

892
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:08,500
We are no match for them.

893
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:12,940
We can only ask for an explanation now.

894
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:14,620
So you'll

895
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:15,780
trade my scars

896
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:18,420
for your and my brother's gain?

897
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:22,380
- Ungrateful daughter!
- You...

898
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:23,700
Rebellious and disrespectful!

899
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:24,940
What are you doing?

900
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,700
She has been beaten up so hard.

901
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:29,140
Do you still want to beat her?

902
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:42,340
Since ancient times,

903
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,260
a daughter must obey her father at home

904
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:48,300
and her husband after marriage.

905
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:55,780
Mother,

906
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,700
I won't let her divorce him.

907
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:00,620
Don't worry.

908
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:05,060
