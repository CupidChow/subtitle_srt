Why are you arresting me?

Don't say you don't recognize it.

Chief,

49
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,850
you gave the Nightingale Token
to Jiang Si?

50
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,130
What if she really is...?

51
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,730
She will lead us
to the Nightingale Division.

52
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,880
What if she remains unmoved?

53
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:08,490
Then she's less suspicious.

Help me.

57
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:42,570
Are you alright?

58
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,350
Mr. Zhen, you're a scholar.

59
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,810
Why are you practicing martial arts?

60
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,340
You don't understand.

61
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,660
I have someone I want to protect.

62
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,020
If danger arises,

63
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,100
I hope I can protect her.

64
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,660
Yu Qi can do it.

65
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,340
So can I.

66
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,460
I heard Miss Si
likes flowers and plants.

67
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,020
I found this Lan-tsao

68
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,820
by chance in the mountains,

69
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,500
so I brought it to her.

70
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:27,940
Understood.

71
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,940

72
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,100
and efforts will surely

73
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,100
be passed on to Miss Si.

74
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,700

- Miss, women are not allowed here.
- Sure.

I'm looking for someone.

80
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,100
The more reason you can't go in.

81

Ma'am,

82
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,820
please make an exception.

83
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,460

86
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,300
come here to look for someone,

87
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,460
who would dare

88
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,340
visit here now?

89
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,340
You should go back.

90
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:38,940
Young Master Zhan,

91
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,340
should I hold it for you?

92
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,180
No, no.

93
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,540
I'm practicing pitch-pot.

94
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,700
This is how to practice it.

95
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,420
I must use my mouth.

96
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,020
Use your mouth?

97
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,940
This is the first time I've seen someone

98
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,620
practice pitch-pot with their mouth.

99
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,540
Zhan, this skill of yours

100
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,660
is really impressive.

101
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,940
My dear sister.

102
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,040
You're managing either the household

103
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:58,980
or the shop every day.

104
00:09:58,980 --> 00:09:59,980
I can't even

105
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,020
find you to chat.

106
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,540
So, I came to find you.

107
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:03,820
That's more like it.

108
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,420
Bring the tea.

109
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,300
The tea leaves were picked
this morning. Try it.

110
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,000
Zhan, have you been to Tianxiang House?

111
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,380
What Tianxiang House?

112
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,820
I don't even know

113
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,020
which way the door opens.

114
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,780
If I find out who told you about that,

115
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,780
I'll peel their skin off.

116
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:35,940
I thought

117
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,460
you'd be familiar with the place

118
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,060
so you could help me.

119
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,900
If that's the case,

120
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,300
I'll have to think of another way.

121
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,180
What do you mean?

122
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,580
Do you want to pretend to be a man

123
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,940
and sneak into a brothel?

124
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,140
If it really comes to that,

125
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,020
I'll have to go myself.

126
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,540
Don't. I've been there.

127
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,580
Is that so?

128
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,100
Didn't you just say

129
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,180
you didn't even know

130
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,260
which way their door opened?

131
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,660
I'm familiar with the place.

132
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,660
Familiar?

133
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,620
No, I'm not familiar with it.

134
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,260
I just saw it

135
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,140
while passing by.

136
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,780
If that's the case,

137
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,860
Zhan, you have to help me.

138
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,020
Take me to Tianxiang House.

139
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:16,960
I want to meet someone.

140
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,500
Meet someone?

141
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,580
Have you fallen for some playboy

142
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,220
who loves to visit brothels?

143
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,500
I don't agree.

144
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,620
Zhan, I want to meet

145
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,100
the courtesan, Liu Yan'er.

146
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,900
You even know Liu Yan'er?

147
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,180
That's not appropriate.

148
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,100
You're a noble lady.

149
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,100
How can you meet with a courtesan?

150
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,340
If Father finds out,

151
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,700
he'll beat me to death.

152
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,980
Everyone in Ling'an knows

153
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,700
Liu Yan'er is an expert in fragrances.

154
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,820
How many patrons have spent lavishly

155
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,580
just to see her make fragrances

156
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,060
for pleasure?

157
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,220
That's true.

158
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,500
Even Tianxiang House's name

159
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,820
came from this.

160
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,220
Are you planning to learn her skills?

161
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,460
How well you know me.

162
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,420
Of course.

163
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,310
- Great.
- Bravo.

164
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,180
Si, stay close to me.

165
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,580
No, no, you can't look.

166
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:26,740
Gentlemen,

167
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,100
do you know any of the girls here?

168
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,020
It's you.

169
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,140
No, no, it's not me.

170
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,840
I've never been here.
You've mistaken me.

171
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:35,980
Ma'am,

172
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,080
please make an exception.

173
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,220
We want to see Courtesan Liu.

174
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,940
Since you've snuck in,

175
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,860
I won't expose you

176
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:45,920
for this gentleman's sake.

177
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,940
You go have fun.

178
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,980
Just don't cause trouble.

179
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,420
Courtesan Liu

180
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,740
is our star attraction.

181
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,540
My business depends on her.

182
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,580
How could I let you go annoy her?

183
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:00,860
Ma'am...

184
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,060
I also want to meet her.

185
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,340
Is that possible?

186
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,220
Yu.

187
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,700
Well...

188
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,740
If you want to meet Courtesan Liu,

189
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,700
please follow me.

190
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:13,860
Wait.

191
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,620
Do you also frequent here?

192
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,740
Mr. Zhan, do you also frequent here?

193
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,100
(As expected, it's Yu Qi.)

194
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,980
(He's testing me
with the Nightingale Token.)

195
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,220
Let them both come with me.

196
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,460
Sir,

197
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,220
we have rules.

198
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,620
Courtesan Liu

199
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,220
can only meet one guest at a time.

200
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,860
It's fine if you go alone,

201
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,620
but you can't bring them.

202
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,100
Just help me out here.

203
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,100
Well...

204
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,580
This...

205
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,700
Please come in.

206
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,100
This way.

207
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,060
Miss Liu,

208
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,340
they are...

209
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,820
Miss Liu, you're known
for your art of fragrance.

210
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,940
I also know something about it.

211
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,700
I'd like to ask you about a formula.

212
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,620
Three qian of cloves,
half a liang of Long Nao,

213
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,940
one qian of sapphire-berry,
and a little suhe.

214
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,060
Miss Liu, what do you think?

215
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,940
Ms. Chun, you may go now.

216
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:26,860
Sure.

217
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,740
The formula you asked about

218
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,580
is my secret recipe.

219
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,580
I wouldn't reveal your secret in public.

220
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,980
But there's one key ingredient

221
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:37,820
that I don't know.

222
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,580
Could you enlighten me?

223
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,780
It's hard to meet a like-minded friend.

224
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,340
Sir,

225
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,220
please come here.

226
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,860
Yu, let's drink.

227
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:51,860
I don't drink.

228
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,580
Then eat apricots.

229
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,940
I'll drink then.

230
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,700
Sir, why don't you try this?

231
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,820
It helps calm the mind.

232
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:04,540
(Liu Yan'er, a nightingale spy)

233
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,060
Jiang Si,

234
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,820
this is your senior, Liu Yan'er.

235
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,720
She just returned from Ling'an.

236
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,340
She'll teach you about fragrances.

237
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,820
Greetings, Senior Liu.

238
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,580
Be careful.

239
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,220
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

240
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,220
Here.

241
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,940
This formula is right.

242
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,540
That one too.

243
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:49,860
Junior, smell this.

244
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,460
It smells so good.

245
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:57,860
Alright.

246
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,420
They're asleep now.

247
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,740
You look unfamiliar.

248
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,400
What brings you here so suddenly?

249
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:04,940
I'm Zhao Yu,

250
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,820
Special Envoy of the North Affiliate.

251
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,820
I've run into some trouble,

252
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,180
so I came here.

253
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,580
Trouble?

254
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,820
While on a mission,

255
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,340
I discovered a woman

256
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,300
who carries the Saintess's Totem.

257
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,100
But after investigation,

258
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,500
I found that this woman

259
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,860
had never left Dazhou

260
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,340
and had no contact with Nanwu.

261
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,020
Why don't you report it

262
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,820
to the North Leader?

263
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,860
It's known to everyone

264
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,220
that whoever finds the Saintess
will be heavily rewarded.

265
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,420
Our affiliate is strict with us,

266
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,060
and the leader isn't merciful.

267
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,660
If I

268
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,980
take this woman back rashly,

269
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,920
I'll be fine
if she truly is the Saintess,

270
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:42,820
but if not,

271
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,740
I'll certainly be punished.

272
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:46,860
Everyone knows

273
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,300
you're the most experienced

274
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,340
in Ling'an.

275
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,300
If I have to share the reward with you,

276
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,740
I'll accept it.

277
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,340
If I can't see her,

278
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,020
I can't decide.

279
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,820
I'd like to bring her here to meet you,

280
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,180
but as you know,

281
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,340
Ling'an is heavily guarded.

282
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,540
Miss Liu,

283
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,740
apart from the Saintess's Totem,

284
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,340
what other traits

285
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,380
can help verify her identity?

286
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,340
Prophecy.

287
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,580
It's rumored that the Saintess
can foresee the future

288
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,340
and lead Nanwu
into an era of prosperity.

289
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,820
(Now, I surely know)

290
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,020
(what will happen in the future.)

291
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,820
(So, I did become
the Saintess by mistake.)

292
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,700
(Tianxiang House)

293
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,100
I'm not drunk.

294
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,140
Why am I dizzy?

295
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,500
Logically speaking,

296
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,460
this shouldn't happen
with my alcohol tolerance.

297
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,600
This is a bit improper.

298
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:45,980
Si, are you okay?

299
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,020
I'm fine.

300
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:48,860
By the way, Zhan,

301
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,540
Qingbao Foodie is nearby.

302
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,780
Their ice custard

303
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,620
is especially tasty.

304
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,180
It should help with your dizziness.

305
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,540
I've been wanting to try it.

306
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,820
- Icy custard?
- But it seems a bit far.

307
00:18:58,830 --> 00:18:59,720
Let's walk faster.

308
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,560
Let's go. No, no.

309
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:01,510
We can make it in time.

310
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,420
I know that shop. I'll go buy it.

311
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,520
With your speed,
you won't be there before it closes.

312
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,540
Thanks, Commandant Yu.

313
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:08,980
You're such a good friend.

314
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,260
We'll wait for you here on this street.

315
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,340
- Sure.
- Let's go.

316
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,760
Zhan, since you're dizzy,

317
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,500
let's walk slower.

318
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,580
I should've only had one drink.

319
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,140
Oh, dear.

320
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,340
How can you ride this way?

321
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,500
Get out of my way!

322
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:31,940
Move!

323
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,380
Stop!

324
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,180
Are you seeking death?

325
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,140
Move aside!

326
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,420
In broad daylight,
do you have any respect for the law?

327
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,340
Go apologize to them.

328
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,380
(Unexpectedly,)

329
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,260
(I still ran into her.)

330
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,380
Si, don't worry.

331
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,420
I'm here for you.

332
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,500
No one

333
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,420
can throw you out.

334
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,100
I'll protect you.

335
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,820
Get out of the way! Move!

336
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,420
Stop!

337
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,260
Are you seeking death?

338
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,360
Move aside!

339
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,610
In broad daylight,
do you have any respect for the law?

340
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,580
Go apologize to them.

341
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,780
Apologize?

342
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,420
I'm a Commandery Princess!

343
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,480
I don't care who you are.

344
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,440
You injured someone,
so you need to apologize.

345
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,540
You must have a death wish.

346
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,380
Say it again.

347
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,540
You must have a death wish!

348
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,140
I'll kill you!

349
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:33,420
Wake up, Zhan!

350
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,480
(This time,)

351
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,540
(I can't let my brother)

352
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,600
(clash with Cui Mingyue.)

353
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,500
You injured someone,
so you need to apologize.

354
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,600
Otherwise, you can't leave!

355
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,440
You're seeking death!

356
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,100
It's my brother's fault.

357
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,100
I'll apologize on his behalf.

358
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,500
Your Grace, please be lenient

359
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,640
and forgive him.

360
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,580
Si, what are you saying?

361
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,420
Zhan.

362
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,820
Who are you?

363
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,420
It doesn't matter.

364
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,580
You don't need to remember me.

365
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,620
I've long heard

366
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,620
of your elegance and charm.

367
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,740
Seeing you today,

368
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,180
I think you're truly extraordinary.

369
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,820
You're a sweet talker.

370
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,180
But it's him who offended me.

371
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,580
If you want to apologize for him,

372
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:19,100
kneel and kowtow to me,

373
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,740
and I'll let you go.

374
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,700
What do you think?

375
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,100
Don't push it.

376
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,340
Exactly.

377
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,420
She's bullying them.

378
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,420
Si...

379
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,860
Your Grace,

380
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,420
sorry for our offense.

381
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,100
Please forgive us.

382
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,020
Good. You're a smart girl.

383
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,780
I'll overlook it this time.

384
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:40,580
Let's go.

385
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:46,210
How domineering!

386
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,220
How could she be like this?

387
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,180
Si, are you alright?

388
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,100
I'm fine, Zhan.

389
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,540
Why did you apologize to her?

390
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:56,660
They're both women.

391
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,660
Why the big difference?

392
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:58,980
One is unreasonable,

393
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,060
and the other is gracious

394
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,780
with extraordinary manners and beauty.

395
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,140
To me,

396
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,090
this girl is just afraid

397
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,210
of revenge on her brother

398
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,660
so she endures such humiliation.

399
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,580
It's truly admirable.

400
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,820
Are you saying

401
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,620
I'm not as good as her?

402
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,140
This...

403
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,580
Stop!

404
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,740
Stop!

405
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,420
How dare you!

406
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,020
As a Commandery Princess of Dazhou,

407
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,460
you rode without cause in the city,

408
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,340
provoking trouble.

409
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,020
You should be flogged.

410
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,920
What gives you the right to arrest me?

411
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,180
Let go!

412
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,760
I'm the Commandant of Capital Security.

413
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,660
I'll take her back.

414
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:47,900
Remember to eat it.

415
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,100
- Let go.
- Great.

416
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,100
- Great.
- Great.

417
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,100
- Great.
- Great.

418
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,500
(Court, Capital Security)

419
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,440
My daughter is ignorant.

420
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,660
Sorry, Commandant Yu.

421
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,780
I'll discipline her more strictly.

422
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,100
I won't take up any more of your time.

423
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,300
Goodbye.

424
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,780
What kind of person is this?

425
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,300
How can he arrest me?

426
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,580
I'll surely deal with you.

427
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,620
Father,

428
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,740
you're the Bulwark-general of the State.

429
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,060
Can he accept your respect?

430
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:23,860
Mingyue,

431
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,140
if you cause trouble again,

432
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:28,820
I'll have to leave you

433
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,300
to your mother.

434
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,540
Can you be more obedient?

435
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,180
I know I was wrong.

436
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,780
Father, don't be angry.

437
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,100
Come here.

438
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,660
Princess Mingyue.

439
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,100
Who are those two who offended me

440
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,100
at the door just now?

441
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,100
Your Grace,

442
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:48,960
they were

443
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,200
from the Earl Dongping's family.

444
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,060
Earl Dongping's family.

445
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,860
(Earl Dongping's Mansion)

446
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,780
Aman, listen up.

447
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,180
From today on,

448
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,500
all of my brother's meals

449
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,260
must be checked by me personally

450
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:12,140
before you deliver them to him yourself.

451
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,580
Apart from you and me,

452
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,420
no one else can handle it.

453
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,540
- Got it?
- Yes.

454
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,540
Good, no problem.

455
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,600
You can deliver it to him now.

456
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,660
Chief, did you go to Tianxiang House

457
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,620
with Jiang Si?

458
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,140
Is she the Saintess?

459
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,420
Do we need to take action?

460
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,800
She's not the Saintess.

461
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,540
Nor is she
from the Nightingale Division.

462
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,700
She doesn't even know

463
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,820
where the totem came from.

464
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,740
Is she colluding with others

465
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,420
to deceive us?

466
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,540
I believe her.

467
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:55,860
Go keep an eye on Liu Yan'er
at Tianxiang House.

468
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,460
She's from the Nightingale Division.

469
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,420
Miss.

470
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,900
Take down my sign.

471
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,620
I'm not receiving guests lately.

472
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:09,900
Yes.

473
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:23,720
Miss,

474
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,840
what would you like to drink?

475
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,800
A cup of tea, please.

476
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,740
Sure.

477
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,340
A cup of tea.

478
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:31,820
A cup of weak tea.

479
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,740
Have some tea.

480
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,580
Thank you.

481
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,790
Would you like some tea?

482
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,640
Alright.

483
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:53,580
Feel free to look around.

484
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,740
Wonton! Noodles!

485
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,100
Wonton! Noodles!

486
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,580
Fresh wonton and noodles!

487
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,300
Wonton!

488
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,060
Lots of filling with thin skin!

489
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,100
Wonton!

490
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,380
Lots of filling with thin skin!

491
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,460
Take a look!

492
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,780
Miss, take a look at this.

493
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,780
Look at this wind chime.

494
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,060
(Where is she?)

495
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,820
Freshly made ice yuanzi!

496
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,660
Take a look!

497
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,300
Freshly made ice yuanzi!

498
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,860
Come and take a look.

499
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,340
Freshly made ice yuanzi!

500
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,180
Shopkeeper.

501
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,340
Miss, what would you like to drink?

502
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,540
A bowl of ice yuanzi.

503
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,060
Sure, please wait a moment.

504
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,020
It'll be right here.

505
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,100
Here you go, ice yuanzi.

506
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,900
- Please enjoy.
- Thank you.

507
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,060
Shopkeeper,

508
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,460
do you know the Earl Dongping's Mansion

509
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,300
on this street?

510
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,540
Yes.

511
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,500
I've been doing business here for years.

512
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,380
Is there something you need?

513
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,180
No, nothing.

514
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,640
Is Earl Dongping's family

515
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,020
originally here,

516
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,620
or did they move from the south?

517
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,500
They've been here

518
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,620
for generations.

519
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,100
They're not new here.

520
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,820
Do you know their fourth young lady?

521
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,260
Miss, you're so kind.

522
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,740
There's no need for this.

523
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,060
You're talking about Jiang Si, right?

524
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,080
She often comes here

525
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,280
with her brother to buy drinks.

526
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,400
So, she was born and raised

527
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,500
in Earl Dongping's Mansion?

528
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,580
Yes, she was born and raised here.

529
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,940
Let me tell you.

530
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,820
This girl is very assertive.

531
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,120
The most popular fragrance shop

532
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,760
in Ling'an

533
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:51,940
is run by her.

534
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:52,900
What's the shop's name?

535
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,300
It's called Fragrance Shop.

536
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:59,140
(Fragrance Shop)

537
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:08,100
(Jade Bloom Aroma)

538
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,460
(Fragrance Shop)

539
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,660
I didn't expect
Zhao Yu's skill in fragrance

540
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,100
to be on par with mine.

541
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,100
Some of her formulas

542
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,660
are even mine.

543
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,300
But how would she know?

544
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,340
(She asked me about the Saintess.)

545
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,500
(Could it be that she is)

546
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,740
(the Saintess?)

547
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,620
(That's why she knows everything.)

548
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,820
(If she's the Saintess,)

549
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,020
(why would she hide her identity)

550
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,540
(from the Nightingale Division?)

551
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,660
(But the North is far away.)

552
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,020
(It'll take too long)

553
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,140
(to confirm her identity.)

554
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,900
(I need to figure it out asap.)

555
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:14,220
(Grand Princess's Mansion)

556
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,100
Yu Qi from Capital Security

557
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,980
is the 7th Prince?

558
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:19,660
Yes.

559
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,780
His Majesty doesn't know

560
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,340
he's back to Ling'an, right?

561
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,340
Yes.

562
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:28,260
If Yu Qi returns to the imperial family

563
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,540
and becomes a Prince,

564
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:32,500
it will be harder to handle.

565
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,820
We need to plan ahead.

566
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,260
Yu Qi is a Prince?

567
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,900
He defied the Emperor and came back.

568
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,580
This is a good card

569
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,740
in our hands.

570
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,740
General Cui.

571
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,060
Honey.

572
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,720
How have you been disciplining
our daughter?

573
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,740
Her arrogant temper

574
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,260
needs to be dealt with properly.

575
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,740
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

576
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,460
Mingyue was out riding
in the street today

577
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,820
and almost injured someone.

578
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,120
She refused to admit her mistake

579
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,280
and whipped innocent citizens.

580
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,880
Capital Security caught her red-handed.

581
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,140
If I hadn't intervened,

582
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,340
she would've been flogged by now.

583
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,420
Mingyue is my jewel.

584
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:19,100
Who dares to harm her?

585
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,100
Look at you.

586
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,700
(Graceful and Dignified)
Look at you.

587
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,020
It's because of your attitude

588
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,580
that she's spoiled like this.

589
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,020
What gives you the right

590
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,020
to blame me?

591
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,120
You're accusing me of spoiling Mingyue?

592
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,380
All these years,

593
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,340
have you ever cared about us?

594
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,020
Haven't you always cared

595
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:41,540
about that woman
in Earl Dongping's Mansion?

596
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,900
It's been so many years, Rongyang.

597
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,780
You always talk
about Earl Dongping's Mansion.

598
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,100
When will you be done with it?

599
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,820
Isn't it true?

600
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,300
You scared me!

601
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,100
- Your Grace.
- Lower your voice.

602
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,020
Your Grace.

603
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,820
How can you eavesdrop?

604
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,230
(Ms. Xu)
If Her Highness finds out,

605
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,220
she'll punish you!

606
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,300
Don't worry about it.

607
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,260
Let me ask you.

608
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,220
Is the woman who caused my father

609
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,020
and mother to drift apart for years

610
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,900
from Earl Dongping's Mansion?

611
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,780
I don't know.

612
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,920
Who are you trying to fool?

613
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,060
You are my mother's wet nurse.

614
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,180
What is there that you don't know?

615
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,900
Just quietly tell me.

616
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,020
I won't tell Mother.

617
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,980
Your Grace, she...

618
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,100
She's Her Highness's metal knot.

619
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,580
She...

620
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:44,980
Don't ask about it anymore.

621
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,500
Ms. Xu, if you don't tell me,

622
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,180
I'll investigate myself.

623
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,580
Your Grace...

624
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,820
That woman is already dead.

625
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,060
Dead?

626
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:13,860
Zhan,

627
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,220
how's your study
of military strategy going?

628
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,860
I've already mastered it.

629
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,180
Come on, Zhan.

630
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,100
Si,

631
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,620
I don't need medicine.

632
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,820
If you truly care about me,

633
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,740
could you let me sleep?

634
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,700
This isn't medicine; it's a supplement.

635
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,020
You need to take it before meals.

636
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,260
Breakfast will be here soon.

637
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,220
Supplement?

638
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,060
No, no.

639
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,300
You've been

640
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,660
a bit strange these days.

641
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,220
I'm totally fine.

642
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,020
Why ask the physician to check on me?

643
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,220
The physician already said

644
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,500
my health is great.

645
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,980
I'll live to 88 without any problem.

646
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,900
This prescription was given
by the physician.

647
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,260
It's not for treating any illness,

648
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,620
just to strengthen your body.

649
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,580
Zhan, I started to prepare this

650
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,580
even before the sun came out.

651
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,260
No wonder your eyes are so dark.

652
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,900
Fine, I'll drink it.

653
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,980
Drink it while it's hot.

654
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,060
It's a little bitter.

655
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,340
There are candied treats.

656
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,380
Suck on one.

657
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,100
Drink a bit more.

658
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,420
- More?
- Drink a bit more.

659
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:26,940
By the way, Zhan,

660
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,260
for this month,

661
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,660
you shouldn't leave the house.

662
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:33,660
For a month?

663
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,100
If you don't have to go out,

664
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,900
you should just stay in your chamber.

665
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,140
What?

666
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,580
Si, you're not having a fever.

667
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,320
How can you talk nonsense like this?

668
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:51,300
You want me to stay at home for a month?

669
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,620
You might as well kill me.

670
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,500
It would be quicker.

671
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,500
Stop that nonsense.

672
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,260
Stop saying such inauspicious things.

673
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,420
Touch the wood,
and it wouldn't come true.

674
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:04,180
Si, why are you angry?

675
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,500
I'm not angry.

676
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,460
Zhan.

677
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,980
Look, since childhood,

678
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,660
I've never asked you for anything,

679
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:11,500
right?

680
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,340
This time, I'm asking you.

681
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:14,500
Just one month.

682
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:15,780
During this month,

683
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:16,840
you stay at home,

684
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,420
practice martial arts with Master Qin,

685
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,500
and read military books.

686
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,360
After this month,

687
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,740
you can go anywhere you want.

688
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:23,060
I won't stop you.

689
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:28,060
But I've already been working hard.

690
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,660
Staying at home for a whole month

691
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:34,220
is really hard.

692
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,620
Zhan, you see.

693
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,880
After one month, it will be

694
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,820
the selection
for the Imperial Insignia Guard.

695
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,280
If you get selected,

696
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,620
I'll be able to marry

697
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:43,060
whoever I want

698
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,820
and won't have to suffer anymore.

699
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,060
Zhan, just do it

700
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,580
for my marriage

701
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:51,980
and my lifelong happiness.

702
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:52,820
Okay?

703
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:55,260
Just one month.

704
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,340
Okay.

705
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,340
You're the best.

706
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,540
Miss, breakfast is ready.

707
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,180
Zhan, let's have breakfast.

708
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,580
Perfect. I'm hungry.

709
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,420
By the way, Zhan,

710
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,220
I've informed Grandmother.

711
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,980
From now on, you'll have your meals

712
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,860
in your own room.

713
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,340
You don't need to join us.

714
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,380
Why?

715
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,940
Zhan, eat more eggs.

716
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:19,980
Wait...

717
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:20,900
I...

718
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:21,820
Aman.

719
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:23,940
Why?

720
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,180
Aman, lock the door.

721
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:27,140
Lock the door?

722
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,620
Come on, Si.

723
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,140
You can't do that!

724
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,860
You can't lock the door!

725
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,180
Si!

726
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:05,500
(Administrator Lin,
Zhen Heng's classmate)

727
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,420
Yan'er.

728
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,660
Sir, please have some tea.

729
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,660
What a perfect match.

730
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,060
A match made in heaven.

731
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:04,860
I'm finally out.

732
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:07,460
These days have been so boring.

733
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,860
Master Qin Feng.

734
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,780
What brings you here?

735
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,220
I've missed you so much, Master Qin.

736
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,060
Master Qin.

737
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,060
Zhan, long time no see.

738
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,060
You've grown so much.

739
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,380
I almost didn't recognize you.

740
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,460
Of course.

741
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:26,300
Now, I'm handsome, charming,

742
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,500
and dashing.

743
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,300
Ji, prepare some wine and dishes.

744
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,140
I want to have a good drink
with Master Qin.

745
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,020
Got it.

746
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,940
Master Qin, what brings you here?

747
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,320
I just returned to Ling'an,

748
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,020
and Miss Si asked me

749
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,860
to teach you martial arts every day.

750
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,940
So, from today,

751
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,340
you need to wake up at the Yin hour

752
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,340
and practice with me

753
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,660
to strengthen your body.

754
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,620
At what time?

755
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,880
At the Yin hour every day.

756
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,180
Let me think.

757
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,460
Zi, Chou, Yin...

758
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:59,020
Since Miss Si entrusted you to me,

759
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,180
I can't let her down.

760
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,980
Master Qin, you don't know...

761
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:03,900
Si, you're back.

762
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:04,740
Master Qin.

763
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,300
You brat!

764
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:07,660
You can leave,

765
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,800
but I know where to find you.

766
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,740
Thanks for today.

767
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:20,580
It's nothing.

768
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,540
We're leaving then.

769
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,540
Sure.

770
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:49,580
(Matchmaker Wang's Hall)

771
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,100
Thank you, Mrs. Zhen.

772
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,460
Miss Si, please sit.

773
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,500
Okay.

774
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:34,100
I'm only helping your sister

775
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:35,740
because of you.

776
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,020
Otherwise,

777
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,020
with her nature,

778
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,160
I wouldn't help her at all.

779
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,180
Thank you, Mrs. Zhen.

780
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,140
Thank you, Mr. Zhen.

781
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:43,900
Actually, my sister

782
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,380
was influenced by others.

783
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:46,780
She wasn't born bad.

784
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,340
One takes the color of one's company.

785
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:50,860
If she can really marry

786
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,260
Administrator Lin in the future,

787
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,340
I believe she'll change.

788
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,380
Administrator Lin

789
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:57,580
is quite picky

790
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:58,860
about marriage,

791
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:00,940
but I never expected him

792
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,220
to fall for your sister

793
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:03,620
at first sight.

794
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,980
Fate truly brings people together

795
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,260
from miles away.

796
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,580
Miss, tea is ready.

797
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:17,780
You two

798
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,780
are both

799
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,220
unmarried.

800
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:22,660
And yet, you're worrying

801
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:24,180
about someone else's marriage.

802
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,620
Why don't you think

803
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:26,860
about yourselves?

804
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:29,260
Mother.

805
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,140
Mrs. Zhen, have some tea.

806
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:34,700
Mrs. Zhen,

807
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,060
the tea today

808
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,180
is on me.

809
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:41,620
What?

810
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,420
You want to thank me

811
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:44,500
with a cup of tea?

812
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,820
It's not that easy.

813
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:50,380
Shopkeeper.

814
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:51,900
Coming.

815
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:56,220
I heard you had new tea leaves
in the backyard.

816
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,180
Take me to see it.

817
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:58,620
Please, Mrs. Zhen.

818
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:18,020
Miss Jiang.

819
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,860
How about more tea?

820
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,020
Please let me, Mr. Zhen.

821
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:21,860
It's okay.

822
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,420
Let me do it.

823
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,140
Thank you.

824
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:33,140
How is it?

825
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,020
The man I chose for you is good, right?

826
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:36,700
He looks like a gentleman,

827
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,060
but

828
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,500
he's only a 6th Rank official.

829
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,260
Our family at least has a title.

830
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:45,180
That title is just a name.

831
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:46,540
You know

832
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:47,560
the state of our family.

833
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:51,060
We might not carry such honor.

834
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,860
Though his rank isn't high,

835
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,380
he has actual power.

836
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,180
If you find the right man,

837
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,460
your later life

838
00:41:58,460 --> 00:41:59,460
is guaranteed.

839
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,620
Mother, you're not ambitious at all.

840
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:03,200
Your lineal mother is ambitious.

841
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,700
She worked hard to marry your sister

842
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,540
into that wealthy family,

843
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,100
but you know

844
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:08,940
what happened.

845
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,700
Don't ask

846
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,020
for more than fate grants you.

847
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:13,020
Don't always look

848
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:14,580
at what others have.

849
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:17,380
Pei,

850
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,180
just listen to me.

851
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,300
If you miss this marriage,

852
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,340
it will truly be gone.

853
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,660
Chief, I lost Liu Yan'er last night.

854
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:30,900
She refused to receive guests,

855
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:31,940
dressed up, and went out

856
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:33,340
to visit only common places.

857
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:34,620
Nothing special.

858
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:36,780
But she's cautious,

859
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,660
unlike an ordinary courtesan.

860
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,320
Don't follow her too closely,

861
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,500
or the effort will be in vain.

862
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:42,340
Yes.

863
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:45,700
Miss Jiang.

864
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:46,940
Miss Jiang.

865
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,300
Please stop calling me Mr. Zhen

866
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:49,780
outside the court.

867
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:52,100
It would seem distant.

868
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:53,900
Then...

869
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:55,460
Should I call you

870
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:57,540
Zhen?

871
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:58,860
That'd be great.

872
00:42:59,060 --> 00:42:59,900
Zhen.
