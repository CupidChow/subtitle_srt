11
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,480
Honey,

12
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,430
the gifts for my family

13
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,510
are almost ready.

14
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:48,430
Let's head back.

15
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:50,670
No, we need to buy more for the visit.

16
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,510
Look at this.

17
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,040
Pack some for me.

18
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,150
Alright.

19
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:07,950
Honey.

20
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,930
- Buy some candied treats for me.
- Sure.

21
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,280
I'll go check on Aman and Long Dan

22
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,360
and see how they're doing.

23
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,280
Hurry up.

24
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,590
I'll try one, okay?

25
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,510
Sure, go ahead.

26
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,280
This one.

27
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,550
Why are you back again?

28
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,000
If you continue with your plans

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,920
to harm Dazhou,

30
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,550
I will never allow it.

31
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:33,790
Greetings, Saintess.

32
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,550
How do you know?

33
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:37,850
You forged the bamboo leaf letter

34
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,140
that ordered the Nightingale

35
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,040
to return to Nanwu, right?

36
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,040
I went back and asked the Grand Elder.

37
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,560
The Grand Elder didn't write

38
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,610
that bamboo leaf letter.

39
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,080
Only the Saintess knows

40
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,460
the secret of the bamboo leaf letter

41
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,410
and can imitate her handwriting.

42
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,550
I came back this time

43
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,480
to ask you to return to Nanwu.

44
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,920
Please return to Nanwu asap.

45
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,590
I won't go with you.

46
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:58,510
I will wait for you.

47
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,780
(Grand Princess's Mansion)

48
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:12,950
(Mingyue,)

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,360
(I'd never regretted)

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,920
(what I did.)

51
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:23,040
(But I regret it now.)

52
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,510
(Why did I ask)

53
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,880
(for the marriage edict for you?)

54
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,080
(You died because of it.)

55
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,360
Mingyue,

56
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,110
I know you haven't left.

57
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,670
You're in heaven, watching over me.

58
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:56,080
Mingyue, don't worry.

59
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,550
I'll make sure to complete

60
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,760
the things you left unfinished.

61
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,440
I'll have that wretched couple

62
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,760
suffer every torment in this world

63
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,920
and then kill them

64
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,880
to join you in death.

65
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,580
(Earl Dongping's Mansion)

66
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,270
- Come on.
- Be careful.

67
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,240
This vase must be held properly.

68
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,300
Don't handle it carelessly.

69
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,190
Come on.

70
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,800
Didn't I tell you all?

71
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,980
This tea cup set

72
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,780
needs to have a celadon glaze.

73
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,860
Why is it still the same old set?

74
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,860
Prince and Princess Yan
will come back today.

75
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,260
Be sure to handle

76
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,220
everything gently.

77
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,220
- Be careful.
- Yes.

78
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,140
Look at him.

79
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,500
Grandmother,

80
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,060
Si is family.

81
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,300
She won't mind these things.

82
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,020
She's a Princess Consort now.

83
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,500
What should be done must be done.

84
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,140
The necessary rules

85
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,440
must be observed.

86
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,060
Grandmother, you're right.

87
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,260
Grandmother.

88
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,140
- Zhan.
- Father.

89
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,020
Yi.

90
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,000
Zhan.

91
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,260
It's so lively here.

92
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,540
This is for Princess Yan.

93
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,820
I'll try it on her behalf.

94
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,860
What a glutton.

95
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,980
Greetings, Grandmother.

96
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,180
Greetings, Father.

97
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,100
Good, good.

98
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,980
Grandmother, please have my tea.

99
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,260
Good.

100
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,300
Father, please have my tea.

101
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,940
From now on,

102
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,260
we are all family.

103
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,380
Thank you, Grandmother.

104
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,340
Remember to take care of each other.

105
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,820
Yes, Grandmother.

106
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,340
Don't worry

107
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,820
about anything else.

108
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,420
Just focus on the life

109
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,700
between you two.

110
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,860
That's the most important thing.

111
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,180
Good, good.

112
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,620
We've lived here for so many years,

113
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,060
but now we have to move

114
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:25,980
to the new house.

115
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,500
I'll miss it.

116
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,980
I'll miss it too.

117
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,860
But even after we leave here,

118
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,420
this place will always be our home.

119
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,620
If we ever miss home,

120
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,260
we'll just come back.

121
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,180
Si.

122
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,100
Yi.

123
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:45,740
I embroidered

124
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,960
a mandarin duck quilt for you.

125
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,860
It's a bit bigger than the one
you had before.

126
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,700
Thank you, Yi.

127
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,820
How thoughtful of you.

128
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,300
This is the first time
Prince Yan is staying here.

129
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,510
If there's anything you need,

130
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,460
just tell the butler.

131
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,860
Yi.

132
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,780
His Highness and we

133
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,780
are family now.

134
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,000
No need to be so polite.

135
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,140
I need to tell you something.

136
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,260
The Grand Princess has kept it quiet,

137
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,660
but I think

138
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,540
you should know.

139
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,540
On the day of the wedding,

140
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,660
Zhu Ziyu interrupted
the wedding procession

141
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,100
and wanted to marry Cui Mingyue.

142
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,820
On their wedding night,

143
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,340
he killed Cui Mingyue.

144
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,340
Mother...

145
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,540
He set himself on fire?

146
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,580
How could this happen?

147
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,580
Is it because

148
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,700
of what I said to him?

149
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,020
Miss,

150
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,300
Zhu Ziyu is here.

151
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,700
Yi.

152
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,380
Why are you here?

153
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,540
I came to check on Yan.

154
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,540
You've spent all the money

155
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,460
on candied treats and fruits?

156
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,380
With that marriage edict,

157
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,360
Cui Mingyue is even more reckless.

158
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,760
When Si and I were waiting

159
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,560
for Prince Yan
outside the Palace yesterday,

160
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,260
she came to threaten Si

161
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,340
that she'd do everything to torment her

162
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,340
after the wedding.

163
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,860
She's a madwoman.

164
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,220
She'd definitely do something like that.

165
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,780
She won't even spare

166
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,180
the Jiang family.

167
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,660
Back when we were in Lingshui,

168
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,460
she tried to kill you.

169
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,540
At that time, Yan and you

170
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,300
might be dragged into it.

171
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,140
If anyone dares to harm Yan

172
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,300
or Si,

173
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,180
I'll fight them to the death.

174
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,340
Zhu Ziyu has done so many things

175
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,420
to betray you.

176
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,100
But in the end, he came to his senses

177
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,740
and died protecting you.

178
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:32,940
Yi,

179
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:33,980
the dead are gone.

180
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,500
You should let go now.

181
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,340
Father, I miss you so much.

182
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,580
Yan,

183
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,340
I miss you too.

184
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,740
Father,

185
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,220
can you play with me every day
in the future?

186
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,180
I promise you

187
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,780
that from now on,

188
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,260
I'll play with you every day.

189
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,780
Shall we swing on the swing?

190
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,700
Alright.

191
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,740
- Yan, hold on tight.
- Sure.

192
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,100
Do you want to go higher?

193
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,260
Is it fun?

194
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,180
Yes.

195
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,220
Yan, hold on tight.

196
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,540
Higher.

197
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,500
Alright, hold tight.

198
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,460
Are you happy?

When did you become so polite,

216
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,660
calling me that?

217
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,560
You must not call me that.

218
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,360
You should call me Honey.

Alright, honey.

00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,460
Darling, please sit.

00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,300
Why did you take so long?

222
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,980
How's the chat with Father?

223
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,020
When you hadn't come back,

224
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,100
I thought you might've

225
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,140
lost your way back.

228
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,660
I had a wonderful time tonight.

229
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,540
They're my father

230
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,860
and my brother-in-law.

231
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,860
I'm glad you had a good time.

Your eyes are telling me

233
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,820
you're a bit sad.

00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,220
When I was packing,

235
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,540
I thought about all the years

236
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,740
I spent here,

237
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,620
and now I have to leave.

238
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,060
So, I'm having a hard time.

239
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,260
Actually,

240
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,500
I've always had a little wish

241
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,340
that I've never told you.

242
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,500
I want to live in your home.

243
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,100
Don't talk nonsense.

244
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,580
How about this?

Every now and then,

246
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,420
we can come here to reminisce

247
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,440
and stay for a few days.

248
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,140
Thank you, honey.

I almost forgot

250
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,300
I want to show you something.

262
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,700
(Grand Princess's Mansion)
I finally found out.

263
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,140
The night Jiang Si treated

264
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,380
Princess Fuqing's eyes,

265
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,700
she and Ms. Duo

266
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,380
went to the Imperial Pharmacy together.

267
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,580
It was Ms. Duo who told Jiang Si

268
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,820
which herb to take.

269
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:38,020
How dare Ms. Duo betray me?

270
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,060
At that time, Jiang Si

271
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,700
wasn't even a Princess Consort.

272
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,940
What benefits could

273
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,380
an Earl's daughter promise?

274
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,460
How could she manage

275
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,500
to buy her off from me?

276
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,580
I don't know.

277
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:53,820
You may leave.

278
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,620
Shijiu.

279
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,540
Here.

280
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,980
Any news from those sent

281
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,100
to eliminate Xiao?

282
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,060
They reported back last night.

283
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,740
They've confirmed everything.

284
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,260
It should be done soon.

285
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,700
Send someone to keep an eye on Ms. Duo.

286
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,980
As soon as she leaves the Palace,

287
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,900
find a chance to capture her.

288
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,140
Also,

289
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,940
you go and keep an eye on Jiang Si

290
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,260
and see what her relationship

291
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,700
with Nanwu really is.

292
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,340
Understood.

293
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,180
Uncle Anmou is really clever.

294
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,620
He wrote a letter

295
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,780
and put it in the gifts

296
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,700
we brought back.

297
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,380
What did it say?

298
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,660
Just some

299
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,300
formal and flattering wishes.

300
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,460
In the end, it suggests

301
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,620
that family members
should help each other.

302
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,860
He wants you to speak well of him

303
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,420
in front of the Emperor,

304
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,580
so he can get promoted.

305
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,660
Ms. Xiao

306
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,180
used to treat us so poorly.

307
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,540
How could he still say that?

308
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,420
He couldn't talk to us directly,

309
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,620
so he wrote it in the letter.

310
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,660
What's wrong?

311
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,780
The Grand Princess's men

312
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,180
are following closer.

313
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,300
Has she started to suspect my identity?

314
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,900
We must be even more cautious.

315
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,580
The Grand Princess is about to move,

316
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,860
so Xiao and Ms. Duo

317
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,820
must be in danger.

318
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,220
We need to protect them.

319
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,300
Let's head back first.

320
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:27,940
Qian,

321
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,060
can you adapt to the life

322
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:29,940
in the countryside?

323
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,860
Sure.

324
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,300
Though the farm life

325
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,460
is harder than our life

326
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,900
back at the mansion,

327
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,100
it's much more peaceful.

328
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,380
As long as I'm with you,

329
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,700
I'm happy no matter where I am.

330
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,060
Brother also sent word

331
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,540
that he'll visit us in a few days.

332
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,460
Come on.

333
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,860
Alright, you got water on my face.

334
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,060
Sir, who are you?

335
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:58,820
Qian,

336
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,560
they're sent by the Grand Princess.

337
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:01,980
Run!

338
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,860
By order of Her Highness,
leave no survivors.

339
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:09,060
Qian,

340
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,140
- hurry
- Open the door.

341
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,220
through the back door.

342
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,100
I won't.

343
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,060
We should run together.

344
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,100
The two of us can't escape together.

345
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,660
I won't leave. Mother, I won't.

346
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,580
Run!

347
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,340
Mother!

348
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,220
Mother...

349
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:45,780
Mother!

350
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,260
Mother...

351
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,780
Qian, don't cry.

352
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,260
I can't move anymore.

353
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,480
It seems like I can't stay
with you anymore.

354
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,420
Mother, you'll be fine.

355
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,420
We'll go back
to Earl Dongping's Mansion.

356
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,100
You'll be fine, Mother.

357
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,780
Mother...

358
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,020
I've done many wrong things.

359
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,540
This is

360
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,060
my punishment.

361
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,340
Qian,

362
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,420
after you return to the mansion,

363
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,740
tell your uncle and Jiang Si

364
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,820
that I can never repay

365
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,180
my debt to them.

366
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,820
Mother, I...

367
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,380
In my next life,

368
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,140
I'll do everything I can

369
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,540
to repay their kindness.

370
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,220
Mother, you can't die.

371
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,660
You can't leave me.

372
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,180
Don't leave me.

373
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,100
Captain Xie,

374
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,380
please send Qian

375
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,420
back to Earl Dongping's Mansion.

376
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,660
Mother, don't die. Mother.

377
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,420
Don't leave me.

378
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,740
We've arrived at Ling'an.

379
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,260
You're safe now.

380
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:52,780
(Prince Yan's Mansion)

381
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,300
Qian.

382
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,820
Si.

383
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,820
Si.

384
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:15,780
Qian,

385
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:16,980
where's Aunt Xiao?

386
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,060
She passed away.

387
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,380
They killed her

388
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,220
in front of me.

389
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,580
How could that be?

390
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,560
It was the Grand Princess's Iron Guard.

391
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,860
I've failed your trust.

392
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,340
I arrived too late.

393
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,060
I could only save Ms. Jiang Qian.

394
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,140
It's all my fault.

395
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,900
If I had noticed earlier...

396
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,820
It's not your fault.

397
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,020
Mother died

398
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:44,940
to save me.

399
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,580
I'll make the Grand Princess

400
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,580
pay for it.

401
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,220
Aman,

402
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,780
take Qian to rest inside.

403
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,700
Yes.

404
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,340
Miss.

405
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,500
By the way,

406
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,620
before Mother passed away,

407
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,860
she wanted me to tell you

408
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,260
that she regretted what she did

409
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,580
and hoped you could forgive her.

410
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,340
(It was too late.)

411
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,440
(My identity will eventually
be exposed.)

412
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,020
(I need to think of a plan.)

413
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,380
(Otherwise, my family)

414
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,420
(might be dragged into it
because of me.)

415
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:28,700
(Earl Dongping's Mansion)

416
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,020
Mother.

417
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,300
Mother, you...

418
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,340
Greetings, Princess Yan.

419
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,140
Mother,

420
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,340
you sent someone to call me back.

421
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,700
Is there something urgent?

422
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,020
He's here.

423
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,500
Princess Yan, you wanted to see me?

424
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,340
Uncle Anmou,

425
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,060
I recently heard

426
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,420
you've been telling people

427
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,180
that Prince Yan is your son-in-law.

428
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,380
What are you up to?

429
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,980
What's wrong with that?

430
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:13,820
He's my nephew-in-law after all.

431
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,300
Right, Ancheng?

432
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,300
I've warned you many times.

433
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,180
You can't use Prince Yan's name

434
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,260
to spread rumors outside.

435
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,220
The political world is complicated.

436
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,540
Talking too much will be bad for them.

437
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,580
Mother,

438
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,940
even if I hadn't said that...

439
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,580
Si and your brother are right.

440
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,900
Anmou,

441
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,620
this was a foolish thing to do.

442
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,860
As Si married Prince Yan,

443
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,140
your every word and deed

444
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,220
may be seen by others

445
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,220
as related to Prince Yan.

446
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,300
Go apologize to Prince Yan,

447
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,300
and don't let it happen again.

448
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,140
Yes.

449
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,260
Uncle Anmou,

450
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:58,220
what is this letter about?

451
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,540
What letter?

452
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,340
Anmou.

453
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,580
No, this letter...

454
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,120
Si, now that you've become

455
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,800
Princess Yan,

456
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,500
have you lost all respect
for your elders?

457
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,420
Uncle Anmou,

458
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,900
do you think it's appropriate

459
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:17,860
to pass me this letter?

460
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:18,780
What's wrong with that?

461
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:19,700
Enough.

462
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,180
Anmou,

463
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:23,580
you asked Prince Yan to help you.

464
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,580
This is what you deserve.

465
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,860
Si,

466
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,140
actually, your uncle

467
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,220
is not a man driven

468
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,620
by greed for fame or wealth.

469
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:36,300
I think this was
just an unintended mistake.

470
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,980
I only want what's best for our family.

471
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,180
Stop it.

472
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,500
Today,

473
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,820
you already scolded him

474
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,260
in front of everyone.

475
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:48,100
Why not let it go?

476
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,900
Can you do that for me?

477
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,420
Grandmother, do you think

478
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:52,500
this is a small matter?

479
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,660
Did you encourage Uncle Anmou

480
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,820
to beg me

481
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:59,420
for an official position?

482
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,540
Of course not.

483
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,100
Then what do you mean, Uncle Anmou?

484
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,220
Si,

485
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,300
how can you talk
to your grandmother like this?

486
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:08,780
Have you gone too far?

487
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,380
You're a Princess Consort
and our family,

488
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,420
so we respect you,

489
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,820
but we won't beg you

490
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,180
or be afraid of you.

491
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,900
If you still remember

492
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,220
our teachings and kindness,

493
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,180
you should be mediating

494
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,580
for your uncle

495
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,820
even if he didn't

496
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,220
ask for it.

497
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,140
Mediate for him?

498
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,460
Uncle Anmou, ask yourself.

499
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,100
What has your family done

500
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:31,980
for my family

501
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,100
all these years?

502
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,500
Your wife

503
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,620
killed my mother.

504
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,860
Your daughter knew

505
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,680
that her husband was violent

506
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,040
but still sent me into his grasp.

507
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,020
What about you?

508
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,660
Have you ever respected my father?

509
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,520
Have you ever cared

510
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,500
about my siblings and me?

511
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,350
Now, you claim

512
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,460
we're family and want to smooth it over.

513
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,580
It's too late.

514
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,900
How impudent!

515
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:51,620
Mother...

516
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,280
Being a Princess Consort
doesn't give you

517
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,900
the right to do whatever you want.

518
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,780
However wrong your uncle is,

519
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:01,460
he's still your father's brother.

520
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,140
How can you

521
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,980
step on his dignity

522
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,260
and scold him like this?

523
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,420
I'm not dead yet.

524
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,060
Grandmother,

525
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:11,820
for all these years,

526
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,540
I've always felt
that you favored Uncle Anmou

527
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,820
and his family

528
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,900
because he's an official

529
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,940
and you're relying on him

530
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,140
to support the family.

531
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,340
But now, I see that's not it at all.

532
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,180
You simply favor him

533
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,060
without reason.

534
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,420
You like Uncle Anmou

535
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,580
more than you like my father.

536
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:31,580
Today, you'd rather offend
a Princess Consort

537
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,220
than speak out for him.

538
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,380
Xiao was right.

539
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,140
My mother's death

540
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:38,980
is also related

541
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,020
to you two.

542
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,140
You're the most selfish

543
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,140
mother and son in this world.

544
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,660
- You...
- Fine.

545
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:47,980
Then I'll wish you two live in harmony.

546
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:54,820
Oh, my deceased husband...

547
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,220
- Mother.
- How could our family

548
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,720
have such a granddaughter?

549
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,660
Mother, get up.

550
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,720
You can't kneel.

551
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,620
Get up, Mother.

552
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:03,900
Mother.

553
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:08,940
Ancheng, Ancheng.

554
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,460
This is your good daughter

555
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:14,900
whom you've raised for many years.

556
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:18,180
Si, stop talking.

557
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,460
Father, if you want,

558
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,420
come with me to Prince Yan's Mansion.

559
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:23,900
From now on,

560
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,940
we can live separately,

561
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,980
and we'll have nothing to do

562
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,180
with them.

563
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,940
You're being unfilial.

564
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,780
You're giving up our family.

565
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:34,980
Ancheng,

566
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,820
you can't go with her.

567
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,140
Jiang Ancheng,

568
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,900
are you really going to leave here

569
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:46,100
and your mother

570
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:51,060
to enjoy fame and fortune?

571
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:56,460
Mother, I won't go.

572
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,100
Si,

573
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,620
you were raised here.

574
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,780
Without your grandmother,

575
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:02,900
how would you exist?

576
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,020
Why do you have

577
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,620
to make this decision so decisively?

578
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,700
How could you go this far?

579
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,580
I will never forget

580
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,560
how you treated me before.

581
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,980
Now that I'm married,

582
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,180
I don't want to be bound

583
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,780
by you guys anymore.

584
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,700
You're just

585
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:40,100
an ignorant

586
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,380
and ungrateful girl.

587
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,220
I don't have a granddaughter like you.

588
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,700
I've long had enough

589
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,380
of having you as my grandmother.

590
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,760
As things have come to this,

591
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,400
go fetch the family seal.

592
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,180
Let's write the Letter
of Disownment today.

593
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,180
As you wish.

594
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,340
Go fetch the family seal.

595
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,620
Don't.

596
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,860
It's not necessary.

597
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,140
Fu.

598
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,300
(Grandmother, Father.)

599
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,660
(Sorry.)

600
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,620
(I have no choice.)

601
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:24,940
Stop.

602
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,160
(Changning Palace)
By the Empress's command,

603
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,260
I need to go

604
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,560
to Qingyin Temple to pray
on the 15th day of every month.

605
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,500
Go then.

606
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,420
I've met the Saintess.

607
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,860
She won't return with me to Nanwu.

608
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,300
She's become Princess Yan,

609
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,980
deeply in love with Prince Yan.

610
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,640
How could she bear to part?

611
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,800
Prince Yan is the Commander
of Chiyu Cavalry.

612
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,980
If war breaks out at the border,

613
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,940
he will have to go back.

614
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,580
And Princess Yan will follow.

615
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,460
Once they reach our territory,

616
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,700
it will be much easier to bring

617
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,220
the Saintess back to Nanwu.

618
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,780
I'll inform the Grand Elder.

619
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,020
This pattern looks strange.

620
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,980
Could it be hiding some secret?

621
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:36,020
Does it resemble Nanwu's Flame Totem?

622
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:39,940
Could Jiang Si be from Nanwu?

623
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,660
That's impossible.

624
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,810
Su Ke gave birth to her in Ling'an,

625
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:47,940
and Jiang Si was raised in Ling'an.

626
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,660
Go and ask our informants

627
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,580
about the origin

628
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,700
of this totem.

629
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:57,940
Yes.

630
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,460
Earlier, you said

631
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,500
our people

632
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,180
found Ms. Duo

633
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:03,500
at Qingyin Temple.

634
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,140
Keep an eye on her.

635
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,020
Get her back to see me asap.

636
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:07,940
Yes.

637
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,180
What do you want?

638
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,020
This is the imperial carriage.

639
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,180
Ms. Duo, the Grand Princess
wants to see you.

640
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:24,820
Come with us.

641
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,220
Chase!

642
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,060
Stop.

643
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,140
Don't run.

644
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,060
Stop.

645
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,060
Wait.

646
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,540
What's going on?

647
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,580
We're about to enter the city.

648
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,740
We can't go together.

649
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,980
The Grand Princess sent the Iron Guard
to deal with you.

650
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,340
Returning to the Palace
would be like walking into a trap.

651
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:08,220
Why not stay outside?

652
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,500
The Grand Princess will at least

653
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:11,500
have some reservations
at the Empress's Palace.

654
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:12,860
But if I'm outside the city,

655
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,140
she can act with impunity.

656
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:16,270
I have something important

657
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,220
in Changning Palace.

658
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,740
I must return to retrieve it.

659
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:20,980
Be careful.

660
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,660
How was it?

661
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:28,900
It was fine.

662
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,620
They didn't catch Ms. Duo.

663
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,460
That's good.

664
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,060
Thankfully, you had Long Dan

665
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,140
follow her.

666
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,740
I heard from Aman today

667
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:37,740
that you went back home.

668
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,640
Why did you have a fight?

669
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,220
Did Grandmother give you a hard time?

670
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,680
It's I who gave her a hard time.

671
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,220
Why?

672
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,660
You care the most about your family.

673
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,140
The Letter of Disownment

674
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,740
needs the seal of Capital Security
to be valid.

675
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:04,540
Got it.

676
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,740
You don't care about that place

677
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,420
but the people there.

678
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,220
As long as the people you love are safe,

679
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,140
they'll still be with you.

680
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:25,500
(Prince Yan's Mansion)

681
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,020
Your Highnesses,

682
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,460
you're finally back.

683
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,680
Ms. Jiang Yi
and Young Master Zhan are here.

684
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,820
Si,

685
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:42,020
why did you sever ties with the family?

686
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,740
We've hated Uncle Anmou for a long time.

687
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,100
It's not worth getting so upset

688
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:45,820
over him.

689
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,620
If you want to vent,

690
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,020
let me beat him up for you.

691
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,980
Don't sever ties with me.

692
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,340
Yu,

693
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,700
speak for me.

694
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:02,900
Zhan.

695
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,340
Si, what's going on?

696
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,820
Tell me.

697
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:18,900
I've made up my mind.

698
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,060
If you want,

699
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,460
you'll still be my brother and sister.

700
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:23,860
But that mansion

701
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:25,900
is no longer my home.

702
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,580
From now on,

703
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,100
this place is my only home.

704
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,340
What do you mean?

705
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,460
Si,

706
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,500
is there something you're hiding?

707
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,380
There's no one else here,
only me and Zhan.

708
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,140
You can tell us.

709
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,300
She's not hiding anything.

710
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,820
Before, in your house,

711
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,700
she had to endure and suffer.

712
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,380
Now that she's married me,

713
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,860
she doesn't have to endure anymore.

714
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,700
But I can assure you

715
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,420
I will take good care of her.

716
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,260
I grew up with my sister.

717
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,540
No one understands better than I do

718
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,380
what hardships and suffering

719
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,660
she has endured.

720
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,100
She suffered enough in your house,

721
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:09,740
didn't she?

722
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,560
She's my sister.

723
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,880
I don't care about your opinion.

724
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,140
Jiang Zhan, this is my mansion.

725
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,500
Your nobility won't intimidate me!

726
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,420
Zhan!

727
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:16,620
Let go.

728
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:31,780
In that case,

729
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,300
we won't disturb you any longer.

730
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,140
Si,

731
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,140
I won't believe a word

732
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,340
of what you said tonight.

733
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,600
I only believe in the sister

734
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,420
I know and understand.

735
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:47,620
You said you weren't hiding anything,

736
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,860
but I don't believe it.

737
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,420
Maybe you think it's too grave

738
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,260
for us to bear.

739
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,540
Or maybe you think

740
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,660
we can't help you.

741
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,140
But no matter what,

742
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,220
I won't force you to tell us.

743
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,540
Just remember:

744
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,460
Even if you've written
the Letter of Disownment,

745
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,300
we will always be your family.

746
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,300
This door will always be open for you.

747
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,420
Yi,

748
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,100
how is Father?

749
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:32,300
Father sent us here.

750
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:22,740
I understand.

751
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,220
Once this is over,

752
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:28,940
I'll go home with you.

753
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,420
Your Highness,

754
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,020
we've searched everywhere in the Palace

755
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,420
but still can't find Ms. Duo.

756
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,570
I truly underestimated her.

757
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,820
As long as the Empress

758
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,980
and Fuqing don't come forward
as witnesses,

759
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,700
Ms. Duo can't stir up any trouble.

760
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:14,700
(Mingyue,)

761
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:16,620
(I won't let go)

762
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,940
(of anyone who harmed you.)

763
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:23,980
(Peace and Prosperity)

764
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,180
Your Highness,

765
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:37,920
I have something to say.

766
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,340
You may leave now.

767
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:42,540
Yes.

768
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,580
Stand up.

769
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,460
I'm guilty.

770
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:53,100
I'm the one who blinded Princess Fuqing

771
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,820
and killed the late Empress.

772
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,340
You already knew?

773
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:06,980
During Princess Yan's investigation,

774
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,180
she suspected you and Ms. Hua.

775
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,660
Moreover,

776
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:12,900
when Princess Yan helped Fuqing

777
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,180
remove the poison,

778
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,900
she specifically invited you along.

779
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,820
So, I was sure

780
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:21,380
you were the one who planted the worm.

781
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,780
If that's the case,

782
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,100
why didn't you expose me?

783
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:27,300
I believe in Princess Yan.

784
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:30,060
She must have a reason

785
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:31,820
to keep you here.

786
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:34,220
Actually, ten years ago,

787
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,580
the night you took action,

788
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,300
I wasn't asleep.

789
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,940
I heard you say,

790
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,300
"Your Highness,"

791
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,260
"only if you can't see anything"

792
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,340
"can you save your life."

793
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,500
Your Highness, you already knew.

794
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:56,580
Princess Fuqing,

795
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,100
Your Highness,

796
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,420
you are too kind

797
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,260
to end well

798
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,540
in this cold palace.

799
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,340
You're a spy here,

800
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:09,060
always looking indifferent,

801
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,820
but I know

802
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,140
you have some genuine feelings

803
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,660
for me and Fuqing.

804
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,340
Your Highness,

805
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,500
I've wronged you and the Princess.

806
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,060
You are

807
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:25,180
a knife of the Grand Princess

808
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,340
but also a proof of her crimes.

809
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:29,860
Ms. Duo,

810
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,220
the Crown Princess is my niece.

811
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:33,820
You can trust her.

812
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:35,860
I can send her

813
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,180
to help you hide outside the Palace.

814
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:39,740
Your Highness,

815
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,020
if Ms. Duo

816
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,300
can return to the Palace today,

817
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,300
could you arrange for her to go

818
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:45,780
to Crown Prince's Mansion to hide?

819
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,140
Why?

820
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,680
The Crown Prince and the Grand Princess

821
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,920
are on the same side.

822
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:51,620
Even if the Grand Princess

823
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:53,260
searches the entire Ling'an,

824
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,940
she wouldn't think to check there.

825
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,820
Even if she finds out

826
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:58,160
that the Crown Prince hid Ms. Duo,

827
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:59,540
she will hesitate.

828
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,800
(Peace and Prosperity)
There's another reason

829
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:03,300
for the Crown Prince to meet Ms. Duo.

830
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,300
It will allow Ms. Duo

831
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,300
to tell the Crown Prince

832
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,660
that the Grand Princess
killed the late Empress.

833
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,260
He colluded with his mortal enemy

834
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,700
because he thought the Grand Princess

835
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,900
was sincere to him.

836
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,500
If he learns the truth,

837
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:14,660
I believe

838
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,040
he'll grow distant
from the Grand Princess.

839
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:25,340
(Crown Prince's Mansion)

840
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:41,620
Come here.

841
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,500
Your Highness,

842
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:53,780
I've found out

843
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:54,800
the origin of this totem.

844
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:55,980
It's the unique symbol

845
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:56,900
of Nanwu's Saintess.

846
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,060
What?

847
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:00,700
Nanwu's Saintess?

848
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,180
No wonder Jiang Si

849
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,300
could detoxify the Slumber Flower,

850
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,700
cure Fuqing's eyes,

851
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:12,980
and make Ms. Duo betray me.

852
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:14,980
This is Nanwu's secret.

853
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:16,900
I've asked our informants,

854
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:18,260
and finally,

855
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:19,500
from a captured Nanwu general,

856
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,460
I learned that anyone

857
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,460
with this mark

858
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:23,460
is someone extraordinary from Nanwu.

859
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,260
He also said

860
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,640
that the Flame Totem becomes darker

861
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:27,700
the closer it is to fire.

862
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,180
You can determine if it's real
based on this.

863
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,860
The Flame Totem...

864
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:41,540
This show is

865
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:44,340
getting more and more interesting.

866
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:54,940
Aman,

867
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,580
deliver this letter to Consort Xian.

868
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:57,980
This is urgent.

869
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,100
Go now.

870
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,420
Sure.

871
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:03,980
(Grand Princess's Mansion)

872
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,420
Your Highness,
Prince Qi requests to see you.

873
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:10,740
I'm Yu Zhang. Greetings, Aunt.

874
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:12,260
You hardly

875
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:14,020
pay me a visit.

876
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:16,420
I've been thinking about you,

877
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,980
but I couldn't find a good reason

878
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:20,140
to come and visit.

879
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,740
So, what's the reason now?

880
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,460
Aunt, are you searching

881
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,020
for Ms. Duo?

882
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:30,900
I know where she is.

883
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,740
Are you using Ms. Duo

884
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:36,020
to gain favor?

885
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,460
Ms. Duo is now hiding

886
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:40,820
in Crown Prince's Mansion.

887
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:49,580
Though Ms. Duo always covers her face

888
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:50,500
when she comes here,

889
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,300
there are still traces.

890
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:56,500
How dare you keep an eye
on my mansion?

891
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:01,180
