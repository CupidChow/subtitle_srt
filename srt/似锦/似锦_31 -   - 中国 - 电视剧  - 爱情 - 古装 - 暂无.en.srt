(Grand Princess's Mansion)

12
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,020
Your Highness,

13
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:46,750
Prince Yan went

14
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:47,940
to the Astronomy again today,

15
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:48,900
using another excuse.

16
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,820
Let him investigate.

17
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,020
All the evidence
was destroyed back then.

18
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,340
He's just wasting his time.

19
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:02,940
I understand,

20
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:04,980
but what's strange is

21
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,700
that halfway through the files,

22
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,660
Prince Yan secretly ran

23
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,260
to the back garden

24
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:10,980
and dug up a tree.

25
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,520
Why would he dig up a tree?

26
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,160
There was a jar of wine
buried beneath it.

27
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,700
I've worked at the Astronomy

28
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,740
for so many years,

29
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,500
yet I never knew

30
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,900
there was wine buried there.

31
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,060
I'm worried that inside that jar,

32
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:23,980
instead of wine,

33
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,260
there might be evidence.

34
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,340
If Prince Yan finds out...

35
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,540
Well...

36
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,100
Did someone else know

37
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,820
about what happened back then?

38
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,440
Your Highness, rest assured.

39
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,540
Mr. Chu and Mr. Xiao

40
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,460
have been dealt with.

41
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,620
Now, only you and I

42
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,860
know the truth.

43
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,620
Since that's the case,

44
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,820
if Prince Yan finds out anything,

45
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,780
it means you betrayed me.

46
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,980
I'd never dare betray you.

47
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,860
I'll believe you for now.

48
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:03,940
This is an antidote.

49
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,140
Apply it to your wound,

50
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,060
and you'll be fine.

51
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,100
Thank you, Miss.

52
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,220
Then...

53
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,300
Your Highness, Miss,

54
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,860
shall I escort you out?

55
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,380
No need, I know the way.

56
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,460
You may leave.

57
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,000
Did you really poison her?

58
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,080
Of course not.

59
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,140
I just scared her a little.

60
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,940
I only sprinkled some pollen

61
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,540
on her wound

62
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,660
to make it itch.

63
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,380
Where's the antidote from then?

64
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,700
That was just a scented pill.

65
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:31,820
I couldn't admit

66
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:32,940
there was no poison,

67
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,520
or how would I trick her in the future?

68
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,980
This way, they'll think twice

69
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,180
before coming after you again.

70
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,460
Brilliant, two birds with one stone.

71
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,180
Why hasn't the mentor

72
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,800
(Peace and Prosperity)
my parents invited

73
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,800
arrived here?

74
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,420
I've been waiting
for an incense stick of time.

75
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,380
The new mentor has official duties

76
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,960
and is taking time out to teach you.

77
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,660
Your Highness, please be patient.

78
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:00,530
Shh.

79
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,460
Someone's coming.

80
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,540
I'm Zhen Heng.
Greetings, Princess Fuqing.

81
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,500
On, it's Mr. Zhen.

82
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,820
You're my new mentor?

83
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,340
I'm not knowledgeable enough,

84
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,980
but I will dedicate
my lifelong knowledge

85
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,620
to honor the trust of His Majesty

86
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,840
and Her Highness.

87
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:20,900
Mr. Zhen, have a seat.

88
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,580
Thank you.

89
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,260
His Majesty ordered me to teach you,

90
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,320
but he did not specify what to teach.

91
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,180
Today, I brought the Four Books
and Five Classics,

92
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,820
Shiji, Zhenguan Zhengyao,

93
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,740
and Lüshi Chunqiu.

94
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,420
Mr. Zhen, you truly are

95
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,180
sharing everything you have.

96
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,460
It's my honor to teach you.

97
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,380
I pulled these

98
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,260
one by one from the mountains.

99
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:06,900
Jiang Zhan,

100
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,460
do you have a grudge against me?

101
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,780
Chuchu, do you know
how to make fragrance?

102
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,020
I've seen my sister do it.

103
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:14,980
It looked simple.

104
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,460
But when I try,

105
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,900
I realize I can't make anything.

106
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,860
I'll take you to apply some medicine.

107
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,980
No need.

108
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,940
What exactly happened?

109
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:35,860
Nothing.

110
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,460
Last time, when Jiang Si recovered,

111
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,140
I knew you had
family matters to discuss,

112
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,220
so I didn't ask much.

113
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,300
Did something else happen afterward?

114
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,220
I promised my father

115
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,540
that I wouldn't say

116
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,020
or do anything.

117
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,380
So, you feel stifled?

118
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,300
No.

119
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,780
Are you stupid?

120
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,620
If you need to vent, why pick something

121
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,720
you're bad at?

122
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,420
Won't that make your feel worse?

123
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,380
Besides,

124
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,060
you ruined my precious fragrances.

125
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,100
Look at my hands.

126
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,220
Don't you feel sorry for me?

127
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,340
Why do you have so many wounds?

128
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,580
Let me apply some medicine for you.

129
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,220
In the martial world,

130
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,700
these small wounds are nothing.

131
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,860
Come on, I'll take you somewhere.

132
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,460
I'm not going.

133
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,660
It'll be fun.

134
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,740
You look so down.

135
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,980
I have to help you relax.

136
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,100
It'll make you feel better.

137
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,300
Besides,

138
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,340
we're so close.

139
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,300
Even if we're just siblings,

140
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,900
you should've still told me.

141
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,900
Actually, the poison
Aunt Xiao gave to Si

142
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,800
was ordered by the Grand Princess.

143
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,300
I always thought my mother
died of illness,

144
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,980
but she was poisoned by Her Highness.

145
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:10,700
So much has happened,

146
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,700
yet I brought you here to grill fish.

147
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,820
I'm sorry.

148
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,980
What should we do next?

149
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,020
I told you because I didn't want
to hide it from you,

150
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:25,840
but I will never let you

151
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,900
take this risk with me.

152
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,140
How can that be?

153
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,460
Is there really nothing I can do?

154
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,740
You've done so much for me.

155
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,100
This is just the beginning.

156
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,020
- I...
- Come with me.

157
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,660
- What for?
- Let's go.

158
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,740

May you be blessed.

169
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:36,060
No need for such formalities.

170
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,420
(Sunshine and Luxury)
I'm delighted

171
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,540
that you came to see me.

172
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,740
Please, have a seat.

173
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:42,900
Thank you, Your Highness.

174
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,860
Prince Yan and Miss Jiang

175
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,740
truly make a perfect couple.

176
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,820
Even I find it a pleasing sight.

177
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:54,300
It has been too long
since the last joyous occasion.

178
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,140
We should have a grand celebration.

179
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,340
Your Highness, you flatter us.

180
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,860
Your Highness,

181
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,860
this is from the banquet that day...

182
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,780
Yes.

183
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,980
I was fond of this exquisiteness,

184
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,620
so I asked Ms. Duo

185
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,100
to bring the Spring Amidst Trees

186
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,500
back to Changning Palace,

187
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,580
hoping for good fortune.

188
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,260
Princess Fuqing is here.

189
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,540
Your Highness, mind the threshold.

190
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,380
Ms. Hua,

191
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,060
you don't have to remind me
every time.

192
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,140
I've stepped over this

193
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,300
countless times.

194
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,220
Fuqing,

195
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,580
your brother

196
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,620
and his future wife are here.

197
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,060
Come and greet them.

198
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,860
Fuqing.

199
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,620
I'm Jiang Si.
Greetings, Princess Fuqing.

200
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,260
Greetings, Jin.

201
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,220
Greetings, Miss Jiang.

202
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,820
Miss Jiang prepared

203
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,100
this fragrance for you.

204
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,660
She hopes you like it.

205
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,820
Your Highness, please give it a try.

206
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,180
It smells wonderful.

207
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,380
Thank you, Miss Jiang.

208
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,740
I wish you and Jin
a lifetime of happiness.

209
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,820
You're welcome.

210
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,140
Here.

211
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,500
Your Highness,

212
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,300
may I ask about the Princess's
eye condition?

213
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,780
Miss Jiang, you don't know this.

214
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,260
When Fuqing was young,

215
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,580
she watched the fireworks
with the Emperor

216
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,420
and was hurt by a sky lantern.

217
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:32,900
May Dazhou

218
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:36,140
be prosperous and peaceful.

219
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,840
May Dazhou

220
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,060
be prosperous and peaceful.

221
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,580
After the sky lanterns,

222
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,020
when I woke up the next day,

223
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,460
I suddenly

224
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,780
couldn't see anymore.

225
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,660
Your Highness,

226
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,180
I have a request.

227
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,340
What is it?

228
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,380
My father is only an Earl,

229
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,580
and I'm unfamiliar

230
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,500
with palace etiquette.

231
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,780
Your Highness, please allow me

232
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,420
to learn from you

233
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,820
at Changning Palace,

234
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,740
so I won't make mistakes

235
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,420
during the wedding ceremony.

236
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,680
That is not appropriate.

237
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,260
Mother,

238
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,780
Jin is the son of Consort Xian.

239
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,300
By tradition and etiquette,

240
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,780
Miss Jiang should learn

241
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,820
from Consort Xian.

242
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,820
To be honest,

243
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,380
yesterday, I had a disagreement

244
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,620
with Consort Xian in Jinhua Hall.

245
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,060
She will not guide me

246
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,460
with sincerity.

247
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,220
You're the head of the harem,

248
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,700
the lineal mother of all Princes.

249
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,020
If I could learn from you

250
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,300
at Changning Palace,

251
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,900
Consort Xian would have

252
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,060
no grounds for complaint.

253
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,540
I only need three days.

254
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,860
Just three days.

255
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,100
Please, Your Highness.

256
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,860
Mother, Consort Xian is domineering.

257
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,820
- I fear...
- Fuqing.

258
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,020
Since Miss Jiang has made this request,

259
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,020
I shall grant it

260
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,380
as a wedding gift to them.

261
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,140
Miss Jiang,

262
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,740
you may study etiquette
at Changning Palace

263
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,900
for three days.

264
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,260
Thank you, Your Highness.

265
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,140
Slow down.

266
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:13,340
(Blessings and Clarity)

267
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,480
Why did you suddenly decide

268
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,560
to study palace etiquette?

269
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:16,940
It was too urgent

270
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,100
to discuss it with you.

271
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,180
Then tell me. What's going on?

272
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,500
Princess Fuqing's eye condition

273
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,700
is likely caused by Nanwu's gu worms.

274
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:24,620
Are you sure?

275
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,540
Pretty much.

276
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,700
I'm thinking

277
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,500
that following
the Princess's eye condition,

278
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:29,740
we might be able

279
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,380
to find the Nanwu woman

280
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,300
hidden in the Palace.

281
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,900
His Majesty has always favored

282
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,020
the Grand Princess.

283
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,500
The only way we can be truly safe

284
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,020
is by obtaining proof

285
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,680
that she's colluded with Nanwu.

286
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,740
Princess Fuqing is

287
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,780
clearly a kind and reasonable girl.

288
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,220
She's so young, yet unable to see.

289
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,580
If we can cure her eyes,

290
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,300
that'd be a good deed.

291
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,300
Don't worry.

292
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,180
It's just three days, okay?

293
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,300
Fine.

294
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,100
I'll pick you up in three days.

295
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,060
Your Highness,

296
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:06,620
may I ask if the mole
near the Princess's eye

297
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,460
was there since birth,

298
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,020
or if it appeared

299
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,040
after she lost her sight?

300
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,740
Fuqing was born

301
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,820
without a mole near her eye.

302
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:16,800
Now that you mention it,

303
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,540
that mole

304
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,900
only appeared

305
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,980
after she became blind.

306
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,980
Was its color light

307
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,500
at first,

308
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,540
but it deepened over the years?

309
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,620
Yes.

310
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,900
But isn't that how all moles are?

311
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:35,940
That's why

312
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,220
a small mole like that

313
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,260
wouldn't raise suspicion.

314
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,020
Everyone, leave us.

315
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,260
What do you mean?

316
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,940
Is Fuqing's mole

317
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,020
related to her blindness?

318
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,300
I once read in an ancient text

319
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:08,980
about a Mang Worm

320
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,700
that can reside in people's eyes,

321
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,300
blocking their meridians

322
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,420
and sealing their vision,

323
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,900
plunging them into eternal darkness.

324
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,420
The "mole" near the Princess's eye

325
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,460
isn't a mole.

326
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,660
It's a worm cyst.

327
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,900
A worm cyst?

328
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,140
So, my daughter's blindness

329
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,540
wasn't caused

330
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,340
by the light of the sky lanterns?

331
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,700
Did the Mang Worm

332
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,580
reside in Fuqing's eye

333
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,620
on its own?

334
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,140
These worms require careful cultivation

335
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,140
to survive inside a human eye.

336
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,300
Are you saying

337
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,100
someone deliberately tried

338
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,540
to blind Fuqing?

339
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:42,980
Yes.

340
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,860
Since the day I entered the Palace,

341
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,300
I've never envied nor resented anyone.

342
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,380
I've never made enemies
among the consorts.

343
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,740
I've never scolded the maids

344
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,820
and eunuchs in my service harshly.

345
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,340
I have done everything I could.

346
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,260
Why would someone

347
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,700
still want to harm my child?

348
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,140
She's merely a Princess,

349
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,180
unable to fight for power or the throne.

350
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,820
Who would be so cruel?

351
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,500
Your Highness,

352
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,220
we must find

353
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,140
the culprit.

354
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,460
Perhaps if we do,

355
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,180
the Princess's sight

356
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,980
may be restored.

357
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,220
Your Highness,

358
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,700
Jiang Si went to visit
Consort Xian yesterday

359
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:46,940
and was punished.

360
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,940
Yet today, she went to visit

361
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,780
the Empress with Prince Yan

362
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,700
and stayed to learn palace etiquette.

363
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,860
She certainly knows how to adapt.

364
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,420
Realizing that Consort Xian
won't protect her,

365
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,480
she's now trying to gain favor
with the Empress.

366
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:02,860
Unfortunately,

367
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,580
she has chosen the wrong patron.

368
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,940
After returning to the Palace,

369
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,380
tell the Nanwu woman
to clean up her tracks asap.

370
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:14,940
Yes.

371
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,180
Your Highness, I'd like to ask

372
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,060
if all your personal maids

373
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,040
moved to Changning Palace with you

374
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,100
before you were made Empress.

375
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,220
Are you suggesting

376
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,700
that the one who placed the worm

377
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,900
is an old servant of mine?

378
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,780
The Mang Worm is difficult
to survive in the eye.

379
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,420
It requires careful nurturing

380
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,500
over time.

381
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,140
Princess Fuqing

382
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,620
fell ill shortly

383
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,840
before you became the Empress.

384
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,020
So, I suspect

385
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,540
this person must have moved

386
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,680
to Changning Palace as well.

387
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:51,940
At that time,

388
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,180
no one in the harem

389
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:55,820
could have predicted

390
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,500
that I'd become the Empress.

391
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,860
I have no sons.

392
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,660
My family has no power.

393
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,260
His Majesty never favored me.

394
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,420
I had only five personal maids.

395
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,980
Among them,

396
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,900
only Ms. Hua and Ms. Duo remain.

397
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,000
- Could it be...?
- Please don't be anxious.

398
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,660
This is just my conjecture.

399
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,820
It could never be them.

400
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,380
Ms. Hua

401
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,140
practically raised Fuqing.

402
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,300
She cherishes her like her own eyes.

403
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,380
Though Ms. Duo has a bad temper,

404
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,460
whenever I was neglected and mistreated,

405
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,620
she was always the one
who stood up for me.

406
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,780
Your Highness, it is time for your meal.

407
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,220
Ms. Hua, what is going on?

408
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,100
Your Highness,

409
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,980
the kite is stuck on the roof eaves.

410
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,260
Is it broken?

411
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,660
Can it still be retrieved?

412
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:55,880
Don't worry, Your Highness.

413
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:57,420
I'll have someone bring a ladder.

414
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,500
Princess Fuqing.

415
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:14,980
Miss Jiang.

416
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,020
Your Highness,
the kite is on the rooftop.

417
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,580
Yes.

418
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,620
I'll try to knock it down.

419
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:22,900
That'd be great.

420
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,500
But Ms. Hua said

421
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,140
it was stuck quite high up.

422
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,620
Can you reach it?

423
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:28,820
It is quite high.

424
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,380
Let me give it a try.

425
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,660
Here it is.

426
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,420
I got it. Take a look.

427
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,700
Is it broken?

428
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,060
No, it's perfectly fine.

429
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,220
But the string snapped.

430
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,700
Your Highness, hold it.

431
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:02,980
I'll just tie

432
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,100
the string back.

433
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:06,900
Is it reattached?

434
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,300
Yes.

435
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,580
That's good.

436
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,660
If only everything in this world

437
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,340
could be mended as easily

438
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,900
as a broken kite string.

439
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,060
What do you think of the four candidates

440
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,860
Yu Jin recommended?

441
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,100
Your Majesty,

442
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,660
Captain Xie of Lingshui
has an excellent reputation.

443
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,020
His annual evaluations
at the Civil Affairs

444
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,540
are consistently top-tier.

445
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,980
However, I believe

446
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,020
there is one concern.

447
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:38,660
What concern?

448
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,460
I heard that Captain Xie
intends to marry

449
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,940
the eldest daughter of Earl Dongping.

450
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,740
If that happens, he'd become

451
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,180
Prince Yan's brother-in-law.

452
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,300
Would that not appear as favoritism?

453
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,820
Calling you inflexible
is no exaggeration.

454
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,100
Favoritism applies

455
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,590
to the unworthy and incompetent.

456
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,360
When it comes to true talent,

457
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:03,140
it'd be appointing the worthy,
regardless of ties.

458
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:04,940
Your Majesty,

459
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,620
Prince Yan

460
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,540
became the Commandant

461
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:09,940
of Capital Security

462
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,820
through the Tournament.

463
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,340
It was accepted by the people.

464
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,380
So, I believe

465
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,940
Capital Security is different

466
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,160
from other government offices.

467
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,100
It's vital to the peace of Ling'an

468
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,540
and the confidence of the people...

469
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,460
Enough, enough.

470
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,140
I summoned you here

471
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,380
not to listen to a lecture.

472
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,100
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

473
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,540
May I ask

474
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,140
why you have summoned me?

475
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,220
Zhen,

476
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,620
look.

477
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,340
Who is that flying the kite?

478
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,660
Are you referring to Miss Jiang Si?

479
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,060
Not Jiang Si.

480
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,900
The one standing beside her.

481
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,460
Princess Fuqing.

482
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,780
Zhen,

483
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,980
I appointed you as her mentor

484
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,980
some time ago.

485
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,900
What do you think of her?

486
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,460
Thanks to your trust,

487
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,540
I've had the honor
of teaching Princess Fuqing.

488
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,860
She is intelligent, quick-witted,

489
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,180
and eager to learn.

490
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,620
And?

491
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,340
She grasps key concepts

492
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,580
of the classics

493
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,100
effortlessly

494
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,840
and can even infer beyond the material,

495
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,380
offering insightful perspectives.

496
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,900
I am truly impressed.

497
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,260
Think again.

498
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,740
Beyond her studies,

499
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,380
what else have you observed?

500
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,460
Indeed.

501
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,180
Though born into nobility,

502
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,340
the Princess is humble
and unpretentious.

503
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,860
She treats the servants

504
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,180
with kindness and generosity,

505
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,860
displaying great compassion.

506
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:57,940
That's all?

507
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,500
Yes.

508
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,140
The kite is flying now.

509
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,020
It's up in the air.

510
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,180
- Slow down.
- Princess Fuqing.

511
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,700
Are you okay?

512
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,620
I'm fine.

513
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,900
Your Majesty,
sorry for my lapse in composure.

514
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,420
Fuqing is my most beloved daughter,

515
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,660
and the kindest

516
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:44,100
and most gracious Princess
in the Palace.

517
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,860
I've long wished to find her

518
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,580
an upright and reliable husband.

519
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,180
Zhen,

520
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,980
what do you think of this?

521
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,380
Your Majesty,

522
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,420
I have not yet considered

523
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,340
a suitable candidate.

524
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,520
I will certainly keep an eye out.

525
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,980
You are truly a block of wood.

526
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,900
I'm asking

527
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:14,580
what you think of Fuqing yourself.

528
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,700
Your Majesty,

529
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,780
the Princess is of noble birth,

530
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,220
while I am merely a scholar.

531
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,220
I dare not think that way.

532
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,860
So,

533
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,100
you do not wish to marry Fuqing?

534
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:44,300
I have always regarded Princess Fuqing

535
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,540
as my student,

536
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,660
nothing more.

537
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,060
Mr. Zhen refused?

538
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,460
I don't believe it.

539
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:11,780
Why would I lie to you?

540
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,640
I heard it in the Imperial Garden.

541
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,140
Our Princess is so wonderful.

542
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,580
Whoever marries her

543
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,670
would be truly blessed.

544
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,080
Everyone says that Mr. Zhen

545
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,640
has an unmatched ability to solve cases,

546
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,620
but in my opinion,

547
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,940
he is completely blind.

548
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,780
Princess Fuqing is kind

549
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,700
and gentle.

550
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,340
Besides, she is a lineal Princess.

551
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,200
Logically,

552
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,240
suitors lining up for her

553
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,280
should be from Changning Palace
to Zhengyang Gate.

554
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,500
What are you saying?

555
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,140
Ms. Duo.

556
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:37,740
Please forgive us.

557
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,180
How dare you gossip

558
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,540
behind the Princess's back?

559
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,700
Ms. Duo, please forgive us.

560
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,780
(Ms. Duo)

561
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:45,700
Your Highness,

562
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,160
this is my failure in discipline.

563
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,460
- They spoke
- Please...

564
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,580
- out of turn.
- Have mercy.

565
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,220
They should have their tongues cut out.

566
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,460
We won't do it again.

567
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,800
Your Highness, please have mercy.

568
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:56,420
The Empress has always ruled
the harem with kindness

569
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,020
and dislikes harsh punishments.

570
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,580
I think

571
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,560
docking a month's wages
should be enough

572
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,820
to teach them a lesson.

573
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:03,780
Absolutely not.

574
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,880
If such a light punishment

575
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,340
is given,

576
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,500
everyone in Changning Palace

577
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,820
will gossip about their masters.

578
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:09,680
There won't be order.

579
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,480
They weren't exactly
speaking out of turn.

580
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,780
What's there to punish?

581
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:13,980
Your Highness...

582
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,140
You may leave.

583
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,420
- Thanks.
- Thanks, Your Highness.

584
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:25,860
Your Highness,

585
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,900
don't take

586
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:29,940
what they said to heart.

587
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,580
I don't blame them.

588
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,540
Mr. Zhen isn't wrong either.

589
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,260
After all, who would truly love

590
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,580
someone who cannot see?

591
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,980
I never planned on marrying anyway.

592
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,860
I only wish to stay by Mother's side.

593
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,460
Your Highness, have you considered

594
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,340
perhaps Mr. Zhen

595
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,500
does not mind your blindness at all?

596
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,380
Perhaps it is you

597
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,300
who minds it too much,

598
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,260
and over time,

599
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,340
it has become a knot in your heart.

600
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,020
You are right.

601
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,180
It is my burden.

602
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,900
When I speak to others,

603
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,900
I cannot see their eyes.

604
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,540
So, how can I ever tell

605
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,940
if they are sincere?

606
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,020
Maybe one day,

607
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,100
your eyes will be healed.

608
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,580
Then

609
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,740
you can see Mr. Zhen for yourself

610
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,180
and ask him about it.

611
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,500
Miss Jiang,

612
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,460
can you describe

613
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,660
the sky

614
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,820
for me?

615
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:36,220
Today's sunset is especially beautiful.

616
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,580
It's deep red, like a glowing sphere,

617
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,980
slowly sinking lower and lower.

618
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,140
The clouds at the horizon

619
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:48,220
are streaked with orange and pink.

620
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,500
I can imagine

621
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,500
that living

622
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,740
in darkness

623
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,060
must be lonely.

624
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,260
Miss Jiang Si,

625
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,020
life in the Palace is lonely.

626
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,100
Other than Mother,

627
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,260
I have no one to confide in.

628
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,740
No one has ever said

629
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,420
what you said today to me before.

630
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,620
Don't worry.

631
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,500
We'll have endless things to talk about.

632
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,420
Look.

633
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,140
I have an older brother and sister,

634
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,940
but I don't have a younger sister.

635
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,500
Since you are Prince Yan's sister,

636
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,300
you are naturally my sister as well.

637
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:35,140
I'll visit the Palace often
to keep you company.

638
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,740
We'll share many more secrets.

639
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,740
(Peace and Prosperity)

640
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,540
I didn't see anything.

641
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,740
Aunt, I didn't see anything.

642
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,580
I didn't see anything, Aunt.

643
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,660
I didn't see anything.

644
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,060
I didn't see anything!

645
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,140
Your Highness.

646
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,060
It's me, Jiang.

647
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,340
Don't be afraid.

648
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,640
Did you have a nightmare?

649
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,300
Don't be afraid.

650
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:06,900
I'm here.

651
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,220
I heard you saying,

652
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,660
"I didn't see anything."

653
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,660
No...

654
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,260
What could frighten you so much?

655
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,100
Is it related to the Grand Princess?

656
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,060
I told you I didn't see anything.

657
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,380
Don't ask me.

658
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,300
I saw nothing.

659
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,660
I cannot say.

660
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,780
Alright, don't be afraid, Fuqing.

661
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:32,700
Rest assured.

662
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,700
We will do our best

663
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,740
to find a way to heal your eyes.

664
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,620
Don't be afraid.

665
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,140
Don't be afraid.

666
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:44,660
I'm here.

667
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,260
I'm here.

668
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,380
Why prepare so much food?

669
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:01,740
I'm in Changning Palace.

670
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,940
How could I possibly go hungry?

671
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:04,980
I haven't been by your side

672
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,260
these past few days.

673
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,900
What if you lost your appetite?

674
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,420
So? Any progress?

675
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,300
Based on the Empress's attitude

676
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,480
toward the Grand Princess

677
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,460
these days,

678
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,620
I'm sure

679
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,620
their relationship is strained.

680
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,740
In fact, the Empress

681
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,100
seems to fear the Grand Princess.

682
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,340
She has poor relations

683
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,740
with many consorts in the harem.

684
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,500
Supporting the Empress

685
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,780
doesn't necessarily mean anything.

686
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,920
Perhaps she just finds her
easier to use.

687
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,660
Empress Di has no sons,

688
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,140
her family holds no power,

689
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,460
and in the past,

690
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,220
she never received much favor.

691
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,780
To the Grand Princess,

692
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,620
these weaknesses might be seen

693
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,300
as advantages.

694
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,260
These advantages make her

695
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,580
easier to control.

696
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:57,980
By the way,

697
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:58,820
last night,

698
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,100
Princess Fuqing had a nightmare.

699
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,820
She kept calling out for her aunt

700
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:02,980
in her sleep,

701
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,490
saying she didn't

702
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,380
see anything.

703
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,500
The more she insisted she saw nothing,

704
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,620
the more likely it was
that she saw a secret.

705
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,540
I suspect

706
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,420
it must be something truly terrifying,

707
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,940
so she's been afraid to speak of it,

708
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,940
fearing that the Grand Princess
will retaliate

709
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,020
and harm Empress Di.

710
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,220
Do you think her blindness

711
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,740
is connected to this?

712
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,460
If the Grand Princess

713
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,940
has spies from Nanwu

714
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,340
hidden in Changning Palace,

715
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,500
then this person

716
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,700
could both gather intelligence

717
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,820
and keep an eye on Fuqing,

718
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,140
preventing her
from revealing the secret.

719
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,260
Should we tell the Empress

720
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,620
about this?

721
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,900
Would she

722
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,300
make Fuqing confess?

723
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,860
Fuqing has kept this
from the Empress for years.

724
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,380
She must be

725
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,740
suffering immensely.

726
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,380
We can't reveal this

727
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,500
without her permission.

728
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:03,740
Yes.

729
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,020
Right now,

730
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,620
our top priority

731
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:07,980
is finding the spy

732
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,100
in Changning Palace.

733
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:10,740
We cannot let them continue

734
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,840
to wreak havoc in the harem.

735
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,260
But there are

736
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:15,780
so many maids here.

737
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,520
We'll have to check the palace registry.

738
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:19,780
From my observations,

739
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:22,300
two people seem suspicious.

740
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,300
Who?

741
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,380
One is Ms. Duo;

742
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,620
the other is Ms. Hua.

743
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,940
They spoke

744
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:27,820
out of turn.

745
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,420
They should have their tongues cut out.

746
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,760
The Empress has always ruled
the harem with kindness

747
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,980
and dislikes harsh punishments.

748
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:33,980
Ms. Duo's family

749
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,660
once ran a martial arts school.

750
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,140
She knows some combat skills,

751
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:38,540
rarely smiles,

752
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,020
and is highly decisive.

753
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,980
When handling maids,

754
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,020
she is utterly ruthless.

755
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,460
Ms. Hua is an orphan.

756
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,660
She is always warm

757
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:47,980
and cheerful

758
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,540
and never argues with anyone.

759
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,060
But she is only

760
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,700
in charge of daily affairs,

761
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,720
so she has no reason
to leave the Palace.

762
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,180
Ms. Duo, however,

763
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,820
works for the Empress

764
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,760
and has many opportunities
to go outside.

765
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,380
Not leaving the Palace

766
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,400
doesn't mean she has no way
to send messages.

767
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,500
Carrier pigeons could be used.

768
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:09,740
Carrier pigeons?

769
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,340
I noticed scratches

770
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,700
on Ms. Hua's fingers,

771
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,220
the kind left by pigeon claws.

772
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,280
That matches up perfectly.

773
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:26,540
Could Ms. Hua

774
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,620
really be the spy?

775
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,580
We must act quickly.

776
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,660
Let's inform the Empress at once.

777
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,500
You also want to learn etiquette?

778
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,940
Yes.

779
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:39,460
Jiang Si's father is an Earl.

780
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,340
Her manners are far better than mine.

781
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,300
If she performs flawlessly
at the wedding

782
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,620
while I make a mistake,

783
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,260
it would be utterly humiliating.

784
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,580
But I can't stay

785
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,100
in the Palace to study,

786
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,860
so I wanted to borrow

787
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,020
Ms. Hua for a while.

788
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:54,620
Ms. Hua?

789
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,540
What are you two up to?

790
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,940
I just want

791
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,340
to learn proper etiquette.

792
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:03,100
Fine then.

793
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,140
Your Highness, I don't want to go.

794
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,700
But Prince Yan asked for you.

795
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,620
- Your Highness...
- Go pack.

796
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,380
Yes.

797
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,120
Thank you, Your Highness.

798
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,260
Prince Yan,

799
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,700
can I trust

800
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,900
you and Jiang Si?

801
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,180
After my return,

802
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,300
you are the only one in the Palace

803
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:36,940
who has treated me kindly.

804
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,460
You're a good child,

805
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:42,660
and so is Jiang Si.

806
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:49,700
(Prince Yan's Mansion)

807
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,660
Ms. Hua,

808
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,580
we've arrived. Come out.

809
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,940
You refused to leave the Palace,

810
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,660
but we're at the doorstep now.

811
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,460
There's no need to hide
in the sedan chair.

812
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,340
Your Highness, you misunderstand.

813
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:22,980
I am not unwilling.

814
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,380
Since I entered the Palace at 13,

815
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,900
I have never stepped outside.

816
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:30,340
Everything out there has changed.

817
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,620
The outside world is

818
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,540
no longer the one I knew.

819
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,220
Is that what troubles you?

820
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:38,780
Yes, you wouldn't understand.

821
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,540
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

822
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:45,740
Wait.

823
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,820
The flowers in your mansion

824
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,340
are common in my hometown.

825
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:52,180
Seeing them again feels so familiar.

826
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,220
It seems you and Lingshui

827
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,260
are truly connected.

828
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,180
Where?

829
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,220
Lingshui?

830
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:10,980
Miss Jiang.

831
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,180
It's you.

832
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,500
Did you plant the Mang Worm

833
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,560
in Princess Fuqing's eyes?

834
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:16,780
It was me.

835
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:19,020
How does a noble lady of Dazhou like you

836
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,580
know so much about Mang Worms

837
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,580
from Nanwu?

838
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:22,740
How did you find out?

839
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,460
In that case,

840
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,580
Miss Jiang,

841
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,980
you've known too much.

842
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,140
I'm afraid I must do this.

843
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,620
(Peace and Prosperity)

844
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:50,950
Where is Miss Jiang?

845
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,660
She is in the back garden with Ms. Duo.

846
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,500
Let go of me. I'm fine.

847
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,500
She is a Nanwu woman.

848
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,870
She can save Princess Fuqing.

849
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:09,440
Though she's a Nanwu woman,

850
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,500
I have confirmed

851
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:11,620
that she planted

852
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,660
the gu worm

853
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:13,860
in the Princess's eyes.

854
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,500
So, she knows how to cure it.

855
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,420
Tell me how.

856
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,580
I'm just clearing obstacles

857
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,500
for the Grand Princess.

858
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,540
Ms. Duo,

859
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:23,780
I'm the Saintess.

860
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,220
Will you serve me

861
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,580
or the Grand Princess?

862
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:27,940
You choose.

863
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,380
Greetings, Saintess.

864
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:49,780
Please punish me.

865
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,820
Yes, Saintess.

866
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,060
Tell us how to remove

867
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,300
the gu worm.

868
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,640
A few herbs from Imperial Pharmacy

869
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,220
will suffice.

870
00:36:58,900 --> 00:36:59,820
That's all?

871
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:00,900
Yes.

872
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,460
Alright, I'll take you to get them now.

873
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,060
(It's simple to remove the worm.)

874
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,820
(Wrap realgar powder in a cyan cloth,)

875
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,780
(add pangolin scale powder
and snake bile,)

876
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,260
(dip it in warm wine,)

877
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,340
(and repeatedly wipe around the eyes.)

878
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,940
(When the worm cannot withstand it,)

879
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,100
(it will leave her body.)

880
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,300
Miss Jiang.

881
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,740
Your Highness, I'm about to begin.

882
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,340
Remember:

883
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,420
No matter how much it hurts,

884
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,340
you must keep your eyes shut

885
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,420
until I tell you to open them,

886
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:38,780
alright?

887
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,540
Sure.

888
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,580
- Fuqing.
- Mother.

889
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,680
Fuqing, can you bear it?

890
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,880
- I know it hurts.
- Fuqing.

891
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:57,820
Hang in there.

892
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,540
- Fuqing.
- Ms. Duo.

893
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:01,620
Fuqing.

894
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,420
Mother.

895
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,340
Fuqing.

896
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:07,900
Your Majesty,

897
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:08,780
Miss Jiang has started

898
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:10,220
removing the worm.

899
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,300
Father.

900
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:13,860
Hang in there.

901
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,460
(Glorious Fortune)
It's almost done.

902
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:18,740
Ms. Duo, hurry.

903
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:19,660
Father.

904
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,040
She's treating her inside.

905
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,720
- You'd better not go in.
- Mother.

906
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,180
She is just a young girl.

907
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,540
Why must she endure such pain?

908
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:29,860
Jin,

909
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,620
did the wounds you suffered in the South

910
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,980
also hurt as much?

911
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,340
Father,

912
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:38,980
I am a man.

913
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,420
I do not fear pain.

914
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,380
It's all my fault

915
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,580
for making you suffer so much

916
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,660
and enduring so many hardships.

917
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:56,420
(The worm has a spirit.)

918
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,060
- (It's been there for ten years.)
- Mother.

919
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,020
(It knows)

920
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,660
(there is no better host.)

921
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,260
(We're forcing it out,)

922
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:04,950
- (so it'll resist.)
- It hurts.

923
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,640
(The pain will feel like her heart
being gnawed away.)

924
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:09,060
(It's a contest of endurance)

925
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,300
(between the worm)

926
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:11,580
(and the Princess.)

927
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,940
Your Highness, it's almost over.

928
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,540
Hold on, Fuqing.

929
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:18,780
Mother.

930
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:22,900
It's almost over.

931
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,460
Your Highness, it's almost over.

932
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,380
It hurts.

933
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:33,460
It hurts so much.

934
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,740
- One last time.
- Mother.

935
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:44,780
Your Highness, hold on.

936
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,180
One last time.

937
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,660
Your Highness, it's almost over.

938
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:55,860
It's out, Your Highness.

939
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,020
It's out.

940
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,780
Your Highness, don't open your eyes.

941
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:06,180
Here.

942
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,100
Fuqing.

943
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:41,620
(Grand Elder, I saw the Saintess.)

944
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:49,500
(Glorious Fortune)

945
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:53,500
(Blessings and Clarity)

946
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,300
Your Highness,

947
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,460
you can open your eyes now.

948
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,420
Fuqing?

949
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,100
Fuqing.

950
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,340
Mother.

951
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,620
Your eyes...

952
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,700
My child, you have suffered.

953
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:01,260
You can finally see again.

954
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,220
Your Majesty.

955
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:09,540
The Princess can see.

956
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:14,060
Fuqing.

957
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,020
Fuqing,

958
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:19,100
can you see me clearly?

959
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,180
Father.

960
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:30,580
Why do you look so much older?

961
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:36,980
I've aged.

962
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,180
How wonderful, Miss Jiang.

963
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,860
Jiang Si, Jin,

964
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,860
you have rendered great service.

965
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:53,380
Tell me. What reward do you want?

966
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:55,760
Thank you, Your Majesty.

967
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,460
This is my first time
receiving a reward.

968
00:42:58,900 --> 00:42:59,980
Please allow me

969
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,060
to think it over.

970
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:03,220
Sure. Go ahead.

971
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:06,900
Come on. Let me take another look.
