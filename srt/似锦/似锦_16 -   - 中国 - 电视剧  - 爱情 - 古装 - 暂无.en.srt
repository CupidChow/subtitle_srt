I wonder

32
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,160
when it'll stop.

I jumped over the wall to get out

00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,320
and sprained my ankle a lot.

After digging a hole in the wall,

47
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,710
I had no more sprains.

that an immortal

66
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,830
would rest on the treetop

67

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,840

00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,280

00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:56,750
This is my daughter, Shen Xin'er.

193
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,240
There's only the two of us

194
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,200
in our family.

195
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,550
Thanks to this clinic

196
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,870
and my medical skills,

197
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,520
we can barely make a living.

198
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,510
Xin'er,

199
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,270
cook some noodles for them.

200
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,350
- Hot food will warm them.
- No need.

201
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,440
That's too kind.

202
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,280
- Thanks, Miss.
- It's fine. Let her go.

203
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,040
Aman.

204
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,320
Here's some money, ma'am.

205
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,390
This isn't an inn

206
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,510
but a shabby hut.

207
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,630
I can't charge you for...

208
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,870
If you don't take it,

209
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,280
we can't stay the night here.

210
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,440
I insist you take it.

211
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,040
Thank you, Miss.

212
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,520
I'll take it then.

213
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,950
Sit and rest.

214
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,650
I'll go check the noodles.

215
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:35,500
- Thank you.
- Sure.

216
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:36,360
Thanks a lot, ma'am.

217
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,200
You're welcome.

218
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,950
"Virtue and Skills".

219
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,100
(Kind and Skilled)

220
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,960
Here they come!

221
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,510
Eat them while they're hot, Miss.

222
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,790
- Thanks.
- Here you go.

223
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:53,800
One bowl each.

224
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,750
Thanks, Miss Shen.

225
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:57,700
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

226
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:58,870
Sure.

227
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,230
I was too hasty

228
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,940
and fell into their trap.

229
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,920
They used a body double for Sang Qi.

230
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,400
Did he already die?

231
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,800
I'll find out.

232
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,830
If he's still alive in jail,

233
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,430
we'll go to Capital Security to rescue me.

234
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,710
What's taking the girls so long?

235
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,320
It's time to go.

236
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,520
Bad news!

237
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,710
Commandant Yu, Young Master Zhan,

238
00:14:59,030 --> 00:14:59,870
help!

239
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,000
What's wrong?

240
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,350
Miss Si is burning up.

241
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,360
Why is she suddenly having a fever?

242
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,280
I don't know.

243
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,600
Miss Si

244
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,350
was born weak, I guess.

245
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,320
She caught a cold in the rain,

246
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,550
causing the fever.

247
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,390
What to do?

248
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,280
Don't worry.

249
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,230
Shan'an Clinic is well-known

250
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,030
in our village

251
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,440
and in this entire area

252
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,750
for my medical skills.

253
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:20,710
I'll go check.

254
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,350
She's a girl.

255
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,080
You boys can't go to her room.

256
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,320
Let's go, Xin'er.

257
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,680
Thank you, ma'am.

258
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,670
Hurry, Mrs. Shen!

259
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,630
She feels even warmer.

260
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,040
She was fine.

261
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,470
Why is she having a high fever?

262
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:48,470
She's not too strong a girl.

263
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,560
The rain gave her a cold.

264
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,320
That's why she's burning up.

265
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,160
Mrs. Shen, actually,

266
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,550
I think I saw something evil

267
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,750
last night.

268
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,230
Was this old house

269
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,680
haunted by evil spirits?

270
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:08,320
Could she be...?

271
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,870
You're right.

272
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,280
It's possible.

273
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,400
This cottage was built

274
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:14,920
ages ago.

275
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:18,110
We have nowhere else to go

276
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,080
and have to make do with it.

277
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:23,520
I'll do acupuncture on her

278
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,110
and decoct herbs for her.

279
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,710
I think she'll be fine.

280
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,400
Thank you very much.

281
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,640
What's taking them so long?

282
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,400
- Let's go check.
- Sure.

283
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,150
I just finished

284
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,840
the acupuncture on her.

285
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,160
You can't go inside, boys.

286
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:55,200
She's having a bad cold.

287
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,160
It's under control for now.

288
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,030
But Miss Si is too weak.

289
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,590
I've run out of herbs.

290
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,390
Right now,

291
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,650
we need ice to bring down

292
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,510
her fever quickly.

293
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:05,640
I'll get it. Where is it?

294
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,720
The ice cellar is 30 li west

295
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,750
- of the village.
- Sure.

296
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,590
Hurry!

297
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:10,670
Miss, Miss,

298
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,310
do you remember the herbs

299
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,750
I just prescribed?
- Yes.

300
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,480
They have to be picked up separately

301
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,750
from the pharmacies I said.

302
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,640
Sure, sure, I'll go.

303
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,910
- Aman, Chuchu.
- Yes.

304
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,590
- Be quick!
- Got it. Come on.

305
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:22,270
Don't worry. I'll stay and watch.

306
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,670
Take your time. Calm down.

307
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:25,670
Xin'er,

308
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,480
go get some water for Miss Si.

309
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:28,430
Sure.

310
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,000
I'll fetch some dandelions.

311
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,590
- I'll get them.
- Sure. Go ahead.

312
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,480
- Stay here.
- I will.

313
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,430
Thanks, ma'am.

314
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,430
No worries.

315
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:58,630
Young man.

316
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,000
- Thanks.
- Drink up. Don't get heatstroke.

317
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,920
Thank you very much.

318
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,480
Go back and rest. I'm here.

319
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,480
Sweat's dripping from your face. Drink.

320
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,590
Why isn't Chief back yet?

321
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,040
Miss Shen,

322
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,110
please look after Miss Si for a while.

323
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,440
By the way,

324
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,430
where's the toilet?

325
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,680
- Over there.
- Thanks.

326
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,520
Thank you. Thanks.

327
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,870
Miss Si, your decoction.

328
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,760
Miss Si?

329
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:26,910
What are you doing?

330
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,110
Miss Si, you're sick.

331
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,000
- Take this.
- I won't!

332
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,160
Aman, Aman!

333
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,000
Chuchu!

334
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,840
You don't trust me?

335
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,240
I don't.

336
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,870
No wonder I felt someone

337
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,800
touching my hands when I was dizzy.

338
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:45,760
You're a girl.

339
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,000
What's your problem?

340
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,720
A girl?

341
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,480
You think you're so smart, huh?

342
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,480
You're a man!

343
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,790
You had me at hello.

344
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:05,590
Zhan! Help!

345
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:06,560
Let me go!

346
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,720
Help! Zhan!

347
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,110
Save it. No one can hear you.

348
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,720
Help! Zhan!

349
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,560
Xin'er, stop.

350
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,030
Are you insane?

351
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,750
She's a treasure.

352
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,680
We need her.

353
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,160
Don't ravish her.

354
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,190
I like her.

355
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,870
Don't touch her. Control yourself.

356
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:31,200
It's not showtime yet.

357
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,240
Don't act on impulse.

358
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,280
Fine.

359
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,800
Who are you? Stop.

360
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,040
Watch him.

361
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,390
Miss Si! Miss Si!

362
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,000
Go ahead.

363
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,550
It was all my fault, Chief!

364
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:17,000
I failed to protect Miss Si.

365
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,830
A gang of bandits took her away.

366
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:19,790
Miss Si!

367
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,110
- After we came here,
- Miss Si!

368
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:24,760
she had a fever. Then bandits came.

369
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,240
Was that a coincidence?

370
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,190
Sir,

371
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,110
you can't blame me for it.

372
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:31,200
When I kindly took you in,

373
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,830
I told you about the bandits

374
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,030
harming the people here.

375
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,160
My poor daughter

376
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,280
almost got abducted, too.

377
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,240
- Yu,
- Those animals!

378
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,590
the top priority is to find Si.

379
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,910
Tell the authorities.

380
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,320
They'll find her faster than us.

381
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,030
Aman and I will recheck the area.

382
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,110
Maybe we'll find something.

383
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,070
Let's start looking.

384
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,150
Maybe we'll find her.

385
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,590
Tell the authorities!

386
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,800
Who's beating the drum this late?

387
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:01,670
It's you two civilians, huh?

388
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,520
You disturbed my sleep.

389
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,720
(Magistrate Jia)
You know the consequences?

390
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,590
Sir, bandits broke into the Shan'an Clinic

391
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:09,510
and abducted my sister.

392
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:11,090
Please send officers to look for her now!

393
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:14,390
Bandits?

394
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:16,670
I see.

395
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,390
Leave your report here.

396
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:20,960
If she doesn't come back in two days,

397
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,000
I'll

398
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,520
have my men search for her.

399
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:25,540
What...?

400
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,000
You're in charge of this area.

401
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,960
If your delay puts her in danger,

402
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,270
can you take the consequences?

403
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,510
Here in the yamen,

404
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:33,480
I act by law.

405
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,480
Don't tell me what to do.

406
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,370
If anything happens to her
in your jurisdiction,

407
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:38,880
I assure you

408
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,750
that you'll lose your post forever.

409
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:41,670
How dare you!

410
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,190
Who are you

411
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,110
to threaten me?

412
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,960
Stop! Stop right there!

413
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,700
(Yamen)

414
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,800
Guard.

415
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:56,870
Send a message to those two

416
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,830
to unload the goods soon.

417
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,110
A storm's coming.

418
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,110
Yes, Master.

419
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:07,580
(Jiang Si had a fever, 100 taels a night.)

420
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,150
If this batch is sold,

421
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:15,240
we'll make a killing.

422
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,640
Jiang Si is the best.

423
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,830
Some big shot likes her.

424
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,040
He's willing to pay more.

425
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,480
Mother,

426
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:27,630
I also like her a lot.

427
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,840
How about

428
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,870
we keep her?

429
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:31,960
Anyway,

430
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,040
we've made enough money.

431
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,040
You fool!

432
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:37,190
Listen,

433
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,310
she's a rare beauty

434
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,590
and worth a ton.

435
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,150
Without her,

436
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,350
do you know how much money

437
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,350
we'll lose?

438
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,720
Don't you even think about it!

439
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,670
Go away.

440
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,320
Go!

441
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,670
Go watch her.

442
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,840
Yu,

443
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,560
what to do now?

444
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,480
Young Master Zhan, Mr. Yu!

445
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,150
Master Qin!

446
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,280
What happened to you?

447
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,380
I came to report a case.

448
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,390
My wife, Rong, is missing.

449
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:34,800
Her too?

450
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,000
When I was at the Jiang's,

451
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,670
I received her letter,

452
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,000
saying that she felt unwell

453
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:42,720
and meant to go to the Shan'an Clinic.

454
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:44,110
- Then
- That clinic again.

455
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,230
I didn't hear from her again.

456
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,040
I was worried about her condition

457
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,350
and rushed back home.

458
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,000
Rong.

459
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,280
Rong!

460
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,560
Rong!

461
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:07,190
Rong!

462
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,270
- Rong!
- You're back, Master Qin.

463
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,110
Ms. Li,

464
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,430
did you see my wife?

465
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:15,910
What happened to our family?

466
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,110
Uh...

467
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,280
Say it!

468
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:21,390
I went to the yamen,

469
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,280
but that magistrate

470
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,240
didn't care about his people at all.

471
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,100
(Bring Back the Dead)

472
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,100
(Shan'an Clinic)

473
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:31,950
Oh no!

474
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,580
That woman and her daughter did it.

475
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,590
A new girl, ma'am?

476
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,840
Let me see.

477
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,150
How young and lovely!

478
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,000
Get your dirty paws off her.

479
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,520
She's gold.

480
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:51,960
Yes, fine.

481
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:52,960
Take her inside.

482
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,240
Go ahead. Move.

483
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,350
Watch her closely!

484
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,390
- Chief.
- Anything?

485
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:04,910
No. I found nothing here.

486
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,190
There's nothing in this room.

487
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,150
I found knockout powder.

488
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:12,590
Look.

489
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:13,960
The ghostly figure

490
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,110
I saw last night is real.

491
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,960
I guess the Shens meant to drug me

492
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,880
but gave up after knowing I could fight.

493
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,760
Commandant Yu,

494
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,590
look, perfume powder from our shop!

495
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:22,790
Miss Si must've left it.

496
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:23,660
Where did you find it?

497
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,790
It spreads from the gate.

498
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:25,630
Let's go.

499
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,700
(Shan'an Clinic)

500
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,100
(Rong)

501
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:42,520
Where am I?

502
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,520
A hut in the mountain.

503
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,880
There are a lot more

504
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,430
of such huts nearby

505
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,270
filled with the women

506
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,480
abducted by that old hen

507
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,520
and her son.

508
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,630
You too?

509
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,190
I'm different.

510
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,590
I'm married.

511
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,350
No one wants to buy me.

512
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,670
May I know your name?

513
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,080
Rong.

514
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,830
It's been a long time

515
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,110
since anyone asked me my name.

516
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,000
Rong,

517
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,150
have you never tried to escape?

518
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:25,520
I would if I could.

519
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:28,000
Those outside all work for those two.

520
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,680
They pretend

521
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,590
to be physicians

522
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,680
and use their clinic as a front

523
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,800
for human trafficking.

524
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,960
They've raked in enough money

525
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,760
and hired many people to watch us.

526
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,190
There's no chance.

527
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:50,000
I've tried over and over

528
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:53,040
but got caught

529
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,670
and beaten up every time.

530
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:57,440
Even if I made it out,

531
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,800
how could I live on?

532
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,240
I've...

533
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:05,480
That effeminate animal has...

534
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:08,430
I...

535
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:09,670
Rong,

536
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,750
we'll find a way

537
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:11,670
to escape.

538
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,400
Think about your family.

539
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,720
We can't give up.

540
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,150
My husband...

541
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,640
My husband hasn't

542
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,390
heard from me for a long time.

543
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,760
He must still be waiting for me.

544
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,560
Be quiet!

545
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,190
Cheers, guys! Drink up!

546
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,070
What's taking Laosi so long

547
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,030
to bring them food?

548
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:50,870
Go and check.

549
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:51,870
You guys drink.

550
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:52,950
Hurry!

551
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,870
Eat, Brother.

552
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:00,030
Are the new arrivals today

553
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:00,870
good enough?

554
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:03,000
- Is there anyone you like?
- She's hot.

555
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,080
- You like her?
- All good.

556
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:04,840
Let's go.

557
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,430
I like what you said.

558
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,030
Come on. Cheers.

559
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:10,960
Drink up.

560
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,270
- Here.
- Drink up.

561
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:13,550
Come on. Keep going.

562
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,430
- Fill the cups.
- Keep drinking.

563
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,800
That chick is a lady.

564
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,310
- Run!
- Who's there?

565
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:26,720
Stop!

566
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:31,270
Run! Go get help to rescue me!

567
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,110
Rong!

568
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,430
Rong!

569
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:42,750
You two go that way.

570
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:44,270
- Yes. Let's go.
- You, follow me.

571
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,110
Yes.

572
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,760
- Hurry!
- Go!

573
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,080
Catch her!

574
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:51,940
Stop!

575
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,520
Stop!

576
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,720
Stop!

577
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:56,390
Stop there!

578
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:02,190
Over there!

579
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,270
You two go that way.

580
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,110
Let's go.

581
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:06,590
- Let's go this way.
- Yes.

582
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:07,910
Where's she?

583
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,190
Come on.

584
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,560
Doing a runner, huh?

585
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,830
Are you done?

586
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,280
We got her back.

587
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:37,960
I'm exhausted.

588
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,150
Where's Rong?

589
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:42,480
Who?

590
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:45,190
You mean that woman carrying my baby?

591
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,520
Mother,

592
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:48,380
it's the one trying to run away with her.

593
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,000
What did you do to her?

594
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:52,000
When I brought her back,

595
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,320
I took her pulse.

596
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,910
To my surprise, she's one month pregnant.

597
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,520
We can only sell her to a brothel

598
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,190
at a loss before she shows.

599
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,560
- Bring her over.
- Move!

600
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,830
- Rong!
- Come on. She's here.

601
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,280
Rong!

602
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:07,590
Miss Si...

603
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,040
Rong!

604
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,280
Don't worry about me.

605
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:13,630

I could keep you.

Let's get you changed into a pretty dress.

622
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,800
Consider it my farewell gift.

623
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,480
She'll have her first client tonight.

624
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,920
Don't cause more trouble.

625
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,520
We've lost one chick.

626
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:15,870
Drag her inside.

627
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,280

They're in cahoots.

633
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:40,430
That explains it.

634
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,240
Here's a little something for you.

635
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,190
Not bad.

636
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,040
Let's dash.

637
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:46,990
- Let's go.
- We can't!

638
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:47,900
Uh...

639
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,490
We don't know how many people they have.

640
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:50,430
If we act rashly,

641
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,560
Miss Si might get hurt.

642
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,670
What's your plan?

643
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,670
- Long Dan.
- Yes.

644
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,280
Fetch Mr. Zhen quickly.

645
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,240
Yes, sir.

646
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:01,190
Be very careful.

647
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:02,390
Take these.

648
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,280
Stay here as lookouts.

649
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,280
I'll get in and check.

650
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,830
Be careful, Qi.

651
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:24,790
Stay here.

652
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:26,110
Don't move.

653
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,190
I'll get something pretty for you to wear.

654
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:29,670
Let's go.

655
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,190
Jiang Si!

656
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,870
I didn't see you when I got back.

657
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,720
I was worried sick

658
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,670
- about you!
- You found me.

659
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:52,950
It's fine.

660
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,280
Let's go.

661
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,480
We can't leave yet.

662
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,070
If that woman

663
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,110
and her son find me gone,

664
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:00,480
they'll destroy all the evidence.

665
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,520
Then

666
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:02,550
more women will be

667
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:03,590
harmed by them.

668
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:05,910
Alright.

669
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,870
I'll stand guard outside.

670
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,880
It's time to get changed.

671
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,040
Look at you trying to escape.

672
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,870
You got dirt on your face.

673
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,150
You're so not a man.

674
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,080
What a big baby

675
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,750
and mama's boy.

676
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,070
What did you say?

677
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:36,190
Was I wrong?

678
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,920
I have a guess, though.

679
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:40,150
Maybe you're

680
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,400
sweet and kind

681
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,670
but forced to

682
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:45,000
harm all those

683
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,960
innocent women.

684
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,270
You're dressed as a woman

685
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,750
because you haven't found your love.

686
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,440
Once the government tracks you down,

687
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,070
you'll be doomed.

688
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:55,920
What's your point?

689
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,590
My reputation

690
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:58,750
has been ruined.

691
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:00,630
I have nowhere else to go.

692
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:02,440
If I agree...

693
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,190
to be with you,

694
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:07,790
will you

695
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:09,190
abandon your mother

696
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:10,560
to leave with me now?

697
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,760
Do you mean it?

698
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,150
Do you think I have other choices?

699
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:18,630
A defiled girl

700
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,880
shall die.

701
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,150
Fine. We have a deal.

702
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,110
If you agree to be my love,

703
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,960
we can leave today and go far away.

704
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,520
We've made tons of money.

705
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:40,950
But...

706
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,110
my mother is too tough.

707
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:45,280
I don't have the money yet.

708
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,270
Do you know

709
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,480
if she has anything so valuable

710
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,270
that she'll risk her life

711
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,560
to keep it safe?

712
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,840
If you're able to find

713
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,110
and obtain it,

714
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:56,960
she'll give you

715
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,320
whatever you want.

716
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,160
I see.

717
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,230
Wait for me, darling.

718
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:36,960
Son!

719
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:39,030
Where's she?

720
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:39,960
She's gone!

721
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,190
- Si!
- Miss!

722
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:44,480
- Zhan!
- I thought

723
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,480
I'd lose you forever!

724
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,440
- Si!
- Jiang Si!

725
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,880
- Si!
- Zhan!

726
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,270
Are you alright?

727
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,230
Did he hurt you?

728
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,560
I'm good. Relax.

729
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:54,790
Mr. Zhen,

730
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:56,840
Lingwu County is right ahead.

731
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,880
The road is bumpy.

732
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:00,190
Are you alright?

733
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,040
I'm fine, Long Dan.

734
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,320
Go as fast as you can.

735
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,230
- I'm fine.
- Miss Si,

736
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:11,960
did you see a woman

737
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:14,080
named Rong?

738
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:15,590
She's my wife.

739
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,230
Did you see her there?

740
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,600
Mr. Yu,

741
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:19,520
did you see Rong?

742
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:21,360
Master Qin,

743
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,240
Rong...

744
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,190
Rong killed herself.

745
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,040
She killed herself...

746
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,510
No way. No.

747
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:41,350
No.

748
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:42,590
Rong!

749
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,480
Master Qin...

750
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,030
I'll slaughter those animals!

751
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,760
Master Qin!

752
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:47,990
Master Qin!

753
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:49,070
Hold it for me.

754
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:51,110
Were you cut?

755
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:52,440
I'm good. I'll help him.

756
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,240
Hold on!

757
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,040
Master Qin! Master Qin!

758
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:00,350
Master Qin,

759
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,080
calm down.

760
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,800
I'll kill them all

761
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:04,920
for Rong's death!

762
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,070
Master Qin, we aren't sure

763
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,030
about the things inside.

764
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:08,920
Breaking in like this will get us killed!

765
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,080
Rong is dead.

766
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:12,480
I'd rather die with her!

767
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,110
If you died, who'd take revenge for her?

768
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:36,960
Good liquor!

769
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,230
One more cup. One more cup.

770
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:39,920
I toast you, sir.

771
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,110
I'll refill your cup.

772
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:41,950
Cheers.

773
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:47,040
It's you again.

774
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,960
You failed in your duty.

775
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:50,670
We don't trust you.

776
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,840
That's why we're back

777
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,840
for justice.

778
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:53,840
Ridiculous.

779
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,590
I don't have time

780
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:56,790
for chitchat.

781
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:58,190
You scum!

782
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,230
Instead of keeping people safe,

783
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,440
you're here indulging in

784
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,360
drinks and lust.

785
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,200
How dare you!

786
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:04,440
Get out now,

787
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,790
or I'll have all of you arrested.

788
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:10,390
(Ling'an)
Commandant Yu Qi of Capital Security.

789
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,110
- I'll get to the bottom of this case.
- Go, go, go!

790
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,710
Commandant Yu, sir,

791
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:21,630
forgive my ignorance.

792
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:22,960
I didn't recognize you.

793
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,670
Please don't take it to heart.

794
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:26,480
What case is it

795
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:28,000
that troubles you

796
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,630
to come all the way here?

797
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:31,510
You know that woman and her son

798
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:32,830
who run the Shan'an Clinic, right?

799
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:34,840
Her son in female attire has been

800
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,630
assaulting and selling innocent women.

801
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,880
Do you know nothing about that?

802
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:44,510
Do you mean

803
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:46,310
Shen Xin'er and her mother?

804
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,110
They have a good reputation here

805
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:51,750
for their excellent medical skills.

806
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,030
Look at you calling black white.

807
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:55,190
You're something else.

808
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:56,230
You mistake an obvious man

809
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,230
for a woman!

810
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:59,000
It's all but a misunderstanding.

811
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,160
Outside the hut in the woods,

812
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,400
Mrs. Shen passed a bag of money

813
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,880
to you, right?

814
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,310
Mr. Jia.

815
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:10,400
Mr. Zhen.

816
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,150
"Fear not sternness but justice.

817
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:15,520
Admire not ability but fairness."

818
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:17,590
You disregard the law and justice

819
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:18,550
for your selfish gains

820
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:19,760
when handling cases!

821
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,000
You sit up on high

822
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:23,190
while I'm a lowly magistrate.

823
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:25,480
You don't know certain things

824
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,150
unless you see for yourself.

825
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,630
Today, someone's daughter

826
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:29,710
goes to that clinic.

827
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:30,800
Tomorrow, someone's wife

828
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,810
goes there.

829
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,880
How will those women

830
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,880
live on?

831
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,000
Regarding Shen Xin'er's case,

832
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:36,790
I've got the evidence.

833
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,400
It's irrefutable.

834
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:41,030
You're guilty of malpractice,
bending the law,

835
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:42,230
and corruption.

836
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,070
Guards,

837
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,400
- take him away!
- Yes.

838
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,800
Go! Move!

839
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:47,070
Keep up! Keep us!

840
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,310
- Go!
- What to do?

841
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,520
Master Qin! Master Qin!

842
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,840
I'll kill you!

843
00:40:58,070 --> 00:40:59,480
Calm down, Master Qin!

844
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:00,670
I have to kill them

845
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:01,670
for Rong's death!

846
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:03,000
Don't do it, Master Qin!

847
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,120
They deserve death,

848
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,710
but if you kill them,

849
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:06,670
you'll be guilty, too.

850
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:07,880
You'll be ruined!

851
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,920
Being killed by you

852
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,110
is too easy for them.

853
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:11,480
Do you know the sentence

854
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,320
for their crimes?

855
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:13,510
They'll be

856
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:14,590
cut into pieces.

857
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:15,880
Guards, take them away!

858
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,360
Spare my son, please!

859
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,960
- Go!
- I'm begging you!

860
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:28,950
Master Qin,

861
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:30,960
where are you going?

862
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,960
Rong left me.

863
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:33,710
I no longer have a home.

864
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,320
I'd rather

865
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,110
go to a temple to pray

866
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:39,080
for the rest of my life.

867
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,510
I'd like to say goodbye before leaving.

868
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:42,350
Master Qin...

869
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,840
I've made up my mind.

870
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:46,080
Please let me go.

871
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:47,360
Master Qin,

872
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:49,270
I'll escort you.

873
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,840
Si,

874
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,630
we've been in Lingwu for too long.

875
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,100
If we go back to Lingshui as planned

876
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:54,920
for ancestor worship,

877
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,630
I'll miss the Guard orientation.

878
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:58,440
I've talked to Yu

879
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,920
and Mr. Zhen.

880
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:01,360
They'll escort you.

881
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:02,630
That's a relief.

882
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,400
Go back then, Zhan.

883
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,560
Your work is more important.

884
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:07,230
Once I get to Lingshui,

885
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,560
I'll explain to Yi.

886
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,230
Take care of yourself.

887
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:11,870
I will.

888
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,760
Let's go, Master Qin.

889
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,960
Take care, Miss Si.

890
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,200
Miss Si,

891
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:29,190
it's chilly at night.

892
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:30,440
Don't catch a cold.

893
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,640
Zhen,

894
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:33,440
thankfully, you came in time.

895
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,480
Otherwise, Magistrate Jia

896
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:36,510
would brush away

897
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:37,350
that case for sure.

898
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:39,480
What else is troubling you?

899
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,040
I heard

900
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,670
most of the women,

901
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:43,790
who had been to that clinic,

902
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:46,000
were forced to die

903
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,190
by their husbands' families.

904
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,520
I wonder

905
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,190
if I made a mistake.

906
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,200
No.

907
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:05,060
