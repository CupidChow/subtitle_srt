Marquis,

13
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,350
here's a secret letter..

14
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,430
Mr. Zhen,

15
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:54,740
a list of Nanwu's spies

16
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,680
has been found

17
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,760
in Prince Yan's Mansion.

18
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,710
No way! It's a set-up!

19
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:00,870
Here's the evidence.

20
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,280
See for yourself, Mr. Zhen.

21
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,680
Who found this letter?

22
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,570
I did.

23
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,560
Answer my question.

24
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:15,120
Where exactly did you find this letter?

25
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,610
Under the pillow in the bedroom.

26
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,310
Such a confidential list

27
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,150
was placed under a pillow?

28
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,960
Don't you think that's suspicious?

29
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,680
Whether it's suspicious or not

30
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,400
is not for you to decide, Mr. Zhen.

31
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,710
Let's go to Earl Dongping's Mansion.

32
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:37,990
Mr. Zhen, what should we do?

33
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,710
They are going
to Earl Dongping's Mansion.

34
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,750
The people there are

35
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,000
the Princess Consort's maternal family.

36
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,960
According to the law,

37
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,520
they should be detained
and put on trial.

38
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,030
There is nothing I can do.

39
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,590
But don't worry.

40
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,590
At this stage,

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,560
Marquis Changxing won't act recklessly.

42
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:55,590
Let's go.

44
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,710
I am getting married today.

45
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,840
In the future,

46
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,400
I won't be able to serve you.

47
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:39,310
I hope you'll be safe and healthy.

Please take a look at this.

52
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,480
Does this paper
have any special properties?

53
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,750
Just as you said,

54
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,720
this paper is quite extraordinary.

55
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,270
It's smooth as spring ice,
dense as snow,

56
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,000
firm and pure as jade,
fine and light as silk.

58
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,120
this is Chengxintang Paper.

59

60

76
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,080

Instead of bringing blessings,

82
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,000
she has brought disaster upon us.

Marquis,

84
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,120
we were once in-laws.

85
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,040
Please have mercy.

86
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,150
In-laws?

87
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,800
When my son was beheaded,

88
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,480
why didn't I hear you

89
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,480
call me an in-law then?

90
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,430
That was because he committed crimes,

91
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,360
harming so many women.

92
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,720
He brought it upon himself.

93
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,680
Shut up!

94
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,070
Now, your daughter Jiang Si

95
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,000
has committed treason.

96
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,190
No one in your family

97
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,360
can escape responsibility.

98
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,360
My daughter could never

99
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,560
collude with the enemy.

100
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,560
Someone must have framed her.

101
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,120
Are you questioning

102
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,160
His Majesty's judgment?

103
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,310
Shall I relay your exact words

104
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,190
to His Majesty?

105
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,520
By the way,

106
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,270
my dear former in-law,

107
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,630
don't worry.

108
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,270
I won't let go

109
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,830
of my former daughter-in-law

110
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,680
and your son who's outside.

111
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,830
You're avenging on us!

112
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:39,920
So what?

113
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,800
Jiang Si is

114
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,270
from your family after all.

115
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,240
Arrest them all.

116
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,080
Yes.

117
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,270
Wait.

118
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,270
Jiang Si has long severed ties

119
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,190
with our family.

120
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,040
This is the Letter of Disownment
between us.

121
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,270
A Letter of Disownment?

122
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,160
It's worthless.

123
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,510
Ancheng, what's going on?

124
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,470
Marquis,

125
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,120
this is not just a piece of paper.

126
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,510
It was stamped by our family seal

127
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,880
(Severed all ties; Jiang Si)
and Capital Security.

128
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,360
Do you think

129
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,950
this can absolve you?

130
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,870
Don't think about it.

131
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Marquis, tearing it
won't change anything.

132
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,560
This document has been filed
in Capital Security.

133
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,070
According to the law,

134
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,750
with this document,

135
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,000
whether Jiang Si is guilty

136
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,920
or holds power

137
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,270
has nothing to do

138
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,270
with us.

139
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,560
Marquis,

140
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,960
please release my innocent family.

141
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,240
If you have any objections,

142
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,440
we can go to His Majesty.

143
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,440
I'm surprised

144
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,630
that Jiang Si left this backup plan.

145
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,840
But I don't believe

146
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,390
your family

147
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,670
can escape unscathed.

148
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,040
Listen up.

149
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,910
This mansion is to be strictly guarded.

150
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,270
No one is allowed in or out

151
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:59,550
to prevent any communication
with Nanwu.

152
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,560
Yes.

153
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,510
Grandmother, are you okay?

154
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,820
(With all ties severed,
I'm not a Jiang anymore.)

155
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,510
Did Si give you this?

156
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,440
Yes.

157
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,080

158
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,920

159
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,320
please bring this back.

This must be your hidden motive.

163
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,480
Don't worry, Si.

164
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,610
I'll take care of things at home.

165
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,150
So,

166
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,120
that day,

167

how Si is now.

(Peace and Prosperity)

203
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,170
There's no such thing as Nanwu's spells.

204
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,240
Si got

205
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,270
the prescription

206
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,870
for my eyes

207
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:11,810
from an old folk book.

208
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,830
She got the herbs
from the Imperial Pharmacy.

209
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,270
Your Highness,

210
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,270
don't be fooled by this witch.

211
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,960
If there are no spells of Nanwu,

212
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,400
then why have the imperial physicians

213
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,400
and the famous physicians

214
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,420
failed to treat it

215
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,320
after so many years

216
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,670
while she alone found the cure?

217
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,470
Marquis Changxing, don't you understand

218
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:28,490
what coincidence means?

219
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,390
Or do you and your officers

220
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,320
just guess at cases?

221
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,110
Fuqing.

222
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,390
(Sunshine and Luxury)

223
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,480
Today, both chief judges are here.

224
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,390
I want to speak

225
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,550
on behalf of Princess Yan.

226
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,600
She's warm-hearted,

227
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,150
kind, and clear-minded.

228
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:48,320
You cannot condemn her
because of her identity.

229
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,270
Without evidence,

230
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,490
it may be hard to convince the public.

231
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,010
Rest assured, Your Highness.

232
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,630
I will get to the bottom of this.

233
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:58,630
Good.

234
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:02,080
Well said, Mr. Zhen.

235
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,150
Rest assured, Your Highness.

236
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,080
We've found the evidence.

237
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,270
We will not let any wrongdoer
go unpunished.

238
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,360
What evidence?

239
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,390
A solid one.

240
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,080
I'll present it to His Majesty shortly.

241
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,240
You'll know soon enough, Your Highness.

242
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,120
Right, Mr. Zhen?

243
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,720
Sorry for disturbing you today.

244
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,330
As things have been clarified,

245
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,240
I'll take my leave now.

246
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,750
I take my leave.

247
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,320
Mr. Zhen, please stay.

248
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,230
Mr. Zhen,

249
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,840
I have something to discuss with you.

250
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:06,230
Consort Xian.

251
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,800
Consort Xian.

252
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,200
It's your turn.

253
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,680
Your Majesty.

254
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:22,960
What is this about?

255
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,550
If you're pleading for Jin and his wife,

256
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,390
save it.

257
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,240
I'm not pleading for them.

258
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,240
I'm suing the Grand Princess.

259
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:36,990
Why?

260
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,240
Rongyang incriminated your son
and daughter-in-law,

261
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,820
so you want to accuse her?

262
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,270
You've learned to frame others now?

263
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,630
It was the Grand Princess who altered

264
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,240
the celestial signs when Jin was born,

265
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,480
slandering him as an unlucky man.

266
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,590
Who told you this?

267
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,550
What proof do you have?

268
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,320
I have no proof of this,

269
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,600
but the Grand Princess has committed

270
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,120
many other wrongdoings.

271
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,080
Actually,

272
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,510
Mother and I wanted to save Jin and Si,

273
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,270
so what we told Marquis Changxing

274
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,910
was a lie.

275
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,030
Is there a hidden truth?

276
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,150
Listen.

277
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,720
Si does know Nanwu's secret spells,

278
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,200
and my blindness is

279
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,150
indeed caused

280
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:17,990
by the Nanwu worm.

281
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,280
Moreover,

282
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,150
it was the Grand Princess

283
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,790
who ordered to blind me.

284
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,790
This is the confession of Ms. Xu,

285
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,550
Grand Princess's wet nurse.

286
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,180
Your Majesty, please believe me.

287
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,120
Do you really believe

288
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,080
that Si would commit treason?

289
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,210
In my opinion,

290
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,700
it's the Grand Princess who's afraid

291
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,280
that her dealings with the Nanwu woman

292
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,990
and the harm she caused will be exposed,

293
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:44,440
so she's accusing others first.

294
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:46,840
So what if Jiang Si bears

295
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,680
that totem?

296
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,440
She is from Dazhou!

297
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,870
She married our Prince!

298
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,080
Is she insane?

299
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,080
Why would she work

300
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,670
for the Nanwu she's never even been to?

301
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,630
Your Majesty, you must understand

302
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,360
such a simple logic, right?

303
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,000
I've handled many cases.

304
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,150
Every crime has a motive.

305
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,080
But I truly can't understand

306
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,670
why the Grand Princess would harm you.

307
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:10,970
It was because I knew she killed

308
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,910
the late Empress.

309
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,630
Why only present

310
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,870
the confession now?

311
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,580
The document won't change on its own,

312
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,810
but people may change it.

313
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,270
I fear that Ms. Xu
might retract her statement

314
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,390
and turn against us.

315
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,390
Even if I'm not the smartest,

316
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,420
after being set up so many times,

317
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,120
I should have learned to think.

318
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,120
Alright, get up.

319
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:41,910
You've always been overbearing.

320
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,630
Who would dare to set you up?

321
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:44,870
You know very well

322
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,920
who is

323
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,160
the overbearing one

324
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,840
in the harem,

325
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,630
no, in Ling'an

326
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
and the entire Dazhou.

327
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,960
It's your sister, Rongyang.

328
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,870
She thinks because she saved your life,

329
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:59,250
she can do whatever she wants
and trample on human lives.

330
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,110
Enough!

331
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,540
If you speak recklessly again,

332
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:02,750
you'll be confined

333
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,480
in Jinhua Hall for a month.

334
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,030
Is a month enough?

335
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:11,830
How about making it longer?

336
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,340
You can just lock up my son and I

337
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,510
for a lifetime.

338
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,590
Nonsense.

339
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:30,910
Your Highness.

340
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,300
(Blessings and Clarity)
If this is exposed,

341
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,550
it will put Mother and I

342
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,510
in danger.

343
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,350
But now,

344
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:41,410
Si has been thrown into prison
because of this,

345
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:42,960
so I'm not sure

346
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,310
if I should continue

347
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,680
to keep this secret.

348
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,240
In my opinion,

349
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,270
you hid the cause

350
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,260
of the blindness earlier

351
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,680
to protect the Empress.

352
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,110
Later, you hid the cure

353
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,110
to protect Prince and Princess Yan.

354
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,830
But all you've done has played

355
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,260
right into the Grand Princess's hands.

356
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:01,750
So, Mr. Zhen,

357
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,830
what should I do?

358
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:03,910
Speak out.

359
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,450
Facts speak louder than anything.

360
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,960
Tell His Majesty everything.

361
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,750
Will that really help?

362
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,840
Some things

363
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,480
cannot be kept hidden.

364
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,200
They'll come to light sooner or later.

365
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,130
Your Highness,

366
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:18,270
if you need some courage,

367
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,750
(Blessings and Clarity)

368
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,920
I can go with you.

369
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:24,870
Mr. Zhen,

370
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:26,830
I have a question

371
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,270
for you.

372
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:30,510
What is it?

373
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,920
Why did you refuse

374
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,070
to marry me that day?

375
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,080
This...

376
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,190
Your Highness,

377
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,400
have some lotus seed tea to cool down.

378
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:48,400
I've been schemed against by an outsider

379
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,750
for all these years,

380
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,160
and I haven't won once.

381
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,270
I originally thought

382
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,480
Jiang Si was a woman with spirit,

383
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,070
but in the end,

384
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,830
I overestimated myself.

385
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,160
Mother, haven't I warned you

386
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:10,980
not to give that confession to Father?

387
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:13,270
What you did won't help Jin

388
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,610
but only harm us.

389
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,470
How rebellious.

390
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,100
How dare you blame me?

391
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,360
Do you think I don't know

392
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,880
the first one to report Jin and Si

393
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,750
was you?

394
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,040
Zhang,

395
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,270
how can you team up
with the Grand Princess

396
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:31,790
to harm your family?

397
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,830
Jin was enchanted by a witch.

398
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,200
I was trying to eliminate
the threat to Dazhou.

399
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,200
What's wrong with that?

400
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,000
That's your real brother!

401
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,550
If something

402
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:42,720
happens to him,

403
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:47,450
I won't have a son who betrayed

404
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,060
his family like you.

405
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,350
Mother, you admit

406
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,640
he's my real brother now?

407
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,310
Are you going to abandon me

408
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,270
for his sake?

409
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,800
In the past,

410
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,790
everyone said Jin was an ill-fated man.

411
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,400
I had no choice.

412
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:04,920
But now,

413
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,030
we can prove

414
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,160
his innocence.

415
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:09,310
Why can't you stand united?

416
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,510
As long as one

417
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,030
of you two

418
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,110
can rise to power,

419
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,480
our future

420
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,000
will be secure.

421
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,040
Zhang,

422
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,310
do you understand?

423
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,430
Yes.

424
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,720
You care

425
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,640
about neither of us.

426
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,880
You only care which one of us

427
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,750
can help you become the Empress Dowager.

428
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,220
(Ms. Duo from Changle Palace)

429
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,270
Dozens of Nanwu spies hid in the harem?

430
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,650
Even the Empress's personal maid,

431
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:22,690
Ms. Duo, is one of them.

432
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,550
Your Majesty, please let me

433
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,400
apprehend all the spies

434
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,550
on this list.

435
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,080
If they're from Nanwu,

436
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,000
we can be sure

437
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,400
that Princess Yan committed treason.

438
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,550
She should be executed,
with her entire clan eradicated.

439
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,420
Arrest them.

440
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,720
Yes, Your Majesty.

441
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,200
Mr. Zhen, why do you remain silent?

442
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:46,590
Your Majesty,

443
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,720
I also

444
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,200
have something to present.

445
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,960
This is a torn fragment

446
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,090
from the very list in your hand.

447
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,350
I've checked

448
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,560
that this paper

449
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,310
is no ordinary paper

450
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,550
but the rare and highly valuable

451
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,480
Chengxintang Paper.

452
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,350
Chengxintang Paper is worth a fortune.

453
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:11,070
Even I am reluctant to use it lightly.

454
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,510
Have you ever given

455
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,960
such paper to anyone?

456
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,580
Mr. Zhen, the evidence is clear.

457
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,980
His Majesty has ordered the arrests,

458
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,310
yet you keep evading the topic.

459
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,410
What is your intention?

460
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:21,910
Go on.

461
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,110
I believe

462
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,550
this list is a fabrication.

463
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:27,310
If all the maids on it

464
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,920
are truly Nanwu spies,

465
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:31,240
then the traitor working with Nanwu

466
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,030
might be someone else.

467
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,750
Everyone I questioned

468
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,230
has spoken in Jiang Si's defense.

469
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,960
Even the always
just and impartial Mr. Zhen

470
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,800
holds the same view.

471
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,880
That is enough to prove

472
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,160
that witch has bewitched them all.

473
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,150
Marquis,

474
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,480
may I ask

475
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,510
if you have any solid evidence?

476
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,110
I...

477
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,880
Your Majesty, when I first heard

478
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,590
that Princess Yan was the Saintess,

479
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,640
I also found it

480
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,720
utterly absurd and difficult to accept.

481
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,400
But upon further reflection,

482
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,680
I wonder if there is any law

483
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,880
that convicts a person

484
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,790
based solely on their identity.

485
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,590
The law wants people to be upright.

486
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:09,020
Is that not the very foundation
of the laws you established?

487
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,460
Jiang Si hasn't broken any law

488
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,300
or committed treason.

489
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,690
Though she's Nanwu's Saintess,

490
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,750
I believe

491
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,310
- she is innocent.
- If she's declared innocent,

492
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,960
how will the officials

493
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:18,920
accept it?

494
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,110
Are you thinking only of Prince Yan

495
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:24,110
and not of His Majesty?

496
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,030
The Saintess's identity is exposed,

497
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,510
and Emperor Jingming has imprisoned her.

498
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:44,170
She could be executed at any time.

499
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,000
That day, we should've taken her away,

500
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,790
so things wouldn't be like this.

501
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:49,770
Save the Saintess first.

502
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,840
Will the spies

503
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,940
in the Palace be useful?

504
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,100
This is the important item

505
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,160
I returned to retrieve.

506
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,030
A map of the secret passages.

507
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,360
Over the years I've been lurking
in the Palace,

508
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,590
besides passing intel
to the Grand Elder,

509
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:05,980
I also found a hidden passage.

510
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,400
It was built

511
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,070
by Emperor Jingming

512
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,270
after Prince Xiang's rebellion.

513
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,440
The tunnels are intricate

514
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,280
and maze-like.

515
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,130
A single misstep

516
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:14,890
can cause the intruder
to be lost forever.

517
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:15,750
That cunning old fox

518
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,200
truly is devious.

519
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:20,920
- Keep it.
- But even with this,

520
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,310
it's still not enough.

521
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,800
Prince Yan.

522
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,160
Why are you here?

523
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,320
I followed you.

524
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,790
The prison is heavily guarded.

525
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,890
Even if you manage
to sneak into the Palace

526
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,440
through the secret passage,

527
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,500
getting into the prison is impossible.

528
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,520
Ignore him.

529
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,920
He is a Prince of Dazhou.

530
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,960
Even if his wife is imprisoned,

531
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:42,240
he would never help us.

532
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,240
It is because my wife

533
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,550
has been thrown into prison

534
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,200
that I must cooperate with you.

535
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:56,140
(Grand Princess's Mansion)

536
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,310
His Majesty

537
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:04,270
will believe Zhen Heng

538
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,590
and declare them innocent?

539
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,110
There is no final verdict yet.

540
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:10,160
But in my opinion,

541
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:13,070
His Majesty has wavered.

542
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,480
At the very least,

543
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,510
the death sentence can be avoided.

544
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,880
Since His Majesty is soft,

545
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,590
then let me handle it.

546
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,310
(It seems I must rescue
the Saintess asap.)

547
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:27,910
Shijiu,

548
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:29,880
send a message to Han Ran.

549
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:31,720
At the Mao hour tomorrow,

550
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,680
secretly open the Palace's side gate.

551
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,040
Marquis.

552
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,480
Your Highness.

553
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,680
Please rid Dazhou of evil.

554
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:47,550
You act solely
for the good of the nation.

555
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,790
I vow to follow you unto death.

556
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,320
Uncle.

557
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,240
Long Dan.

558
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,350
Have you found out

559
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,550
anything about Si?

560
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,200
Miss Jiang Si has been imprisoned.

561
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,070
Was it the Grand Princess

562
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,450
who accused her before His Majesty?

563
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,790
I knew it.

564
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,270
Si was right.

565
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,270
No matter how much we retreat,

566
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:20,110
she will never let us go.

567
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,720
Long Dan,

568
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:25,270
can you take me out of here?

569
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,240
Ancheng,

570
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,160
where are you going?

571
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,880
To save my daughter.

572
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:32,910
To submit

573
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:34,790
a memorial

574
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:37,030
that was delayed for 20 years.

575
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,280
Mother,

576
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:42,750
do you want to stop me

577
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,920
at this point?

578
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,320
Stop!

579
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:11,590
Who are you?

580
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:25,110
I'm Jiang Ancheng, a former official
of the Astronomy, Earl Dongping.

581
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,110
I have something to say.

582
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,680
(Jiang Ancheng, Earl Dongping)

583
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:34,160
On the 5 day of the 5th month
of the 3rd year of Jingming,

584
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:37,960
the Northern Star shone bright,

585
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,070
an auspicious omen.

586
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,270
That night, the 7th Prince was born.

587
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,790
It was a sign of harmony
between heaven and man.

588
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:50,160
I humbly request His Majesty's attention

589
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:54,240
so that heaven's favor may bless Dazhou
with an enduring reign.

590
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,080
Report this at once!

591
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,260
(Zhuque Gate)
I'm Jiang Ancheng, a former official

592
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:02,590
of the Astronomy, Earl Dongping.
I have something to say.

593
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,420
An order from above:

594
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,260
The Nanwu witch is
to be interrogated alone.

595
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,150
- Yes.
- Yes.

596
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,560
Move!

597
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,350
Jiang Si,

598
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:50,110
why are you not surprised

599
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,110
to see me?

600
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:53,400
Your tactics are nothing

601
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,880
more than petty tricks.

602
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,940
What's there to be surprised about?

603
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,270
Then

604
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,750
what about Jiang Ancheng?

605
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:03,310
Your father

606
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,880
cares deeply for you.

607
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,550
He actually dared

608
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,310
to kneel outside the Palace

609
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,240
and accuse me.

610
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:15,590
What?

611
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:18,400
I humbly request His Majesty's attention

612
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:23,400
so that heaven's favor may bless Dazhou
with an enduring reign.

613
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,480
He must not be allowed
to see His Majesty.

614
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,440
And I must never

615
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,720
see him again.

616
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,870
Yes.

617
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,790
Don't hurt my father!

618
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,000
Don't hurt my father!

619
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,740
You can do whatever you want to me.

620
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:36,960
I will agree to any terms.

621
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,270
Just don't harm my father!

622
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,520
Please.

623
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,350
I beg you! Don't hurt my father!

624
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,680
The Northern Star shone bright,

625
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:49,350
an auspicious omen.

626
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,070
I will agree to any terms.

627
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:52,310
Just don't harm my father!

628
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,000
You wretched woman!

629
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,510
You have no right

630
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:06,070
to bargain with me.

631
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:11,070
Father, why are you here?

632
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,480
Your Highness,

633
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,000
Si is imprisoned.

634
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,830
The only way to save her

635
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:18,310
is to bring down the Grand Princess.

636
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,070
I must submit a memorial

637
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,110
to inform His Majesty

638
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,750
of how the Grand Princess
falsified celestial omens

639
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,070
and framed you.

640
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:27,000
Should we not plan this carefully?

641
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:29,200
No need to dissuade me any longer.

642
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,270
I've always

643
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,240
been weak.

644
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,750
Si has suffered so much

645
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,440
because of my cowardice.

646
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,050
How can I sit idly by any longer

647
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,070
with the current situation?

648
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,280
Very well.

649
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,410
I'll take you to the Palace.

650
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,350
(Tiande Hall)

651
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,510
Your Majesty,

652
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:53,190
the Grand Princess

653
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,920
altered celestial omens

654
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:58,030
to frame the 7th Prince
as an ill-omened child.

655
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:01,110
She did this to divert blame
from General Cui's defeat,

656
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:03,920
as well as to stop Consort Xian
from being promoted

657
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,400
(Memorial from the Astronomy)
because of the 7th Prince.

658
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:07,880
She bribed the Astronomy

659
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,720
to alter the auspicious sign

660
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,030
on the 7th Prince's birth record.

661
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,880
With this, the blame
for the military failure

662
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,490
was shifted onto the newborn Prince.

663
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:16,950
She killed two birds with one stone.

664
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,920
Not only did it stop
Consort Xian's promotion,

665
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,310
but it protected General Cui

666
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:23,000
from the wrath
of the court and the people.

667
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,880
These are baseless accusations.

668
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,720
They are not.

669
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,720
I overheard their conversation

670
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,680
back then.

671
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,750
But to protect myself,

672
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,260
(An auspicious omen)
I remained silent.

673
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,400
But I refused to sink

674
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,480
to such depths,

675
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,440
so I chose to resign and return home.

676
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:43,430
Jin.

677
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,520
Here.

678
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,000
Do you know about this?

679
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:47,190
Yes.

680
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:53,590
I should place this branding iron

681
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:55,400
on your mouth

682
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,920
and burn your tongue with it.

683
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:02,830
That'd be the best.

684
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,200
Please...

685
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:07,960
I beg you.

686
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,720
Please spare my father.

687
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,640
What about Mingyue?

688
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,750
What about my daughter?

689
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:26,870
Father.

690
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:29,550
I do indeed feel wronged,

691
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,220
but I do not harbor resentment,

692
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,640
for I know that you

693
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,400
have also been deceived.

694
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:39,350
Very well, I understand.

695
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,160
You may all leave.

696
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,280
Your Majesty...

697
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:44,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

698
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,000
That's it?

699
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,400
What exactly does His Majesty intend?

700
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,350
To bring down the Grand Princess,

701
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,550
your words alone

702
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,560
are far from enough.

703
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:01,390
So...

704
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:09,200
Your Highness, the Emperor

705
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:10,440
urgently summons you.

706
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,480
Sorry for my failure.

707
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:23,300
Yu Jin protected Jiang Ancheng

708
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:24,990
and brought Ms. Duo into the Palace.

709
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,520
Go.

710
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:31,600
- Inform Marquis Changxing.
- Yes.

711
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,400
Thank you for bringing me
into the Palace.

712
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:36,160
Do you know you might die this time?

713
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:38,230
As long as the Saintess is unharmed,

714
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,440
my death will be worth it.

715
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,400
I'll leave the Saintess to you.

716
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,560
Rest assured.

717
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,480
Ms. Duo, come with me.

718
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,620
(Imperial Prison)

719
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,400
Summon Princess Fuqing in.

720
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,030
Greetings, Father.

721
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,630
Today, I've brought someone

722
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,960
for you to meet.

723
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:25,550
Who?

724
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,110
Ms. Duo has an important matter

725
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:37,230
to report to you.

726
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,800
Let her go.

727
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,640
- Yes.
- Yes.

728
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:42,320
What is it? Tell me.

729
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,760
Your Majesty,

730
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,510
Jiang Si is the Saintess of Nanwu,

731
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,510
but she has never had

732
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,590
any connection with us.

733
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:51,110
The true traitor is someone else.

734
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,000
It is your most beloved sister,

735
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,840
Rongyang.

736
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,800
Rongyang?

737
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,150
I have evidence to present.

738
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,920
This is the Slumber Flower,

739
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,760
unique to Nanwu.

740
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,000
With its pollen in water,

741
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,240
it'll be colorless and tasteless

742
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:09,160
but highly poisonous.

743
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,960
The Grand Princess once ordered someone

744
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,940
to use this to kill Su Ke,
Earl Dongping's wife,

745
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,920
the mother of Princess Yan.

746
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,800
Afterward, she ordered me

747
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,480
to blind Princess Fuqing

748
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:22,030
and lurk by Empress Di's side.

749
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,190
You're a spy from Nanwu.

750
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:26,270
Do you think I'll believe you

751
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:27,710
after just a few words?

752
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,800
Father,

753
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,800
everything Ms. Duo said is true.

754
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:31,910
When I was accidentally

755
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,190
locked in a cupboard back then,

756
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:34,480
I overheard

757
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,710
Aunt and Ms. Duo

758
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,700
discussing a plot
to kill the late Empress.

759
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:38,960
After this,

760
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,840
I lost my eyesight,

761
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:42,710
and then Ms. Duo

762
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,400
appeared beside me.

763
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,640
Are you saying

764
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,590
Rongyang planted Ms. Duo beside you

765
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:49,400
to keep an eye on you?

766
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,760
Yes.

767
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,230
I was too fearful back then

768
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,960
to reveal this for the sake

769
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,000
of Mother and I.

770
00:35:58,590 --> 00:35:59,230
But now,

771
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:00,370
Jiang Si, who once helped me,

772
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,900
has been framed by the Grand Princess

773
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,900
and thrown into prison.

774
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:05,230
So today, I wish to plead with you

775
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,580
to investigate the Grand Princess

776
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:07,840
and clear Jiang Si's name.

777
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:10,910
Ms. Duo,

778
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,680
do you realize

779
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,320
that by admitting to being

780
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,550
a Nanwu spy today,

781
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,070
you will never be able

782
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,760
to leave the Palace again?

783
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,520
I chose to enter the Palace.

784
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,440
I know what the outcome will be.

785
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:25,440
My death will be worth it,

786
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,440
if you, as the Emperor of Dazhou,

787
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,880
can tell right from wrong.

788
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,720
Saintess.

789
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,880
Your Majesty,

790
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,250
why summon me so urgently?

791
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:10,510
Rongyang,

792
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,120
do you know

793
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:16,400
Ms. Duo's true identity?

794
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,230
She is a Nanwu spy.

795
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,110
Today, she came

796
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:27,360
to accuse you of your crimes.

797
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:29,510
How interesting.

798
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:31,670
Your Majesty, please tell me more.

799
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,240
She said

800
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,400
you ordered her

801
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:36,320
to kill the late Empress.

802
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,360
The Grand Princess then worked with me

803
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,560
and promised to help me
enter the Palace,

804
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:42,840
but I had to help her kill

805
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,960
the Empress of Dazhou.

806
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,440
I killed the late Empress?

807
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:49,440
How could I conspire with Nanwu

808
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,840
to harm our late Empress?

809
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,160
She also said...

810
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,280
The Grand Princess once ordered someone

811
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,420
to use this to kill Su Ke,
Earl Dongping's wife,

812
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,360
the mother of Princess Yan.

813
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:04,510
Are you saying

814
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:08,360
that Su Ke's death
is also related to me?

815
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:10,230
Haven't you always resented her?

816
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:11,990
Isn't that so?

817
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:17,150
Your Majesty,

818
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,960
Su Ke's death has nothing to do with me.

819
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,280
So, Fuqing's blindness years ago

820
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,060
also has nothing to do with you, right?

821
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,550
This is the very Nanwu worm

822
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:29,190
that caused Princess Fuqing's

823
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,320
blindness.

824
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,600
Of course.

825
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:34,320
You know me the best.

826
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,320
You must not be deceived

827
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,070
by those crafty Nanwu people.

828
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,000
Ms. Duo and Jiang Si

829
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:42,030
must've colluded together,

830
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,590
using any means to falsely accuse me.

831
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,160
So,

832
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:48,590
you didn't sell

833
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,510
Dazhou's war horses to Nanwu,

834
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,710
right?

835
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,880
For more money,

836
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,190
the Grand Princess

837
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:56,180
sold Dazhou's war horses to Nanwu.

838
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,020
(Ledger)

839
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,880
This ledger contains
the transaction details.

840
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:00,190
Impossible.

841
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,200
Very well.

842
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,160
I believe you.

843
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,230
I also think it is impossible.

844
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,440
Baoping, prepare the tea.

845
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,720
Rongyang,

846
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,250
you've come under the scorching sun.

847
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,550
You must be thirsty.

848
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,110
I've heard that tea made
with this flower

849
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,230
is the sweetest.

850
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:19,400
Try it for me.

851
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:32,730
Why aren't you drinking?

852
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:36,870
Your Majesty,

853
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,590
what do you mean by this?

854
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:41,210
This is the Slumber Flower,

855
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:44,230
unique to Nanwu.

856
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:45,530
With its pollen in water,

857
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:46,770
it'll be colorless and tasteless

858
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,640
but highly poisonous.

859
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,400
The one in your hand

860
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,170
came from the Grand Princess's yard.

861
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,630
So, Your Majesty

862
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,280
has been waiting for me here.

863
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,760
When you were colluding with Nanwu,

864
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:59,060
did you ever consider me

865
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,160
your brother?

866
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,630
Didn't you also cause the death

867
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:03,190
of my only daughter?

868
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,550
I never imagined

869
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:06,840
you'd commit such a monstrous,

870
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,190
unforgivable act.

871
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:10,860
Do you have any final words?

872
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,230
Your Majesty,

873
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,070
the world has changed.

874
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,880
I don't need to drink

875
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:22,190
the poisoned tea.

876
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,720
Rongyang,

877
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,640
I never expected

878
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,440
that one day you would rebel.

879
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,070
I'm not rebelling.

880
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:48,280
I'm just protecting myself.

881
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,190
It was you

882
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:52,230
who pushed me

883
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,960
step by step to this point.

884
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:55,510
Over the years,

885
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,630
I've been exceedingly favored you.

886
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:00,070
What exactly do you want?

887
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,400
What do I want?

888
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:06,480
I want my daughter

889
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:07,670
to live safely,

890
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:11,840
my husband to love me,

891
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,230
and my brother

892
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,510
to never abandon me,

893
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,880
no matter what.

894
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:21,430
Your Majesty,

895
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,150
am I too greedy?

896
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,360
Which of my wishes can you fulfill?

897
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:28,480
I granted your marriage

898
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,030
to Cui Xu

899
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:32,360
and Mingyue's marriage

900
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,670
to Jin.

901
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,590
I've fulfilled all your wishes

902
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,920
and made you
the noblest Princess of Dazhou,

903
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,440
but in the end, you resent me.

904
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,710
What exactly do you want me to do?

905
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:46,030
I want you to kill Jiang Si.

906
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,880
She is the Saintess of Nanwu.

907
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:49,630
Yet you didn't kill her,

908
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,880
but try to poison me in turn.

909
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:53,550
Why?

910
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,680
Why is that?

911
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:55,710
That is a public affair;

912
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:56,840
you are my family.

913
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,760
Well said.

914
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:12,950
Your Majesty,

915
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:17,670
since you cannot avenge Mingyue,

916
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:20,230
then let me

917
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,960
avenge her death.

918
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,550
Jiang Si and Yu Jin

919
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,070
will die a horrible death.

920
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:33,030
I also want you to experience

921
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,670
the feeling of being forsaken

922
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:36,760
and losing a beloved child.

923
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:38,230
They must all die.

924
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,070
They must all die with my daughter.

925
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:45,400
Are you still the same Rongyang?

926
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,550
What have you changed into?

927
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,400
I barely recognize you anymore.

928
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:51,150
I haven't changed.

929
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:54,540
It's you who has changed.

930
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,590
My brother has never hurt me

931
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,440
and would never poison me.

932
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,230
From the moment you handed me

933
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:03,360
that cup of poisoned tea,

934
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:06,190
I no longer have a brother.

935
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,030
I truly regret it.

936
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:11,920
Regret what?

937
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,620
Regret putting you on the throne.

938
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:18,140
