(Open and Noble)

12
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,670
Do I have

13
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,490
to send Yi back to her maiden home?

14
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,230
Who said anything about that?

15
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,640
Sometimes,

16
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,080
I just get mad at you.

17
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,360
Why do you always take her side?

18
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,550
Son,

19
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,510
what's wrong with you today?

20
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,150
Before, whenever I asked you
to abandon her,

21
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,440
you'd fight me to the end.

22
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,120
Why did you

23
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,160
bring it up yourself today?

24
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,420
Aren't I just worried

25
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,560
that you might act on impulse

26
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,710
and actually send her back?

27
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,990
If you were only saying it in anger,

28
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,510
you should've told me sooner,

29
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,330
so I wouldn't be so worried.

30
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,480
If I told you,

31
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,520
I'm afraid

32
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,490
you'd run straight to Yi
and tell her everything.

33
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,880
Then she'd become even more defiant,

34
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,710
showing me

35
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:37,880
even less respect.

36
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,270
Fine, let's not mention that.

37
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,520
She's always

38
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,790
with her sister now.

39
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,790
Even our relationship

40
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,420
isn't as close as before.

41
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,600
She's just an unmarried girl.

42
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,390
One day,

43
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,420
she'll return
to Earl Dongping's Mansion.

44
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,510
She won't be here for long.

45
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,910
You should hurry and send someone

46
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,750
to find Qing'er.

47
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,040
Where has she gone?

48
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,360
Yes.

49
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,510
Miss Jiang.

50
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,240
Miss Jiang.

51
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,270
It's you who saved me?

52
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,920
Just as you predicted,

53
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,630
Zhu Ziyu never intended

54
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,640
to keep his promise.

55
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,480
The moment he found me useless,

56
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,710
he wanted to kill me.

57
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,000
You saved my life.

58
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,360
I will surely repay this debt.

59
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,760
No need to be so formal.

60
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,080
Let her be formal.

61
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,230
We need your help with something.

62
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,390
Is Qing'er taken care of?

63
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,240
Yes.

64
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,560
I've ensured

65
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,710
that she vanished without a trace.

66
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,830
Young Master, where is my sister?

67
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,270
Please let her go.

68
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:34,800
Deliver a letter for me.

69
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,950
If you do as I say,

70
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,470
once the task is done,

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,640
not only will I let your sister go,

72
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,670
but I will also grant her freedom.

73
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,870
But if you can't even

74
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,030
handle such a small matter,

75
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,440
then consider

76
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,590
what might happen to her.

77
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,150
Very good.

78
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,840
Miss Yu'er.

79
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,760
Someone is waiting for you
in the carriage.

80
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,440
Yu'er.

81
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,590
Qing'er.

82
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,030
Yu'er, get in.

83
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,390
Qing'er, are you alright?

84
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,830
Zhu Ziyu has promised me.

85
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,200
Soon, he will set you free.

86
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,760
But why are you

87
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,470
with Miss Jiang?

88
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,240
Set me free?

89
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,480
In Zhu Ziyu's eyes,

90
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,510
I am already

91
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,560
a lifeless corpse.

92
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,910
Of course, I am free.

93
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,030
What do you mean?

94
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:02,950
Zhu Ziyu feared my betrayal

95
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,240
and tried to kill me.

96
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,230
Luckily, Miss Jiang and Mr. Yu

97
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,710
saved me despite our past grievances.

98
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,630
Otherwise, you and I

99
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,000
would've been separated by death.

100
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,640
Yu'er,

101
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,080
you seem to be in a hurry.

102
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,470
Are you going

103
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,270
to deliver a letter for Zhu Ziyu?

104
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,390
This...

105
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,270
It's alright, Yu'er.

106
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,680
Zhu Ziyu is not to be trusted.

107
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,000
Now, our only chance

108
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,080
is to help Miss Jiang.

109
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,510
Let's give the letter to her.

110
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,150
The plan has changed.
Await further instructions.

111
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,640
Wait.

112
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:56,710
Don't worry, Yu'er.

113
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,960
I have a way

114
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,510
to set you two free.

115
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,880
Miss,

116
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,880
Zhu Ziyu sent Qing'er again.

117
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,390
He said

118
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,240
he was waiting for you
in a hidden house.

119
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,540
He had something important to say

120
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,270
and asked me to take you there.

121
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,270
Mr. Zhu,

122
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,640
the letter has been delivered.

123
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,390
That lady said

124
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,390
she was waiting for you
in a hidden house

125
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,150
and asked me to bring you there.

126
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,560
She's too eager.

127
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,470
Mr. Zhu,

128
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,160
the lady is inside.

129
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,240
If it was just a rumor,

130
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,400
how could I have returned unharmed?

131
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,720
It's the abandoned house

132
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,710
on Carp Lane ahead.

133
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,560
A beauty awaits me.

134
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,200
Who are you trying to fool?

135
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,670
Has Mrs. Zhu Ziyu

136
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,720
lost her mind?

137
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,800
You don't believe me?

138
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,830
Seeing is believing.

139
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,710
I'll take you there myself.

140
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,120
It's just ahead.

141
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,960
We're almost there.

142
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,840
Let's go.

143
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,230
I miss you so much.

144
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,950
Give me more time.

145
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:48,920
I'll find a way

146
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,110
to abandon Jiang Yi.

147
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,180
No.

148
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,470
I'll kill Jiang Yi.

149
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,280
How much longer do I have to wait?

150
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,920
If this continues,

151
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,230
I might start to doubt

152
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:18,790
how true

153
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,280
your feelings for me are.

154
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:22,630
(Before,)

155
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,240
(to harm my sister, Cui Mingyue)

156
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,620
(had been spying on the Zhu family)

157
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,680
(but didn't collaborate with Zhu Ziyu.)

158
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,350
(To my surprise,)

159
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,110
(after all those changes,)

160
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,200
(they ended up conspiring together)

161
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,080
(to kill my sister.)

162
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,440
Heaven and earth can testify

163
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,380
to my feelings for you.

164
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,870
But her sister is quite troublesome,

165
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,720
and she has

166
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,020
a skilled Commandant by her side.

167
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,320
A Commandant?

168
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,070
It's Yu Qi from Capital Security.

169
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,440
Yu Qi?

170
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,630
He's come to Lingshui?

171
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,230
Do you know Yu Qi?

172
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,710
How would I know him?

173
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,390
Ziyu,

174
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,520
are you saying

175
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,280
as long as Jiang Si stays,

176
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,750
you won't be able to make a move?

177
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,270
She even ruined our meticulous plan

178
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,470
at Yunshui Tower.

179
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,710
I fear if we act recklessly,

180
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,050
we'll leave evidence behind.

181
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,560
Didn't Qing'er already reveal herself?

182
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,440
Why still use her to pass messages?

183
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,110
Don't worry.

184
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,710
Qing'er has been killed.

185
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,830
Since she's of no use,

186
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,690
it's better she's gone for good.

187
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,750
That's her twin sister, Yu'er.

188
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,950
They just look alike.

189
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,400
Once it's done,

190
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:38,750
they won't be alive.

191
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,440
What about Meng Nan

192
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,750
from Caiyun Troupe?

193
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,520
He said he'd stay by my side every day

194
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,920
to cheer me up.

195
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,560
How dare an actor

196
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:53,400
like him entertain such fantasies?

197
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:55,200
How dare a lowly man

198
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,560
like him stain your eyes?

199
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,710
He's good at drumming

200
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,870
and has a bit of charm.

201
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,470
He's kept around

202
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,350
for amusement.

203
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,590
After all,

204
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,590
you can't be with me every day.

205
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,630
I want to be with you day and night,

206
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,590
forever and always.

207
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,200
Your Grace, you promised me

208
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,630
you'd marry me, right?

209
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,600
You can never

210
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,160
look at other men again.

211
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:27,990
It's just ahead.

212
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:28,900
We're almost there.

213
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,680
Meng is a fool.

214
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:32,750
I had him spread rumors

215
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,950
about Jiang Yi,

216
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,990
and he actually did it.

217
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,280
I'm just afraid
he'll blurt out the truth

218
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:40,910
if he's arrested.

219
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,040
What truth?

220
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:43,750
Since the beginning,

221
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,440
he's never seen my true face.

222
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,840
You've never appeared either.

223
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,440
It was always Qing'er passing messages.

224
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:49,750
Are you scared?

225
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,560
As you wish.

226
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,990
- It's here.
- It's here.

227
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,560
Push the door open.

228
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,280
You've brought them here?

229
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:02,320
- Don't worry. I'm here.
- Open the door.

230
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,040
- Open the door!
- Open the door!

231
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,320
We can't leave from both doors now.

232
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,040
There's even nowhere to hide.

233
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,080
You fool, we're trapped.

234
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,280
Let's go.

235
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:29,120
- Meng Nan.
- It's a man

236
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,230
meeting with Mr. Meng?

237
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,830
Aren't you blind?

238
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,230
Don't you see the woman behind him?

239
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:36,750
Oh.

240
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,600
Indeed.

241
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,590
Who are you?

242
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,180
This is my family's place.

243
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,130
Get lost now!

244
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,400
Darling, are you alright?

245
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,550
Don't leave yet.

246
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,390
Yi.

247
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,870
Was Ziyu calling for you just now?

248
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,320
- Yi.
- You're keeping a mistress secretly.

249
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,320
Now that you've been caught,

250
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:02,840
you're using my sister

251
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,990
as a shield?

252
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,750
Honey, I see. You love someone else.

253
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,110
Is it because of her

254
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:10,780
that you went to such lengths

255
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:11,800
to harm me?

256
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,750
Yi, it's a misunderstanding.

257
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,720
Don't listen
to your sister's instigation.

258
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,570
At this point,

259
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:19,160
how dare you say I'm instigating this?

260
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,520
A lone man and a woman
in a secret alley.

261
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,040
What misunderstanding could there be?

262
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,160
Explain yourself.

263
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,990
Let everyone judge.

264
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,350
Right.

265
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:29,950
Miss,

266
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,950
how long do you plan to hide?

267
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,120
You dared to meet with a married man,

268
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,630
but you lack the courage to admit it?

269
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,440
Let everyone see

270
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,560
whose daughter this is.

271
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,800
Jiang Si, how dare you.

272
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,590
Who could be as bold as you?

273
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:50,870
You know her?

274
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,560
Cui Mingyue.

275
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:57,630
How powerful the Grand Princess is.

276
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,520
You've kept the news so well.

277
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,000
Not long ago,

278
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,750
Cui Mingyue attempted
to kill my brother,

279
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,630
so she was demoted by His Majesty.

280
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,240
Now, she's even more resentful

281
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,320
toward our family.

282
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,560
Do you really think

283
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:12,710
the only daughter of the Grand Princess

284
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,950
would like you?

285
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:18,160
Which one do you trust, her or me?

286
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,320
It's up to you.

287
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,230
Let go.

288
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,950
Since you've seen

289
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,040
that Mingyue and I are in love,

290
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,080
let's part on good terms.

291
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,280
(It's her.)

292
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:35,870
(The Grand Princess.)

293
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,680
Mother.

294
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,280
Your Highness.

295
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,710
Mingyue and I are in love.

296
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,440
I hope you can approve.

297
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,280
Mother,

298
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,110
I was deceived by Zhu Ziyu.

299
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,400
When I first arrived here,

300
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,670
he showered me with sweet words

301
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,890
and was persistent and clingy.

302
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,680
Mother, please believe me.

303
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,110
Zhu Ziyu, be wise.

304
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,720
If you dare to pester her again,

305
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:10,520
I'll take your life.

306
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,630
Your Highness,

307
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,630
shielding the County Princess like this

308
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:18,800
is aiding evil.

309
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:19,870
How dare you!

310
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,790
The County Princess
disregards others' lives,

311
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,000
treating them like ants.

312
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,590
One day, this will lead

313
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,110
to a mistake that can't be undone.

314
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,510
Are you teaching me

315
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,110
how to discipline my daughter?

316
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:34,040
You know the best how His Majesty

317
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:36,070
dealt with the only son
of Marquis Changxing

318
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,000
when he made a mistake.

319
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,480
Jiang Si, you're bold.

320
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,870
The County Princess said

321
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,310
Zhu Ziyu deceived you

322
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,240
with sweet words,

323
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,390
but I think

324
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,160
this was a trap

325
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,280
you carefully set up

326
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,110
for my sister

327
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,760
to avenge your demotion.

328
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,590
You're sharp-tongued,

329
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,560
but I detest

330
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,040
being threatened.

331
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,430
Stop!

332
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,250
What are you trying to do?

333
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,630
You must be Yu Qi.

334
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,720
Is Lingshui also

335
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,390
under the control of Capital Security?

336
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,960
We're not like you

337
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,880
who can rule

338
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,550
and domineer over everyone

339
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:22,630
inside or outside Ling'an.

340
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,730
Yu Qi, how dare you

341
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,060
speak ill of the Grand Princess?

342
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:27,950
I wouldn't dare.

343
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,590
I can't ignore the law

344
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:31,670
like the County Princess.

345
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,550
Let me remind you.

346
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,070
His Majesty has had a verdict

347
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,280
on the Jinshui River Case.

348
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,280
Mingyue is merely a victim.

349
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,630
What happened today is already clear.

350
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,480
If you keep quiet,

351
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,960
I'll have no interest

352
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,590
in your lives.

353
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,110
(Since I can't avoid it,)

354
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,430
(I'll have to be ready for the battle.)

355
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,590
Yi, I was blind.

356
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,240
Please forgive me.

357
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,830
As you wish,

358
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:19,670
let's part ways.

359
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:24,860
(Zhu Mansion)

360
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,350
(Mr. Zhu)

361
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,190
You wretched child!

362
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,320
Bring the family punishment!

363
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:31,590
Today,

364
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,030
I must beat this son to death

365
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,560
to uphold our reputation.

366
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,320
- Honey.
- Don't interfere.

367
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,830
It's all your indulgence.

368
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,190
Yi,

369
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,720
don't worry.

370
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,350
I'll make sure this is resolved,

371
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:52,870
and justice will be served.

372
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,040
I only wish to part ways.

373
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,870
Yi, get up.

374
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,280
Yi,

375
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,760
my son Yu

376
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,960
has committed an unforgivable sin.

377
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,280
But, as you've not thought of yourself,

378
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,640
you should at least think of Yan.

379
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,960
After all, you're married.

380
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,630
What's so hard to overcome?

381
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,480
Yan...

382
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:20,800
Mr. Zhu,

383
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,450
if we're talking about justice,

384
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,450
this matter

385
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:24,480
should've been dealt with

386
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,390
at the court.

387
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,310
I...

388
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,800
It's because of Yan

389
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:28,980
that my sister would rather

390
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,080
discuss this privately.

391
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,760
With the current situation,

392
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,960
we must take Yan with us.

393
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,800
What right does an unmarried girl

394
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,550
like you have

395
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,240
to make decisions for your sister?

396
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,870
Yi,

397
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,000
I know

398
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,760
you won't be so cruel

399
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,110
to do this.

400
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:53,950
Right?

401
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,960
What will happen to a woman

402
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,350
like you with a daughter

403
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,440
after the divorce?

404
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,280
There's no need for you to worry.

405
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,520
Our family is declining,

406
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,320
but we can accommodate Yi.

407
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:08,630
Son,

408
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,590
kowtow and apologize to Yi,

409
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,190
and promise it won't happen again.

410
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,840
Yi,

411
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,310
I was vile and despicable.

412
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,520
I've betrayed you.

413
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,000
Yi,

414
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,560
please give me one more chance.

415
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,200
You tried to kill your wife

416
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,550
and committed adultery with a lady.

417
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:31,910
You're truly despicable.

418
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,590
Since my sister

419
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:34,550
has now seen

420
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,560
your true face,

421
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,350
how could she give you another chance

422
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,800
to continue your marriage?

423
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:43,960
Tried to kill his wife?

424
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,720
You can't make baseless accusations.

425
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,560
Mr. Zhu,

426
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,920
not long ago,

427
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,640
my sister almost lost her life

428
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,680
when a horse ran wild

429
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,960
on the road to Cloud Temple.

430
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,430
Have you investigated

431
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,830
the truth behind this?

432
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,430
Well...

433
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,320
I've long suspected

434
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:02,240
the mastermind behind that

435
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,390
was Zhu Ziyu.

436
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,520
At that time,

437
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,730
Commandant Yu was also there,

438
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,150
witnessing the whole incident.

439
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:09,350
Mr. Zhu,

440
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,670
have you thought this through?

441
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,680
If you don't agree to divorce,

442
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,030
we'll take accident

443
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,720
to the court.

444
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:17,270
If it turns out

445
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,110
to be related to Zhu Ziyu,

446
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,430
then you and your son's careers...

447
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,910
You'd better write
the Letter of Divorce now.

448
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,040
From now on,

449
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,520
my sister and your son

450
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:30,620
will part ways,

451
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,880
no longer involved in marriage,

452
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,870
death, or anything else.

453
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:35,320
Otherwise, we'll meet in court.

454
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,870
Since she wants a divorce,

455
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,590
let's grant her wish.

456
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,590
Didn't you always want

457
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:46,630
to get rid of her, Mother?

458
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,410
Today is just the right day.

459
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,830
And Yan

460
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,150
is just a girl.

461
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,080
She'll marry into another family.

462
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,680
If they want her,

463
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,000
let them take her.

464
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,150
We can't let this go to the court

465
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,000
and ruin my future.

466
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,080
You...

467
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:04,670

I, Zhu Ziyu, with my wife, Jiang,

think differently,
and it's hard to reconcile.

482
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:20,630
We seek a separation.

483
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:22,630
This document is written

484
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:24,240
to affirm our parting.

485
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,280
Our daughter

486
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,800
and boat of her dowry

487
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,190
will be with Jiang.

488
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,430
Our future marriages

489
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,150
won't be subject to disputes.

490
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,870
For future evidence,

491
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,670
I volunteer to write this contract.

492
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,430
Miss,

493
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,080
the rain has stopped,

494
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,390
and the sky is clear.

495
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,520
Qing'er, you go first.

496
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,830
If Zhu Ziyu catches you,

497
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,270
he won't let you go.

498
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:45,560
Yu'er, what will you do if I leave?

499
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:46,830
As long as you're well,

500
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,280
I'll be content.

501
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,480
My deed is still in his hands.

502
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,800
In this life,

503
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,350
I fear I'll be trapped here.

504
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,080
Give me Yu'er's deed.

505
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,240
What?

506
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,680
What Yu'er?

507
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,520
Continue.

508
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:01,390
Don't! I'll give it to you.

509
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:10,720
From now on,

510
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,350
if you dare to trouble them,

511
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:14,240
it'll be more than a beating.

512
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,080
Let's go.

513
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:40,630
Yu'er.

514
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,190
- Miss Si.
- Miss Si.

515
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:44,910
This is your deed.

516
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,790
From now on,

517
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:49,000
(Deed of Person)
you two

518
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,150
are free.

519
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:55,240
- Thank you, Miss Si.
- Get up.

520
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,960
Your Grace.

521
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:08,110
Your Grace.

522
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,830
I knew it.

523
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,080
You were just afraid
of the Grand Princess

524
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,320
to admit it,

525
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,490
but you still have feelings
for me, right?

526
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,560
What a fool.

527
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,190
You really think I'd care for you?

528
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,830
But I've been sincere

529
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,720
to you, Your Grace.

530
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,830
You even tried

531
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,150
to kill your wife.

532
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,830
How can you be sincere?

533
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,000
I've seen plenty

534
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,480
of snobs like you.

535
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,520
A little benefit is enough

536
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,110
to entice you.

537
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,870
Unfortunately,

538
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,910
you failed to kill Jiang Yi.

539
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,190
But

540
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,870
watching your marriage fall apart,

541
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,040
and seeing how desperate Jiang Yi is,

542
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,430
I found it quite amusing.

543
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:10,350
You played me like a puppet

544
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:12,670
and caused my family to fall apart

545
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,190
just for amusement?

546
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,760
What else?

547
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,720
Life is long,

548
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,870
and I have everything I need.

549
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:25,510
Of course, I need something

550
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,670
to entertain myself.

551
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,590
Zhu Ziyu,

552
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,670
you've seen it.

553
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,520
People who offend me

554
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,280
never end well.

555
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,320
So,

556
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:41,150
just give me what I want,

557
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:42,830
or else,

558
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:47,430
a broken family is just the beginning.

559
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,960
If all your family is killed...

560
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,720
What do you think?

561
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,000
That's more like it.

562
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:49,940
(Fenglin Inn)

563
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,110
Aunt, which one
do you think is prettier?

564
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,520
I think these two are pretty.

565
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,560
Then let's have them stand together.

566
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,590
Aunt.

567
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,160
- Yan, wait.
- What do you think...

568
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,000
Eat this wonton first.

569
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,110
Sure.

570
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,960
What should you say at this moment?

571
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,240
Thank you, Brother.

572
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,670
I'm not your brother.

573
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,200
I'm about the same age

574
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,560
as your aunt,

575
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:16,390
so you should call me Uncle.

576
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:18,670
That's Aunt, and I'm Uncle.

577
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:21,000
Thank you, Uncle.

578
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,830
- Good girl.
- Good girl.

579
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:23,670
Here.

580
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,190
Let me feed you.

581
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,110
Good.

582
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,630
Be careful. It's hot.

583
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,350
Take a sip of the soup.

584
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,560
Uncle is too busy looking at Aunt

585
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,350
to notice the wonton.

586
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,020
I didn't have time...

587
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:56,870
Alright, Yan.

588
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,150
Commandant Yu,

589
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,590
thank you for your help these days.

590
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,040
You're too kind.

591
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,350
Protecting the people

592
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,350
is the duty

593
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:08,200
of Capital Security.

594
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,200
Besides, Jiang Zhan and I

595
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,430
are close friends.

596
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,760
His family is my family.

597
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,400
Zhan is so lucky to have

598
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,390
a friend like you.

599
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:17,070
I'm also lucky to have

600
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:18,190
a friend like him.

601
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,830
It's fine. There's no redness.

602
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,870
Let me blow it for you.

603
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,190
From now on,

604
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,190
I'll leave those two in your care.

605
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,240
Don't worry.

606
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,160
With me here,

607
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,390
they'll have food to eat.

608
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,240
Miss Si,

609
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,560
actually,

610
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,880
I've always wanted to give you

611
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,720
this painting.

612
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,350
What's this?

613
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,520
Since you asked,

614
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,320
I'll tell you honestly.

615
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,390
The reason why I saved your sister

616
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:13,110
is for righteousness

617
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,430
and to repay kindness.

618
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,280
To repay kindness?

619
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:17,530
A life-saving kindness.

620
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:19,350
Your mother, Su Ke,

621
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:21,590
once saved my life.

622
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,390
My mother?

623
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,770
My parents died when I was young.

624
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:27,430
Before they passed,

625
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,320
they entrusted me to Caiyun Troupe.

626
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:32,520
When I was just past my coming-of-age,

627
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:34,630
they bullied me for being young

628
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,960
and alone.

629
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,960
I couldn't fight back,

630
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,590
but I didn't want

631
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:40,960
to yield to them,

632
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:42,750
so, in a fit of anger,

633
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:43,870
I ran away from the troupe.

634
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,680
But I didn't expect

635
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,320
to meet a human trafficker on the way

636
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,960
and almost got beaten to death.

637
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:50,670
Fortunately,

638
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,520
I was saved by Su Ke.

639
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:55,020
- Help me!
- You can't escape!

640
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:56,500
(Su Ke, Jiang Si's mother)
Help me!

641
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,350
Mr. Cui.

642
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,720
- Get lost.
- Yes.

643
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:05,350
Miss,

644
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:06,670
are you alright?

645
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:07,870
Miss?

646
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,040
- Miss?
- Miss?

647
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:11,760
The year Su Ke took me in

648
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,000
was the happiest time of my life.

649
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:25,390
Su was a lady

650
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:26,620
but she took in an actress.

651
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,870
Many people were gossiping about it.

652
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:32,280
Her father wanted to send me away,

653
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:34,040
but Su said

654
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,160
that they could gossip if they wanted,

655
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,280
and we shouldn't care.

656
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,150
Even if she sent me away,

657
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:41,190
they still wouldn't stop.

658
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,830
Though Su didn't care,

659
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,320
I didn't want to trouble her,

660
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,150
so I returned to Caiyun Troupe.

661
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,390
But her words

662
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,150
really enlightened me.

663
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,830
After that,

664
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,200
I no longer let rumors

665
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,800
affect me.

666
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,110
I promised her

667
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,800
that when I returned,

668
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,480
I would perform

669
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,040
the most beautiful dance for her.

670
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,560
Thank you,

671
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,560
Ms. Fei,

672
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,790
for telling me so much.

673
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,230
I lost my mother

674
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:15,230
right after I was born,

675
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,190
and I have

676
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,670
never met her.

677
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,230
All these years,

678
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:24,390
I've only been able to picture her

679
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:25,590
from others'

680
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,480
fragments of words.

681
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,280
Ms. Fei,

682
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,920
I envy you

683
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,560
for how you got to spend

684
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,840
so much time with her.

685
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:40,360
The world is vast. We'll meet again.

686
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,820
(Fenglin Inn)

687
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,680
Yan, slow down.

688
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,720
Be careful.

689
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,270
You go ahead and leave first.

690
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,800
Yes.

691
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,200
Mr. Yu.

692
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,310
I have something I don't understand.

693
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,590
Before we leave,

694
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:42,960
I want to ask you.

695
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,000
Go ahead.

696
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,360
The person observing

697
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,150
in the woods that day was you, right?

698
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,400
You must've made a mistake.

699
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:08,310
That day, I was on patrol elsewhere

700
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:09,800
and only rushed over

701
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,090
when I heard the startled horse.

702
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:17,270
You said I risked my life to save them,

703
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:19,750
but you did the same thing.

704
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:37,580
(Border of Ling'an)

705
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:40,540
(Earl Dongping's Mansion)

706
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,360
Greetings, Grandmother.

707
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,720
Yan,

708
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,110
kowtow to your great-grandmother.

709
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,300
Si,

710
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:04,560
you really have grown bold.

711
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:06,110
Now, is the family

712
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:08,110
under your control?

713
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,590
This is serious,

714
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,360
but you didn't even inform

715
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,360
your father and brother.

716
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,560
How can you

717
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,800
bring them back

718
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,560
without telling anyone?

719
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,840
Grandmother, it was my decision.

720
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:21,710
Si just couldn't bear to refuse me.

721
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,190
Alright, don't speak for her.

722
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,400
I know both of your tempers.

723
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,320
Mother,

724
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,840
this must be handled swiftly.

725
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,510
Yi has suffered greatly.

726
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:36,110
That Si saved Yi

727
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:37,710
from danger

728
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:39,750
is what matters.

729
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,000
It's understandable

730
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:43,810
that she didn't have time to tell us.

731
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,190
Both of you

732
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:48,460
are home now.

733
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,630
Si's engagement was canceled,

734
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:50,710
and Yi got a divorce.

735
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:53,560
What misdeeds have we done?

736
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,070
Grandmother,

737
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:56,800
it was Ji and Zhu

738
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,030
who had done misdeeds,

739
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,480
not Yi and Si.

740
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,840
I will uphold our family,

741
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:04,150
and no one will bully our girls again.

742
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,790
Yan, come on. Get up.

743
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,790
Go greet your great-grandmother.

744
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:15,880
Go on.

745
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,190
Great-grandmother.

746
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:30,710
Let me hold your hands, okay?

747
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:34,400
Yi, get up.

748
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:38,880
Please have two little red fruits,

749
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:40,880
one in each hand.

750
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:43,150
Hold them carefully.

751
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,680
Go on.

752
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:55,960
You have your happy lives to live.

753
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:59,080
From now on,

754
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,840
I won't interfere with your matters.

755
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:09,700
(Morning Drizzle)

756
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:12,860
(Haitang Chamber)

757
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,380
(The past is
like autumn leaves falling.)

758
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,720
(There's still enough time
to resolve every difficulty.)

759
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,060
You're lying to me, right?

760
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:29,230
Why would the Grand Princess
kill Yu Qi?

761
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,360
She's got what she wants.

762
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,400
Why would I lie to you?

763
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:33,590
Dazhou couldn't conquer Nanwu

764
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,250
and recently suffered a defeat.

765
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,860
The Grand Princess blamed everything

766
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:37,740
on Chiyu Cavalry

767
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,750
and beheaded

768
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,190
their leader, Yu Qi.

769
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:43,440
- Junior.
- How could this be?

770
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:45,110
How could this be?

771
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:45,960
Our people have been

772
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,230
at A Goose to Return for so long.

773
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:49,440
The news can't be wrong.

774
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,150
Yu Qi is really dead.

775
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,350
Mentor, the Grand Princess
and her daughter

776
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:01,660
killed my family and my husband.

777
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,190
I want to join you

778
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:04,310
in attacking Changle Palace.

779
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,560
I'll kill them

780
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,070
to avenge my family

781
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:08,560
and husband.

782
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:21,190
Jiang Si.

783
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,480
You're not dead.

784
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:27,440
You're the Saintess of Nanwu.

785
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,630
I'm not the Saintess of Nanwu.

786
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,230
I'm here for revenge.

787
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,590
The entire court

788
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,400
is under my command

789
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,560
and won't tolerate your insolence.

790
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:47,880
Then today,

791
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:50,080
we'll see whether it's your command

792
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:52,310
or my sword that decides this.

793
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,160
This

794
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:00,080
is for my family.

795
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,280
You and your daughter Cui Mingyue

796
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,440
have killed innocents.

797
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,550
My father, brother, and sister

798
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:08,920
all suffered and died because of you.

799
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,160
Today,

800
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,820
I will avenge them.

801
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,270
This

802
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,670
is for my husband,

803
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:20,110
Yu Qi.

804
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:26,020
Why did you have to kill him too?

805
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,440
Do you think

806
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:33,110
he was just the Yu Qi you knew?

807
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,150
Even if I die,

808
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:43,400
your life will never change.

809
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,600
Shut up!

810
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,000
I was born and raised

811
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:53,560
in Dazhou,

812
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,000
but you and your daughter

813
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,560
wanted to wipe me out,

814
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:00,710
leaving me no place in Dazhou.

815
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,560
This

816
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,960
is for myself.

817
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:43,750
I finally had my revenge.

818
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,310
I finally had my revenge.

819
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:49,630
(Now,)

820
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,310
(Zhan, Father,)

821
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:54,110
(and Yi)

822
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:55,670
(are safe and sound.)

823
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,150
(Maybe I'm no longer a jinx,)

824
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:01,400
(and Yu Qi will be safe too.)

825
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:05,020
