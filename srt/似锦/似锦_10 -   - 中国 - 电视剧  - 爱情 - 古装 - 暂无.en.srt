(Capital Security Office)

Qian still has me.

13
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:10,240
I can look after her.

14
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:11,850
Unlike Si

15
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,050
who's motherless.

16
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,930
Motherless?

17
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,600
Yes. Her mother died when she was born.

18
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,240
They call her a jinx.

19
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,320
Mrs. Zhen,

20
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:35,650
please.

21
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,250
Heng.

22
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:52,290
Good morning, Mother.

23
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,780
How did you sleep last night?

24
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,900
Thanks for your concern, Mother.

25
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,100
I had a good night's sleep.

26
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,260
Very well.

27
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,740
Where's Commandant Yu?

28
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,300
He didn't come to the office.

29
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,420
I think he's working on a case.

30
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,820
He and Miss Jiang Si

31
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,100
seem to be close.

32
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,820
He once saved her brother,

33
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,980
Jiang Zhan, on the Grill Ground.

34
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,700
Brother!

35
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,340
Who was it?

36
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,740
He's the savior of her family,

37
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,500
but others might think

38
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,420
they're a...

39
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:45,900
a couple.

40
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,700
Even if they really are,

41
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,620
I believe she won't

42
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,820
cross the line.

43
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,380
I wouldn't say the same

44
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,260
about Commandant Yu.

45
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,100
Heng,

46
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,940
I brought you chicken soup.

47
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,190
Take it while it's hot.

48
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:13,700
Thanks, Mother.

49
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,660
Mother,

50
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,660
it's so flavorful.

51
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,700
If you like it,

52
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,660
I'll make you soup every day.

53
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,580
Haitang Chamber remains the same.

54
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,780
I miss it so much.

55
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,460
Have a seat, Yi.

56
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,780
How has Zhan been lately?

57
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,500
Did he stir up trouble and get beaten?

58
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,460
The same as usual.

59
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,460
He's fine.

60
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,020
Have some water.

61
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,340
I can't stop worrying about him.

62
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,820
Si, I can't come home too often.

63
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,140
Only you can discipline him.

64
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,060
Rest assured.

65
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,340
I'll keep an eye on him.

66
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,100
I'm worried about you.

67
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,940
You can only come back

68
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:06,780
for the festivals.

69
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,020
We don't know

70
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,100
if you're well.

71
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,820
Father misses you dearly.

72
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,180
I'm good.

73
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,340
Don't worry about me.

74
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,900
Is your mother-in-law kind?

75
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,020
Do you and your husband fight?

76
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,780
Why ask?

77
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,900
I'm simply curious.

78
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,580
When they meant to marry me

79
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,580
into Duke An's Mansion,

80
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,540
I kept wondering

81
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,900
what it was like

82
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,220
to live with strangers

83
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,260
in a strange house.

84
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,780
Now that I'm single again,

85
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,020
and I won't

86
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,580
marry someone else soon,

87
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,460
I'm relieved.

88
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,100
It's normal to have such concerns,

89
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,500
but you need to learn to be tolerant

90
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,020
to get along well with others.

91
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,140
My husband and I respect each other.

92
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,700
We've never had a fight.

93
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,340
He always protects me.

94
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,460
My daughter, Yan, is sweet.

95
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,140
As strict as my mother-in-law is,

96
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,700
she isn't mean to me.

97
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,260
I'm content with my life.

98
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,340
Protecting you?

99
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,380
What's wrong?

100
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,140
What's your husband protecting you from?

101
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,140
His mother

102
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,100
still wants a grandson.

103
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,180
Ever since we got married,

104
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,380
I haven't given birth to a son.

105
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,220
She's unhappy about it, of course.

106
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,100
If I didn't ask,

107
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,700
you'd never

108
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,780
tell me anything.

109
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,140
No one's life is perfect.

110
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,700
Telling you that would only make you upset.

111
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:32,700
I'd be upset

112
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,700
if you hid it from me.

113
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,580
I feel we're estranged.

114
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,980
Are you threatening me, silly?

115
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,780
Long time no see.

116
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,340
You've somewhat changed.

117
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:43,980
Yi,

118
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,780
what else troubles you at their house?

119
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:46,900
Tell me everything.

120
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,380
Other girls wouldn't be so keen

121
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,820
on hearing their sisters' troubles.

122
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,460
There's none.

123
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,780
All is well.

124
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,100
All is well?

125
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,580
Really?

126
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,740
Look, if anything

127
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,340
upsets you in the future,

128
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,700
let me know

129
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,940
immediately,

130
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:05,780
alright?

131
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,020
Si,

132
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,020
what makes you say that?

133
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,580
Promise me that.

134
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,220
Fine. I promise.

135
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,460
Chief,

136
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,140
we've been staking out for a while.

137
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,340
The Surreal Wander seller hasn't shown up.

138
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,260
Did we somehow alert him?

139
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,300
(Black Market)
Didn't you check him out?

140
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,660
No one knows who he is.

141
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,100
He's a lone wolf

142
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,700
who comes and goes like a shadow.

143
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,060
It's not easy

144
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,140
to catch him.

145
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,220
Chief, there he is.

146
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,460
That braided man.

147
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,860
(200 Taels)

148
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,500
(20 Taels)

149
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,420
(10 Taels)

150
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,780
It's good. I'll take 100 grams.

151
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,460
Go and follow him.

152
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,300
Yes.

153
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,380
Chief, the buyer went straight home.

154
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,500
I found nothing suspicious.

155
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,580
Go and get prepared.

156
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,700
Catch that scorpion breeder next time.

157
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:16,700
Yes.

158
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,100
Aunt Xiao,

159
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,380
you've been managing

160
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,340
our house for decades.

161
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,060
It's time for you to rest.

162
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,340
I've been handling everything

163
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,500
in this mansion

164
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,460
all these years.

165
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,580
You can't take that away from me.

166
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,940
In terms of buying people over

167
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,300
to do dirty deeds,

168
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,180
I'm certainly not your match.

169
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,660
Later, I'll explain everything

170
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,620
to your grandmother.

171
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,100
Aunt Xiao, you probably don't know

172
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,620
that you'll have to rest in your room

173
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,060
for a few days

174
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,700
because Grandmother has

175
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,300
had you grounded.

176
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,700
That stupid Jiang Pei

177
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:02,700
must've sold me out.

178
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:04,860
Ms. Xiao,

179
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,220
Lady Jiang asked us

180
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,580
to escort you back.

181
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,420
I can walk.

182
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,340
I don't need you.

183
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,180
Watch your step, My Lady.

184
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,460
Good morning, My Lady.

185
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,460
My tiddlers need to eat.

186
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,860
Eat now!

187
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,020
There they are to eat.

188
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,100
You only come to me for food.

189
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,460
Eat up!

190
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:35,980
Grandmother.

191
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,500
Good morning, Grandmother.

192
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,980
Did you sleep well last night?

193
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,100
I was troubled

194
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,700
by all those things at home.

195
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,100
How could I

196
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,580
sleep well?

197
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,420
I'm sorry for troubling you

198
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,620
with my divorce.

199
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,180
Did you forget what I said?

200
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,340
Now that you're back,

201
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,460
no need to come to greet me every day.

202
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,420
Stay in your courtyard

203
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,980
and rest.

204
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,740
Why did you come so early?

205
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,250
Is there something wrong?

206
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,860
Nothing can get past you, Grandmother.

207
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,460
Is this for your mother?

208
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,740
Over the years, she's been

209
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,620
managing the household

210
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,780
and keeping everything in order.

211
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,420
She's hardly done anything wrong.

212
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,540
Isn't it a bit unfair

213
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,980
to bring her down simply because

214
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,940
she lost her head for the moment?

215
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,980
Sometimes,

216
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,140
when people are in charge for too long,

217
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,100
they'll have the wrong idea

218
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,580
that they own such power

219
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,620
and can do as they want

220
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,860
for their selfish gains.

221
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,940
Mother is nothing like that.

222
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,660
She always puts our clan first.

223
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,940
She'd never be so selfish.

224
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,100
You're so naive, Qian.

225
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,660
You've been through so much.

226
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,340
How come you still can't

227
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,340
see through others?

228
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,820
(Earl Dongping's Mansion)

229
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,220
Yi,

230
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,300
take good care of yourself.

231
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,580
Come back with Yan whenever you can.

232
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,460
I will.

233
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,220
Take care of yourselves

234
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,220
and Father, too.

235
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,100
Si, if you miss me,

236
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,420
come to my place in Lingshui.

237
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,740
I'll visit you later.

238
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,340
I miss Yan a lot.

239
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,460
She misses you, too.

240
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,420
Managing the house isn't easy.

241
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,220
Be very careful.

242
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,220
Don't get hurt.

243
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,140
Zhan, take care of Si.

244
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,180
I will, Yi.

245
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,100
Zhan, Si,

246
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,580
take care.

247
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,220
Ziyu,

248
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,460
please look after my sister.

249
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:13,860
Take care.

250
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,340
Ziyu,

251
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,060
have a safe trip.

252
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,100
Do take care of Yi.

253
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,860
Why did Si

254
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,340
go missing all of a sudden?

255
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,740
Why did I stop Mr. Zhen

256
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,220
from investigating it?

257
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,820
Have you thought about that?

258
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,660
Don't be swayed by emotions.

259
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,700
Otherwise,

260
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,100
you'll be blinded.

261
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,740
Do you know

262
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,860
what means the most

263
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,740
to your mother?

264
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,700
- It's...
- It's not our clan

265
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,340
but the status of your branch.

266
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,980
She'd do anything

267
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,300
for it.

268
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,580
Do you

269
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,340
trust Si that much?

270
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,220
I entrusted her

271
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,140
with such a huge responsibility

272
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,100
to help manage the household

273
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,940
and keep her from danger. Wasn't that good?

274
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,260
Some people don't know

275
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,260
what's the most important

276
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,220
throughout their lives

277
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,980
but act on impulse.

278
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,340
That won't get them too far.

279
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:18,980
Qian,

280
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,220
I know

281
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,700
you're hurt.

282
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,220
You're in great pain.

283
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,740
But you cannot

284
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,060
give yourself up

285
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,220
for one failed marriage.

286
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,940
If we make the right move,

287
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,860
your life will pick up for sure.

288
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,220
Then

289
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,500
you'll still be the best girl in our mansion.

290
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,830
Your grandmother will be proud
of you the most.

291
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,220
So far, I've taken every step

292
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,460
as Mother's planned.

293
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,820
But what exactly do I want

294
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,620
the most?

295
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:09,020
Does Miss Si want to manage the household?

296
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,140
Without Ms. Xiao,

297
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,340
who can she manage?

298
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,500
Herself, I guess.

299
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,460
I'm having a stiff neck.

300
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,750
I slept on the wrong side.

301
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:18,980
Are you alright?

302
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,380
It's terrible.

303
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,020
You've hardly done anything.

304
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,180
You may rest today.

305
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,980
- I didn't do anything.
- Eat.

306
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,100
Nourish your body.

307
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:26,940
It hurts.

308
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:27,850
I know.

309
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,820
I'm mad.

310
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,380
Stop wearing a long face.

311
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,340
You lazybones!

312
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,620
It's already late,

313
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,140
but you haven't started cooking.

314
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,100
Do you want to quit?

315
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,700
There she is, picking up a fight.

316
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:44,740
I know

317
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,140
you think Miss Si is too young

318
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,100
to run the house.

319
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,820
But she said

320
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,980
you'd better not

321
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,100
dig your own grave.

322
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,420
If you can't do your job,

323
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,980
when Lady Jiang asks,

324
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,180
none of you will be spared!

325
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,980
How dare that stupid little girl

326
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,220
barge in here

327
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,220
and tell us what to do!

328
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,220
Look,

329
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,140
she isn't all wrong.

330
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,300
We've been working here for so long.

331
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,900
Don't we know Lady Jiang

332
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,220
better than her?

333
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,060
Yes.

334
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,460
I meant to take revenge for Ms. Xiao.

335
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,100
Take revenge?

336
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,660
There are many other ways.

337
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,700
(Morning Drizzle)

338
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,140
(Haitang Chamber)

339
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:24,980
Miss,

340
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,020
you've been working from dusk to dawn.

341
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,220
Why did you

342
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,520
bear such a heavy responsibility?

343
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,700
Let me ask you this.

344
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,460
Would anyone in the house

345
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,940
dare to harm Aunt Xiao?

346
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,460
No.

347
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,700
Jiang Pei drugged me

348
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,900
on Grandmother's birthday.

349
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,020
Who told her to do so?

350
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,140
Who...?

351
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,140
Ms. Xiao, of course.

352
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,380
Looks like I've trained you well.

353
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,780
If you're in charge,

354
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,940
no one can harm you

355
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:48,980
or our branch again.

356
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:49,820
Exactly.

357
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:52,900
Miss,

358
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,740
do you like Mr. Zhen?

359
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,180
Why ask?

360
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:00,820
Clearly,

361
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,100
he likes you.

362
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,860
I've seen it clearly.

363
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,300
He's a good man.

364
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,540
He's brave and upright

365
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:10,900
compared with officials

366
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,460
who use every means to fawn on others.

367
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,500
I admire people like him,

368
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,380
but

369
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,980
that's all.

370
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,780
I also think

371
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,940
you'd better

372
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:23,940
not fall for him.

373
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,260
Why is that?

374
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,220
Commandant Yu is much better.

375
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,580
Whenever you were in trouble,

376
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,260
he always came in time and helped you out.

377
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,700
Hadn't you told me about it,

378
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,460
no one wouldn't have known.

379
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,180
Miss, isn't he like

380
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,020
those heroes in stories who help others

381
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,220
without leaving their names?

382
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,700
We can't always rely on others' help.

383
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,060
Stop reading those stories.

384
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,300
They aren't true.

385
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,420
But Commandant Yu is real.

386
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,220
Miss,

387
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:57,460
do you have feelings for him?

388
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:00,940
No!

389
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,380
I don't have feelings for anyone.

390
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,580
My priority is to manage

391
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,660
the house and our business.

392
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,700
That's enough. Stop asking questions.

393
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,340
Or I won't be able to

394
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,540
finish the accounts.

395
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,420
Enjoy your sweet soup.

396
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,460
Fine. Alright.

00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:14,860

460
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,220
Yes, sure.

461
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,220
Be careful, Grandmother.

462
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,540
Careful.

463
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,700
Thanks, Qian.

464
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,300

465
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,860

00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,860

467
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,980
The ground was wet.

468
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,220
I slipped and fell.

469
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:06,980

470
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,220
I'm fine.

471
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,740
I'll check it later.

472
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,020
You should.

473
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,580
It's been a while since we had

474
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,220
such plain food for breakfast.

475
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,100
When I meditated in the mountain,

476
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,020
I also

477
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,420
had these in the morning.

478
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,140
A light diet

479
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,700
in the morning is healthy.

480
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:34,980
Right.

481
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,860
Mother, let's eat.

482
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,420
Has the congee gone bad?

483
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,460
It smells a bit off.

484
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,900
The bun seems...

485
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,220
Nothing has

486
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,460
gone well since this morning.

487
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,780
Mother,

488
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,900
Si is still too young

489
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,700
to manage such a big house.

490
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,140
If you let her do it,

491
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,420
who knows

492
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,380
how much trouble

493
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,380
she'll cause?

494
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:22,980
Chaos will arise. Our clan will fall.

495
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,420
Anmou,

496
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,620
will some spoiled food

497
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,380
lead to chaos?

498
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,460
Have you been

499
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,060
an official for so long

500
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,820
that you've started labeling people

501
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:37,940
at home at will, too?

502
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:43,980
Brother,

503
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,740
you've become

504
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,420
much more sarcastic.

505
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,620
Who started it?

506
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,900
The congee has gone sour!

507
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:50,900
So what?

508
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,740
Enough!

509
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,060
You, sit down.

510
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,460
What a bummer.

511
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,460
Both of you are fathers.

512
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,140
It's embarrassing

513
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,620
to argue before your children.

514
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:16,860
Si,

515
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,700
you've been in charge lately.

516
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,780
Can you handle the work?

517
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,380
Grandmother, Uncle Anmou,

518
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,300
things that happened today

519
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,500
won't happen again. I promise.

520
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,660
Please give me three more days.

521
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,260
If I fail to run the household,

522
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,180
I'll return the tokens and the keys.

523
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,180
Three more days?

524
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,260
You can barely go through today.

525
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:43,980
I won't eat it.

526
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,700
Suit yourself.

527
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,680
You've been making shoe soles for days.

528
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,570
Are they not done yet?

529
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,380
Yes. I get tired just looking at them.

530
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,380
Have some walnuts.

531
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,220
Are you busy, ladies?

532
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,460
Miss Si.

533
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,380
Wake up! Miss Si is here!

534
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,220
Miss... Miss Si.

535
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,060
You must be tired.

536
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,540
I can manage.

537
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,140
I'm not young anymore.

538
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,300
I was napping

539
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,700
when you came in.

540
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,300
It was my fault to disturb you

541
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,780
when you were sleeping.

542
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,420
Well,

543
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,060
clearly, you're exhausted.

544
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,420
You may take today off

545
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,620
and rest.

546
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,460
The kitchen no longer needs you.

547
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:27,980
Miss Si,

548
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,110
what's that supposed to mean?

549
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,540
Are you kicking us out?

550
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,660
We're senior servants in this house.

551
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,460
We've been working here our entire life.

552
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,340
Yes, Miss Si.

553
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:38,100
None of the prominent clans in town

554
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,700
would drive out their senior servants.

555
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,180
Don't mistake it.

556
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,540
I care about senior servants like you.

557
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,120
That's why I'm giving you a few days off.

558
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,900
Working in the kitchen all day

559
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,220
is exhausting.

560
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,460
Enjoy your vacation.

561
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,700
You'll still be paid the same.

562
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,060
Take as much time off as you want.

563
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,500
You may come back later.

564
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,260
Really?

565
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,660
Do you mean it?

566
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,780
Of course.

567
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:01,900
I hired these two chefs

568
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,620
from the Guangju Restaurant.

569
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,180
We can try some new dishes for a change.

570
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,460
Relax. Don't worry about your work.

571
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,260
Aman,

572
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,900
show them around the kitchen.

573
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,740
Yes.

574
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:14,610
Let's go.

575
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,220
What exactly is she doing?

576
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,940
I... I have no idea.

577
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:24,820
Miss Si,

578
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,540
I'm born to work. I can't rest.

579
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,380
Those new chefs are strange to our kitchen.

580
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,500
I'll give them a hand.

581
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,460
The shrimps are dead.

582
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,620
They're inedible.

583
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,940
Miss Si, I meant to throw them away.

584
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:37,900
There's fish for lunch.

585
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:38,740
It's fresh.

586
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,140
What are you waiting for? Help me!

587
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:41,980
Go.

588
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,340
Si seems more capable

589
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,900
than I thought.

590
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,060
We underestimated her.

591
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,900
I know, right?

592
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,060
In the past few days,

593
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,220
when servants caused trouble on purpose,

594
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:03,980
she wasn't mad at all

595
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,620
but being so nice to them

596
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,860
as to offer them

597
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,220
paid vacation days.

598
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,380
As for their work,

599
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,460
she had found better ones

600
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,140
from the outside to do it.

601
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,500
A few boneheads

602
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,900
did go home

603
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:16,940
to rest happily.

604
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,260
After a while,

605
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,460
they'd lose their job for sure.

606
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,460
That's right.

607
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,140
The smart ones,

608
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,700
who saw through Si's plot,

609
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,460
wouldn't dare stir up trouble again.

610
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,250
Let's see how long she can hold on.

611
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,780
Qian.

612
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,420
Qian?

613
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,700
What's on your mind?

614
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:54,780
Nothing.

615
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,860
What were you saying, Mother?

616
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,300
Qian,

617
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,220
pull yourself together.

618
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:09,900
A few days ago,

619
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:12,540
I gave you a list from Matchmaker Wang.

620
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:13,740
Did you see it?

621
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,420
Is there anyone you like?

622
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,540
It's only been a while since my divorce.

623
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,460
Are you so eager to marry me off again?

624
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,540
Am I such an eyesore to you?

625
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,980
I didn't mean that.

626
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,460
I'm concerned about you.

627
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,140
Women grow old quickly.

628
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:40,220
The sooner you marry, the better.

629
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,500
"It's for your sake."

630
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,220
Aunt Xiao

631
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,180
has said so to you repeatedly, right?

632
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,060
Don't try to sow discord between us.

633
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,020
In this house,

634
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,500
only Mother cares about me.

635
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,660
I'm not sowing discord.

636
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:10,700
Actually,

637
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:12,860
I envy you a lot

638
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,420
because your mother loves you

639
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,860
and plans out everything for you.

640
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,260
As you know,

641
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,700
I lost my mother when I was born.

642
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,540
What's your point?

643
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,420
My point is

644
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:32,780
parents' love,

645
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,660
if misused,

646
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,680
will hurt themselves and their children.

647
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,020
I heard your mother

648
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,540
started setting you up

649
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,660
with others again.

650
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,020
She was provoked by you.

651
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,780
You have Mr. Zhen who's a rare catch,

652
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,460
and you've taken away her power.

653
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,260
She's mad.

654
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:52,980
She has nothing to do

655
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,700
but pay all her attention to me.

656
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,980
Blaming me

657
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,740
won't ruin my life

658
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,460
or change your situation.

659
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:03,260
At first, you listened to her

660
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,700
to marry up for a better future.

661
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,420
You saw what happened.

662
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,980
Now, you have a second chance.

663
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,860
Are you going to listen to her again?

664
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:15,890
Flowers bloom and wither.

665
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,180
People go up and down.

666
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:20,900
I'm divorced.

667
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,180
Do you think I still have a choice?

668
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,460
Back then,

669
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,980
we went to school together.

670
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,540
We learned not to

671
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:33,060
be pleased by gains or saddened by losses.

672
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,620
Women aren't confined

673
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,460
to their parents' or husbands' homes.

674
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,060
Once you walk out,

675
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,500
you'll see a completely different world.

676
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,060
Why are you giving me that look?

677
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,420
Is it really for my sake

678
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,620
or yours?

679
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,180
Did you go through

680
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,500
that list from Matchmaker Wang?

681
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,860
The 50-year-old

682
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,670
Commandery Prince Nan'an
wants another wife.

683
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,180
The owner of Yuxi House

684
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,380
with a broken right leg

685
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,620
has already lost three wives.

686
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,300
Matchmaker Wang chose them for me?

687
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,220
I know you're upset,

688
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:15,900
but

689
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,380
given your condition,

690
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,900
we can't be picky.

691
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:23,740
Yes.

692
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,500
I can only be picked.

693
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,140
Even my own mother thinks

694
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:31,580
I can only marry

695
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,700
some unwanted man like them.

696
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,460
Qian,

697
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,460
you're mistaking me.

698
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,220
Alright. Never mind.

699
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,940
It's fine if you don't like them.

700
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,380
Lan's eldest daughter

701
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:46,420
will hold a birthday banquet soon.

702
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,220
You can

703
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,460
dress yourself up

704
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,700
and go there with me

705
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,220
to meet others.

706
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,060
Meet others

707
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,700
to make them laugh at me?

708
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,780
Cao Xingyu has just been put on death row.

709
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,220
How could I spread my tail

710
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,500
in public to find a new husband?

711
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,220
How would people judge me?

712
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,220
Si has taken over the household,

713
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,900
so you're forcing me to remarry

714
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,420
to bring down the First Branch?

715
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,900
Am I your daughter

716
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,460
or your tool to fight?

717
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,300
Enough!

718
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,620
What's wrong with you today?

719
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,660
Would you rather grow old

720
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,940
and die alone in this house?

721
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,260
Finally,

722
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,500
you've got it off your chest.

723
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,060
As long as I'm home,

724
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,260
you're ashamed of me, aren't you?

725
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:38,900
If so,

726
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,140
I'll leave.

727
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:41,980
Where are you going?

728
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,300
I've written to Brother and his wife.

729
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,660
They aren't ashamed of me.

730
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,020
I'm going to Lingxi tomorrow

731
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,700
to get out of your sight!

732
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,980
Qian, Qian!

733
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,660
Come back!

734
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,660
She's driving me crazy!

735
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,140
She's so spoiled.

736
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,980
I wanted the best for her,

737
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,660
but she fell out with me

738
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,450
and meant to live with her brother.

739
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,020
I'm so pissed!

740
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,260
- Ms. Xiao.
- I'm mad!

741
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,900
Don't be upset. Have a seat.

742
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,460
Ms. Qian said so on impulse.

743
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,900
Actually, it's good for her

744
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:23,900
to leave the city.

745
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:24,900
How so?

746
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,100
Think about it.

747
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,740
Everyone in town knows

748
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:31,660
what happened to her ex-husband's family.

749
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,740
They may say hurtful things.

750
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,100
If she goes to Lingxi,

751
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,900
she'll feel better.

752
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,460
Her brother can help her

753
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,980
find a good husband there.

754
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,540
On the bright side,

755
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:43,900
it's not bad for her.

756
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,100
You have a point.

757
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:48,820
But Qian

758
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,060
has never gone that far.

759
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,740
Why does she suddenly

760
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,420
want to go to her brother's place?

761
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,660
Who gave her that idea?

762
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:00,860
Ms. Ruan.

763
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:09,620
Miss Si, why is

764
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,980
the monthly allowance more than before?

765
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,500
It's a little something from me.

766
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,780
Don't worry.

767
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,500
The extra money is from my own pocket.

768
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,300
Aunt Xiao doesn't know.

769
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:22,660
Well then,

770
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,380
thanks, Miss Si.

771
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,540
Don't mention it.

772
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,380
By the way,

773
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,740
I heard

774
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:30,660
after Qian

775
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,980
left for Lingxi,

776
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,100
her mother

777
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,460
was eager to marry Pei off.

778
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,780
Although she's grounded,

779
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,380
she interferes

780
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,260
in others' business as usual.

781
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,260
She can no longer

782
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,260
rely on her daughter.

783
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,820
Now, she's trying to

784
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,180
manipulate someone else's.

785
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,020
Isn't that good?

786
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:51,820
Pei can't wait

787
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,460
to marry into a good family.

788
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:54,900
Ms. Xiao

789
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,140
was picky.

790
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,540
She meant to marry Qian up.

791
00:35:58,900 --> 00:35:59,780
Then what?

792
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:02,340
We saw what happened to her.

793
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,260
I might be a woman,

794
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,660
but even I know

795
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,170
if those of noble birth

796
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:10,500
intend to marry humble girls

797
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,900
from our family,

798
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,580
there must be something wrong with them.

799
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,460
Otherwise, who doesn't

800
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,980
want to find a perfect match, right?

801
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,260
I didn't mean you, of course.

802
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:23,900
It's fine.

803
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,020
I didn't know

804
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,420
you were so sharp.

805
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,460
I'm not sharp,

806
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,820
but Pei's so gullible

807
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,260
that she's led by the nose.

808
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:35,940
Pei.

809
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,620
Ms. Xiao.

810
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:49,900
Pei.

811
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,380
Mother.

812
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:52,620
Ms. Ruan,

813
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,740
I need to have a word with her.

814
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:55,820
Give us some space.

815
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,340
You never stop setting me off.

816
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:10,580
Never mind.

817
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:13,460
Your marriage is important.

818
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,020
I won't blame you.

819
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,100
My marriage?

820
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,500
Didn't you tell your father

821
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,300
you wanted to marry a civil official?

822
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,940
In Ling'an,

823
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,340
which one is the most honorable?

824
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,180
It's Mr. Zhen.

825
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,420
Mr. Zhen?

826
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,100
Zhen Heng?

827
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,140
Yes.

828
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,620
I meant to

829
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,380
set you up with him.

830
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,180
Unexpectedly,

831
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,020
Si beat me to it

832
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,420
again.

833
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,420
Ms. Ruan, I'll cut to the chase.

834
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:47,060
There's someone I know

835
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:49,380
who's perfect for Pei.

836
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:50,820
I asked Mrs. Zhen

837
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,780
to be the matchmaker.

838
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,060
He and her son were classmates.

839
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:56,660
He's from a decent family.

840
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:59,060
Although he's only a local official,

841
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,820
he's a wonderful man.

842
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,180
He'll come to Ling'an

843
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,460
to report on his work soon.

844
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:05,660
Really?

845
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:06,700
Yes.

846
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:09,740
But as you know,

847
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:12,380
Pei and I don't get along well.

848
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,820
As her cousin, I'm in no position

849
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,820
to interfere in her marriage.

850
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,020
Don't worry.

851
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,580
I'll tell her

852
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,140
I found that man.

853
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,060
Still, they should

854
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,020
meet first and see

855
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,260
if they like each other.

856
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:27,030
Leave that to me.

857
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:29,140
Thank you very much, Miss Si.

858
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,300
You're welcome.

859
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:31,980
I'm surprised

860
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,100
you trust me so much.

861
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,980
I don't trust you more than others,

862
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,260
but I

863
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,860
trust Ms. Xiao even less.

864
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,300
She can't keep using Pei as her pawn.

865
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,740
I appreciate your candidness.

866
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,780
You may leave.

867
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:50,020
Once he arrives,

868
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,260
I'll let you know.

869
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,580
Good day.

870
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:17,960
Miss,

871
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,780
why go to such great lengths

872
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,540
to find a perfect match for Miss Pei?

873
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,300
She treats you the worst.

874
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,380
I hate her the most.

875
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,420
Aunt Xiao must've figured out

876
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,900
that Jiang Pei blurted out

877
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:29,980
the Drunk at 8th Step.

878
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,100
Once she comes out,

879
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,620
she'll make

880
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,580
Jiang Pei suffer.

881
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,380
I see.

882
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,940
That's why you have to

883
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,380
find her a safe place to go soon.

884
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,300
Aren't you smart?

885
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,460
You got it right away.

886
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:53,420
(Jiang)

887
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,620
(Running the house is like cooking.)

888
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:59,260
(Be patient and watch the fire.)

889
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,020
(Don't rush it.)

890
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,290
(A big fire is)

891
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,020
(likely to overcook the food.)

892
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,500
(Mishandling of domestic affairs)

893
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:08,740
(can lead to trouble.)

894
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:13,140
(A soft fire spoils the food
if left unwatched.)

895
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,780
(Just like the trifles at home,
if left unsolved,)

896
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:16,980
(will grow bigger.)

897
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,460
(Only those with a big heart)

898
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:22,340
(know how to balance things.)

899
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,940
(Do the right thing at the right time.)

900
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,860
(Keep a healthy routine and diet.)

901
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:31,740
(Eat a light breakfast to help digest.)

902
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:34,260
(Have a well-balanced lunch to gain energy.)

903
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,100
(Things like social events require)

904
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:46,860
(careful and proper planning even more.)

905
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:50,020
(Farms and shops need management, too.)

906
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,180
(Keep the accounts accurate.)

907
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,260
(Make every cent count and be meticulous.)

908
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:58,420
(The kitchen staff should know what to do.)

909
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,700
(Have a clear division of work.)

910
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,100
(Some prepare ingredients.)

911
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,780
(Others cook them.)

912
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,460
(Meals and fruit)

913
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,060
(should be balanced)

914
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,660
(to provide enough energy for the day.)

915
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:14,820
(In that case,)

916
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,660
(even someone captious like Uncle Anmou)

917
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,860
(won't find anything wrong.)

918
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,020
(As much as Aunt Xiao hates me,)

919
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,210
(she has to play by our family rules.)

920
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:24,420
Greetings, Miss Si.

921
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:27,340
- (Servants should know their duties.)
- Miss Si.

922
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,140
(Oversee their work constantly)

923
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:32,640
- (to make sure they're responsible)
- Miss Si.

924
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,900
(and everything at home is in order.)

925
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,820
(Then our clan will thrive.)

926
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:49,660
Greetings, Miss Si.

927
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:56,890
Greetings, Miss Si.

928
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,060
(Our clan)

929
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:59,380
(will prosper)

930
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,140
(and enjoy lasting fortune.)

931
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:18,770
Anyone can come to the black market.

932
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:20,330
His accomplices might be somewhere here.

933
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:23,660
- Seize them.
- Yes.

934
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:34,890
Run!

935
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:05,020
