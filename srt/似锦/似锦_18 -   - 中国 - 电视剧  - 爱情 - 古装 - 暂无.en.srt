(Opera)
Phoenix Hairpin?

13
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:44,920
Tonight's first opera

14
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,590
is Phoenix Hairpin.

15
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:47,950
Do you mean to

16
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,790
show everyone in Lingshui

17
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,640
that I'm as evil as Mrs. Lu in it,

18
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,590
breaking up you and my son?

19
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,670
I wouldn't dare.

20
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,430
I had left for charity when operas

21
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,430
needed to be chosen.

22
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,600
When I returned,

23
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,070
I heard you had decided on them.

24
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,080
Stop lying!

25
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,030
Are you saying

26
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,480
I chose that one in particular

27
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,590
to insult myself?

28
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,360
You're disrespectful to me.

29
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,270
I can have my son divorce you.

30
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,510
Mother, it really wasn't me.

31
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,160
Mother, I'm not Lu Wuguan.

32
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,310
I won't listen to you to divorce Yi.

33
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,640
It'll never happen, Mother.

34
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,950
Get up, Yi.

35
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:30,990
I ordered that opera,

36
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,360
not Yi.

37
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,200
You...

38
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,880
You're still covering for her?

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,840
If you were

40
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,950
a kind mother-in-law,

41
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,390
you wouldn't fear rumors.

42
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:40,670
In the last few days,

43
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,030
Yi went here and there

44
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,600
for the Water Festival.

45
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,160
Not only did you not help her,

46
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,780
but you also kept picking on her.

47
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,310
How unfilial!

48
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,150
That's enough.

49
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,120
Don't be mad, Mother.

50
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,280
It's all my fault.

51
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,120
Mrs. Ziyu!

52
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,150
Mrs. Ziyu!

53
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,400
Mrs. Ziyu,

54
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,710
the Caiyun Troupe is a mess.

55
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,270
- You kicked me!
- Stop, you two!

56
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,640
You vamp!

57
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,630
Stop, ladies!

58
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,550
That's enough!

59
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,040
- I'm begging you!
- I'll kill you!

60
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,360
- How dare you!
- It's my fault!

61
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,590
It's my bad, alright?

62
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,180
I shouldn't have given you that lip balm.

63
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,000
- I'm sorry!
- Stop.

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,840
It's your fault!

65
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,160
It's a big day today.

66
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,440
You two are the stars of the Caiyun Troupe.

67
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,110
Why are you fighting?

68
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,000
What's going on?

69
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,060
Sorry for the trifle.

70
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,600
Trifle?

71
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,080
Look at my face!

72
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,390
She caused it!

73
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,500
(Yanniang, Caiyun Troupe)

74
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,600
It's an allergy caused by yams.

75
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,040
She's taken the medicine,

76
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,090
but it'll take six hours

77
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,710
at least to reduce the swelling.

78
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,310
That's too long.

79
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,560
I have to go on stage

80
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,400
in less than two.

81
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,920
Are there other ways, Physician?

82
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,760
There's nothing else I can do.

83
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:54,990
Good day.

84
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,680
Where was yam

85
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,080
added to the lip balm?

86
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,030
Ask her!

87
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,240
I've said a million times

88
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,110
I didn't do it.

89
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:04,510
Ms. Fei,

90
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,560
I bought a new lip balm, Half Cherry,

91
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,400
for you.

92
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,830
Wear that to go on stage tonight

93
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,680
and you'll outshine everyone.

94
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,600
I outshine others for my performance,

95
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,110
not for my looks.

96
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,560
Is that so?

97
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:17,880
In that case,

98
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,150
don't put on any makeup.

99
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,880
Perform onstage without it.

100
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,120
Meng, I'll take it if she won't.

101
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,600
I picked up

102
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,030
this lip balm for her.

103
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,230
If you also want it,

104
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,500
I'll get you one next time.

105
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,240
You grab everything that's mine.

106
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,910
Take it if you like it.

107
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,390
No wonder you gave it away to me.

108
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,480
Turns out, the lip balm

109
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,430
had been tampered with.

110
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,150
I didn't even open the box.

111
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,310
How could I do that

112
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,150
without touching it?

113
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,910
We all know you're a mutt from Nanwu.

114
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,800
You're full of tricks.

115
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,720
Who's a mutt?

116
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,560
You!

117
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,400
You're a mutt!

118
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:53,670
Stop arguing.

119
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,880
The box doesn't seem to have a hidden switch.

120
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:57,910
Mr. Meng,

121
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,710
where did you buy the lip balm?

122
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,000
From the rouge shop

123
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,140
on the west side of the city.

124
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,800
After you bought it,

125
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,820
did you bring it

126
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:07,760
with you the whole time?

127
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,390
Just now, before I performed,

128
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,200
I put the box on the table over there.

129
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,710
That vamp did it.

130
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:16,950
She didn't want me

131
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,000
to perform Phoenix Hairpin

132
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,320
to outshine her.

133
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,830
Phoenix Hairpin? Did Mother...?

134
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,880
Set the lip balm aside for now.

135
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,150
It's almost showtime.

136
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,680
Given Yanniang's condition,

137
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,680
she can't sing.

138
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,000
Mrs. Ziyu, we sing

139
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,240
with the throat, nose, and stomach,
not the mouth.

140
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,080
I can do it.

141
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,320
But you can't go up there

142
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:38,270
looking like this.

143
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,240
I have an idea, Yi.

144
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:01,000
Yes! Good! Great!

145
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,640
The Zhu Mansion

146
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,160
celebrates this year's Water Festival

147
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,080
with style and grace.

148
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:13,950
Zhu's celebration

149
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,560
has always been the best.

150
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,030
Of course.

151
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,240
To prepare for it,

152
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,150
I didn't get a good night's sleep.

153
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,000
Didn't Mrs. Ziyu

154
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,840
do all the work?

155
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,910
Had Mrs. Lu had such a great daughter-in-law,

156
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,750
Phoenix Hairpin wouldn't have been written.

157
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,800
That's too kind of you.

158
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,200
I'm young and ignorant.

159
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,920
Mother planned out everything.

160
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,320
I simply ran errands for her.

161
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,040
Enjoy the show.

162
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,150
It's about to begin.

163
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,560
- Great!
- Wonderful!

164
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,590

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,200
Good!

00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,200

00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,280
What happened?

191
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,960
Wasn't she with you the whole time?

192
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,360
I was buying osmanthus cakes.

193
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,730
When I turned around, she was gone.

194
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,480
The streets are packed tonight.

195
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,920
I can't lose her.

196
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,160
- Mrs. Ziyu.
- Captain Xie.

197
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,790
What's the emergency?

198
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:19,800
Yan went missing.

199
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,320
Could you help me look for her?

200
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,160
Don't panic.

201
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,870
Let's split up and search.

202
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,400
Sure. Thanks.

203
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,080
Azhu, you go that way.

204
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,120
- I'll go this way.
- Yes.

205
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,080
Mr. Yu,

206
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,040
why are you watching it from here?

207
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:04,080
It's got a great view.

208
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,080
The groom on the boat just now

209
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,440
looked somewhat like you.

210
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,470
Really?

211
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,440
Everyone has two eyes and a nose.

212
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,560
Plus, he wore a mask.

213
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,390
We could be similar.

214
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,960
What's that?

215
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:38,910
When I came back earlier,

216
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,600
Mr. Meng didn't feel well.

217
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,550
He asked me

218
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,350
to do that show for him.

219
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,800
You had to point out it wasn't him.

220
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,280
Is that so?

221
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:59,160
Fine, I insisted on doing it.

222
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,710
But why?

223
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,680
I couldn't see you marry another man.

224
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,680
Pardon? I didn't get it.

225
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,240
I couldn't see you

226
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,360
marry another man

227
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,350
even in a show!

228
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:38,370
Great!

229
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:43,950
Bad news, ma'am.

230
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,510
Ms. Fei sprained her ankle.

231
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,280
What?

232
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,800
Are you alright, Ms. Fei?

233
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,120
What to do?

234
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,280
My performance is next.

235
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:52,710
Have a seat.

236
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,630
Tonight's top priority is

237
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,520
the Water Festival.

238
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,360
The ritual dance is most important,

239
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,400
but now, it can't be done.

240
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,830
That'll bring shame

241
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,160
on our whole clan!

242
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,480
You... It's your fault.

243
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,670
You knew you had to dance

244
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,990
but acted so carelessly.

245
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,160
Where's Yi?

246
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,750
Where did she go?

247
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,280
My Lady,

248
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,720
we looked all over the Yunshui Tower

249
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,400
but found no sign of her.

250
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,440
She must be avoiding me

251
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,830
to make me

252
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,350
clean up the mess.

253
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,680
(Where did Yi go?)

254
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,740
(She cares about the Festival the most.)

255
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,090
(She'd never leave without reason.)

256
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,830
(What exactly happened?)

257
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,590
Yan! Yan!

258
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,960
- Ma'am.
- Did you see a little girl?

259
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,920
Did you see her?

260
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,110
No, sorry.

261
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,230
Yan!

262
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,150
Did you see a little girl?

263
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,470
- I didn't.
- Ms. Fei,

264
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,110
do you have

265
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,800
a replacement in your troupe?

266
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,440
The ritual dance is the hardest.

267
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,560
No one else can do it.

268
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,720
I happened to learn to dance

269
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,800
in my childhood.

270
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:50,960
When I served

271
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,510
in the Yunshui Tower these days,

272
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,750
I saw Ms. Fei dancing.

273
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,630
I can give it a try.

274
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:04,630
Beautiful!

275
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,080
It's good, isn't it?

276
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,030
Great!

277
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:07,870
It's nice.

278
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,510
First, Yanniang had an allergy.

279
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:17,200
Then Ms. Fei sprained her ankle.

280
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,950
Yet she happened to learn that dance.

281
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,440
All that couldn't be a coincidence.

282
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:22,950
Just now, Ms. Fei said

283
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,870
yam could trigger her asthma,

284
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,400
making her too weak to dance.

285
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,240
Qing'er's target

286
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,080
was Ms. Fei

287
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:32,130
from the very beginning.

288
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,320
Yanniang used that lip balm

289
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,800
with yam by accident.

290
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,230
Who knows

291
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,400
her scheme actually worked?

292
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,650
She set your sister up

293
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:43,190
and then stepped forward to save the day

294
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,950
to impress the Zhu Clan.

295
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,710
- She's more than she lets on.
- Good!

296
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,140
There's no time to lose.

297
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,200
I'll go find my sister.

298
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,600
Watch Qing'er closely.

299
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,590
We'll split up.

300
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,840
Be careful.

301
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,390
Yan!

302
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,870
Yinlou!

303
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,160
Miss Si.

304
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,680
Did you see Yi?

305
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,240
She thought Yan had gone missing.

306
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,550
She must still be looking for her.

307
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,320
Yan, who was there with you?

308
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,440
How did you get lost?

309
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:14,720
I didn't.

310
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,340
(Yan, Jiang Yi's Daughter)
I fell asleep.

311
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,280
Then I saw Mr. Xie after waking up.

312
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,710
She didn't wander away herself.

313
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,320
Someone must've taken her away.

314
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,920
But why?

315
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,320
I get it.

316
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,560
That was to drive Yi away.

317
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,750
Let's split up

318
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,670
and find her.

319
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,510
Sure.

320
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,510
Take Yan with you.

321
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,350
- Sure.
- Alright.

322
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,680
Be good, Yan.

323
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:41,960
Let's go.

324
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,840
Yi!

325
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,350
Yi!

326
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,320
(Ms. Fei couldn't perform.)

327
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,630
(Qing'er's plan worked.)

328
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:02,990
(Why bother to)

329
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,400
(drive Yi away?)

330
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:11,320
- Great!
- Wonderful!

331
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,840
How clumsy!

332
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,470
You were so careless.

333
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:24,960
Let's go, Mother.

334
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,300
You need to get changed.

335
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,080
Yan!

336
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,590
Yan...

337
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,040
Yi!

338
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,630
Yi! Yi!

339
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,230
Wake up!

340
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,920
Where's Yan?

341
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,200
Where's my daughter?

342
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,040
She's fine.

343
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,200
Don't worry.

344
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,080
Yi! What's wrong?

345
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,550
She's having an asthma attack.

346
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,230
I brought her here to rest.

347
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,350
An asthma attack?

348
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:53,520
How useless!

349
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,360
She's having it now

350
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,590
of all times?

351
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,200
I'll call a physician to check her.

352
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,950
Don't get changed yet, Mother.

353
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,100
Let's take Yi home to make her rest first.

354
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,040
What?

355
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:08,110
Only a little cough is making you so worried?

356
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,350
Don't you know how old I am?

357
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,590
I'm covered with wet clothes in the wind.

358
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,060
Aren't you worried I'll also fall ill?

359
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,350
Go fetch my clothes.

360
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:17,190
Yes.

361
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,630
Is... is that a man over there?

362
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:41,480
Mr. Meng.

363
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,240
Close the door.

364
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,720
No one is allowed in.

365
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,150
- Go!
- Yes.

366
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,280
Close the door.

367
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,720
Let no one in.

368
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,560
Yi,

369
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,430
what exactly happened?

370
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,960
Why is he here?

371
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,350
You tramp!

372
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,960
You had a tryst with a lowly performer

373
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,160
while having your sister

374
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,190
covering for you.

375
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:15,110
I didn't, Mother.

376
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,720
I came to look for Yan.

377
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,110
I don't know why he is here either.

378
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,870
You have to trust me, Ziyu!

379
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,520
Trust you?

380
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,590
He's right here.

381
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,590
We caught you in the act.

382
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,560
Stop denying it!

383
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:30,830
I'll kill you...

384
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:31,910
- Lady Zhu.
- You...!

385
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,200
What are you doing?

386
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,280
What am I doing?

387
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,840
Ziyu,

388
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,310
I'm asking you

389
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,720
to get to the bottom of this matter.

390
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,200
If my sister is wronged

391
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,280
for things she didn't do,

392
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,680
you won't look good either.

393
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,720
Only the three of you were here.

394
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,670
If Yi didn't do it,

395
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,520
was it you?

396
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,110
Si didn't do it.

397
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,870
Really?

398
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,670
Are you also wronged?

399
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,190
Did that man

400
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,630
come here himself?

401
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,000
It was me.

402
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,960
I had a tryst with him,

403
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,280
not them.

404
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,670
I came to see Meng,

405
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:12,880
but Mrs. Ziyu

406
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,190
and Miss Si walked in on us.

407
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,520
Meng panicked.

408
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,280
He fell off the bed and fainted.

409
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,160
I begged the two of them

410
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,040
to cover for me,

411
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,240
making you mistake it.

412
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,800
I'm really sorry.

413
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,000
Yi,

414
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,720
I lost my head in a fit of rage

415
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,070
and blamed you

416
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,150
before knowing the truth.

417
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,670
Once Mr. Meng wakes up,

418
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,910
I'll check everything with him

419
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,240
and clear your name.

420
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,320
Are you still doubting me?

421
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:25,870
Qing'er.

422
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:27,910
Where are you going?

423
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,480
Lady Zhu.

424
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,760
Young Master Zhu.

425
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,080
Mr. Meng,

426
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,040
don't be afraid. Tell us

427
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,880
who you came to see

428
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,910
for a tryst tonight.

429
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,590
Be honest,

430
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,320
or the Zhu Clan

431
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:03,590
will show no mercy on you!

432
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,800
It was Mrs. Ziyu.

433
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,000
How could it be me?

434
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,830
I had never even talked to you.

435
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,160
Mrs. Ziyu had her maid

436
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,000
tell me

437
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,470
she had fallen for me a long time ago.

438
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,040
If I didn't come to see her tonight,

439
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,190
the Caiyun Troupe

440
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,480
wouldn't survive in Lingshui.

441
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,760
Nonsense!

442
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,520
When did I fall for you?

443
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,910
Why are you framing me?

444
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:34,390
Calm down, Yi.

445
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,390
Let me ask you.

446
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,040
You said my sister

447
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:39,040
had her maid send you a message, right?

448
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,480
Was that maid Qing'er?

449
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,560
You knew already.

450
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,430
- Why ask?
- Liar!

451
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,670
Qing'er just came to the Zhu's.

452
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:48,790
Had my sister meant to

453
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,070
arrange a secret tryst,

454
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,670
she would've sent her confidant.

455
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,190
Why would she choose Qing'er?

456
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:54,430
It was her.

457
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,040
She set me up.

458
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,280
She used Yan

459
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,670
to lure me over.

460
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,310
Yan's over there.

461
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,630
- Where?
- Follow me.

462
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,830
(Qian's Nuts)
Yan's inside, Mrs. Ziyu.

463
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,840
Ms. Fei,

464
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:21,950
you claimed

465
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:24,110
you had a tryst with him

466
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,430
while he said

467
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,760
he came to see Jiang Yi.

468
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,240
Who exactly was it?

469
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,110
Bring Qing'er in!

470
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,760
Yi,

471
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,760
I wish I could trust you.

472
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,800
We've been married for so long.

473
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,110
Everyone in town knows how well I treat you.

474
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:50,150
Now that your statements don't match,

475
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,190
we'll have to rely on Qing'er

476
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,830
to clear your name

477
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:59,430
and find the evildoer who set you up.

478
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,840
Open it.

479
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,240
Get in.

480
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,550
Mrs. Ziyu had me

481
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:10,960
send a message to Mr. Meng

482
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,240
because I was a new maid.

483
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,560
I wouldn't draw others' attention.

484
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:14,720
She promised

485
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,270
to send me to Ling'an after tonight,

486
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,350
saying it was much better than Lingshui.

487
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,240
What are you talking about, Qing'er?

488
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,590
I shouldn't have taken you in

489
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,320
as Si said.

490
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,320
I never expected a young girl like you

491
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:29,350
to be so evil and scheming.

492
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,720
Mrs. Ziyu,

493
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,630
I'm grateful for your kindness,

494
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,590
but this is huge.

495
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:34,720
I can no longer

496
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,630
cover for you.

497
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,550
Young Master, Lady Zhu,

498
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,440
I filled in for Ms. Fei to dance just now.

499
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,510
Many people saw me there.

500
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:42,520
How could I've lured Mrs. Ziyu over?

501
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:43,590
Right.

502
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,590
When I left,

503
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,720
she was dancing.

504
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,080
She couldn't have done it.

505
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,350
Jiang Yi,

506
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,590
how shameless you are!

507
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,880
And here I thought you were decent.

508
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,630
You'd never do such indecencies.

509
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,190
I couldn't have been more wrong!

510
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,720
At this point,

511
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,350
what else do you have to say?

512
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,670
The Zhu Clan's tarnished

513
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,270
all because of you!

514
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,110
Mother!

515
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,680
I didn't do it, Mother!

516
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,550
You have to trust me!

517
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:10,560
It wasn't me!

518
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,190
I got you.

519
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,150
Qing'er,

520
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,350
I don't know yet

521
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,870
how you managed to trick everyone,

522
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,280
but mark my words.

523
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,280
Ruining my sister's name

524
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,910
is ruining her life.

525
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,440
You know

526
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,630
how well she treated you.

527
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,880
If you still have a conscience,

528
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,800
tell the whole truth right now!

529
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:35,070
But if you keep lying

530
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:35,910
and defaming her,

531
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,590
I'll report you to the government!

532
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,520
If the court here can't handle it,

533
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,160
we'll go to court in Ling'an!

534
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,000
What?

535
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,590
Your sister committed

536
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:44,790
adultery,

537
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:46,080
and you're taking it to court?

538
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,390
Are you insane?

539
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,240
Lady Zhu,

540
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:50,870
Yi already said

541
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:52,520
she didn't do it.

542
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,550
No means no, you hear me?

543
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:55,390
You...

544
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:56,870
Miss Si,

545
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,080
must we go that far?

546
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:01,150
Yi...

547
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,910
No matter what she did,

548
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,430
she's still Yan's mother

549
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,080
and my wife.

550
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:11,000
Let's deal with it within our family.

551
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:12,960
Don't let it out.

552
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,910
Don't let it out?

553
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,190
Listen carefully, Ziyu.

554
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:17,440
My sister said

555
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,880
she didn't do it,

556
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,030
so it wasn't her,

557
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:20,870
understand?

558
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,720
Fine.

559
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,640
Let's say she's innocent.

560
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,000
It was Qing'er who led her here.

561
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,630
But everyone saw her dancing onstage.

562
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,960
Could she be in two places at the same time?

563
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:38,110
She couldn't, of course.

564
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:44,820
(Yu'er)

565
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:46,950
She...

566
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,520
Two Qing'er?

567
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,630
She was the one dancing just now.

568
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,720
I see.

569
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,910
They're twins.

570
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,560
Lady Zhu,

571
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,070
look at them.

572
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:03,000
One replaced Ms. Fei to dance.

573
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,960
The other led my sister here

574
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,400
so that no one would

575
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,240
believe Yi.

576
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,390
What a vicious scheme!

577
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,150
Mr. Yu,

578
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,480
please hand them over

579
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,430
to the government,

580
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,480
- as well as him.
- No, no, no!

581
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,800
Long Dan.

582
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,190
No, don't!

583
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,110
It was her. She sent the message.

584
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,700
I didn't get to see Mrs. Ziyu's face.

585
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,430
She impersonated Mrs. Ziyu.

586
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,350
Everything was their idea.

587
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:26,910
It had nothing to do with me!

588
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,070
Performers sure can

589
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,080
make up stories.

590
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,670
See, Qing'er?

591
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:31,920
He's pinned everything

592
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,350
on you and your twin sister.

593
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:35,240
Are you not going to defend yourself?

594
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,630
Clearly, my wife and I

595
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,800
were fooled by such an ingrate.

596
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,910
Lately,

597
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,410
you tried to get close to me,

598
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:46,880
but I told you clearly

599
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:48,040
to give up that thought

600
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:51,040
and that I only loved Yi.

601
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,440
Yet you set

602
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,910
such a deadly trap to ruin her.

603
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,110
What's done is done.

604
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,040
What else do you have to say?

605
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,830
I was greedy and jealous.

606
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,510
Setting her up was my idea.

607
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:12,910
It had nothing to do with others.

608
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,870
My sister knew nothing about it.

609
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:15,830
I only told her

610
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,150
to dance onstage.

611
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,520
It's all my fault!

612
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,800
Ms. Fei...

613
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:32,640
- Please!
- Don't set foot in the troupe again,

614
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,590
or I'll break your legs!

615
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,430
Ms. Fei, Yanniang!

616
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,080
That troupe is cheap.

617
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,620
It's beneath me anyway.

618
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,560
Now that I'm out,

619
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,730
I'll go somewhere else!

620
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,930
(Dressing Room, Hai Hour)
The lip balm had yam.

621
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:51,790
(Jiang Yi)
Then

622
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:53,480
lard was smeared on my pumps.

623
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,870
I connected the dots.

624
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,520
Someone was coming after me.

625
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,080
It was most likely to be Meng Nan.

626
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,880
I was right. In the box

627
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,910
he brought with him,

628
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,280
I found that note,

629
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,550
but those words on it

630
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:06,560
couldn't prove anything.

631
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:08,280
That's why I didn't show it.

632
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,670
I knew someone was behind him.

633
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:15,350
Ms. Fei,

634
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,240
I have a question, though.

635
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:18,760
It's said

636
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,390
that you value reputation greatly.

637
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,000
But just now, to help Yi out,

638
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,880
you'd rather lie and tell them

639
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,040
you had a tryst with Meng Nan.

640
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,720
Why did you do that?

641
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,110
Reputation is important,

642
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:30,240
not just mine

643
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,720
but also that of our troupe.

644
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,830
Meng Nan was one of us.

645
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:36,000
If I indulged his evil deeds,

646
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,590
it'd ruin your sister's life

647
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,070
and make our troupe

648
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,310
a laughingstock.

649
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,520
We could never perform again.

650
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,080
I admire your integrity.

651
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:13,670
Yi,

652
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,000
are you alright?

653
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:20,150
I'm fine.

654
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,840
Let's go back.

655
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,430
Yan is waiting at home.

656
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,110
If I don't tuck her in,

657
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,560
she won't go to bed again.

658
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,520
Yi,

659
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,390
you chose to

660
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,280
bury the truth for her sake, right?

661
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,350
It wasn't too big a deal anyway.

662
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:40,590
Punishing the evildoer,

663
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:41,720
Qing'er

664
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:42,800
is enough.

665
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,560
Yi,

666
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,080
do you really believe

667
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,640
a humble girl like her

668
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,720
planned out everything alone

669
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,830
to set you up tonight?

670
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:51,190
As much as

671
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,720
Lady Zhu disliked you,

672
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,070
she didn't believe

673
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,870
you'd cheat on your husband

674
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:57,910
while Zhu Ziyu

675
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,520
seemed to be on your side,

676
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,560
everything he said was to fan the flames.

677
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,440
He made Lady Zhu mad

678
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,430
and eager to get changed,

679
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:08,200
which was to open the closet

680
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,480
to see if Meng Nan was inside.

681
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,720
After Ms. Fei

682
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:11,920
took responsibility

683
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,960
for the tryst,

684
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,310
he insisted on questioning Meng Nan

685
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,160
once he woke up.

686
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,400
In the end, when we meant to

687
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,870
hand the twins over to the government,

688
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,030
he stopped us desperately.

689
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:20,870
Si,

690
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:23,720
that's enough.

691
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,280
I have to let it out.

692
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:28,350
I'm sure

693
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:30,390
you know the truth,

694
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:32,390
but you refuse to face it.

695
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,910
After the carriage accident

696
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,320
and today's tryst,

697
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:38,880
who knows

698
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,800
how much worse he'll do to harm you?

699
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:42,630
I'm worried

700
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,080
that he'll

701
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:46,190
use Yan to threaten you!

702
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:53,910
We've been married for seven years.

703
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,630
Does our marriage mean nothing to him?

704
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,720
How could he be so heartless?

705
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,720
What did I do wrong?

706
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,000
Yi,

707
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,800
you did nothing wrong.

708
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,520
Evildoers do evil.

709
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,110
They're to blame.

710
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,320
Never blame yourself for their fault.

711
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:29,760
Zhu Ziyu

712
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,040
has fooled everyone.

713
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,280
Whatever happened before,

714
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:36,750
you must've let it slide

715
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,070
unchecked.

716
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,440
That's why you didn't know

717
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,080
who meant to harm you tonight.

718
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,320
We must get to the bottom

719
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,630
this time

720
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:47,910
so that you'll see

721
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:51,320
your husband's true colors.

722
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,040
Zhu Ziyu met with a woman.

723
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:08,350
Did you get a good look at her?

724
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:09,670
I couldn't.

725
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,630
She had guards.

726
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:12,880
I feared they'd be alerted,

727
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,280
so I came back to tell you first.

728
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,790
But I noticed

729
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:16,960
that her maids were dressed up

730
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,720
even better than some of noble birth.

731
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,070
That woman

732
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,240
must be of gentility.

733
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:23,190
Did Zhu Ziyu

734
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:25,670
have an affair with a noble lady?

735
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,590
That'd explain why he took

736
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:28,710
huge risks to ruin my sister.

737
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,150
Without her, that lady

738
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:31,760
would be his new wife.

739
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,110
I can't believe

740
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,190
an educated man like him

741
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,670
would sink so low!

742
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:38,350
They've been married for seven years.

743
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,800
How could he harm her?

744
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,320
Calm down, Captain Xie.

745
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,080
That's only a theory.

746
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,520
Captain,

747
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,080
Meng Nan keeps spreading rumors,

748
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,160
saying Mrs. Ziyu

749
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,080
had an affair with him.

750
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,870
That animal!

751
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,960
Don't worry. I'll have him arrested now.

752
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,150
Let's go!

753
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,310
Yinlou

754
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,830
seems outraged.

755
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:08,350
It's not a big deal.

756
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,760
Tie Meng Nan up.

757
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:11,560
He'll speak with a knife against his neck.

758
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,240
Do you still remember

759
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,100
you're the Commandant of Capital Security?

760
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,240
Officials shall not

761
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,430
abuse their power.

762
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:19,960
Right now,

763
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:21,870
I'm only your guard.

764
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:23,400
Just say the word.

765
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,480
Your wish is my command.

766
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:29,830
Is there a way to lure out that snake

767
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:30,830
and the one in the dark

768
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,350
at the same time?

769
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:34,550
Meng Nan

770
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:36,160
knows nothing about her identity.

771
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,310
He's a useless pawn.

772
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:40,110
Using him to get her out

773
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,840
is hard.

774
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:46,040
Zhu Ziyu has been extremely discreet.

775
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,040
There must be a messenger

776
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:50,800
between him and that woman.

777
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,820
(Zhu Mansion)

778
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,120
Get up.

779
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,360
Sit, Qing'er.

780
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:23,350
What do you want?

781
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:24,400
Don't be afraid.

782
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,630
I'm here

783
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,710
only to ask you

784
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,560
if Zhu Ziyu

785
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,230
gave you the order

786
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,150
to do all that.

787
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,430
I said

788
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,080
I did it alone.

789
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:40,520
I don't expect you to sell him out.

790
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:42,790
I just want to know

791
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:44,670
why he did that.

792
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:50,590
I have your deed.

793
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,630
If you tell me

794
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,670
about Zhu Ziyu's motive,

795
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,480
you can have it back.

796
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,080
You don't want it?

797
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:05,110
What if I tell you

798
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:07,000
I also have

799
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:09,270
your sister's deed?

800
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:11,390
What?

801
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:12,400
How did it

802
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,480
fall into your hands?

803
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,110
I knew it.

804
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,480
Zhu used your sister

805
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,110
to threaten you, didn't he?

806
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,200
I know

807
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:21,320
she was a dancer.

808
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,840
Zhu Ziyu bought her out of town.

809
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,400
You two had been

810
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,400
separated for years.

811
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:27,390
It wasn't until last month that you reunited.

812
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:28,960
As far as I know,

813
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:30,960
she's the only family you've left.

814
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,400
You're willing to

815
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,400
take full responsibility,

816
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,560
but do you really think

817
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,630
Zhu Ziyu will let you live?

818
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,750
Will you be able to see your sister again?

819
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,040
You're protecting your sister.

820
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,400
So am I.

821
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,540
Your sister's been tortured by Zhu Ziyu.

822
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:46,790
So has mine.

823
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,510
We want the same thing.

824
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:50,040
That is to help our family out.

825
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:52,040
Isn't your sister doing well?

826
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,480
She's been living a well-off life.

827
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,360
Is she, really?

828
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,710
In the Yunshui Tower,

829
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:58,150
she was framed by you,

830
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,840
which almost destroyed her.

831
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,840
Only you and your sister

832
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:04,630
know Zhu Ziyu's secrets.

833
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:08,040
You probably know him better than me.

834
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:09,710
Think about it.

835
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,150
To protect himself,

836
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,750
will he let you

837
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,440
or your sister live?

838
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,270
In his eyes, my sister,

839
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,590
his lawfully wedded wife, means nothing.

840
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,240
What about you?

841
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,400
How much do you mean to him?

842
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,070
You and your sister

843
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:25,400
have finally reunited.

844
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,070
You've suffered so much

845
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:28,440
and finally come this far.

846
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,670
Did you give it your all

847
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:32,790
only to end up dead here?

848
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:36,790
Qing'er, I want nothing from you.

849
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:38,190
I simply hope

850
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:40,150
you'll think about

851
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:41,270
what I just said.

852
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:48,000
Did she really say so?

853
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,760
Yes.

854
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:50,750
Qing'er insisted

855
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,150
that she did everything alone.

856
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:53,880
She didn't crack today.

857
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,040
What if Jiang Si pushes her every day?

858
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,030
Qing'er

859
00:36:59,030 --> 00:36:59,870
cannot live.

860
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,000
How did you manage the house?

861
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,960
Qing'er ran away under your watch!

862
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,230
What else can you do?

863
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,600
Besides,

864
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:32,080
do you know Meng Nan

865
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,560
has been spreading rumors?

866
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,160
Right now,

867
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:37,760
your affair with him has become

868
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,000
the talk of the town.

869
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,080
You've brought shame

870
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,960
on the entire Zhu Clan!

871
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,550
Sorry, it's my fault.

872
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:46,480
How is that your fault, Yi?

873
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:49,000
Lady Zhu, as you know,

874
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,440
Yi was set up.

875
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:52,480
Meng Nan is defaming her on purpose.

876
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,760
You can't blame her

877
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,310
for his nonsense.

878
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,110
I don't blame her.

879
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,630
I blame you.

880
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,560
I didn't kick you out

881
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:05,150
because we're in-laws.

882
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,600
Yi,

883
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,590
ever since your sister came,

884
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,710
how much trouble has she caused?

885
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,230
I heard back in Ling'an,

886
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:15,880
she had crossed the line

887
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,920
over and over.

888
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:20,520
As long as she stays with us,

889
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,360
we'll never live in peace.

890
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,670
Leave our house today.

891
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,670
You're no longer welcome here!

892
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,840
Mother,

893
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:29,280
you may dress me down

894
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,440
or scold me all you want.

895
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,590
I'm your daughter-in-law after all.

896
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:34,840
But Si came all the way to visit me.

897
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,920
You shouldn't blame her in any case.

898
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,160
You're in no position to do so.

899
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,230
Without her,

900
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:41,250
I would've fallen off the cliff and died

901
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,280
or been harmed

902
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,710
by their set-up in the Yunshui Tower.

903
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,790
Do you detest her so much

904
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,840
because she saved my life,

905
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,360
making you unable to

906
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,960
have your son marry someone else

907
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,560
who'd be perfect for him

908
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,440
and give birth to his sons?

909
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:57,390
You...

910
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,710
Your kindness and obedience

911
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:01,190
were an act.

912
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,630
Turns out, you're as unruly

913
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,670
as your sister.

914
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,320
Alright then.

915
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:09,320
Get out of my house,

916
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,230
both of you!

917
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,040
I'm your son's lawfully wedded wife.

918
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:15,230
If you want me to leave,

919
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:17,080
have him divorce me.

920
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,560
Ever since we got married,

921
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,920
I've always put the Zhu Clan first.

922
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,960
I've never done anything indecent.

923
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,590
Although we don't have a son,

924
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:26,790
I've given birth to a daughter.

925
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,960
I'm not guilty of sterility.

926
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,150
Which of the Seven Criteria

927
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,480
for Divorce have I met?

928
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:34,470
You...

929
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:35,840
According to the law,

930
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,270
one who divorces his wife without reason

931
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:39,690
will be jailed for 18 months.

932
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,600
Lady Zhu,

933
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:41,760
if you have your son

934
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,230
divorce my sister like this,

935
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:44,310
Earl Dongping's Mansion

936
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:45,960
will file suit against you.

937
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,690
It won't be the first one we've filed.

938
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:49,110
In that case,

939
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:50,480
your son will lose his freedom

940
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,320
and his career.

941
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:53,800
You'd better weigh it up.

942
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,640
It's not

943
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,520
up to you to divorce my sister!

944
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,240
You...

945
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,360
Get lost, both of you.

946
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,280
Scram!

947
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,560
Let's go, Yi.

948
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,200
Captain Xie.

949
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:34,520
Do as I say

950
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:37,040
if you want to live.

951
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,280
Yes.

952
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,630
Come on, Yan!

953
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:48,440
Look, Yan. Do you like it?

954
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,310
- I always told myself
- Yan.

955
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,270
to bear with it.

956
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:56,920
But now, I feel

957
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,790
it's great to lash out.

958
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:01,550
Yi,

959
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:04,590
thank you.

960
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,230
Oh, silly.

961
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:08,840
However much one can bear,

962
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:10,440
there's a bottom line.

963
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,040
You're my bottom line,

964
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:16,560
as well as Yan.

965
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,670
Mother!

966
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,070
I'm here!

967
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:23,480
- Play with me.
- I'm coming, Yan!

968
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,360
Let's go on.

969
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,670
- Catch it!
- Come on!

970
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:38,990
Mother,

971
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:40,320
don't be mad.

972
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:42,280
I shouldn't have asked you

973
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,230
to bring that up.

974
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,680
Son,

975
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,360
they're two peas in a pod.

976
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:51,110
They're of one heart.

977
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,080
Only you and I are family.

978
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:55,640
Only if we

979
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,590
work together

980
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,150
can we tame

981
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:58,990
those two sisters.

982
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:00,840
Yi promised me

983
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:02,190
that after the Water Festival,

984
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:03,400
she'd made her sister leave.

985
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,790
Now, she's changed her mind

986
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:07,110
and talked back to you

987
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:08,190
for her sister.

988
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:09,520
Do I

989
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:13,440
have to divorce her?

990
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:17,190
Who said that?

991
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:19,670
Didn't you

992
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,000
always say so?

993
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:21,880
Silly boy.

994
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,840
I didn't mean what I said.

995
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,190
I used to serve my mother-in-law, too.

996
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,040
To be honest,

997
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:29,790
except for not having a son,

998
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:30,920
Yi's hardly

999
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:31,880
done anything wrong.

1000
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:35,040
She's second to none as a wife.

1001
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,280
No one

1002
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,680
can be better than her in Lingshui.

1003
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:39,840
If so, why did you find fault

1004
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,960
with her in everything?

1005
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:42,390
Why?

1006
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:44,270
After your grandmother left earlier,

1007
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:46,280
I finally became

1008
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,230
a mother-in-law.

1009
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,840
Couldn't I

1010
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,080
show my power?

1011
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,670
Sometimes,

1012
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:54,110
I was actually mad at you

1013
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,670
because you always took her side.

1014
