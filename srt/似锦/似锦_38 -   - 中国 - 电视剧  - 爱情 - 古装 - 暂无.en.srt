00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,660
(Tiande Hall)

12
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,680
Are you still the same Rongyang?

13
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,870
What have you changed into?

14
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,640
I barely recognize you anymore.

15
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,430
I haven't changed.

16
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,810
It's you who has changed.

17
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,840
My brother would never hurt me,

18
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,640
let alone poison me!

19
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,480
From the moment you handed me

20
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,560
that cup of poisoned tea,

21
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,360
I no longer have a brother.

22
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,190
I truly regret it.

23
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,190
Regret what?

24
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,870
Regret putting you on the throne.

25
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,520
Had it been Prince Xiang on it,

26
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,190
none of this would've happened!

27
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,360
You're deranged!

28
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,840
Do you hear yourself?

29
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,080
I am the Emperor of Dazhou.

30
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,870
What are you insinuating

31
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,190
by saying that to my face?

32
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,870
Nothing.

33
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,190
From this day forward,

34
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,000
you're no longer the Emperor.

35
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,910
You're nothing.

36
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,400
Guards, seize him!

37
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,960
Greetings, Your Majesty.

38
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,400
Cao Yong,

39
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,800
I never thought you'd betray me.

40
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,960
You killed my son.

41
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,150
I've never forgotten that.

42
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,390
Do you think you'll get your way

43
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,960
by trapping me?

44
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,960
I will get my way.

45
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,120
What can you do to me?

46
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,150
At tomorrow's morning court,

47
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,080
I will announce to the realm

48
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,680
that His Majesty is indisposed,

49
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,240
and I will

50
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,560
serve as regent.

51
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:37,900
(Tiande Hall)

52
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,310
Eunuch Liu.

53
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,240
Si, Si!

54
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,480
- Si!
- Miss!

55
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,350
You're awake.

56
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,480
Where am I?

57
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,920
Yu told us to find a safe house

58
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,510
for you to take shelter in

59
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,000
once he got you out.

60
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:54,790
Where is he?

61
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,120
Don't worry, Si.

62
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,190
He said he'd convince His Majesty

63
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,710
to bring down the Grand Princess.

64
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,600
Where's Father, Zhan?

65
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,190
The Grand Princess said

66
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,160
he went to the Palace earlier today

67
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,070
- to file a suit.
- What?

68
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,360
We need a plan fast

69
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,480
to rescue Father.

70
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,800
Calm down. You're too weak.

71
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,640
Lie back.

72
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,310
Yu'll come in a minute.

73
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,560
We'll work it out together.

74
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:18,790
Miss,

75
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,510
where does it hurt, Miss?

76
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:21,830
What to do?

77
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,430
It was my fault, Miss.

78
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,120
I failed to take care of you.

79
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,390
Aman, let's go get more hot water.

80
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,110
I'm fine.

81
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,920
How is my father?

82
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,190
We owe this to him.

83
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,680
His Majesty will punish the Grand Princess.

84
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,920
She that does evil shall find evil.

85
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,510
Get well soon.

86
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,880
Don't worry about other things.

87
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,000
Speaking of other things,

88
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,920
I need to go to Nanwu.

89
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,240
You're too weak

90
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,560
to travel.

91
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,000
But I'm the Saintess.

92
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,830
The war between Nanwu and Dazhou

93
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,680
may break out anytime.

94
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,110
I believe

95
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,390
if I go back to Nanwu

96
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,510
and persuade the Grand Elder

97
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,040
to withdraw,

98
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,160
the war between us

99
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,310
can be avoided,

100
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:14,750
and the people

101
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,870
won't suffer calamity.

102
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,360
I must

103
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,920
take this trip.

104
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,000
Only by fighting with our lives

105
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:23,920
can we be together

106
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,920
openly and honestly forever.

107
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,750
If you go,

108
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,510
we may never see each other again.

109
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,640
But

110
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,960
if I don't give it a try,

111
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,800
I'll end up

112
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,390
as a wandering ghost,

113
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,510
drifting here and there as someone else

114
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,200
and being separated

115
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,000
from you and my family forever.

116
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,670
I cannot

117
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,120
live on like that.

118
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,510
I'll go with you.

119
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,480
You can't.

120
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,200
If you went along,

121
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,000
you'd be convicted of conspiracy.

122
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:56,510
You have to go back.

123
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,360
Only if you're back

124
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,320
can you exonerate me
from escaping from prison.

125
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,030
A brief parting

126
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,560
is for

127
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,720
an everlasting union.

128
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,550
It's a maximum security prison.

129
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,550
She got out right under your nose.

130
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,320
Good-for-nothings!

131
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:29,120
Issue an all-points bulletin

132
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,790
nationwide.

133
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,080
Princess Yan, Jiang Si,

134
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,870
is Nanwu's Saintess.

135
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,550
She deserves death.

136
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,200
Whoever catches her,

137
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,270
alive or dead, will be rewarded.

138
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:41,870
Yes.

139
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,440
Aman,

140
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,600
Si wants to see you.

141
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:48,590
Yes.

142
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,510
How's Si, Yu?

143
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,560
She's getting better.

144
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,440
Miss,

145
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
how are you? Do you feel better?

146
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:01,480
Much better.

147
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:03,910
It must've hurt badly.

148
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,200
Aman, listen to me.

149
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,080
I'm going to Nanwu tomorrow.

150
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,280
Going to Nanwu?

151
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,910
The jaws of death?

152
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,600
She's made her decision.

153
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,700
Would she listen to me?

154
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,030
She can't go. I'll talk to her.

155
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,710
Jiang Si knows how perilous it'll be

156
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:26,440
better than we do.

157
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,510
You know her well.

158
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,550
You can't change her mind.

159
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:33,750
The more people, the bigger the target.

160
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,870
Promise me

161
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:37,910
that you'll go back

162
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,200
to look after my father

163
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,910
and my family for me.

164
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,560
But...

165
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,360
I... I've never

166
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,670
caused you any trouble.

167
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,390
I only want to go with you.

168
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,870
It's different this time.

169
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,240
I need you to do as I say.

170
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,630
I will, Miss. I promise you.

171
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,720
I'll take care of everyone at home.

172
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:04,910
I can't leave right now.

173
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,000
Can any of you go with her?

174
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,550
- I'll go.
- Me too.

175
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,390
Count me in.

176
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,270
This trip will be perilous.

177
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,520
Qi, we have to take precautions.

178
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,340
(Tiande Hall)

179
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:27,150
"I'm indisposed and weak.

180
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:30,270
For the sake of the state and the people,

181
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,320
I appoint Grand Princess Rongyang

182
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,440
regent.

183
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:36,120
Officials shall fully assist her

184
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,600
in achieving national prosperity.

185
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,270
All shall obey her."

186
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,900
A female regent?

187
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,550
That's ridiculous!

188
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,270
Indeed. It's illegal.

189
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,750
Aunt, if Father fell sick,

190
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:53,270
why didn't I hear anything about it?

191
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,870
You should ask yourself.

192
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,390
At a time like this, why did he

193
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,390
seek help from me of all people?

194
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,110
Your Highness,

195
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:11,480
what has His Majesty come down with?

196
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,870
Nanwu's troops at the border

197
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,240
and the internal chaos
caused by their Saintess

198
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:23,000
infuriated and concerned him,

199
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,910
which took a toll on his health.

200
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,480
May I take a look at the edict?

201
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,580
How dare you

202
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,840
doubt His Majesty!

203
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,200
It was issued all of a sudden.

204
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,240
I have to confirm if it was

205
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,380
of His Majesty's free will

206
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,510
before carrying it out.

207
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,110
Iron Guards!

208
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:43,440
I, Cao Yong, obey the edict.

209
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:46,840
I'll do my utmost to assist Your Highness.

210
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,510
A regent is of vital significance.

211
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,030
His Majesty would appoint

212
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,340
the one he trusted the most.

213
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,120
The Grand Princess is most qualified.

214
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,600
I'll obey the edict.

215
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,080
Zhang!

216
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,360
I'll obey the edict.

217
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,000
I'll obey the edict.

218
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:19,120
I'll obey the edict.

219
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:21,150
I'll obey the edict.

220
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,390
Your Majesty,

221
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,870
is the Grand Princess

222
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,840
going to usurp the throne?

223
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,320
I don't think that's her intention.

224
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,200
But Marquis Changxing

225
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,630
is thirsty for power.

226
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:38,270
The power struggle will intensify.

227
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,120
If the Jade Seal remained in my hands,

228
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,910
and they grabbed it from me,

229
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,270
Dazhou would fall.

230
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,030
Tell Cheng in secret

231
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,750
to send the real Jade Seal

232
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:49,750
to Zhen Heng.

233
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,590
I'm sure

234
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,550
Jin will soon receive it.

235
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,670
You trust Prince Yan

236
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:56,790
so much.

237
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,160
I

238
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,550
trust my judgment.

239
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,350
Where's Prince Yan?

240
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,440
Your Highness,

241
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,240
he didn't come to the morning court.

242
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,390
There's no sign of him anywhere.

243
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,440
He must've fled Ling'an

244
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,630
with Jiang Si.

245
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,750
Marquis Changxing, Cao Yong.

246
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:18,990
Your Highness.

247
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,920
Prince Yan

248
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:23,320
helped Nanwu's Saintess,
Jiang Si, escape from prison

249
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,720
and fled with her. Bring him back.

250
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,600
I'll interrogate him myself.

251
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,920
Yes.

252
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,350
Aunt,

253
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,720
what am I guilty of?

254
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,390
There you are.

255
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:46,630
Where's Jiang Si?

256
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,030
Isn't she in prison?

257
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:53,600
Prince Yan, now that you're here,

258
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,200
I don't need to bring you over.

259
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,120
Guards, seize Prince Yan!

260
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:57,960
I dare you!

261
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,840
Aunt,

262
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,440
he's overreaching himself

263
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:04,960
right in your face.

264
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:06,750
Shut up!

265
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:11,630
Oh, I see.

266
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,270
You're acting as regent,

267
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,350
but Cao Yong

268
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,270
means to kill

269
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,180
your nephew.

270
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,440
I wouldn't dare!

271
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,080
I'm here.

272
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,030
No one would dare harm you.

273
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,480
If you don't side with Nanwu's Saintess,

274
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,600
from now on,

275
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,840
no one will give you a hard time.

276
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,440
Your wish is my command, Aunt.

277
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:53,660
(Taiji Hall, Tiande Hall)

278
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,360
Mr. Zhen, is it you?

279
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,960
Yes, Your Highness.

280
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,150
Mr. Zhen, my aunt...

281
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,910
She staged a revolt.

282
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,320
A revolt?

283
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,550
How is His Majesty doing?

284
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:31,710
I'm not sure.

285
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,360
Speed Guards have
surrounded Father's chamber.

286
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,910
Soldiers are all over the harem.

287
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,400
Imperial Insignia Guards were always here.

288
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,120
Why are the Speed Guards on duty?

289
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,700
(Funing Palace)
Your Highness,

290
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,000
it's His Majesty's decision.

291
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,320
We're following his order.

292
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,870
His Majesty's decision?

293
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,000
Your Highness! Your Highness!

294
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,840
Your Highness,

295
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,030
His Majesty said

296
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,670
he wouldn't see anyone today.

297
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,150
If he simply fell ill,

298
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,190
why wouldn't he see others?

299
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,800
Even if he refused to see officials,

300
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,000
would he also not

301
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,840
let his own sons in?

302
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:09,830
Father, Yu Lang came to see you!

303
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,880
Yu Zhang wants to see you, too!

304
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:15,910
Your Highness!

305
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,590
What's all the fuss about?

306
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,310
Do I hear

307
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,720
Lang's and Zhang's voices?

308
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,200
Please don't make it hard for me.

309
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,350
Looks like His Majesty is indeed sick.

310
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,110
Mr. Han, please

311
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,350
keep guarding the gate.

312
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,400
Don't let anyone in

313
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,680
to disturb His Majesty.

314
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,460
(Funing Palace)

315
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,320
Your Majesty,

316
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,070
they asked to see you

317
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,720
but then became quiet.

318
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,750
Were they stopped by those guards?

319
00:17:59,110 --> 00:17:59,950
Your Majesty,

320
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,640
shall I send

321
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,640
a secret message to the princes?

322
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,880
Do you think

323
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,030
Rongyang's soft?

324
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,550
The messenger would've been killed

325
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,720
before your message was sent out.

326
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,200
Zhang, when did you

327
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,680
ally yourself with the Grand Princess?

328
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,240
You'd rather disregard

329
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,080
Father's safety.

330
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,750
Aunt must've promised you
tremendous benefits

331
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:26,350
such as the throne.

332
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,510
What rebellious remarks.

333
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,240
Don't say such things again, Crown Prince.

334
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,240
Zhang,

335
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,480
if Father's in danger,

336
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,750
we'll end up in a lose-lose situation.

337
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,920
Only if we join hands

338
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,080
to get Father out

339
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,720
can everyone win.

340
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,920
When Father's unwell,

341
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,140
Aunt is giving it her all to serve the state.

342
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,200
We're Father's sons,

343
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,110
but she's more devoted.

344
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:57,790
Yet here you're

345
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:59,310
questioning her loyalty.

346
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,640
With all due respect, that's improper.

347
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,510
(He must've paid allegiance)

348
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,550
(to Aunt a long time ago.)

349
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,280
(If so,)

350
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:15,550
(I'll show no mercy to him.)

351
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,590
The Crown Prince tried to persuade

352
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,680
Prince Qi to bring you down,

353
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,590
but Prince Qi said no

354
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,280
and that he'd support your regency.

355
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,200
He can always size up the situation.

356
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,200
He and His Majesty

357
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,920
weren't truly close.

358
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,200
He wouldn't risk himself

359
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:35,110
for anyone including his father.

360
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,920
But the Crown Prince isn't him.

361
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:44,200
Guess what he'll do.

362
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,480
Invite him to the Palace

363
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,270
to dine with me tomorrow.

364
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,000
I'd like to see

365
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,830
how far he can go.

366
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,310
Chuchu, leave with Si.

367
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:08,800
Du'er and I will cover for you.

368
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,590
Split up and meet us in the South.

369
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:11,950
Don't worry.

370
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,560
See you there.

371
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,720
Let's go.

372
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,240
Zhan,

373
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,110
take care.

374
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,260
Let's go the other way.

375
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,340
How exactly is my father?

376
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,040
Princess Fuqing said

377
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,960
he was confined to his chamber.

378
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,480
The top priority is

379
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,720
to figure out a way to rescue him.

380
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,920
Imperial Insignia Guards

381
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,160
in the Palace have been replaced

382
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:01,030
by Iron Guards, Speed Guards,

383
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,230
and Marquis Changxing's guards.

384
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,960
We're way outnumbered.

385
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,480
If we broke in unprepared,

386
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,460
we won't be able to rescue His Majesty,

387
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,880
only to make things even worse.

388
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,150
You have a point.

389
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,110
No one in Ling'an is

390
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,310
the Grand Princess's match.

391
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,270
Urgent news from the front.

392
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,350
Nanwu's troops have invaded

393
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,640
several of our towns

394
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,590
and firebombed them.

395
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,720
This is my first time as regent.

396
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,070
At this moment of life or death,

397
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:37,400
maybe I should take this chance

398
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,920
to establish my authority.

399
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,830
What's your advice, Marquis?

400
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,040
Your Highness,

401
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,240
as far as I know,

402
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,030
Nanwu launched attacks

403
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,680
because of their Saintess.

404
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,070
If she falls into our hands,

405
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,480
we can use her

406
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,750
to make their troops withdraw.

407
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,960
Order all the exits

408
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:04,400
and gates to search everyone carefully.

409
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,240
We must find her as soon as possible.

410
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,550
To deal with Marquis Changxing

411
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,790
and turn things around,

412
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,160
he's our only hope.

413
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,470
- Cui Xu.
- Correct.

414
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,400
But General Cui is

415
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,520
the Grand Princess's husband.

416
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,880
Will he help us?

417
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,480
He's faithful to the state and the people.

418
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,400
He'd never go along with her

419
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,560
in her evil deeds.

420
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,310
Where are his troops stationed?

421
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,080
The Yanxi Camp.

422
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,810
Send a message to the Chiyu Cavalry.

423
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:30,550
Have them escort us

424
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,830
to General Cui's camp.

425
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,190
Yes.

426
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,160
You should be careful, too.

427
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,110
Whatever we can think of,

428
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,680
so can Marquis Changxing

429
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:41,710
and the Grand Princess.

430
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,440
Once they spot any sign of you,

431
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:44,740
you'll be hunted.

432
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,540
She's eager to establish her authority,

433
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,700
so she'll make an example of officials.

434
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,790
You're in greater danger.

435
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:50,960
Why not go with me?

436
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,880
Soldiers are all over the harem.

437
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,790
I'm scared!

438
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,960
Everything will be fine, Your Highness.

439
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,460
I'll figure out a plan.

440
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,000
If anything happens in the Palace,

441
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,590
fly the kite.

442
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:03,630
When I see it,

443
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,720
I'll come to you.

444
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:07,640
Be very careful, Your Highness.

445
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:16,350
Your Highness,

446
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:17,950
I'll stay in Ling'an.

447
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,890
The Empress and Princess Fuqing

448
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:20,730
remain in the Palace.

449
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,820
Someone has to hold the Grand Princess back.

450
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,350
Once you return, I can

451
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:26,840
help you from the inside.

452
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,240
Alright.

453
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:30,630
Take care of yourself.

454
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,160
If possible,

455
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,260
sound Prince Qi and the Crown Prince out.

456
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,850
The enemy is formidable.

457
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:37,500
We could use more allies.

458
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:46,020
(Princess Yan, Jiang Si,
is Nanwu's Saintess.)

459
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:48,950
Go.

460
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:56,720
What to do, Young Master Zhan?

461
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,590
Keep up.

462
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,430
That woman looks suspicious.

463
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,320
Stop her!

464
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,350
She's Nanwu's Saintess!

465
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,640
Go! Seize her!

466
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,070
- Hurry!
- Go!

467
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,040
Go! Stop!

468
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,150
Jiang Si,

469
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,400
how are you holding up?

470
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:26,590
I'm fine.

471
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,070
Go as fast as you can.

472
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,830
I'll fetch some water.

473
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:52,630
Not her.

474
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,760
Come on. Let's go.

475
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,000
Your Highness,

476
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,310
some civilians said

477
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,510
they saw someone looking like the Saintess

478
00:24:58,750 --> 00:24:59,590
going southward.

479
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,520
The South.

480
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,400
They must've gone to the South.

481
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,110
Prince Yan can mobilize the Chiyu Cavalry.

482
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,350
Cui Xu's troops are also there.

483
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:11,920
Jiang Si

484
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,200
can call on those of Nanwu to help her.

485
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,240
Do they think

486
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,350
they can defeat me with their help?

487
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,640
Shijiu, issue an edict.

488
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,720
Order the Chiyu Cavalry and Cui Xu's troops

489
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,200
to invade Nanwu and fight to the end.

490
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,720
They cannot return

491
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,480
until Nanwu's seized.

492
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:48,410
An all-points bulletin for me
has been issued.

493
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,680
I wonder if everything

494
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,520
is fine at home

495
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,790
and if my family will be implicated.

496
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,030
And how are things at Zhan's end?

497
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,400
Are they hunted?

498
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,480
No one has gone after us along the way,

499
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,680
let alone them.

500
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:03,790
I hope so.

501
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,270
I hope all goes well.

502
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:07,870
It will.

503
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,000

Chief,

515
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,200
go over this mountain

516
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,100
and we'll be in Yangui.

517
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,480
- Can you hold on?
- I'm fine.

518
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:29,640
Time is pressing. Let's go.

519
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:43,380
(Crown Prince's Mansion)

520
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,580
Your Highness,

521
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,720
your wife and child have been

522
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,830
sent to her family.

523
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,030
I handpicked you to fight to the death.

524
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,790
Tomorrow is our only chance

525
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,920
and last chance to act.

526
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,510
You'll go to the Palace

527
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:07,720
with me as musicians.

528
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,840
- Yes.
- Yes.

529
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,520
Your Highness,

530
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,790
we still haven't found Yu Jin.

531
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:13,630
Still not?

532
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,550
Send more people to look for him.

533
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,310
Whatever it takes,

534
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,240
you must find him.

535
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,390
Yes.

536
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,840
Your Highness,

537
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,590
the Crown Prince came to see you.

538
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,520
Send him in.

539
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,920
Greetings, Aunt.

540
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,790
Crown Prince,

541
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,830
who are they...?

542
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:37,950
Aunt,

543
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,200
I selected a group

544
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,040
of musicians for you.

545
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:41,480
All of them are highly skilled.

546
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,560
Two days ago,

547
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,190
I was so worried about Father's illness

548
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:46,390
that I said things

549
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,020
I shouldn't have at the morning court

550
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,110
and offended you.

551
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,400
Here I am to apologize.

552
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:53,160
With you safeguarding Dazhou,

553
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,030
the state will thrive

554
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,440
in peace and harmony.

555
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,310
I'm glad you've come around.

556
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,760
Be seated.

557
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:13,840
Lang,

558
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:17,240
how do you feel about me

559
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,640
acting as regent?

560
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:20,510
I want to hear

561
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:21,790
your heartfelt words.

562
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,590
At first, I disapproved

563
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,160
of your action.

564
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:27,440
By rights,

565
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,160
I should act as regent.

566
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,640
Are those your heartfelt words?

567
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,160
Don't get me wrong, Aunt.

568
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:37,920
I soon realized

569
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,200
you did so for my sake.

570
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,640
That's why I came to apologize.

571
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,310
I know I'm incapable.

572
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45,550
If anything bad happened,

573
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,000
Father would blame me.

574
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:49,680
More importantly,

575
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,200
you tried to

576
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:52,750
look out for me.

577
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:55,310
I still have a lot to learn.

578
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:57,110
I'm glad you know.

579
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:00,680
Thank you for your service.

580
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,510
I toast you, Aunt.

581
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:18,350
Your Majesty.

582
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,560
What?

583
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,240
What's up?

584
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,030
Father is in grave danger.

585
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,550
You stole the throne from me

586
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,270
and killed my mother.

587
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,680
I'll avenge her murder on you!

588
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:54,640
The Grand Princess

589
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:58,310
killed... killed the Crown Prince!

590
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:37,140
(Taiji Hall, Tiande Hall)

591
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,030
Greetings, Your Highness.

592
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,590
I canceled this morning's court

593
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,960
because I heard

594
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,070
someone colluded with other officials

595
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:58,720
to impeach me.

596
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:00,590
You've devoted yourself to Dazhou.

597
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,550
Those fools shouldn't have

598
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:03,400
ganged up on you.

599
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:04,880
Ideally,

600
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:06,310
you couldn't wait

601
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,400
for me to be in power

602
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,030
to make you the Emperor.

603
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,560
But now,

604
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:13,000
those senior officials

605
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,750
are giving me a headache.

606
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,310
I need

607
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,310
someone capable

608
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,240
of pacifying them.

609
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:24,790
You're a prince.

610
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,640
Whether you'll help me or not

611
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:29,640
is up to you.

612
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:33,230
Your regency is perfectly justified.

613
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,510
I ought to assist you.

614
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:35,840
Very well.

615
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,110
Relay my message.

616
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:43,440
The Crown Prince staged a revolt last night.

617
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:47,240
I've had him executed.

618
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,270
I'll learn from his crime.

619
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,200
I, Yu Zhang, will forever be loyal to you.

620
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:04,400
(Zhang, you're smart enough)

621
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:06,920
(to know what to do.)

622
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,840
(I understand.)

623
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,920
Prince Qi

624
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,000
seems to have yielded to the Grand Princess.

625
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,800
What about Jin?

626
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,240
Prince Yan

627
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,440
has left Ling'an overnight.

628
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,240
Right now,

629
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,440
in all of Dazhou, only one person

630
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,590
can deal with Rongyang.

631
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,350
Do you mean...

632
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,560
General Cui?

633
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,070
He and Prince Yan

634
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,400
will join forces to rescue you.

635
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,220
(Yangui)

636
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,220
(Zhou)

637
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:13,340
(Yangui)

638
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:14,710
Welcome back, General Yu.

639
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,030
All rise.

640
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,630
Chief, what took you so long?

641
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:21,080
Have all of you been well?

642
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,800
As soon as I received your message,

643
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,190
I gathered all our men

644
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,480
and started training them.

645
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,710
(Leng Ying)
They're in their best shape

646
00:34:26,711 --> 00:34:27,990
(Chiyu Cavalryman)
waiting for your return.

647
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:28,910
What about Nanwu?

648
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:31,190
They're ready to act. I'm afraid...

649
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:45,990
Darling!

650
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,800
Something happened in the Palace.

651
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,680
Prince Qi,

652
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,030
Mr. Zhen, Zhen Heng, is here.

653
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:15,110
What brings you to my place

654
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
this late, Mr. Zhen?

655
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,000
Prince Qi,

656
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,320
the Crown Prince

657
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,360
was killed by the Grand Princess.

658
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:25,230
I was one step too late.

659
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:26,550
That's why

660
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,620
I implore you to save His Majesty

661
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,360
with me.

662
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,590
His Majesty is only sick.

663
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,610
What do you mean by save him?

664
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,670
Or has his condition worsened?

665
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:38,000
Stop pretending, Prince Qi.

666
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,070
You know what happened.

667
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:42,590
But I believe you didn't choose to

668
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,920
collude with the Grand Princess

669
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,440
or mean to

670
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,550
seize the throne.

671
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,670
How dare you try to read my mind!

672
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,480
Your Highness, a state can't be leaderless!

673
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:55,690
The Crown Prince is dead.

674
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:56,880
Prince Qi

675
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:59,760
isn't loyal to you wholeheartedly.

676
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,710
Although he's paid allegiance to you,

677
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,150
his mother is still alive.

678
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,230
If you make him the new Emperor,

679
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,440
you're unlikely

680
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,280
to hold court from behind a screen

681
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,360
or be in power.

682
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:10,800
Your Highness,

683
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:13,070
are you satisfied

684
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:14,440
with being a mere regent?

685
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,920
Forgive me if I cross the line,

686
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:23,030
but why not proclaim yourself queen?

687
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:26,400
If things drag on

688
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:28,640
until those officials gang up on you,

689
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,150
forcing you to step down,

690
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,510
you'll have no way out.

691
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:36,110
You're right.

692
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,760
I've lost everything.

693
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,500
Instead of sitting still waiting for death,

694
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:46,110
I'd rather sit on that throne

695
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,400
to gain all.

696
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:24,400
(I've decided to hand over the throne
to Grand Princess Rongyang.)

697
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,600
Rongyang,

698
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:28,880
you claimed to take revenge

699
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,190
for Mingyue.

700
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:33,160
Turns out, all that you've done

701
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,190
is to usurp my throne.

702
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:42,670
Whatever.

703
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:44,400
At this stage,

704
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,590
you'd better sign the edict

705
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:48,110
and hand over the Jade Seal.

706
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,800
As you know,

707
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:51,550
I'm not the patient type.

708
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,960
I'll talk to General Cui

709
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,350
about how we can rescue His Majesty.

710
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,880
You stay here and rest.

711
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,440
When entering the gate,

712
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,070
I saw the Chiyu Cavalrymen

713
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,230
on high alert.

714
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,690
And there were signs

715
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,360
of a firebomb attack in town.

716
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:21,070
Clearly, Nanwu is

717
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:22,630
ready to launch attacks.

718
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,840
In this case,

719
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,760
General Cui won't leave the border

720
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,100
to rescue His Majesty with you.

721
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,660
Only if Nanwu's troops retreat

722
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,510
will there be a slim chance of survival.

723
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:32,480
However hard it is,

724
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,400
I must have a try.

725
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,120
Jiang!

726
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,320
Jiang!

727
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,160
Chuchu!

728
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,120
Zhan!

729
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,260
- Chuchu!
- Jiang Zhan!

730
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,240
Jiang Zhan!

731
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:56,390
Zhan, drink.

732
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:58,550
Have some water.

733
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,230
What happened?

734
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,320
Si,

735
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,840
it was all my fault.

736
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,880
I wasn't able to save them.

737
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:14,100
What are you talking about?

738
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,070
Who do you mean?

739
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,670
Aman and Du'er...

740
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:23,190
died.

741
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,720
Aman?

742
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:28,480
How come?

743
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:30,110
Why was she with you?

744
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:32,070
I had told her to leave.

745
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,070
She lied to you.

746
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,190
We'll stick to the plan.

747
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,030
Split up and meet in the South.

748
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:42,990
Young Master Zhan!

749
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,680
Aman?

750
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,150
Didn't Si tell you to leave?

751
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:49,800
I'll go with you.

752
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,550
Why are you in Si's dress?

753
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:53,230
This is my idea.

754
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,440
She and the others will be safer.

755
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,680
- Aman...
- Young Master Zhan,

756
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,190
I've made up my mind.

757
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,010
(...Jiang Si is Nanwu's Saintess.)

758
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:02,190
What to do, Young Master Zhan?

759
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,630
Keep up, Aman.

760
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:22,950
- Shoot!
- Watch out!

761
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:30,390
- Come on!
- Hold him!

762
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:04,510
Surrender now!

763
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,160
Shoot!

764
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:16,920
No, stop!

765
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,400
Du'er, Du'er!

766
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,520
The Grand Princess ordered us

767
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:24,280
to seize the Saintess alive!

768
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,510
Without Miss Si,

769
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,800
I would starved to death on the streets.

770
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,800
Finally,

771
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:43,110
I can repay her for saving my life.

772
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,630
You won't be able to seize me!

773
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,440
Pull yourself together, Jiang Si.

774
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,280
Don't forget

775
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,190
you're Nanwu's Saintess.

776
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:43,960
They risked their lives

777
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,040
so that you could come here.

778
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:46,480
Nanwu is so close.

779
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:48,920
Are you going to give up?

780
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:04,700
