No!

13
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,430
Si cannot marry Prince Yan!

14
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,560
Do you hear yourself?

15
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,400
Brother,

16
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,200
are you too excited

17
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,640
to remain rational?

18
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,280
I'm more rational than anyone!

19
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,510
This marriage

20
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,280
cannot happen!

21
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,950
Tell me why.

22
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,870
What's wrong with it?

23
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,430
Marrying a prince is
stepping into a web of intrigue.

24
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,200
We can't put Si in harm's way!

25
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,350
Look at you

26
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,680
being so paranoid.

27
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,240
Yes.

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,910
At the banquet,

29
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,400
Prince Yan gave all the roses

30
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,630
to Si.

31
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,240
He truly loves her.

32
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,800
He'll protect her.

33
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,400
Si will be fine!

34
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,120
You don't understand!

35
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,630
I won't allow

36
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,470
this marriage.

37
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,800
The edict has been issued.

38
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,240
It's been settled.

39
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,680
Marriage requires

40
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,960
parents' approval.

41
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,590
Come here, Ancheng.

42
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,960
Come here!

43
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,030
You've been idling the days away

44
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,680
in the house these years.

45
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,590
You have no idea

46
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,190
about the situation outside!

47
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,360
Mother,

48
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,960
she can marry anyone

49
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,400
except for Prince Yan!

50
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,910
Why?

51
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,000
He's a wonderful young man.

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,910
When he came to visit,

53
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,750
didn't you keep praising him?

54
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,800
Back then,

55
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,280
I didn't know who he really was.

56
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,710
So what if you know now?

57
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,120
I'm done talking to you!

58
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,420
- Brother.
- Come back!

59
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,540
(Cixin Hall)
Brother!

60
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,310
Don't be mad, Mother.

61
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,150
He simply

62
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,590
loves his daughter too much

63
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,520
to process the fact

64
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,520
that she'll get married and leave.

65
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,190
But that's inevitable.

66
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,240
He'll come around.

67
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,150
I hope so.

68
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,750
Who doesn't love their children?

69
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:37,360
- Right.
- But your brother is

70
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,030
so not himself today.

71
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:40,910
What happened?

72
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,680
This is your favorite. Try it, Your Grace.

73
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,680
Please eat something, Your Grace.

74
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,000
If you collapse,

75
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,030
the Grand Princess

76
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,070
will kill all of us, Your Grace.

77
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,030
I said no.

78
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,630
You hear me? No!

79
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,430
You may leave.

80
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,590
Are you scalded?

81
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,120
Didn't you promise me that?

82
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,480
Why was Jiang Si betrothed to him,

83
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:26,040
not me?

84
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,870
There, there.

85
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,120
Jiang Si doesn't deserve him.

86
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,270
His Majesty's betrothal

87
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:35,120
is a nail in her coffin.

88
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:39,000
A nail in her coffin? What do you mean?

89
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,510
Have I ever

90
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,070
made a promise to you

91
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,800
that I failed to deliver?

92
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,070
Si,

93
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,920
it's all my fault.

94
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,510
Had I married you

95
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,560
into an ordinary family earlier,

96
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,190
you wouldn't have

97
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,480
ended up in this death trap.

98
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:03,790
Father,

99
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,920
it's not as gruesome as you say.

100
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,240
Why were you of all those girls

101
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,430
betrothed to Prince Yan?

102
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,800
He must've played tricks

103
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,950
under the table.

104
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,750
I'm going to confront him now!

105
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,630
Father, if you go,

106
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,310
others will think

107
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,390
I might've been fooling around with him

108
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,000
since a long time ago.

109
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,430
Please calm down.

110
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:31,240
Prince Yan is a good man.

111
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,430
And...

112
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,510
And I

113
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,680
adore him.

114
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,480
Oh, silly,

115
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,040
you're too naive.

116
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,240
A good man

117
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,390
might not be a good husband.

118
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:49,070
Not to mention, he's hardly good!

119
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:49,910
Otherwise,

120
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,360
he wouldn't have fooled us.

121
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,800
He didn't fool us.

122
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,510
Actually, I knew

123
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,430
he was a prince.

124
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,270
He hid it for a reason.

125
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,390
I think

126
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,800
given his personality and integrity,

127
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,950
I can trust him with my life.

128
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,640
After all,

129
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,750
our life is

130
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,720
up to us.

131
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,030
Si,

132
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,950
are you sure

133
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,000
he'll never betray you?

134
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,240
Don't forget he's a prince.

135
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,630
If he falls in love

136
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:19,570
with someone else later,

137
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,390
there's nothing you can do.

138
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,800
You can't divorce him

139
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,640
even if you want to.

140
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,590
Look, Father,

141
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,070
His Majesty has issued

142
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,270
the edict of betrothal.

143
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,750
Whether I like it or not,

144
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,000
what can I do?

145
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:32,920
Feign illness.

146
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:36,480
Then I'll sneak you out of the city.

147
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,190
You can marry someone else

148
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,430
or go wherever you like.

149
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,870
You'll live a carefree life anyway.

150
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,190
That's most important.

151
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,360
I can't live in the dark

152
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,950
for the rest of my life.

153
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,680
I just want to be myself,

154
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,430
be Earl Dongping's daughter.

155
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,960
Father,

156
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,950
trust me. It's really not that bad.

157
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,510
Prince Yan,

158
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,950
can we hire some maids

159
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,390
to attend to the mansion?

160
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,140
This place is much bigger

161
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,720
than the courtyard in Zaoshu Lane.

162
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,630
Long Dan can't handle everything alone.

163
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,240
Once Princess Yan arrives,

164
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,470
there will be maids.

165
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,920
I used to hold a sword

166
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,920
to kill enemies.

167
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,520
Now, I'm holding a rag to do cleaning.

168
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,750
An imperial wedding is

169
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,720
too complicated and elaborate.

170
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,430
I'm worried that my dear Si will be worn out.

171
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,160
You care so much about her, Chief.

172
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,600
Our room needs Pear Agarwood Incense.

173
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,000
Si likes its scent.

174
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,190
Prepare enough of it.

175
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,390
Everything in this courtyard

176
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,600
needs to be rearranged

177
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,070
to her taste.

178
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,160
Also, she loves

179
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,840
crabapple trees.

180
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,040
Plant more of those.

181
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,560
Fine. Noted.

182
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,310
When Si and I

183
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,310
have children,

184
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,560
we'll name our son...

185
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,800
And we'll call our daughter...

186
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,590
What? What's your son's name?

187
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:04,870
And your daughter's?

188
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:05,850
I didn't get that, Chief.

189
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,910
Good.

190
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,870
Ke,

191
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,510
when Yi got married,

192
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,630
I came to tell you the news.

193
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,000
A while ago,

194
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,510
she moved back home.

195
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,550
I was afraid to let you know.

196
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,080
She's doing fine, though.

197
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,670
Don't worry.

198
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,000
Now,

199
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:09,960
our youngest, Si,

200
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,390
is also getting married.

201
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,940
You shouldn't have got out of bed.

202
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,150
I'm fine.

203
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,960
I want to take another look at our home,

204
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,870
at you.

205
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,350
Ancheng,

206
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:40,960
am I no longer pretty

207
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,550
in your eyes?

208
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,320
Darling,

209
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,480
in my eyes,

210
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,670
you're always the prettiest.

211
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,870
Aren't you a sweet talker?

212
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,080
Of course.

213
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,270
Who else

214
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,600
could I sweet-talk?

215
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:09,750
Ancheng,

216
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,360
you mean

217
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,000
the most to me.

218
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,550
I've never regretted

219
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,550
marrying you.

220
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,630
Please

221
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,510
take care of our children.

222
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,150
Don't let them get hurt.

223
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,790
Don't worry too much.

224
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,030
You'll be fine, Ke.

225
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,060
As long as you're with me,

226
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,550
our children will be fine.

227
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,960
Stay with me!

228
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,880
Ke!

(to take care of all of you.)

234
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,390
(There's something)

235
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,030
(I can't tell you.)

236
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,390
(That's exactly why I tried to)

237
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:20,080
(stop you from marrying a prince.)

238
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,200

(Haitang Chamber)

242
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,200
Miss!

243
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,960
Miss. Miss, are you alright?

244
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,080
Miss!

245
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,750
Miss, you... you're coughing up blood!

246
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,030
Miss! Help! Help!

247
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:01,990
Stay with me, Miss!

248
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,960
Help!

249
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,200
Coughed up blood?

250
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,120
Why didn't you tell me at once last night?

251
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,870
Last night, she said she was sleepy,

252
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,720
thinking she'd be fine after resting.

253
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,510
However, she wasn't up yet at noon.

254
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,320
I tried to wake her up but failed.

255
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,630
Call a physician now!

256
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,080
I already have.

257
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,000
Why did she cough up blood?

258
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,080
Did she eat

259
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,550
or drink something bad?

260
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,870
Think!

261
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,440
She had...

262
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,920
Ginger soup!

263
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,320
She had ginger soup from Ms. Xiao.

264
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,500
(Haitang Chamber)

265
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,920
Brother.

266
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,670
- Mother.
- We heard Si fell sick.

267
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:39,980
Mother came to check on her.

268
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,020
Did you call a physician?

269
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:41,930
Save it, Ms. Xiao!

270
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:42,870
Don't play innocent!

271
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,100
Last night, she had ginger soup

272
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,120
from you,

273
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,520
causing her to cough up blood.

274
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,320
Thankfully, I forgot to wash the bowl.

275
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,910
Or the evidence would've been gone!

276
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,600
Was that soup from you?

277
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,630
Say it!

278
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,080
What's wrong with that soup?

279
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,720
Don't blame me for things I didn't do.

280
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,270
Mother, last night,

281
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,600
one of my senior maids

282
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,360
splashed water all over Si by accident.

283
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,390
To prevent a cold,

284
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,840
I brought her a bowl of ginger soup.

285
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,080
What's wrong with it?

286
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,870
What are you doing, Mrs. Li?

287
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,440
Mrs. Li

288
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,080
was the meanest.

289
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,960
She had no respect for you.

290
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,750
Now, she's changed

291
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,030
and had them bring you bath water.

292
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,390
She's the same.

293
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,610
She used to bully us because we were weak.

294
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,750
Now that you're going to be a princess,

295
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,320
I dare her to tread on us again.

296
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,870
Are you burning

297
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,960
Pear Agarwood Incense tonight again?

298
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,390
As pear juice blends in agarwood,

299
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,600
the sweet scent lingers.

300
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,270
It's the best incense for sleep.

301
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:58,510
Si, may I come in?

302
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,840
Open the door.

303
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,200
Ms. Xiao.

304
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,440
It's late, Aunt Xiao.

305
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,390
What brings you here?

306
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,480
I came to bring you ginger soup.

307
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,030
Just now, I noticed her fluster

308
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,750
and pushed her to tell me the truth.

309
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,000
You see, Mrs. Li

310
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,320
didn't do that on purpose.

311
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,270
I made this bowl of ginger soup.

312
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,720
Take it while it's hot

313
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,870
to warm your body

314
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,200
in case you catch a cold.

315
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,320
Thanks for the soup.

316
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,910
I'll take it.

317
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,800
Aman.

318
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:34,670
No need to trouble yourself

319
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,320
with such things again, though.

320
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,790
Si, I know

321
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:40,630
I was

322
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,870
such a fool

323
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,720
and did terrible things to you.

324
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,600
The future of our clan

325
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,270
relies on you.

326
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:49,910
Our two branches

327
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,130
should support each other.

328
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,270
What poison did you use?

329
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,670
I poisoned her?

330
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,720
You won't admit it?

331
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,360
Once the physician arrives,

332
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,240
he'll find out!

333
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:00,550
You're defaming an innocent person!

334
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:01,920
We need no physician.

335
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,350
You said the soup was poisoned, huh?

336
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,280
I'll take the rest

337
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,280
to prove myself!

338
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,390
Zhan is too worried about his sister.

339
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,000
Don't take it to heart.

340
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:17,510
Mother,

341
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,030
I did make mistakes,

342
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,910
and I annoyed tons of people,

343
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,480
but all that I did was

344
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,670
for the sake of our clan.

345
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,150
Look, Mother.

346
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,480
Right now, even a maid

347
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,510
can falsely accuse me

348
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,870
of poisoning my own niece!

349
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,390
Mother, I'm too humiliated

350
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,550
to keep staying in this house.

351
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,030
Please let me go, Mother.

352
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,550
Alright. That's enough.

353
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,560
Get up already.

354
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,160
Get up.

355
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,120
Although you're Si's maid,

356
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,910
you've crossed the line

357
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,030
by slandering the mistress of this house.

358
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,790
Drag her out.

359
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,060
Lock her in the woodshed

360
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,510
with no food for a day and a night

361
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,430
so that she'll learn to

362
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,030
watch her mouth!

363
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,390
- Grandmother!
- I need to look after Miss Si!

364
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,240
Shut up! You don't have a say here!

365
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,440
Move it!

366
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,840
Grandmother,

367
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,190
Aman lost her head for the moment

368
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:13,900
and talked wildly.

369
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,800
Si is still sick.

370
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:16,900
Aman has to attend to her!

371
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,920
Yes, Mother.

372
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,390
Please let her stay

373
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,390
to look after Si.

374
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,550
Is there no other maid

375
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,670
in this big house

376
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,720
to take care of Si?

377
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,360
Maybe

378
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,080
it was Aman

379
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,550
who made Si

380
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,840
eat something bad,

381
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,150
causing my poor niece

382
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,030
to fall ill!

383
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,080
Right now,

384
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,240
do I need approval

385
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:42,240
from you two to punish a maid?

386
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:55,470
Not sick?

387
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,870
But why did she cough up blood?

388
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,440
Why is she still in a coma?

389
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,720
- Well...
- That's right.

390
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,910
Coughing up blood and a coma...

391
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,800
Ancheng,

392
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:07,000
is her condition the same

393
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,070
as that of Su...?

394
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,110
No, no, no. It can't be!

395
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,350
Physician Xu,

396
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,750
I remember

397
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,750
you examined Su as well.

398
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,550
You remind me of that.

399
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,440
Their symptoms are quite similar.

400
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,270
After Ms. Su gave birth,

401
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,720
she coughed up blood and fainted.

402
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,790
Her condition rapidly worsened.

403
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,480
A few days later,

404
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,400
she died of heart failure.

405
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,590
I went through

406
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,680
all the medical books

407
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,920
but didn't find the cause.

408
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,920
Master, you also hired

409
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,200
all the skilled physicians

410
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,190
in town,

411
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:41,270
but none of them could help her.

412
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,480
No! Impossible!

413
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,640
Si couldn't have

414
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,720
caught the same disease as her mother!

415
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,270
I'm really sorry.

416
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,550
Please excuse me.

417
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,590
This way, please, Physician Xu.

418
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,270
Could it be

419
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:59,720
a genetic disease?

420
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:00,750
No way.

421
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,680
Were it genetic,

422
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:03,830
how come Zhan and Yi

423
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,310
turned out fine?

424
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,640
- Right.
- Si

425
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,440
was always healthy.

426
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,350
It must've been Aman's fault

427
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,200
that Si fell sick.

428
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,190
Mother,

429
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,720
let's go to the main hall

430
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,960
and discuss

431
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,830
how to help her.

432
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,200
Si should rest in peace.

433
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,840
- Sure.
- Alright.

434
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,030
Poor girl.

435
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,200
Mrs. Li, stay with her

436
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,590
in case something bad happens again!

437
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,070
Yes, My Lady.

438
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,030
What? Coughed up blood?

439
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,070
- What about Aman?
- Grandmother had her

440
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,370
locked in the woodshed.

441
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,880
I'm going to see Yu.

442
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,720
You go ahead.

443
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:38,910
Chief,

444
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:40,350
didn't we buy a little bit too much?

445
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:41,690
It's once in a lifetime.

446
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:42,540
She deserves the best.

447
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,720
I can't be cheap!

448
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,590
- I see.
- Hey, Zhan. Why didn't you go in?

449
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,430
You're back!

450
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,960
Help! Bad news!

451
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,310
- What's wrong?
- Si is in a coma!

452
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:52,870
Chief...

453
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:02,430
So...

454
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,720
So cold...

455
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,230
So cold... So...

456
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,190
Cold?

457
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,520
Feeling better?

458
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,200
- Hot...
- What about now?

459
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,150
Hot...

460
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:14,430
So warm!

461
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:15,830
Feeling cold and then hot.

462
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,270
What have you come down with?

463
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:18,870
Help!

464
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:21,670
Anyone there?

465
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,680
That country girl...

466
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:24,310
Is everyone in this house dead?

467
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,830
(Haitang Chamber)

468
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:27,920
No one was there.

469
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:36,720
Miss, Earl Dongping's mansion

470
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,920
has rules.

471
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,350
You aren't in a market.

472
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,310
Please don't shout.

473
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,830
Miss Si is sick.

474
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,430
Saying someone's dead can be a curse.

475
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,830
You know she's sick, huh?

476
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,080
She's ill

477
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,110
while here you're

478
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,960
eating and chatting in her courtyard.

479
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,110
Is this also your rule?

480
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,480
Didn't you tell us

481
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,680
to stay away from her,

482
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,510
and that was Young Master Zhan's order?

483
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,850
You're taking such good care

484
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:01,240
of Miss Si.

485
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,790
Is it because Young Master Zhan

486
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:03,960
promised you something?

487
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:07,640
You know, he's a player.

488
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,240
Don't be fooled

489
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,830
and end up with nothing.

490
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,510
You, fetch a basin of hot water.

491
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,920
You, fetch ice cubes.

492
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,240
And you,

493
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,880
tell the Earl to fetch Imperial Physicians

494
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,520
from the Palace.

495
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:29,670
Do as I say,

496
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,510
or my dagger will cut

497
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,750
something else next time.

498
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:46,480
What exactly happened?

499
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,830
Jiang Zhan didn't say much.

500
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,040
Si's said to have the same

501
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,220
strange disease as her mother,

502
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,920
coughing up blood and being in a coma,

503
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,680
leading to heart failure.

504
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,080
I'll call Imperial Physicians.

505
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,760
- You stay with her.
- Hold on!

506
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,340
The Earl just walked them out.

507
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,480
They were a bunch of quacks.

508
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:06,670
They took her pulse but could do nothing,

509
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:07,830
not even write a prescription.

510
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,270
I know you've been

511
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,430
trying to protect your family

512
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,590
and lead a peaceful life.

513
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,550
But only if I can keep a foothold

514
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,720
will I be able to protect you.

515
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,400
Didn't you promise

516
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,480
to keep me safe

517
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,680
and protect me?

518
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:42,960
I thought I'd never

519
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,200
see you again.

520
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,480
What happened to you?

521
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,920
You were fine just a few days ago.

522
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,680
Snake Grass.

523
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,280
Do you mean

524
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,200
you were poisoned by it?

525
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,240
It can cure you?

526
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,390
Snake Grass.

527
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,030
People know

528
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,640
it's highly toxic,

529
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:28,950
but they don't know

530
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:31,680
it's also an antidote to various poisons.

531
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,030
Hang in there. Wait for me!

One more thing, Your Highness.

Earl Dongping's Mansion

557
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,920
hired all the physicians in town,

558
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:46,270
but they failed to remove Jiang Si's poison.

559
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,030
She's on her deathbed.

560
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,920
Your Highness, you'll soon receive

561
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,960
good news.

Everyone is worried about you.

563
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,000
I'll go and tell them you're fine.

564
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,480
Not now.

565
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,350
I didn't catch a disease.

566
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,000
I believe

567
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,200
I was poisoned.

568
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:08,350
By whom?

569
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,000
It must've been my aunt.

570
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,640
First, her maid

571
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,930
splashed water all over me.

572
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,130
Then she had them bring me bath water.

573
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:18,030
Finally, she brought me ginger soup

574
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,910
that'd prove her innocence.

575
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,330
All that couldn't have been a coincidence

576
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:23,830
but all part of her scheme.

577
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:30,960
Are you going to pretend to be sick

578
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:32,960
until she gives herself away?

579
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,240
The day has broken.

580
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,270
Let's put on a show

581
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:42,780
to use her scheme against her.

582
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,830
Your Highness, are you sure

583
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:49,790
that'll save Si's life?

584
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:50,650
I've seen someone

585
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:51,580
- like that.
- Brother.

586
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,660
- It's worth a try.
- Wait!

587
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,240
What now, Xiao?

588
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:56,750
I understand you're eager to save Si,

589
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:59,240
but Prince Yan is a stranger.

590
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:00,640
It's inappropriate for him

591
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:01,590
to enter her room.

592
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:03,350
He and Si have engaged.

593
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,590
What stranger?

594
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,480
Her life is more important than anything!

595
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,750
Come with me!

596
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:10,820
My Lady,

597
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,590
aren't we going to stop him from going in?

598
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,590
Look at them dashing.

599
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:15,750
How could I stop them?

600
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,790
More words and suspicion will rise.

601
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,640
How's she?

602
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:25,830
Her pulse

603
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,590
matches that of the patient I saw

604
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,470
years back.

605
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,470
It's going slow and fast.

606
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,920
There's a clot at the Luxi Point
behind her ear.

607
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,590
That matches, too.

608
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:35,390
Father!

609
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,160
Father, how is Si?

610
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,150
Calm down.

611
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,960
Prince Yan is taking her pulse.

612
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,030
He once saw someone

613
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:45,070
with similar symptoms in Nanwu.

614
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,020
Is she suffering from the same disease

615
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:48,550
as my mother?

616
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:53,880
It's that disease.

617
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,880
The patients will die in a coma.

618
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,350
They feel

619
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,160
hot and cold before that.

620
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,070
Yes! Si was like that yesterday,

621
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:03,880
saying she felt too hot or too cold.

622
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,110
Is there a cure, Your Highness?

623
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,240
Don't worry.

624
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:09,090
I have the prescription from years back.

625
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,000
Thank goodness!

626
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,350
Si will be fine, Father!

627
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,960
That's great!

628
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,360
Thanks, Your Highness.

629
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,910
Azhu, fetch enough handkerchiefs

630
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,180
to wipe away Si's sweat.

631
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:22,270
What should we do, Your Highness?

632
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:24,630
I'm glad you're here.

633
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,860
I'll tell all of you now. Listen carefully.

634
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,510
Her disease is deteriorating fast.

635
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,310
The decoction can't go wrong.

636
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:32,720
The timing, heat, and order

637
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,800
shall all be precise.

638
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,350
To make the poisoner

639
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:36,400
fall into the trap,

640
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:37,350
the prescription

641
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:39,110
needs to be demanding.

642
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,680
Aunt Xiao is calculative.

643
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,310
Were it too simple and easy,

644
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,110
she'd see right through our plan.

645
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,790
That's why

646
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,400
it should include three steps at least.

647
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,400
The first dose is to stabilize her.

648
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,510
Decoct it on high heat for two hours.

649
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,750
The second, cool her down.

650
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,510
Decoct it on low heat for four hours.

651
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:57,640
The last one

652
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:59,680
is the key to detoxification.

653
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,920
Use morning dew to decoct the herbs

654
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:04,070
on high heat for three hours

655
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,640
and then on low heat for two more.

656
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,760
My Lady,

657
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,480
plants near venomous snakes

658
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,590
can remove snake venom.

659
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,760
Did Prince Yan

660
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,640
get lucky and find the antidote?

661
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,680
But what are the odds?

662
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,350
Calm down. Don't panic.

663
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:21,510
Have our people watch her chamber closely.

664
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,440
Find out if they really are decocting herbs

665
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,680
or putting on a show.

666
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:27,270
Will this cure Si?

667
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,560
Relax.

668
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:29,870
I don't trust others,

669
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,880
but Qi is trustworthy.

670
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,110
Si...

671
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,110
Si's hand moved!

672
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:50,960
That jinx!

673
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,680
She just won't die!

674
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,310
Is Yu Qi's prescription

675
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,200
able to remove the poison?

676
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,390
Don't worry.

677
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,200
The last dose is the key.

678
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:01,790
We still have a chance.

679
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:05,790
By the way,

680
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:07,200
one of the herbs

681
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,040
in the third dose

682
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,790
was brought back from Nanwu.

683
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,440
It can't be found in Ling'an.

684
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,070
Without it,

685
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:15,400
all our efforts will be in vain.

686
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,390
- I see.
- Don't worry.

687
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,310
With all of us here watching the decoction,

688
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:20,420
nothing will go wrong.

689
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,620
We live and die with it.

690
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,400
(We aren't decocting herbs)

691
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:25,850
(but testing human nature.)

692
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:28,160
They've started making the second dose.

693
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:29,750
There's no time to think.

694
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,880
Once we

695
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,720
ruin the third dose,

696
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,240
even deities

697
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,750
can't save her life.

698
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,230
Then this household will be

699
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,350
fully under your control.

700
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,280
Is that new maid,

701
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,880
Fangqin, in Mother's room,

702
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,480
your niece?

703
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,830
She's as timid as a mouse.

704
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,150
- I'm afraid...
- Enough!

705
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:49,790
There's no time to be afraid.

706
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:57,750
Watch the time.

707
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,830
When the last dose is half done,

708
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,310
have Fangqin go and...

709
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:04,110
Yes.

710
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,440
Did we fall asleep?

711
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:25,590
We agreed to...

712
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,160
Did you gather all the dew?

713
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,190
Miss Si!

714
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:35,030
- Aman, you're back.
- Young Master!

715
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:36,680
How's Miss Si doing?

716
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:39,720
Is she alright, Your Highness?

717
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,350
Take it easy.

718
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:47,950
Ms. Yi.

719
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,000
Still unconscious.

720
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:54,670
Decoct the third dose.

721
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,000
Now!

722
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:07,240
The final step of our plan is

723
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,550
to give them a chance to act.

724
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,830
When you're away,

725
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,000
they'll do it.

726
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:22,430
Ms. Yi,

727
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:24,920
Lady Jiang said you stayed up all night

728
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,410
and had me bring you cakes

729
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:27,350
in case you're hungry.

730
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,720
Thanks. I'll take it.

731
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,920
Are Prince Yan

732
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,060
and Young Master Zhan inside?

733
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,400
I'll bring the cakes to them.

734
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:34,630
No need.

735
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,000
Leave that to me.

736
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,510
Prince Yan had to go home.

737
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,960
Please thank Grandmother for us.

738
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:42,590
Eat the cakes, Ms. Yi.

739
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:58,710
- My Lady!
- How did it go?

740
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,200
Fangqin went there and checked.

741
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,310
Yu Qi had left to attend to other things.

742
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:06,750
Brilliant!

743
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:08,920
Here comes our chance.

744
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,190
Gather some trustworthy guards

745
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:13,280
to go to the Haitang Chamber

746
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,680
with me!

747
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,320
My Lady,

748
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,800
Fangqin told me

749
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,710
Lady Jiang didn't sleep well last night.

750
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:23,760
She's taking a nap now.

751
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:25,230
No one shall disturb her.

752
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:26,620
The two masters

753
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:27,880
also left.

754
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,490
You two stand guard here.

755
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:31,550
Let no one inside.

756
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,620
If anyone asks, just say a thief broke in.

757
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:34,480
- Yes.
- Yes.

758
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,420
(Peace)

759
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:40,640
- Search it.
- Yes.

760
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:41,500
Ms. Xiao,

761
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:42,660
this is Miss Si's courtyard.

762
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,060
Why break in with so many guards?

763
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:47,360
Since when do I need your permission

764
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:48,760
for anything I do?

765
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:50,840
You see, Miss Aman,

766
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:51,950
I lost

767
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,030
a gold-clad bracelet.

768
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,670
I've searched everywhere for it

769
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,320
except for this chamber.

770
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,190
So here I am to take a look.

771
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,160
Alright?

772
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:01,550
Go.

773
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,400
What's all the fuss about?

774
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,670
Aunt Xiao, Si is sick.

775
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,880
It's rude to barge in

776
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,720
with so many people.

777
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:10,380
Once she wakes up and becomes well,

778
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,190
I'll look for that bracelet with you.

779
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,510
Here's the thing.

780
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,920
That bracelet

781
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:19,670
is a family heirloom.

782
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,800
When I got married, I got it from my mother.

783
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,540
She got it from her mother

784
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,240
who got it from my great-grandmother.

785
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,000
My great-grandmother got it from her mother.

786
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,030
And just like that,

787
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,480
it's been handed down in our family.

788
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,480
Were it lost in my hands,

789
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,630
how could I live on?

790
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:35,530
This is a huge mansion

791
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:36,430
with so many people.

792
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,320
If some servant

793
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,310
got greedy,

794
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,030
sneaking it out to sell it,

795
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,800
I'd never have it back.

796
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:43,390
Don't worry.

797
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:44,840
I'll tell them to be quiet.

798
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:46,280
They won't disturb Si.

799
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,160
Be quiet.

800
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,320
Go!

801
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,800
Stop!

802
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,240
Don't you dare move!

803
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,510
Stop! What...?

804
00:35:58,630 --> 00:35:59,470
What are you doing?

805
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,960
Are you roughing me up?

806
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:01,990
Aunt Xiao!

807
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,320
What's this?

808
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:05,590
It's to cure Miss Si!

809
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,480
- How clumsy!
- The decoction...!

810
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,440
It's for Miss Si!

811
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,200
Look.

812
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,510
How careless!

813
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,680
Aunt Xiao, you...!

814
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,800
What? It wasn't me but her.

815
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,760
Aunt Xiao,

816
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:36,960
didn't you ruin it on purpose?

817
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,550
No wonder I slept in today.

818
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,630
How dare you drug me!

819
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:47,000
Is there anyone in this house

820
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,800
that you wouldn't dare harm?

821
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,070
Mother, don't believe Jiang Si.

822
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:52,470
That's only her side of the story.

823
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:53,300
Grandmother,

824
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,630
thankfully, Prince Yan discovered

825
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,470
her scheme in time

826
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,670
and changed knockout powder

827
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:57,670
to Soothing Incense.

828
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:59,510
That wasn't knockout powder

829
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,960
but Soothing Soup for sleep.

830
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,100
Did you think
by putting Grandmother to sleep,

831
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,590
you could ruin the decoction for me

832
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:06,620
without anyone knowing it?

833
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:08,030
First, you drugged me.

834
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,150
Then you ruined the cure for your niece.

835
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:12,040
With the evidence and witnesses here,

836
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,070
what else do you have to say?

837
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:15,470
Mother,

838
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:16,510
Jiang Si is fine.

839
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:17,350
Look at her.

840
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,710
What cure?

841
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:20,510
She wasn't sick at all.

842
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,840
Yes, Mother.

843
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,440
As you can see,

844
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,710
Si is perfectly healthy.

845
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:26,800
Nothing bad happened to her.

846
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:29,760
Your aunt did that by accident.

847
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,600
Uncle,

848
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,760
she barged in and ruined the cure

849
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,860
in the name of looking for her bracelet,

850
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,480
which almost killed Si.

851
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,400
Do you call that an accident?

852
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,840
Fangqin,

853
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,510
did you bring me knockout powder or soup?

854
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,800
Trust me, My Lady!

855
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,070
I wouldn't dare

856
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:46,480
drug you!

857
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,000
Who sent you?

858
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,840
-Say it!
- Speak!

859
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:52,030
It was...

860
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,720
It was...

861
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:58,360
Drug her?

862
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,510
I'd rather die, Aunt.

863
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:01,360
I wouldn't dare.

864
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:02,440
If you don't do it,

865
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,360
my being punished is one thing.

866
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,320
There will be no room for us

867
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,320
in this household.

868
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,280
But...

869
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,000
Ms. Xiao is in charge.

870
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:12,510
Think about your future.

871
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,480
But if anyone finds out...

872
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:17,110
So what?

873
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,070
By the time Lady Jiang wakes up,

874
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:21,450
things in Miss Si's chamber
have been dealt with.

875
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,150
Who else will know

876
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,760
or dare to say a word?

877
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,480
Anyway, whether you do it or not

878
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,150
is up to you.

879
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,590
Why look at me?

880
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,000
Mother, she's evil.

881
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,840
She's no better!

882
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:41,030
She knew Fangqin would drug you

883
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:42,440
but turned the trick to her own use.

884
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,330
And she feigned illness

885
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:44,550
to fool all of us!

886
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:46,100
"Turned the trick to her own use"?

887
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:47,590
Aunt Xiao, did you admit

888
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:48,520
that you played a trick?

889
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,960
Servants, drag both of them out.

890
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,360
Flog them 20 times each!

891
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,190
- No, My Lady!
- My Lady!

892
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,150
- My Lady!
- My Lady!

893
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,440
How dare you!

894
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,280
Mother...

895
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:07,400
Si, that was too audacious of you,

896
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:09,400
risking your life to set a trap.

897
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,760
You turned this entire house

898
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:13,150
upside down!

899
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,880
Put others aside. Your father was

900
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:18,000
worried day and night.

901
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:19,840
I was inconsiderate,

902
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,630
making you and him concerned.

903
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:23,510
After Prince Yan helped me wake up,

904
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:25,590
I realized that I had been poisoned,

905
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,190
so I pretended that I was still sick.

906
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,360
Poisoned?

907
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,510
You weren't sick

908
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,840
but poisoned?

909
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:35,840
That's right.

910
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:37,320
The poisoner was

911
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:38,440
Aunt Xiao!

912
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,670
How did my wife die?

913
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:54,000
Her symptoms were identical

914
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,030
to Si's.

915
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,710
If you poisoned Si,

916
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,150
had you done

917
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:00,030
the same to her mother?

918
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:01,070
What?

919
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,200
Father,

920
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,230
what do you mean?

921
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,840
Is what my brother said true?

922
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:08,470
I don't know.

923
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:10,550
I don't know!

924
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:13,020
I don't know what you're talking about.

925
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:14,920
I don't know how Su Ke died.

926
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:17,670
I swear, Mother. I don't know!

927
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,630
It was you

928
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,030
who poisoned my mother!

929
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,800
Did you poison her?

930
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,280
Tell the truth!

931
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:31,000
Why yell at me?

932
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:33,030
Su Ke's death was her fate.

933
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:33,920
She died

934
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,800
a long time ago.

935
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:39,070
Now, all of you are pinning her death on me?

936
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,320
You think I poisoned her?

937
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:42,590
Fine. Show me the evidence!

938
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,120
Father!

939
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:45,710
The night before I fell ill,

940
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:46,920
you had your maid

941
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,150
splash water all over me.

942
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:50,030
Then you had them bring me bath water.

943
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,590
Later, you brought me a bowl

944
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,030
of ginger soup without poison.

945
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:54,670
I have reason to believe

946
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,280
you put

947
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:58,840
the poison in the bath water!

948
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,880
Si,

949
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:07,440
as convincing as that sounds,

950
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,230
I'll say it again.

951
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:12,150
Whether it was before or now

952
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,710
that I used poison like you said,

953
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,880
show me the evidence.

954
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:18,920
Do you know this kind of flower

955
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,190
with crimson petals

956
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,880
and yellow pollen?

957
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:26,070
Dissolver it in water

958
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,280
and it'll greatly

959
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,590
nourish the skin.

960
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:32,230
- Never heard of it.
- Never?

961
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:34,000
Didn't you dissolve it

962
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
in the bath water

963
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,280
for me?

964
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:40,880
It's so nourishing.

965
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:43,880
I made a bowl of it

966
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:46,280
for you to try it!

967
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:48,390
Darling!

968
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:49,880
Why are you so terrified?

969
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:50,920
It's just clear water

970
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,190
with a few petals.

971
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:54,920
Unless you knew

972
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:58,590
such flowers were highly toxic!

973
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:04,030
Who knows she can be

974
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:05,880
so evil and vicious?

975
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,070
Had I pushed her even the slightest further,

976
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:10,440
I would've ended up even worse than Su Ke.

977
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:14,510
Mother,

978
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:17,070
we'd better leave. Let's go back.

979
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:18,800
Come on.

980
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:21,990
Mother!

981
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:23,920
Mother!

982
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,920
I've devoted my life to this clan.

983
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:32,360
Now, the First Branch is setting me up!

984
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,320
Grandmother,

985
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,440
this matter concerns my mother's death.

986
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:37,000
If no one here will uphold justice,

987
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:38,510
I'll report it to the government

988
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,880
to find the evidence

989
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,280
and get to the bottom of it!

990
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:42,870
- You can't!
- Get up!

991
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,360
At this point,

992
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,030
you still won't tell the truth?

993
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,510
Be honest with us,

994
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:49,230
or would you rather go to court?

995
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,840
You slapped me.

996
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,760
I did, so what?

997
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,360
Hadn't it been for you,

998
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:00,630
how could I've taken one wrong step

999
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:02,030
after another?

1000
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,440
Did you really poison them both?

1001
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,230
Ke had done nothing bad to you.

1002
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,960
Why did you kill her so brutally?

1003
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:15,820
