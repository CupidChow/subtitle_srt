11
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,400
Qin,

12
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,280
where are you going?

13
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,360
After Rong's death,

14
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,120
I have no place to return to.

15
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:54,790
I think

16
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,640
I should find a temple

17
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,640
and stay with the Buddha.

18
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,680
Before I go,

19
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:00,910
I want to say goodbye to you.

20
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,070
Take care.

21
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,200
Miss Jiang.

22
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,080
The night is cold.

23
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,600
Be careful not to catch a cold.

24
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,710
Zhen,

25
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,510
thanks to you coming in time,

26
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,440
or Magistrate Jia would've certainly

27
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,400
swept this case

28
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,270
under the rug.

29
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,390
Why the worried face then?

30
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,920
Because I've heard

31
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,520
that many women

32
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,760
who've been to Shan'an Clinic

33
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,960
are now being forced

34
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,360
by their in-laws to commit suicide.

35
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,600
So, I'm wondering

36
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,160
if I've done the wrong thing.

37
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,960
No, you haven't.

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,840
You're feeling guilty

39
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,040
for doing the right thing.

40
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,000
Chief, since you want

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,910
to win Miss Si's favor,

42
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,920
why invite Mr. Zhen here?

43
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,160
Now, look.

44
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,110
You've been helping her all the way,

45
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:51,190
but it's Mr. Zhen

46
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,830
who is receiving credit for it.

47
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,190
This is knowing her intentions

48
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,320
and fulfilling her wishes.

49
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,230
I've helped her after all.

50
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,390
The rest doesn't matter.

51
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,000
If that's the case,

52
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,480
why did you send me out

53
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,690
on a long journey so late

54
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,030
just to buy these cherry preserves

55
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,560
for Miss Jiang?

56
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,400
This...

57
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,400
Don't overthink.

58
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,640
It's not your fault.

59
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,920
You're very brave.

60
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,430
Excuse me.

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,400
Mr. Zhen, you must be tired

62
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,490
after such a long journey.

63
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,110
Would you like to try this?

64
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,590
I don't like sweets.

65
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,430
I see.

66
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,470
Miss Jiang,

67
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,790
try some cherry preserves.

68
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,990
You're good at cheering people up.

69
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,410
As soon as you arrived,

70
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,760
Miss Jiang was immediately happy.

71
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:47,710
Yes, yes.

72
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,620
How is it? Is it sweet?

73
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,960
Yes.

74
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,040
How does Mr. Yu know

75
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,360
I like cherry preserves?

76
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,670
I guess that you'd like them.

77
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:59,600
I had a long journey
to buy them for you.

78
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,430
Thank you.

79
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,270
Another one?

80
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,790
Mr. Yu, maybe I should try...

81
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,150
Mr. Zhen,

82
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,270
I almost forgot to tell you this.

83
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,030
You should hurry back and pack.

84
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,750
You'll leave
for Capital Security tomorrow.

85
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,070
Jiang has entrusted me

86
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,800
to escort Miss Jiang.

87
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,040
So soon?

88
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,030
You have official duties.

89
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,270
Miss Jiang, have another one?

90
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,270
Let Mr. Zhen have one.

91
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,950
He said he doesn't like sweets.

92
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,470
Mr. Yu,

93
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,270
we're approaching Cloud Peak.

94
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,920
The Cloud Temple on top of the peak

95
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,080
has always been popular.

96
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,780
People in Lingshui love
to come here to make wishes.

97
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,960
Really?

98
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,070
My sister comes here every year
to make a wish

99
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,910
and give thanks.

100
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,390
She's probably here today too.

101
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,520
Let's go and see.

102
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:20,780
(Cloud Temple, Lingshui)

103
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:12,180
(Mrs. Zhu)

104
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,320
We're just here to offer incense,

105
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,800
but she kowtows

106
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,950
and recites scriptures.

107
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,470
If outsiders see her,

108
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,000
they'll surely gossip about me.

109
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,640
Mother,

110
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,190
Yi's been fasting for three days

111
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,560
for this prayer.

112
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,610
The reason why she's sincere

113
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,480
is to give our family

114
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,390
a grandson.

115
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,470
What's the use of it?

116
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,120
We've tried many ways over the years.

117
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,920
She's drunk incense ashes,

118
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,830
and we've used realgar,

119
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,510
but still, nothing.

120
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,080
Mother.

121
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:49,240
Enough. You're the only one
protecting her.

122
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,660
If she had only given someone else

123
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,240
a daughter after seven years,

124
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,880
she'd have been sent home by now.

125
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,470
I'm Jiang Yi, a devout woman.

126
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,640
The son-bearing immortal,

127
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,910
please let me have a boy

128
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,800
to continue the family line.

129
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,510
I'm willing to live a life
of cultivation,

130
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,680
abstaining from meat and alcohol,

131
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,440
eliminating greed,
and rejecting pleasure.

132
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,950
Ziyu, come back here.

133
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,560
Yi.

134
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,400
Yi.

135
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,150
Yi.

136
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,120
Mother, Yi fainted.

137
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,470
We must send her to the clinic.

138
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,950
What should we do now?

139
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,110
The clinic is far from here.

140
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:50,070
What happened to my sister?

141
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,920
Who is this wild girl?

142
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,200
She's Jiang Yi's sister, Jiang Si.

143
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,670
What happened to my sister?

144
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,040
She fainted from the heat.

145
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,920
Yi.

146
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,960
Yi.

147
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,080
What happened?

148
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,920
Yi...

149
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,320
- Yi, are you okay?
- Si.

150
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,320
Why are you here?

151
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,630
Honey, put me down.

152
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,200
- Let's send Yi to the clinic.
- Sure.

153
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,040
Si,

154
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,320
I'm fine.

155
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,320
Yi, are you okay?

156
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,560
I'm fine.

157
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,960
Mother,

158
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:26,950
sorry

159
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,520
for worrying you.

160
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,550
Seeing you look sickly like this

161
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,470
makes me uneasy.

162
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,870
Go take another carriage.

163
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,450
Don't keep wandering in front of me.

164
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,400
As you wish, Mother.

165
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,990
Yi, sorry for the trouble.

166
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,500
I'll sit in the carriage with you.

167
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,590
Ziyu,

168
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,230
get on my carriage.

169
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,280
We need to talk.

170
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,110
Mother, I want to ride with Yi.

171
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,590
She has her sister with her.

172
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,200
Do you need to worry about her?

173
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:54,990
Let's return home.

174
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,920
Ziyu, hurry up.

175
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:00,470
I'm fine.

176
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,750
You go with Mother.

177
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,150
I have my sister with me.

178
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:03,990
It's fine.

179
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,080
Thank you, Si.

180
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,080
Yi, how are you?

181
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:13,350
Let me take a look.

182
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:20,870
It must hurt a lot.

183
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,400
Does it hurt, Yi?

184
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,440
It's nothing.

185
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,690
Yi, with your current condition,

186
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,400
I can't feel at ease.

187
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,350
Don't worry.

188
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,270
You saw it earlier.

189
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,870
Your brother-in-law treats me very well.

190
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,000
If he truly cared about you,

191
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,470
why would he let you...

192
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,320
By the way, where is Zhan?

193
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,670
Aren't you supposed
to worship the ancestors together?

194
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,110
We were traveling together,

195
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,110
but then we were delayed.

196
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,420
He had to report
to the Imperial Insignia Guard,

197
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,930
so he's headed back to Ling'an.

198
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,160
I was so worried

199
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,380
when I heard he was in trouble.

200
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,200
Only when I got your letter,

201
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,350
saying he was safe,

202
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,710
could I feel relieved.

203
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,910
However, after all this,

204
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,040
it's a blessing

205
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,630
that he can start anew.

206
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,640
What's wrong with the carriage?

207
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,510
What happened?

208
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:05,360
Yi, hold on tight.

209
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,200
OK.

210
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,080
Miss! Hurry and catch up.

211
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,040
What's that sound?

212
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,110
Turn around and catch up.

213
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:19,990
Coachman.

214
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:28,920
- Be careful.
- Be careful, Si.

215
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:37,160
- Help.
- Help.

216
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:50,510
Coachman...

217
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:43,420
(Xie Yinlou, Captain of Lingshui)

218
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,920
Are you alright?

219
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,440
- I'm fine.
- Are you injured?

220
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,950
- I'm fine.
- Here, Yi.

221
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,200
Are you okay, Yi?

222
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,040
I'm fine.

223
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,350
Thank you, sir.

224
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,680
My pleasure.

225
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,280
Miss!

226
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,280
Chief!

227
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:15,990
It's alright.

228
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:16,870
Miss, are you alright?

229
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,840
I'm fine.

230
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,960
I'm fine.

231
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,110
Yinlou, it's you.

232
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,680
Miss Jiang Si,

233
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,120
what brings you to Lingshui?

234
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,520
I came to visit my sister.

235
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,630
It's been so many years
since we last met.

236
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:32,990
How come you're here?

237
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,260
Miss, you may not know this.

238
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,600
I've been a Captain in Lingshui

239
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,520
for several years now.

240
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,110
Thank you, Yinlou,

241
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,200
for saving us earlier.

242
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,470
My pleasure.

243
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,040
Yi, this is Yinlou.

244
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:46,360
He lived with us at home
when we were young.

245
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,200
Remember?

246
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,040
Thank you for saving us, Captain.

247
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,830
Thank you, Mr. Xie, Mr. Yu.

248
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:57,990
If it weren't for you two,

249
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,520
Yi and Si would've been

250
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:01,990
in danger.

251
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,520
Mr. Zhu, it's nothing.

252
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,990
Captain Xie, you're remarkable.

253
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,350
I admire you.

254
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,390
You flatter me.

255
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,230
It was you who turned the tide.

256
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,080
You're both skilled and brave.

257
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,850
You risked your life to protect them.

258
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,960
I admire you.

259
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,040
Let's stop flattering each other.

260
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,880
It's not easy for either of us.

261
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,150
Ziyu, since she's fine,

262
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,590
let's hurry back home.

263
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,590
Thank you, Mr. Xie.

264
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,870
I will remember your kindness

265
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,400
and will visit you for this another day.

266
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:38,470
Goodbye.

267
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,350
Yi, you should go back with Ziyu.

268
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:45,200
I'll stay with Aman and Mr. Yu.

269
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,830
Sure, see you later.

270
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,920
Ziyu, take care of my sister.

271
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,470
Don't worry.

272
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,460
I feel that the horse being startled

273
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,830
is definitely not an accident.

274
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,770
How could a horse
suddenly get scared?

275
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,520
I believe someone

276
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:16,750
tried to harm my sister.

277
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:17,750
Harm her?

278
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,230
- Yes.
- Who do you think it is?

279
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,350
I think it's Mrs. Zhu.

280
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,670
She insisted

281
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,280
that my sister take this carriage today.

282
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,830
My sister used to write to me

283
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,030
and tell me how well she was doing

284
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,160
with the Zhu family.

285
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,320
But I've seen it with my eyes.

286
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:35,120
Now, I know that Mrs. Zhu
has been bullying her like that.

287
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:37,160
I feel so bad about it.

288
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,040
Whoever it is,

289
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,430
I'll stay and help you investigate
before leaving.

290
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,470
Alright.

291
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:49,500
(Jiang)

292
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,230
Young Master, the time is almost up.

293
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,990
Zhan, still practicing?

294
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:04,750
Come here.

295
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,430
Come here now.

296
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,590
You've worked so hard.

297
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:14,960
It makes me feel bad for you.

298
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,000
Sit down.

299
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,080
Look what I've brought for you.

300
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,840
Sit and rest.

301
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,040
Have some tea.

302
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:28,670
Have some tea to soothe your throat.

303
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:29,870
Thank you, Aunt Xiao.

304
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,670
Don't stand on ceremony.

305
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,320
We're family, no need for formalities.

306
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,670
You've changed.

307
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,560
You've really changed.

308
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,250
Since you joined
the Imperial Insignia Guard,

309
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,720
you've changed completely.

310
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,060
You're doing so well now.

311
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,240
That's great.

312
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,270
You're going

313
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,680
to work in the court,

314
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,720
and you and your uncle

315
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,560
will be able to support each other.

316
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:03,870
Aunt Xiao,

317
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,030
Uncle Anmou is

318
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,430
an official of the court.

319
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,190
I'm just a minor guard.

320
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,350
I can't support him.

321
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,880
Good heavens.

322
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,960
What are you saying?

323
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:15,190
What a minor guard?

324
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,480
You are currently serving

325
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,080
by the Emperor's side.

326
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:21,040
If you serve the Emperor well,

327
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,190
you could even become a personal guard.

328
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,280
You know even more than I do.

329
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:33,000
Zhan, I'm genuinely happy
that you've become

330
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,560
an Imperial Insignia Guard.

331
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:36,630
Clearly.

332
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,000
Sometimes there will

333
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,760
inevitably be competition

334
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,110
between our two branches,

335
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,080
but outside of the family,

336
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,320
we are all of the same root,

337
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:48,920
sharing both honor and disgrace.

338
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:51,150
We're all the Jiangs.

339
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,110
Yes,

340
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,280
and no.

341
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,870
How can it not be?

342
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,320
A family

343
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,630
should share both honor and disgrace,

344
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,800
not kick someone when they're down.

345
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:14,960
Now that you're a Guard,

346
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,190
you're talking differently.

347
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,150
I didn't ask you to do it

348
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:23,630
only for your uncle's sake.

349
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,860
It's also for your future.

350
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,760
You're too young to know this.

351
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,480
For an official in the court,

352
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:31,830
it's almost impossible

353
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,870
to get anywhere without any backing.

354
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,350
You're right.

355
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:37,720
But look.

356
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,150
For an Imperial Insignia Guard,

357
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,000
I think I need to rely on myself,

358
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,150
not anyone else,

359
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,830
so I won't become someone else's pawn.

360
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,390
Zhan, if you don't know
what's good for you,

361
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,240
you'll end up falling into trouble.

362
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:58,910
You're absolutely right.

363
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,280
I need to practice,

364
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,040
or I'll easily fall into trouble.

365
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:02,950
Let's go practice.

366
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,590
I don't believe

367
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,040
you'll always be lucky.

368
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,720
What did you say?

369
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,430
I said you're practicing well.

370
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,720
Then I'll practice harder.

371
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,670
You're so strong.

381
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,530
Does he know everything about you?

382
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:16,950
Yes.

389
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,800
Ma'am, we found the horse.

390
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,870
This useless beast

391
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:48,910
almost caused a disaster.

392
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,590
Go have it slaughtered.

393
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,110
- Yes.
- Mother.

394
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,910
It's a life.

395
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,550
We just worshiped the God of Trees.

396
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,630
We can't kill it now.

397
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:59,150
I told you to go, didn't I?

398
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:00,350
Yes.

399
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:04,670
Wait a moment.

400
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,810
This hasn't been clarified yet.

401
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,720
Why in such a hurry to kill the horse?

402
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,080
What's there to clarify?

403
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,000
Isn't it obvious

404
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,320
that this beast suddenly went mad?

405
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,400
It makes me furious by looking at it.

406
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,330
It won't be needed anymore,

407
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,220
so why not kill it?

408
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,800
If I remember correctly,

409
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,440
the carriage I rode in with my sister

410
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,230
was rented by you, right?

411
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,960
How could I have known

412
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,260
that this beast

413
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:32,590
couldn't even handle

414
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,430
such a small task?

415
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:34,480
Was it unexpected,

416
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,020
or are you in a hurry
to destroy the evidence?

417
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,760
Me?

418
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:41,630
What do you mean by that?

419
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,280
Go ahead and tell me.

420
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,750
What crime have I committed?

421
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,480
You wanted to kill your daughter-in-law
in this accident.

422
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,110
You...

423
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:51,870
Mother.

424
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,000
Yi.

425
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,830
I paid money to rent the carriage,

426
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,670
and now it has become my crime.

427
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,210
Don't be angry, Mother.

428
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,390
Captain Xie must've seen
many dangers in the army,

429
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,000
so he's suspicious of this.

430
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,080
Yes, Mother.

431
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,670
Yi would never think like that.

432
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,560
Miss Si,

433
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,280
what do you mean by this?

434
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:25,390
Yi,

435
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,960
do you think I would harm you?

436
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:33,630
Fine.

437
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,560
I really didn't expect

438
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,440
that in your eyes,

439
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:39,800
I'm so cruel.

440
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,630
Yi, don't worry.

441
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:50,630
Mother.

442
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,190
Miss Jiang,

443
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:54,930
I'm going with Mr. Yu and Long Dan

444
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,310
to investigate the coachman.

445
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:57,430
Thank you, Captain.

446
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,110
How unlucky.

447
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,000
I lost the carriage

448
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,390
and got into trouble.

449
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,480
The coachman came three days ago.

450
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,080
His accent shows he's not local.

451
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,350
He said he fled here from the west.

452
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,640
His family's all dead.

453
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,590
I felt sorry for him,

454
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:16,720
so I kept him.

455
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,130
The Zhu family is distinguished.

456
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,350
Why use a newcomer?

457
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,480
It was a coincidence.

458
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:23,430
This morning, everyone had a stomachache

459
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,720
because of some food,

460
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,390
and only he came late, so...

461
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,480
Could it all be part of the plan?

462
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:33,950
Captain Xie,

463
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:35,310
we're from the same hometown.

464
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,390
You know me well.

465
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:38,190
I'm just a simple businessman.

466
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,040
Captain Xie.

467
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,480
Yi,

468
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,340
why still copy scriptures for Mrs. Zhu

469
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,280
after she treated you badly?

470
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,590
I defied her today.

471
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,190
I should apologize

472
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,320
and give her a way out.

473
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,240
But...

474
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,040
Don't you suspect her?

475
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,450
My mother-in-law
isn't satisfied with me,

476
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,660
but she wouldn't go so far.

477
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,510
This incident concerns your life.

478
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:15,670
It can't be taken lightly.

479
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,520
If it weren't for Mr. Xie and Mr. Yu,

480
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,720
it would've been terrible.

481
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,760
But nothing happened to me.

482
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,920
It was probably just an accident.

483
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,960
Think about it.

484
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,030
The horse was startled,

485
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:27,440
and the coachman jumped off at once.

486
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:28,790
It must be premeditated.

487
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,890
The coachman is just a stranger.

488
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,880
Why would he harm me for no reason?

489
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,720
Yi, stop trying to deceive yourself.

490
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:38,280
Mrs. Zhu rented this carriage for you.

491
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:39,480
When Ziyu wanted to get on,

492
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,380
she stopped him.

493
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:42,030
And she was eager to kill the horse now.

494
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:42,910
Alright, Si.

495
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,910
I know you're worried about me,

496
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,590
but we can't guess wildly
without evidence.

497
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,590
I don't want to hurt

498
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,320
my family's feelings over this.

499
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:59,000
I found you really changed

500
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:01,960
during this visit.

501
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,280
In the past,

502
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,190
you were always cautious,

503
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,630
but now...

504
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,560
I'm afraid your assertive actions

505
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,690
will lead you to trouble.

506
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,240
How could I suffer?

507
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:15,030
When we were at home,

508
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,240
we endured everything,

509
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:18,350
but how did the second branch treat us?

510
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,830
Now I've realized

511
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:21,590
that we have to stand up for ourselves,

512
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:23,040
or we'll always be bullied.

513
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,160
It's good that you think this way,

514
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:28,870
so I don't have to worry

515
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,580
about whether you're doing well at home

516
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,070
and whether someone is bullying you.

517
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,390
You've really grown up.

518
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,760
Yi, don't worry about me.

519
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,480
You should think carefully

520
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,000
about what happened today.

521
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,080
Let me see your hand.

522
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:05,930
Don't copy scriptures anymore.

523
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,040
I'm fine.

524
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,170
Chief, after Mr. Chu left

525
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:16,310
the Directorate of Astronomy,

526
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,320
he came to Lingshui.

527
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,830
Mr. Chu is at the tavern ahead.

528
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,040
What about Mr. Xiao?

529
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:20,950
He went mad.

530
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,080
- Mad?
- Yes.

531
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,500
I heard that after his resignation,

532
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,040
he went mad.

533
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:26,510
It's said it's because of the death
of his wife.

534
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,530
It's been several years.

535
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:30,310
Alright, we'll go meet

536
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,320
with Mr. Chu.

537
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,640
Chief,

538
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,920
the one sleeping on the table

539
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,760
is Mr. Chu.

540
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:04,350
What's going on?

541
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,480
Give it back to me.

542
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:07,590
What happened

543
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,280
to the Top Scholar?

544
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:14,560
There's a great world in the drinks.

545
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,350
You used to do well

546
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:17,820
in the Directorate of Astronomy.

547
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,400
Why did you voluntarily transfer

548
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,480
to this small place?

549
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:23,150
My mother was seriously ill back then,

550
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,350
so I returned home to take care of her.

551
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:28,550
What does that have to do with you?

552
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:30,060
Let's talk about something pertinent.

553
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:34,000
The 5th day of the 5th month,
3rd year of Jingming.

554
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,390
You...

555
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,760
Who are you?

556
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,580
I don't know anything.

557
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,800
Don't ask me.

558
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,720
Don't ask me.

559
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,210
Was the unlucky fate of the 7th Prince

560
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,240
suggested by you?

561
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,400
The 7th Prince?

562
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,590
Didn't you say

563
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:51,430
it's over

564
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,590
and you won't pressure me?

565
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:54,310
Since we're here today,

566
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:55,440
you have to speak,

567
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,610
whether you want to or not.

568
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:57,880
I only submitted the petition.

569
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,460
I have nothing to do with anything else.

570
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,790
Are you trying to kill me?

571
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,880
What else do you want?

572
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,720
I don't know.

573
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,880
Stop asking me.

574
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,790
Don't ask me.

575
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:05,630
Stop.

576
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:07,150
I don't know.

577
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,760
Chief.

578
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,670
Forget it.

579
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,430
This is enough.

580
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:18,900
(Zhu Mansion)

581
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,150
You're about to leave, right?

582
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:23,390
Yi and I are going to pay respects
to our ancestors.

583
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,190
So, I'm driving the carriage.

584
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,280
How could I let you drive the carriage?

585
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:28,390
It's okay.

586
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,390
I'm idle anyway.

587
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,390
Thank you, Commandant Yu.

588
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:39,670
Si.

589
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,240
Yi.

590
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,840
Honey.

591
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,610
Don't you have a poetry gathering

592
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,670
with Mr. Wang?

593
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,680
After thinking it over,

594
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,720
I still couldn't relax.

595
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,400
You just escaped danger.

596
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,110
How could I go to a poetry gathering?

597
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:05,560
Today, I'm driving the carriage.

598
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,080
Thank you, honey.

599
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,430
What about me?

600
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,920
You can ride and follow us.

601
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:49,870
Si,

602
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:51,760
Commandant Yu and you...

603
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,670
What do you want to say?

604
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,850
He's looking out for you every day

605
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:00,150
and caring for you in every way.

606
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,800
Does he have feelings for you?

607
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,870
No, Yi.

608
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:09,390
He's just worried and afraid

609
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,080
that something might happen again.

610
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,670
From yesterday's incident,

611
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,240
it's clear he's a good man.

612
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,870
If you two have mutual feelings,

613
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:18,560
you should still obey the parents.

614
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,520
Let me tell you.

615
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,820
When it comes to relationships,

616
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:24,380
you must keep your boundaries in mind.

617
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,190
- Help.
- Stop.

618
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:43,070
Help. Help.

619
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:43,910
You filthy woman.

620
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:46,240
- Stop.
- Help.

621
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:47,630
Stop.

622
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,240
- Help.
- Stop, you filthy woman.

623
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,290
We just helped you
bury your dead father,

624
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:54,690
and now you turn your back on us?

625
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:55,920
Please, let me go.

626
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,760
Filthy girl.

627
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,490
You sold yourself to bury your father.

628
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,640
The three of us

629
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,790
bought you.

630
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:01,910
You're ours now.

631
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,240
You have to take turns

632
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,080
being our wife.

633
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,620
- Get her.
- Don't come near me.

634
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:06,610
- Come with me.
- Help.

635
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,480
Long Dan.

636
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:08,910
Let go of me.

637
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,000
Get up.

638
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:16,900
(Qing)

639
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:24,670
Miss, you look like a kind lady.

640
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:26,160
Please save me.

641
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,240
I'm willing to do anything

642
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,240
for you.

643
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,760
We paid ten taels of silver for her.

644
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,110
Her deed is still with us.

645
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:34,430
You're abducting a common girl.

646
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,960
No, Miss.

647
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,670
I'd rather die than stay with them.

648
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,960
Please, be kind and help me.

649
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,080
It's up to you.

650
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,870
In that case...

651
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:50,630
- You...
- Wait.

652
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,240
Miss,

653
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,270
did you promise to sell yourself

654
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:55,350
to bury your father?

655
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,110
Have these three men

656
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:58,830
helped you

657
00:32:58,830 --> 00:32:59,910
bury your father?

658
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,190
I did promise that,

659
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:05,670
but I can't serve three husbands.

660
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:07,390
They're just hooligans.

661
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,480
Miss, please, save me.

662
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,150
Please, I beg you.

663
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,280
Aman.

664
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,040
Here are 20 taels of silver.

665
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,270
Give me back the deed

666
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:24,110
of this young lady.

667
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:25,950
This...

668
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,110
What?

669
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,870
Isn't 20 enough?

670
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,240
Do you want it?
Give me a straight answer.

671
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,720
Stop hinting at each other.

672
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:47,240
Let's go.

673
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,380
(Xu Qing'er who sold herself)

674
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,350
Miss, here's your deed.

675
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,190
Take it

676
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,320
and leave.

677
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,190
Yi.

678
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,800
Miss,

679
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,630
I can't repay your great kindness.

680
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:06,240
I'm willing to do anything

681
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,080
for you.

682
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,000
If you don't want me,

683
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,920
I'll have nowhere to go.

684
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,190
If those hooligans

685
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,880
come back to harass me...

686
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,430
Miss, we've bought

687
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:16,840
your deed back for you.

688
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,590
If you have nowhere to go,

689
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,630
- should we...
- Si, forget it.

690
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,190
She's just scared.

691
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,150
Miss, please take me in.

692
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:25,670
I can do anything.

693
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,840
I just need a place

694
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,750
to stay

695
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:29,480
and some food.

696
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:32,110
Miss, I'll leave my deed with you.

697
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,680
How about this?

698
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,710
Come to Zhu Mansion tomorrow to see me.

699
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,440
- Thank you, Miss.
- Yi.

700
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,320
Thank you, Miss.

701
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,430
Go investigate these people.

702
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,600
Yes.

703
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,280
Yi, she doesn't have a clear background.

704
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,560
She's just a pitiful girl.

705
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,620
It's just an extra pair of chopsticks.

706
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,440
This is fine.

707
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:02,670
You're kind and gullible.

708
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,430
You won't feel bad this way.

709
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,070
Si,

710
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:21,960
are you still angry with me

711
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,590
for taking in that girl?

712
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:25,290
Yi,

713
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,400
something's definitely wrong

714
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,340
with Qing's background.

715
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:28,800
What's the problem?

716
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,670
We haven't figured out
who the coachman is,

717
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,270
and Qing appears now.

718
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,040
There can't be so many coincidences.

719
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:36,190
I was just helping her out,

720
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:37,460
giving her a chance to survive.

721
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:38,840
Since we saved her,

722
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,400
let's be kind to the end.

723
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,400
Yi, how can you be sure

724
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,150
that everything Qing said is true?

725
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,960
But she has no reason

726
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,150
to lie to me, right?

727
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,590
Right now, I have no proof

728
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,040
for many things.

729
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,000
I don't want to upset you for no reason,

730
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:57,310
so I'll hold off for now.

731
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:58,520
But

732
00:35:58,630 --> 00:35:59,520
you must remember

733
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,750
to guard against others.

734
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:03,950
I know.

735
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,760
Don't worry.

736
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,360
(I thought it was Mrs. Zhu)

737
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,370
(who was a threat to Yi.)

738
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,880
(Now, it seems)

739
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,880
(Qing is also a bit suspicious.)

740
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,960
(Yi is kind,)

741
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,750
(so I'll protect her.)

742
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,480
Hurry and pack.

743
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,360
Ma'am is waiting.

744
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:28,390
Sure.

745
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:29,870
We've cleared everything up.

746
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:32,080
Qing did have an old father

747
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:33,870
who passed away seven days ago.

748
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,260
The whole neighborhood knows

749
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:37,220
about her selling herself
to bury her father.

750
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,070
As for the three men who bought her,

751
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:40,780
they're notorious bullies
in the village.

752
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,080
Since that day,

753
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,590
they've disappeared.

754
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,080
But the neighbors said

755
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,840
they often leave home

756
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,980
for a dozen days at a time.

757
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:05,230
Don't you think

758
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:07,110
those two...

759
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,230
With your sister's temperament,

760
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,960
she'll grant her wish

761
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,710
and bring her into the family.

762
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,150
This seems

763
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,520
a bit unnecessary.

764
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:28,880
I fear she won't be content

765
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,110
with being a concubine.

766
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,630
She may want more.

767
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:48,390
Yi,

768
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,310
we need to talk.

769
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,590
Please don't overthink.

770
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,750
What's the matter? Tell me.

771
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:58,560
How much longer

772
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:00,360
does your sister plan to stay here?

773
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,690
When will she return to Ling'an?

774
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,920
Do you not want my sister

775
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,840
to stay here?

776
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,190
I've told you not to overthink it.

777
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,880
She's always

778
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,070
with Commandant Yu,

779
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:14,190
which might cause gossip.

780
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,030
Also,

781
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,400
doesn't Captain Xie have feelings

782
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,240
for your sister?

783
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:23,120
The Xie family is prominent in Lingshui.

784
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,880
If they could connect with your family,

785
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:26,480
and form an alliance with my family,

786
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,590
it would be great.

787
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,440
Lingshui is so small.

788
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:30,750
If the gossip spreads

789
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,400
to his family,

790
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:34,270
it could ruin your sister's marriage.

791
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:37,180
Honey, don't joke like that.

792
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,760
The Xie family would never

793
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,080
consider my family.

794
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:42,670
Captain Xie is

795
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:43,770
past the marriageable age,

796
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:44,670
yet he hasn't married.

797
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,670
It's been said

798
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:48,670
that when he stayed at your house,

799
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:50,190
he became fond of one of the girls.

800
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,190
Captain Xie has not married

801
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,270
because he was in mourning

802
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,750
for his parents for three years.

803
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,790
Why does it concern my family's girls?

804
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,440
Outsiders can gossip,

805
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,310
but you can't say that.

806
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:09,190
The elders are strict with the girls,

807
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,670
and they always observe the rules.

808
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,750
Alright, I'm sorry.

809
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,000
I know you value the reputation.

810
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:23,030
I shouldn't have spoken ill
of your sister.

811
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:26,070
Please don't be mad.

812
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,590
How could I be mad at you?

813
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,440
My sister was just anxious

814
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,590
because of the accident,

815
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:37,750
so she asked Mr. Yu to help.

816
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:39,440
Besides,

817
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:41,090
I've been in Lingshui for so long,

818
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:42,730
and it's her first time coming to visit.

819
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,040
How can I send her away?

820
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,920
You're right.

821
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:48,920
It was careless of me.

822
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,280
In a few days,

823
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,230
there will be the Water Festival

824
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:54,150
here in Lingshui.

825
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:56,510
It'll be a perfect chance

826
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:57,440
to show Si around.

827
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:59,050
To prepare for the Water Festival,

828
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,730
you'll have to put in lots of effort

829
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:03,190
as Mother is getting older.

830
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,190
Don't say that.

831
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,000
It's truly my duty.

832
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,580
(Ms. Fei, Leader of Caiyun Troupe)

833
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:40,520
- Good.
- Great.

834
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:44,840
- Great.
- Good.

835
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,840
Their dancing is graceful
and captivating.

836
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,460
Look.

837
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,300
(Yunshui Tower, Lingshui)
the dancer leading

838
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,830
is Ms. Fei, Leader of Caiyun Troupe.

839
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:53,710
This is just a warm-up.

840
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,400
The Water Dance tonight

841
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,790
is what she's famous for.

842
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:59,190
It's said Caiyun Troupe

843
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,070
is hard to book.

844
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:01,000
It's in high demand.

845
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,080
Yi, you're amazing.

846
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:04,620
Yes, it usually needs to be booked

847
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:05,840
at least six months in advance,

848
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,400
and it's not guaranteed.

849
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:08,790
I didn't expect anything,

850
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:10,070
but Ms. Fei

851
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,590
said we clicked

852
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:12,880
and agreed to perform for me.

853
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,440
Yunshui Tower is the best spot to watch.

854
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,110
I've saved you a seat.

855
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,920
You rarely come here,

856
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,030
so you must enjoy the view.

857
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:22,000
Yi, you don't have to do this for me.

858
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,230
You've been so busy

859
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,760
with the Water Festival,

860
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,190
running around non-stop.

861
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:27,630
It must be exhausting.

862
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:28,800
But Si,

863
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,880
I'm so glad you're here,

864
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,880
helping me.

865
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:33,710
Lingshui relies on water for sustenance,

866
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:35,150
and the Water Festival

867
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:36,180
is the biggest event here.

868
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,440
I hope everything goes smoothly tonight.

869
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,200
Mrs. Ziyu,

870
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:44,480
Lady Zhu is calling for you.

871
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,320
She says it's urgent.

872
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,520
OK, I'll go right away.

873
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,400
Yi, I'll go with you.

874
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:49,990
No need.

875
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:51,880
You've stayed by my side these days.

876
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:53,360
I know you're worried about me,

877
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
but look, I'm fine.

878
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,830
Though Mother is hard to get along with,

879
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,000
the Water Festival

880
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,310
is under my control.

881
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,160
She won't make things hard
for me tonight.

882
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,440
Then you take care.

883
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:16,480
- Great.
- Good.

884
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,840
What's wrong?

885
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:20,840
I've noticed that Qing

886
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,630
has been working quietly,

887
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,960
and there's nothing unusual

888
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:25,520
with Zhu Ziyu.

889
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,120
Could it be

890
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:29,000
that I've misjudged her?

891
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,040
I know you're worried about your sister,

892
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,840
but being too tense

893
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,080
will only backfire.

894
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:38,590
Why not just relax tonight?

895
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:39,950
I'm here for you.

896
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:50,750
(Opera)
Phoenix Hairpin?

897
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,230
It'll start

898
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,960
with Phoenix Hairpin tonight?

899
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,480
Are you accusing me

900
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,080
in front of everyone in Lingshui

901
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:59,300
of being the vile mother-in-law
in the play

902
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,040
that is trying
to break up you and my son?
