1
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:12,946
Freeze!

2
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:14,414
Nobody move.

3
00:00:19,453 --> 00:00:20,354
This won't work.

4
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:22,656
Let's go one by one.

5
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:25,926
At least one of us must survive.

6
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:27,794
One person?

7
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:31,498
Rock, paper, scissors.

8
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,642
(Inseparable Us)

9
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:42,910
Yu Jin.

10
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:46,046
I bought some groceries.

11
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:48,949
Hey.

12
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:51,818
This was on sale for 5.99 dollars.

13
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:52,886
Good deal, right?

14
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,254
Look at this.

15
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:56,156
This isn't animal welfare, is it?

16
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:58,458
They keep hens in cages like prisons.

17
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:01,061
And force them to lay eggs
with antibiotics.

18
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:03,497
This is torture, pure torture.

19
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:05,132
I get scolded even when I buy stuff.

20
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:06,500
You've been eating them just fine.

21
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,903
How many times have I told you
to buy eco-friendly detergent?

22
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:12,472
Look, this one has phosphates.

23
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:13,407
Phosphates?

24
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:16,577
This is one of the main causes
of aquatic ecosystem destruction.

25
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:18,779
Enough already.

26
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:21,081
It's people like you, trying to save
a few bucks without thinking,

27
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,684
who keep consuming this stuff,
ruining the environment...

28
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:25,285
You think I don't know what's right?

29
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:28,188
I bought it because it was cheap.

30
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:29,823
Cheap things are never good.

31
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:31,325
Good or not, whatever.

32
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:33,727
You don't pay a dime but run your mouth.

33
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:36,029
Run my mouth?

34
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:38,599
I pursue minimalism

35
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:41,535
and practice environmentalism.

36
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:43,237
Do you?

37
00:01:43,237 --> 00:01:45,205
To pursue minimalism,

38
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:47,808
you take our wet wipes, detergent,

39
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:50,377
toothbrushes, toilet paper,
even toothpicks?

40
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:54,281
What, I used a little. Big deal.

41
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:56,283
Big deal? Really?

42
00:01:57,351 --> 00:01:59,820
This frying pan? That's ours.

43
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,488
That salt and sugar, too.

44
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:02,990
They're ours.

45
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,292
Even that sponge is ours.

46
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:07,828
This is so petty and dirty.

47
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:10,030
Take everything of yours from this home.

48
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,399
Fine. I will.

49
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:13,567
I'll take it all.

50
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:20,807
This is ours. This is ours too.

51
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:22,976
Hey, hurry.

52
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,211
Hey, fire!

53
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:26,280
Hey, Bighead Min Jun,
advance at 3 o'clock!

54
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,782
- Sniper Mang, cover me.
- Hey!

55
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:29,983
Do you guys want some ramen?

56
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,418
- No.
- No.

57
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:32,586
Don't talk to me!

58
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:37,291
Won Hee, they are not eating ramen.

59
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:38,992
No, I'll eat.

60
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:40,494
Me too.

61
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,114
Sister, brother.

62
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:04,484
Is this better? Or this?

63
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,186
Why are you getting so dressed up?

64
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,222
Ba Da, are you going on a date?

65
00:03:08,222 --> 00:03:11,291
Yeah, Hye Kyung from Class Five
and I are official today.

66
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:14,161
Song Ba Da.

67
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:15,462
Wear this one.

68
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:16,830
This one?

69
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:17,965
Okay.

70
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:22,669
Even that kid is in a relationship.

71
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:24,438
What about you two?

72
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:30,244
What happened?

73
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:32,846
What? Is there something on my face?

74
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,449
No, there's nothing on it.

75
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:36,717
By the way, Won Hee.

76
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:38,819
What kind of guys do you like?

77
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:40,387
Me?

78
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:43,123
I...

79
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,767
I...

80
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:58,906
It's my part-time boss.

81
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,175
- Sorry, I need to take this.
- Sure.

82
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:03,343
Hello?

83
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:04,845
Yes, my work shift?

84
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:08,682
Oh, right.

85
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:11,051
Didn't she say she liked guys

86
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:13,820
with thick brows and sad, dreamy eyes?

87
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:17,858
I'll just run to the bathroom.

88
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:20,327
I'll go to my room.

89
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,842
What happened to your eyebrows?

90
00:04:34,842 --> 00:04:35,642
Eyebrows?

91
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:37,511
What's wrong with them?

92
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:39,546
My eyebrows...

93
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:42,449
They've always been like this.

94
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:46,053
They're just...

95
00:04:46,053 --> 00:04:47,187
Just what?

96
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:49,523
Just what about them?

97
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:52,626
How do I say this...

98
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:56,897
They look like caterpillars.

99
00:04:57,698 --> 00:04:58,665
Creepy.

100
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:05,873
What the heck, Seo Yi Na!

101
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:07,407
You said she would like it!

102
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,910
Was I wrong?

103
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,646
Seo Yi Na, you're so annoying.

104
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:15,582
Caterpillar brows were my friend
Eun Soo's type.

105
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,718
Won Hee's type was...

106
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:20,254
What was it again?

107
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:22,089
It...

108
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:26,793
Honey, I'm...

109
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:30,130
What happened here?

110
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:34,935
Was there a break-in or something?

111
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,171
No?

112
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,073
- What?
- Nothing.

113
00:05:40,274 --> 00:05:43,777
Isn't it nice? The living room
looks so much more spacious.

114
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:44,678
I mean...

115
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:51,485
Still, this is too much.

116
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:53,820
What about the chair and the sofa?

117
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,789
Is having more worse than having less?

118
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:59,159
How good is this.

119
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:02,229
Now all of us can lie down
on one couch each.

120
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:06,900
Wait, did Na Ra take the mattress too?

121
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:10,504
How are we supposed to sleep here?

122
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:11,471
My back hurts already.

123
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:13,941
Why?

124
00:06:14,408 --> 00:06:17,044
Sleeping on hard floors
is good for your spine.

125
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:18,679
It feels great.

126
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:20,781
Beds aren't even our tradition.

127
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:22,783
I seriously can't sleep like this.

128
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:27,020
I accidentally fell asleep.

129
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:33,994
Come on, stop messing around.

130
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:40,501
Bravo!

131
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:43,003
But seriously...

132
00:06:43,504 --> 00:06:45,706
What if someone rolls off while sleeping?

133
00:06:45,706 --> 00:06:47,040
You're not going to die.

134
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:55,349
Give me a hand.

135
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:04,091
See? It's hard for you to climb up, too.

136
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:06,026
No, it's not hard at all.

137
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:08,729
It's soft and comfy.

138
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:10,998
Stop, you're making me dizzy.

139
00:07:10,998 --> 00:07:13,166
Hurray!

140
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:20,307
Here.

141
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:23,944
What is this, a standing barbecue?

142
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:26,680
Eating while standing aids digestion.

143
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:29,449
But where are the spoons?

144
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,285
Did she take all the spoons too?

145
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:34,555
Curry is traditionally eaten
with your hands.

146
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:35,722
Look, like this.

147
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:39,259
Authentic Indian style.

148
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:41,061
Here.

149
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:43,030
Wait, why me...

150
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:46,733
Tastes good, right?

151
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:48,235
Eat up.

152
00:07:50,037 --> 00:07:51,138
Hot, it's hot.

153
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:56,877
Come on, just go apologize...

154
00:07:58,512 --> 00:08:00,581
Apple curry is tasty, right?

155
00:08:00,581 --> 00:08:02,850
Let's make apple curry next time.

156
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:10,123
- Tasty?
- Yeah.

157
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:13,827
Honey, sit here.

158
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:15,395
Did you even take the bidet?

159
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:17,965
Butt health matters for
those with hemorrhoids.

160
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,701
I even preheated the seat for you.

161
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:22,236
Sit down.

162
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,408
Stop being annoying.

163
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:30,310
Just give them back.

164
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,478
No way.

165
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:34,281
I won't forgive Yu Jin
until she kneels and begs.

166
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:49,563
My back.

167
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:51,932
My back hurts.

168
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,535
Seriously, my back.

169
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,905
Oh Na Ra, really.

170
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:18,659
I'm thirsty.

171
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:47,154
Wait, did she even take the bidet?

172
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:50,924
Oh Na Ra.

173
00:09:51,158 --> 00:09:53,360
You thought I'd just sit and take it?

174
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,216
Oh Yu Jin.

175
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:17,951
This is definitely Oh Yu Jin.

176
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:19,987
Chully.

177
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:24,057
I told you to just make up peacefully.

178
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:25,259
Be quiet.

179
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:26,426
There's no reconciliation.

180
00:10:26,894 --> 00:10:28,195
It's war from now on.

181
00:10:35,536 --> 00:10:37,771
Hey, isn't this our chair?

182
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:39,039
It is.

183
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,875
What, she brought it all the way here
just to throw it out?

184
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:52,452
Chully, sit.

185
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:53,420
Okay.

186
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:56,089
What are you doing?

187
00:10:56,924 --> 00:10:57,958
What do you think?

188
00:10:58,392 --> 00:11:00,127
It's a chair to wait
for the elevator.

189
00:11:05,632 --> 00:11:07,301
How unmannered.

190
00:11:07,301 --> 00:11:10,737
What are you doing in a shared space?

191
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:12,206
Having no manners is better than

192
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:13,974
having no chairs, no sofa,

193
00:11:14,575 --> 00:11:16,777
and no bidet.

194
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:20,380
What else is missing from that home?

195
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,281
What?

196
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:24,685
Oh, right, they don't even have
premium grade two++ Korean beef.

197
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:25,686
Two++ beef?

198
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:27,688
Hyun Chul, did you order meat?

199
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:32,059
Oh, it's from my cousin in Hoengseong...

200
00:11:32,626 --> 00:11:35,095
The brisket that melts in your mouth,

201
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:38,165
and the chewy, savory skirt meat.

202
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:39,733
Sounds delicious.

203
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:44,137
Red meat is full of saturated fat
and cholesterol.

204
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:47,608
That stuff causes tons of heart disease.

205
00:11:47,608 --> 00:11:48,775
What, heart disease crap?

206
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:51,945
Even a ghost who died eating well
looks good.

207
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:55,249
Let's feast on this premium
grade two++ beef today, Chully.

208
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:56,717
Okay...

209
00:12:02,256 --> 00:12:04,591
Won Hee likes guy who can dance well.

210
00:12:33,187 --> 00:12:34,221
Song Kang...

211
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,089
Is it working?

212
00:12:38,492 --> 00:12:39,359
Hey.

213
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:41,094
Are you...

214
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:45,699
Are you okay?

215
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:47,000
What?

216
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:49,503
I think you stepped in dog poop.

217
00:12:57,911 --> 00:12:58,745
What do I do...

218
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:04,985
Hey, where are you going?

219
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:13,594
What's with him now?

220
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,872
Alright, time for my ultimate move.

221
00:13:33,447 --> 00:13:35,482
Hey, Koo Won Hee, don't I look cool?

222
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:37,918
Hey.

223
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:47,060
Looks good, right?

224
00:13:47,728 --> 00:13:48,729
Let's eat.

225
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,268
Are we really eating with our hands?

226
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:57,137
Careful, it's hot, guys.

227
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:01,341
(We're grilling meat.
Do you want to join?)

228
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:04,945
Yi Na said to come and eat meat.

229
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:08,081
Freeze.

230
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:11,418
What are we, beggars?

231
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:13,487
Going over to their home to eat?

232
00:14:14,121 --> 00:14:16,957
But it's brisket and skirt meat.

233
00:14:16,957 --> 00:14:18,592
I really want some too.

234
00:14:18,792 --> 00:14:20,460
If you all go there now,

235
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,628
you guys are dead.

236
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:24,364
Raise your hands now.

237
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,332
Do it.

238
00:14:29,236 --> 00:14:31,271
You're the one who fought with Na Ra,
so why do we have to suffer?

239
00:14:32,673 --> 00:14:34,308
Don't even get near their home again.

240
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:37,110
No visit, no conversation.

241
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,880
No interaction with them, got it?

242
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,289
So what?
She needs me, not the other way around.

243
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:51,592
That girl, Oh Yu Jin,

244
00:14:51,592 --> 00:14:54,328
treats me like I'm nothing.

245
00:14:54,328 --> 00:14:57,097
Don't talk to Jin Woo either, got it?

246
00:14:57,097 --> 00:14:59,132
You're not kids. This is ridiculous.

247
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:01,268
Yi Na, keep an eye on your dad at work.

248
00:15:01,268 --> 00:15:03,303
Make sure he doesn't talk to Jin Woo.

249
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:04,304
If I report it?

250
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:05,172
Ten dollars per report.

251
00:15:05,172 --> 00:15:05,973
Deal.

252
00:15:11,945 --> 00:15:16,116
Mr. Song, are first quarter
and second quarter reports...

253
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:24,725
Can you ask Mr. Song if he's done, Mr. Go?

254
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,160
Mr. Song?

255
00:15:27,561 --> 00:15:31,198
Tell him I'm almost done, Mr. Go.

256
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:36,170
He says he's almost done, Mr. Seo.

257
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,371
Oh, really?

258
00:15:38,739 --> 00:15:42,176
I thought I'd finally make some money...

259
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:44,444
This is so frustrating.

260
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,423
Do we really have to be like this
at work too?

261
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:57,491
Exactly.

262
00:15:57,491 --> 00:16:00,327
They fought last time
over sweet and sour sauce,

263
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:01,862
and didn't talk for a whole month.

264
00:16:01,862 --> 00:16:03,564
Over something so petty.

265
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:05,632
It's exhausting. Seriously.

266
00:16:05,832 --> 00:16:08,302
Don't you think we need drastic action?

267
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:10,971
Drastic action?

268
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:13,040
Exactly.

269
00:16:14,408 --> 00:16:16,910
What are you even talking about?

270
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:19,079
- What's going on?
- What was that?

271
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:20,781
Did I say anything wrong?

272
00:16:23,517 --> 00:16:27,521
No wonder you're a manager forever.
Your mindset is tiny.

273
00:16:27,521 --> 00:16:30,757
Well, better than being a
lifelong assistant manager.

274
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:32,492
You think I like being stuck here?

275
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:35,929
I've got a clunker blocking the way

276
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:37,264
so I can't move forward

277
00:16:37,264 --> 00:16:38,599
even if I wanted to.

278
00:16:38,866 --> 00:16:41,902
Clunker?
That wasn't in the script, was it?

279
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:45,472
Did you just call me a clunker?

280
00:16:45,706 --> 00:16:47,341
You don't even own a car.

281
00:16:49,376 --> 00:16:50,978
That wasn't in the script either.

282
00:16:51,612 --> 00:16:53,480
You look down on me
for not owning a car?

283
00:16:54,615 --> 00:16:58,352
Acting all high and mighty
over one lousy car.

284
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,788
Jin Woo, watch your mouth.

285
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:03,790
How dare you grab your elder's collar?

286
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:04,791
Let go!

287
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:09,997
Did Jin Woo say anything wrong?

288
00:17:09,997 --> 00:17:13,033
You two always brag about your money.

289
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:14,234
Oh Na Ra is so annoying.

290
00:17:15,636 --> 00:17:17,304
That was harsh, don't you think?

291
00:17:17,504 --> 00:17:18,672
You called her annoying?

292
00:17:18,672 --> 00:17:21,308
She takes such a care of you
than anyone I know.

293
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:23,343
Exactly.

294
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:25,312
So what if she's smart? She's rude.

295
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,348
Excuse me? Rude?

296
00:17:28,348 --> 00:17:29,983
Unlike some people, my honey is so sweet.

297
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:32,219
Where else can you find someone like her?

298
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:33,153
That's what I'm saying.

299
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:34,788
Give me a break.

300
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:37,558
If she were any sweeter,
she'd swallow me as a whole.

301
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:39,826
I wouldn't touch you
even if I were starving.

302
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:53,841
What are you doing?

303
00:17:56,343 --> 00:17:57,811
What? Why?

304
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:01,882
Are you fixing the pants
you ripped while dancing?

305
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:03,984
Seo Yi Na told you, right?

306
00:18:04,218 --> 00:18:05,052
Yeah.

307
00:18:05,686 --> 00:18:08,522
How hard were you dancing to
tear your pants?

308
00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:09,590
And you?

309
00:18:09,823 --> 00:18:12,259
Didn't you step in poop
doing the moonwalk?

310
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:15,562
This home doesn't seem
to keep any secrets.

311
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:20,334
Hey.

312
00:18:20,334 --> 00:18:21,768
Come on.

313
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,370
Knock before you come in.

314
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:24,371
Come out for a movie.

315
00:18:24,371 --> 00:18:25,272
No.

316
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:26,139
No way.

317
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:27,374
Then don't.

318
00:18:27,374 --> 00:18:31,044
Won Hee's a horror movie fan,
so we're watching one together.

319
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,314
Horror movie?

320
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:43,457
Can't watch this.

321
00:18:47,227 --> 00:18:48,595
Why are you opening your eyes like that?

322
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,632
Are you scared?

323
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:55,969
No. Something got in my eye.

324
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:57,304
What a lame excuse.

325
00:18:57,671 --> 00:18:58,605
He's scared.

326
00:18:59,673 --> 00:19:00,541
I'm not scared!

327
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:02,743
Kang, you're not scared?

328
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:05,679
This is too boring to watch.

329
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:09,983
Why are you sweating so much?

330
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:12,419
It's not because you got scared, right?

331
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,221
He's scared, totally.

332
00:19:14,221 --> 00:19:16,557
I'm not. It's just hot in here.

333
00:19:16,557 --> 00:19:18,892
Something really did get in my eye.

334
00:19:18,892 --> 00:19:22,563
Young Hoon and Kang are tough guys.

335
00:19:22,563 --> 00:19:23,897
This wouldn't scare them.

336
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:26,266
Sit down already.

337
00:19:45,586 --> 00:19:48,188
It's so cramped in here.

338
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:52,659
Hey, Song Kang. I know you're not asleep.

339
00:19:52,926 --> 00:19:54,695
Just admit you got scared earlier.

340
00:19:54,962 --> 00:19:55,963
Should I go?

341
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:57,764
I'm really leaving.

342
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:00,334
Don't.

343
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:11,111
But you do want to use the bathroom,
right?

344
00:20:11,812 --> 00:20:12,646
No.

345
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,548
You do, don't you?

346
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:16,116
You do, right? You do.

347
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,784
Stop being annoying.

348
00:20:18,986 --> 00:20:21,622
Then I'll go with you when you go later.

349
00:20:23,457 --> 00:20:24,458
Deal.

350
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,126
Deal!

351
00:20:34,368 --> 00:20:35,836
- Honey.
- Yeah?

352
00:20:35,836 --> 00:20:38,005
The spa today was so nice, right?

353
00:20:38,005 --> 00:20:40,974
The water felt amazing.

354
00:20:40,974 --> 00:20:43,744
Look how your face is glowing.

355
00:20:44,378 --> 00:20:47,147
We still have two sessions left.
Let's go again.

356
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:48,615
Yes, let's do that.

357
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:51,852
You need it at your age
if you want to keep glowing.

358
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:55,589
Jin Woo didn't even do anything,

359
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:58,025
but his skin is so smooth and soft.

360
00:20:58,025 --> 00:20:59,359
Like baby skin.

361
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:01,595
I'm young. Yu Jin, aren't I pretty?

362
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:04,531
That's not glow, that's grease.

363
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:07,768
Slippery smooth.

364
00:21:07,768 --> 00:21:08,936
Good afternoon.

365
00:21:10,537 --> 00:21:12,539
Unit 1803?

366
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,174
Oh, that's ours.

367
00:21:14,174 --> 00:21:16,009
We'll take it. We've got it.

368
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:17,311
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

369
00:21:17,311 --> 00:21:18,445
Thank you.

370
00:21:18,879 --> 00:21:21,014
His face is full of wrinkles.

371
00:21:21,014 --> 00:21:22,549
Slippery smooth.

372
00:21:28,355 --> 00:21:30,457
What did you buy?

373
00:21:30,824 --> 00:21:32,192
I don't know. What is it?

374
00:21:32,192 --> 00:21:34,962
She buys so much, she forgets
what she bought.

375
00:21:34,962 --> 00:21:36,129
Environmental destroyer.

376
00:21:37,264 --> 00:21:39,233
A raffle from Peace Mart?

377
00:21:39,233 --> 00:21:39,967
A raffle?

378
00:21:41,768 --> 00:21:45,439
I must've won from that day
we went shopping.

379
00:21:45,439 --> 00:21:47,441
Some people are just born lucky.

380
00:21:47,441 --> 00:21:50,110
Why am I always this lucky?

381
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,912
I'm the one who entered the raffle.

382
00:21:51,912 --> 00:21:53,747
You said you were too lazy to do it.

383
00:21:53,747 --> 00:21:55,482
What are you talking about?
I paid that day.

384
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:58,452
So what? I said I'd pay you back later.

385
00:21:58,452 --> 00:22:00,053
But did you? Did you?

386
00:22:00,053 --> 00:22:01,221
You never did.

387
00:22:01,221 --> 00:22:02,623
Fine, I'll pay you now.

388
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:04,458
- Give me 50 dollars.
- Me?

389
00:22:11,098 --> 00:22:12,633
Can I give you 45 dollars tomorrow?

390
00:22:12,633 --> 00:22:13,901
Yeah, right.

391
00:22:14,935 --> 00:22:16,603
We paid for that raffle entry.

392
00:22:16,603 --> 00:22:18,405
You're being unreasonable.

393
00:22:18,405 --> 00:22:19,740
What are you talking about?

394
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,009
She didn't want to enter,
so thanks to Yu Jin, you won.

395
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:23,477
We deserve some credit, too.

396
00:22:23,477 --> 00:22:24,778
Exactly.

397
00:22:25,379 --> 00:22:27,814
Credit? You're full of it.

398
00:22:28,815 --> 00:22:30,884
Stop being so stubborn, will you?

399
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:44,565
Seriously.

400
00:22:46,133 --> 00:22:49,002
What? Why won't it open?

401
00:22:49,903 --> 00:22:51,171
Is this thing broken?

402
00:23:01,982 --> 00:23:03,217
I thought I was dying.

403
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:10,290
Seriously.

404
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,395
Excuse me, the elevator's broken!

405
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:17,397
Wait, my phone's not working either.

406
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:18,432
Unbelievable.

407
00:23:19,933 --> 00:23:22,336
Hello? Is anyone out there?

408
00:23:22,336 --> 00:23:23,971
What are you doing?

409
00:23:23,971 --> 00:23:25,873
What if you make it worse?

410
00:23:25,873 --> 00:23:27,508
Are you planning to sleep here?

411
00:23:41,121 --> 00:23:42,122
Move.

412
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:43,857
Are you crying?

413
00:23:44,658 --> 00:23:46,727
Na Ra, you even have a runny nose.

414
00:23:47,928 --> 00:23:50,664
Seriously. I really thought I'd die.

415
00:23:51,298 --> 00:23:52,833
We can't go on like this.

416
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:54,902
We need to find a way out.

417
00:23:54,902 --> 00:23:56,403
What are you going to do here?

418
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:03,744
What is going on?

419
00:24:03,744 --> 00:24:06,079
This usually opens with a gentle push.

420
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:07,414
It won't open. What do we do?

421
00:24:07,414 --> 00:24:08,382
What now?

422
00:24:21,995 --> 00:24:23,630
What the heck is this?

423
00:24:26,366 --> 00:24:28,302
You can't even open a door properly?

424
00:24:28,302 --> 00:24:30,070
You can't do anything right.

425
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,605
Why are you blaming Jin Woo?

426
00:24:31,605 --> 00:24:33,540
You were opening it with me.

427
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,242
Stop yelling at your brother-in-law!

428
00:24:40,781 --> 00:24:43,116
The door... it opened?

429
00:24:44,084 --> 00:24:45,185
Why did it open?

430
00:24:45,552 --> 00:24:48,488
Doesn't matter.
It opened, and that's what counts.

431
00:24:49,456 --> 00:24:50,490
Can we leave?

432
00:24:54,328 --> 00:24:55,729
Freeze!

433
00:24:55,729 --> 00:24:57,231
Nobody move.

434
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,136
It might fall from even the
slightest impact.

435
00:25:04,204 --> 00:25:05,339
What do we do then?

436
00:25:05,906 --> 00:25:07,174
Let's pray for our lives.

437
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:09,142
With desperation in our hearts.

438
00:25:09,643 --> 00:25:12,880
We walk very slowly, got it?

439
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,881
Very slowly.

440
00:25:13,881 --> 00:25:15,649
Okay. One...

441
00:25:17,084 --> 00:25:18,485
Freeze!

442
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:20,354
What?

443
00:25:20,354 --> 00:25:21,488
I'm scared.

444
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:26,226
No, this won't work.

445
00:25:27,094 --> 00:25:28,428
Let's go one at a time.

446
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,865
At least one of us has to survive.

447
00:25:32,666 --> 00:25:33,667
One person?

448
00:25:34,234 --> 00:25:36,803
Then... who goes first?

449
00:25:37,504 --> 00:25:38,372
Shall...

450
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:40,974
I...?

451
00:25:41,842 --> 00:25:42,709
What?

452
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:44,545
Respect your elders.

453
00:25:44,545 --> 00:25:45,946
What does that even mean?

454
00:25:45,946 --> 00:25:47,748
Death doesn't come in order.

455
00:25:47,748 --> 00:25:49,583
It says that in the law.

456
00:25:49,583 --> 00:25:51,785
Let's do rock, paper, scissors then.

457
00:25:51,785 --> 00:25:52,920
Fine.

458
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,820
Here we go.

459
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,088
Rock, paper...

460
00:25:55,088 --> 00:25:55,856
Wait!

461
00:25:56,456 --> 00:25:57,658
What the heck?

462
00:25:58,025 --> 00:26:00,027
How many rounds? Best of three?

463
00:26:00,327 --> 00:26:02,329
We're in a crisis. What best of three?

464
00:26:02,329 --> 00:26:03,430
- One round.
- Okay.

465
00:26:03,997 --> 00:26:04,898
Let's go.

466
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:06,934
Rock, paper, scissors!

467
00:26:10,103 --> 00:26:13,006
Then I'll go first and get help...

468
00:26:13,941 --> 00:26:14,842
Why?

469
00:26:16,944 --> 00:26:18,979
How could I leave you here, honey?

470
00:26:20,781 --> 00:26:21,882
You go first.

471
00:26:24,518 --> 00:26:25,485
Jin Woo.

472
00:26:25,485 --> 00:26:26,854
Go. We don't have time.

473
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,328
What now?

474
00:26:38,565 --> 00:26:39,733
Na Ra, you go first.

475
00:26:41,468 --> 00:26:43,737
Me?

476
00:26:44,404 --> 00:26:47,274
You're here alone. How can I go first?

477
00:26:48,308 --> 00:26:49,776
Just go already.

478
00:26:51,245 --> 00:26:52,246
This girl...

479
00:26:54,948 --> 00:26:55,949
But...

480
00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:00,220
Why is no one telling me to go first?

481
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:04,791
In times like this,

482
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:07,494
we need rules.

483
00:27:07,928 --> 00:27:10,197
There were rules on the Titanic, too.

484
00:27:10,898 --> 00:27:13,834
Ladies first. Then by age.

485
00:27:13,834 --> 00:27:14,701
So,

486
00:27:15,702 --> 00:27:17,804
Yu Jin, Jin Woo, me,

487
00:27:18,672 --> 00:27:19,606
and then you.

488
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:34,087
Yu Jin, go.

489
00:27:35,389 --> 00:27:36,390
Na Ra...

490
00:27:51,104 --> 00:27:51,972
Na Ra!

491
00:27:52,439 --> 00:27:54,441
I've always been thankful for your help.

492
00:27:54,441 --> 00:27:56,009
But I never said it out loud.

493
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:57,144
Because of my pride.

494
00:27:57,144 --> 00:27:59,847
I think I took it out on you
without realizing it.

495
00:27:59,847 --> 00:28:01,415
I'm sorry, Na Ra.

496
00:28:01,815 --> 00:28:04,117
No, I'm the one who's really sorry.

497
00:28:04,117 --> 00:28:05,686
I know your situation,

498
00:28:05,686 --> 00:28:07,621
but I still made a fuss over money.

499
00:28:07,621 --> 00:28:09,289
That was petty and shameful of me.

500
00:28:09,289 --> 00:28:11,358
I'm really sorry, Yu Jin.

501
00:28:12,259 --> 00:28:13,794
I love you.

502
00:28:14,061 --> 00:28:16,196
I love you too, Na Ra.

503
00:28:16,797 --> 00:28:18,198
Hyun Chul!

504
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:19,199
Jin Woo.

505
00:28:19,633 --> 00:28:21,268
I know...

506
00:28:22,569 --> 00:28:24,505
I love you...

507
00:28:24,505 --> 00:28:26,006
I love you too...

508
00:28:27,074 --> 00:28:29,543
Love you. Love you all...

509
00:28:42,723 --> 00:28:43,891
What are you doing here?

510
00:28:45,392 --> 00:28:47,828
We're alive.

511
00:28:55,402 --> 00:28:57,271
Guys, we love you!

512
00:28:57,271 --> 00:28:59,540
Love you!

513
00:29:06,849 --> 00:29:09,885
(Final Episode - Living Together)

514
00:29:11,887 --> 00:29:12,621
Mr. Oh.

515
00:29:12,621 --> 00:29:14,557
Did you make chicken soup?

516
00:29:14,557 --> 00:29:16,659
Dad, what are you doing here
without any notice?

517
00:29:16,926 --> 00:29:17,893
Is something wrong?

518
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,330
What, does a father need a reason
to visit his daughters?

519
00:29:21,964 --> 00:29:23,132
Let me join you guys as well.

520
00:29:23,132 --> 00:29:24,733
- Please sit.
- Oh, okay.

521
00:29:25,167 --> 00:29:27,703
But why did you come alone?

522
00:29:28,938 --> 00:29:31,841
Eat, eat up.

523
00:29:36,645 --> 00:29:37,446
Don't you have anything?

524
00:29:37,446 --> 00:29:39,415
Kang, pass me a piece of melon.

525
00:29:41,217 --> 00:29:42,184
Eat up.

526
00:29:43,419 --> 00:29:46,188
Dad, aren't you going home?
It's already ten.

527
00:29:46,722 --> 00:29:48,157
It's that late already?

528
00:29:49,959 --> 00:29:50,960
Ba Da.

529
00:29:51,293 --> 00:29:53,763
How about sleeping with me in a while?

530
00:29:53,763 --> 00:29:54,797
No.

531
00:29:55,231 --> 00:29:56,198
Why?

532
00:29:56,999 --> 00:30:00,970
Grandpa is going to sleep
with Ba Da tonight.

533
00:30:08,244 --> 00:30:10,312
(Five times)

534
00:30:17,153 --> 00:30:18,721
What is going on with Dad?

535
00:30:19,655 --> 00:30:20,623
Right?

536
00:30:21,023 --> 00:30:24,059
He never crashes here because he's picky
about sleeping arrangements.

537
00:30:24,527 --> 00:30:26,195
Did he fight with Mi Ran?

538
00:30:26,195 --> 00:30:28,831
No way. He's always so loving.

539
00:30:29,965 --> 00:30:31,767
It's Mr. Park.

540
00:30:34,303 --> 00:30:35,771
Hey, Oh Young Gyu.

541
00:30:35,771 --> 00:30:38,707
You are not having bad thoughts

542
00:30:38,707 --> 00:30:40,342
because your young wife scammed you
and you lost your house, right?

543
00:30:40,676 --> 00:30:41,610
What?

544
00:30:42,244 --> 00:30:43,712
What do you mean by that?

545
00:30:47,183 --> 00:30:48,317
Dad.

546
00:30:48,517 --> 00:30:51,287
Is it true that
Mi Ran ran off with the money?

547
00:30:51,787 --> 00:30:53,055
Did she sell the house?

548
00:30:53,055 --> 00:30:56,125
Do you know what that house meant?
Is she crazy?

549
00:30:56,125 --> 00:30:59,428
You should've talked to us first.
It's something serious.

550
00:30:59,428 --> 00:31:01,597
Seriously, Mr. Oh, why would you do that?

551
00:31:01,964 --> 00:31:03,866
Well, I...

552
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,935
I mean...

553
00:31:05,935 --> 00:31:07,603
I told you, didn't I?

554
00:31:07,603 --> 00:31:10,306
I knew there was something
shady about Mi Ran.

555
00:31:10,739 --> 00:31:13,142
I knew she was a gold digger
from the start.

556
00:31:13,142 --> 00:31:14,877
Mi Ran's not like that!

557
00:31:16,479 --> 00:31:18,414
Get out, all of you! Get out!

558
00:31:18,414 --> 00:31:20,382
- Dad!
- Come on, Dad...

559
00:31:20,382 --> 00:31:21,383
Mr. Oh...

560
00:31:28,758 --> 00:31:30,392
(Korean)
(Song Kang)

561
00:31:34,797 --> 00:31:36,065
Note-taking genius.

562
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:39,902
Glad I borrowed Kang's notes.

563
00:31:43,372 --> 00:31:44,373
Why a name reading?

564
00:31:47,543 --> 00:31:50,379
No way... Does Song Kang like me?

565
00:31:53,582 --> 00:31:54,550
Did you see?

566
00:31:56,952 --> 00:31:57,720
Yes...

567
00:31:59,889 --> 00:32:00,689
You saw it...

568
00:32:02,691 --> 00:32:03,559
Can I have that?

569
00:32:08,197 --> 00:32:11,367
I've never seen a score like 91 before.

570
00:32:13,002 --> 00:32:14,003
What?

571
00:32:14,637 --> 00:32:18,140
Can you give me a chance
to fill in the remaining nine points?

572
00:32:29,051 --> 00:32:30,252
I'm off.

573
00:32:30,853 --> 00:32:32,922
What the... Why is she leaving so early?

574
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:41,997
Why are you going so early?

575
00:32:42,965 --> 00:32:43,866
No reason.

576
00:32:45,034 --> 00:32:46,368
Why are you out so early?

577
00:32:46,936 --> 00:32:48,137
No reason.

578
00:32:48,904 --> 00:32:49,972
Actually, not really.

579
00:32:56,078 --> 00:32:57,046
What is it?

580
00:32:58,047 --> 00:32:58,948
Press it.

581
00:33:02,651 --> 00:33:03,986
(Press it)

582
00:33:12,628 --> 00:33:13,963
(Rotate it)

583
00:33:18,634 --> 00:33:19,902
(Press it)

584
00:33:27,076 --> 00:33:28,010
Did you read it?

585
00:33:34,383 --> 00:33:35,351
What?

586
00:33:37,052 --> 00:33:38,654
This isn't what I meant to say.

587
00:33:39,488 --> 00:33:40,356
Koo Won Hee!

588
00:33:42,958 --> 00:33:43,793
Koo Won Hee.

589
00:33:45,194 --> 00:33:46,529
What now?

590
00:33:50,065 --> 00:33:50,833
I like you.

591
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:55,271
What?

592
00:33:56,539 --> 00:33:57,640
I said I like you.

593
00:33:59,041 --> 00:34:00,009
For real.

594
00:34:05,781 --> 00:34:07,116
Come out and eat.

595
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:10,820
No thanks.
Someone like me doesn't deserve food.

596
00:34:13,923 --> 00:34:15,925
So you're really going to starve?

597
00:34:17,293 --> 00:34:20,329
Yeah. What's the point
of living when I'm old?

598
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,098
Do what you want!

599
00:34:29,138 --> 00:34:30,172
Mi Ran...

600
00:34:31,807 --> 00:34:33,275
She wouldn't do that...

601
00:34:46,756 --> 00:34:48,457
Nothing but vegetables.

602
00:34:55,564 --> 00:34:56,699
Jin Woo.

603
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:57,967
Yes, Mr. Oh.

604
00:34:57,967 --> 00:35:02,671
How can there not be a single
pack of ramen here?

605
00:35:02,671 --> 00:35:03,973
You know how it is.

606
00:35:03,973 --> 00:35:06,041
My wife only lets me eat
what's good for me.

607
00:35:06,041 --> 00:35:08,210
She doesn't allow unhealthy stuff.

608
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:11,580
But you know me.
Take a look under the sink.

609
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,581
Where exactly?

610
00:35:13,382 --> 00:35:15,284
Between the pipes near the wall.

611
00:35:15,284 --> 00:35:17,787
There! It's there!

612
00:35:20,489 --> 00:35:21,690
Looks delicious.

613
00:35:34,203 --> 00:35:35,671
What are you doing, Dad?

614
00:35:35,671 --> 00:35:36,505
What?

615
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,208
Just came for some water.

616
00:35:40,709 --> 00:35:41,777
What's that smell?

617
00:35:41,777 --> 00:35:42,711
What? Why?

618
00:35:51,587 --> 00:35:53,222
Why are you being so loud?

619
00:35:53,222 --> 00:35:55,291
Why won't the sink cabinet close?

620
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:56,625
I was just getting water,

621
00:35:56,625 --> 00:35:58,727
but I got stuck and nearly died.

622
00:35:59,395 --> 00:36:00,463
Why?

623
00:36:00,463 --> 00:36:01,363
Why is that?

624
00:36:04,633 --> 00:36:06,735
- What is this?
- Water!

625
00:36:06,735 --> 00:36:07,837
Why is water coming out?

626
00:36:07,837 --> 00:36:09,305
What? Dad!

627
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,656
So, when are they fixing the pipe?

628
00:36:27,656 --> 00:36:29,892
It's not just the pipe.

629
00:36:29,892 --> 00:36:32,995
Even the floor's lifted, so they're
tearing it up and doing major work.

630
00:36:32,995 --> 00:36:35,030
It'll take at least a week.

631
00:36:35,698 --> 00:36:37,600
Their landlord is freaking out.

632
00:36:40,002 --> 00:36:41,771
I've lost my appetite.

633
00:36:45,808 --> 00:36:48,177
Mr. Oh, why aren't you eating more?

634
00:36:50,146 --> 00:36:51,981
I'm done. No thanks.

635
00:36:52,748 --> 00:36:54,417
Just eat.

636
00:36:54,417 --> 00:36:57,219
What, are you going to break
our pipes too while cooking ramen?

637
00:37:01,791 --> 00:37:03,559
He's in his 70s.

638
00:37:03,759 --> 00:37:05,561
Don't treat him as you treat the kids.

639
00:37:05,561 --> 00:37:07,630
If he were seven, I'd understand.

640
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:08,798
But he's seventy...

641
00:37:10,166 --> 00:37:12,535
I'm charging Kim Mi Ran for all of this.

642
00:37:12,535 --> 00:37:15,237
How could a sly fox like her
end up in our home?

643
00:37:15,571 --> 00:37:16,772
Mi Ran didn't do anything!

644
00:37:18,174 --> 00:37:21,877
Why do you keep bringing up someone
who's not even here?

645
00:37:25,381 --> 00:37:27,383
Why can't I?

646
00:37:27,383 --> 00:37:28,851
You think you're any better?

647
00:37:29,385 --> 00:37:31,253
- You picked the wrong woman.
- Honey, please...

648
00:37:31,253 --> 00:37:34,423
We are living on rent too...

649
00:37:34,423 --> 00:37:35,891
You cover it, Dad.

650
00:37:36,725 --> 00:37:38,027
This is so scary.

651
00:37:38,761 --> 00:37:40,629
I should just move out of this home.

652
00:37:44,333 --> 00:37:45,367
Oh Young Gyu.

653
00:37:46,836 --> 00:37:48,971
How did it get this bad?

654
00:37:54,443 --> 00:37:57,246
Still, I, Oh Young Gyu...

655
00:37:59,748 --> 00:38:03,385
I loved this woman with all my heart

656
00:38:06,021 --> 00:38:07,223
and I don't regret it.

657
00:38:08,657 --> 00:38:10,326
Even if I could turn back time...

658
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,329
I'd still choose you, Mi Ran.

659
00:38:22,271 --> 00:38:23,272
(Mi Ran)

660
00:38:24,006 --> 00:38:25,207
Hello? Mi Ran?

661
00:38:25,808 --> 00:38:26,776
Young Gyu...

662
00:38:27,243 --> 00:38:29,779
Hey, where are you now?

663
00:38:30,513 --> 00:38:31,580
Behind you.

664
00:38:33,382 --> 00:38:34,917
Behind you, Young Gyu...

665
00:38:40,623 --> 00:38:41,590
Mi Ran.

666
00:38:49,465 --> 00:38:50,533
Don't be scared.

667
00:38:50,533 --> 00:38:53,335
We didn't do anything wrong, right?

668
00:38:54,036 --> 00:38:56,806
Hold your head up with confidence, okay?

669
00:38:58,007 --> 00:38:58,808
Yes.

670
00:38:59,375 --> 00:39:01,544
I believe in you, Young Gyu.

671
00:39:01,544 --> 00:39:02,244
Good.

672
00:39:13,889 --> 00:39:16,826
What?
I thought we were going in confidently.

673
00:39:16,826 --> 00:39:17,927
Yeah, right.

674
00:39:18,727 --> 00:39:20,529
I am confident, but...

675
00:39:21,597 --> 00:39:23,999
I just didn't want to shock them.

676
00:39:25,034 --> 00:39:27,603
Let me go in first and explain.

677
00:39:30,272 --> 00:39:31,040
Alright.

678
00:39:40,216 --> 00:39:41,550
What happened to the house?

679
00:39:42,384 --> 00:39:43,719
Construction work.

680
00:39:45,488 --> 00:39:48,591
How can we stay here like this,
Young Gyu.

681
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,795
Mi Ran, are you hungry?

682
00:39:54,597 --> 00:39:56,532
You haven't been eating?

683
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,901
After leaving like that...

684
00:40:00,002 --> 00:40:01,771
How could I eat?

685
00:40:02,538 --> 00:40:03,472
Mi Ran.

686
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:06,242
What in the world happened?

687
00:40:07,643 --> 00:40:10,045
Well, my son...

688
00:40:10,813 --> 00:40:14,350
You know he's studying in the U.S., right?

689
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:15,184
Yes, I do.

690
00:40:15,851 --> 00:40:18,354
Did something happen to him?

691
00:40:18,821 --> 00:40:21,524
He's a sweet and innocent boy,

692
00:40:22,525 --> 00:40:25,561
but some bad guys tricked him
and now he might go to jail.

693
00:40:26,061 --> 00:40:28,898
He said he would die
if I didn't send the money...

694
00:40:30,166 --> 00:40:32,301
If something like that happened,

695
00:40:32,301 --> 00:40:35,171
you should have told me first.

696
00:40:35,671 --> 00:40:37,640
I was too ashamed...

697
00:40:43,112 --> 00:40:44,480
After sending the money,

698
00:40:44,914 --> 00:40:47,083
I was going to end my life.

699
00:40:49,085 --> 00:40:50,119
Don't say that.

700
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:52,655
Why would you say something so awful?

701
00:40:52,655 --> 00:40:54,023
Even if I were to die,

702
00:40:56,859 --> 00:41:00,996
I wanted to see you again
before I go...

703
00:41:02,865 --> 00:41:03,766
Mi Ran...

704
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:11,941
So frustrating.

705
00:41:14,343 --> 00:41:16,112
I'm too mad to sleep.

706
00:41:17,279 --> 00:41:19,548
What should I do about Kim Mi Ran?

707
00:41:22,418 --> 00:41:23,452
This can't go on.

708
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,027
It's Na Ra.

709
00:41:32,027 --> 00:41:33,095
Young Gyu, what do we do?

710
00:41:33,763 --> 00:41:36,565
Just answer it. You never know.

711
00:41:36,565 --> 00:41:37,399
Answer it?

712
00:41:42,037 --> 00:41:43,405
Hey, Kim Mi Ran!

713
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:46,909
You wicked little snake of a woman!

714
00:41:46,909 --> 00:41:48,744
I am going to flip your eyes upside down.

715
00:41:48,744 --> 00:41:50,312
Should I serve rice on your eyeballs?

716
00:41:52,047 --> 00:41:52,915
Rice...

717
00:42:23,045 --> 00:42:24,580
Mi Ran must be hungry.

718
00:42:41,797 --> 00:42:42,665
Dad.

719
00:42:44,467 --> 00:42:46,769
- What are you doing?
- I...

720
00:42:47,503 --> 00:42:49,038
I was just hungry.

721
00:42:50,072 --> 00:42:52,842
You ate so much earlier,
how can you be hungry?

722
00:42:53,175 --> 00:42:54,243
When did I?

723
00:42:55,044 --> 00:42:57,813
Are you lying just to keep me
from eating a bowl of rice?

724
00:42:58,514 --> 00:43:00,616
Why? What's going on?

725
00:43:00,616 --> 00:43:02,218
Why? What is it?

726
00:43:02,218 --> 00:43:03,152
I mean...

727
00:43:03,552 --> 00:43:06,722
He clearly ate a ton not long ago,

728
00:43:07,156 --> 00:43:08,390
and he's hungry again...

729
00:43:08,824 --> 00:43:09,592
What?

730
00:43:09,592 --> 00:43:11,794
If I say I'm hungry, then I am!

731
00:43:16,532 --> 00:43:17,366
Mr. Oh...

732
00:43:19,201 --> 00:43:22,204
Let me make you something.
Just give me a moment.

733
00:43:23,139 --> 00:43:24,340
Hold on a second!

734
00:43:25,474 --> 00:43:26,342
I mean...

735
00:43:59,442 --> 00:44:01,444
They say if elderly people are shocked,

736
00:44:01,444 --> 00:44:04,713
it could lead to dementia.

737
00:44:05,748 --> 00:44:06,682
Dementia?

738
00:44:07,716 --> 00:44:08,717
Dementia...

739
00:44:10,553 --> 00:44:12,455
It can't be that my dad has dementia...

740
00:44:12,455 --> 00:44:14,123
What if it's really happening?

741
00:44:15,691 --> 00:44:17,560
My poor dad...

742
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,662
No, I'm sure it's not.
Don't worry too much.

743
00:44:19,662 --> 00:44:20,729
What do you know?

744
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,775
Here, try this too.

745
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:41,317
Chew slowly and thoroughly.

746
00:44:42,985 --> 00:44:44,787
Sip the radish water too.

747
00:44:47,089 --> 00:44:47,923
That's it.

748
00:44:55,664 --> 00:44:57,666
We... should go.

749
00:45:05,841 --> 00:45:07,276
Where's Dad?

750
00:45:09,945 --> 00:45:10,880
Dad?

751
00:45:11,747 --> 00:45:12,715
Dad.

752
00:45:14,049 --> 00:45:15,084
This time,

753
00:45:17,052 --> 00:45:21,657
I truly felt your love for me, Young Gyu.

754
00:45:22,892 --> 00:45:24,293
You're really...

755
00:45:24,994 --> 00:45:27,229
the only person on my side in this world.

756
00:45:28,431 --> 00:45:29,899
No matter what happens,

757
00:45:31,867 --> 00:45:33,769
you're the one who'll protect me.

758
00:45:35,738 --> 00:45:37,006
So stupid...

759
00:45:38,207 --> 00:45:39,642
Did you just realize that?

760
00:45:40,643 --> 00:45:41,610
Young Gyu...

761
00:45:43,012 --> 00:45:43,913
Mi Ran...

762
00:46:00,996 --> 00:46:01,997
Young Gyu...

763
00:46:02,198 --> 00:46:03,099
Mi Ran...

764
00:46:20,116 --> 00:46:21,684
Dad.

765
00:46:22,418 --> 00:46:23,619
What are you doing here?

766
00:46:24,386 --> 00:46:25,788
What's with your clothes?

767
00:46:26,188 --> 00:46:27,123
What?

768
00:46:27,123 --> 00:46:30,326
You said you were hungry.

769
00:46:30,326 --> 00:46:32,228
What are you doing here?

770
00:46:33,896 --> 00:46:35,197
What do I say?

771
00:46:35,898 --> 00:46:37,299
I don't know.

772
00:46:37,933 --> 00:46:41,403
Why am I doing here?

773
00:46:44,807 --> 00:46:45,641
I mean...

774
00:46:46,542 --> 00:46:47,710
It's okay, Mr. Oh.

775
00:46:47,943 --> 00:46:49,945
Let's just go together, shall we?

776
00:46:50,412 --> 00:46:51,981
- Mr. Oh.
- Please come.

777
00:46:56,819 --> 00:46:57,887
Yu Jin...

778
00:46:59,889 --> 00:47:01,757
What should we do about Dad?

779
00:47:02,124 --> 00:47:03,492
Dad...

780
00:47:06,228 --> 00:47:08,931
- What do we do?
- What do we do about Dad...

781
00:47:27,817 --> 00:47:28,684
Dad.

782
00:47:29,585 --> 00:47:30,786
Let's play cards.

783
00:47:30,786 --> 00:47:33,789
They say counting numbers
keeps your brain sharp.

784
00:47:33,789 --> 00:47:34,523
Let's play!

785
00:47:34,523 --> 00:47:36,459
Why are we suddenly playing cards?

786
00:47:36,459 --> 00:47:38,060
Sounds fun! Cards!

787
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:39,695
Let's play cards.

788
00:47:49,171 --> 00:47:50,873
What's with the cards all of a sudden?

789
00:47:51,874 --> 00:47:53,442
Mi Ran must be waiting.

790
00:48:02,384 --> 00:48:03,285
Dad.

791
00:48:04,553 --> 00:48:06,822
This is black bush,

792
00:48:06,822 --> 00:48:09,024
and this is red bush.

793
00:48:10,192 --> 00:48:11,660
Oh, I see.

794
00:48:17,433 --> 00:48:18,434
Dad.

795
00:48:18,434 --> 00:48:20,302
Is there anything you want to eat?

796
00:48:20,302 --> 00:48:21,837
Tell me, anything.

797
00:48:21,837 --> 00:48:23,506
No. Just play already.

798
00:48:23,939 --> 00:48:24,807
Okay...

799
00:48:28,978 --> 00:48:31,180
Mr. Oh, when are you coming?

800
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:34,250
I'm really craving some mango right now.

801
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:35,151
Mango.

802
00:48:35,618 --> 00:48:36,485
Mango?

803
00:48:38,687 --> 00:48:40,156
Dad, do you want a mango?

804
00:48:43,025 --> 00:48:43,859
Mango.

805
00:48:44,994 --> 00:48:46,862
- Yeah, I love mango.
- Mango's great.

806
00:48:53,102 --> 00:48:54,069
It's so good.

807
00:48:54,737 --> 00:48:55,538
It's good?

808
00:48:55,538 --> 00:48:56,572
Say ah.

809
00:48:57,573 --> 00:48:59,041
- Is it good?
- Yeah.

810
00:48:59,508 --> 00:49:01,811
Mi Ran, open your mouth.

811
00:49:06,682 --> 00:49:07,716
Let me peel one more for you.

812
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:17,760
Here, Mi Ran.

813
00:49:18,527 --> 00:49:19,628
Mi Ran, open your mouth.

814
00:49:20,362 --> 00:49:21,764
Where did Mi Ran go?

815
00:49:25,701 --> 00:49:29,505
Want to play hide and seek with me?

816
00:49:30,673 --> 00:49:31,574
Alright then.

817
00:49:32,641 --> 00:49:35,111
<i>I'm coming to catch Mi Ran</i>

818
00:49:35,478 --> 00:49:37,379
<i>I'm coming to catch Mi Ran!</i>

819
00:49:37,379 --> 00:49:39,515
<i>I'm coming to catch Mi Ran</i>

820
00:49:39,515 --> 00:49:41,851
<i>I'm coming to catch Mi Ran,
coming...</i>

821
00:49:54,897 --> 00:49:56,632
- Dad, come in.
- What's wrong?

822
00:49:56,632 --> 00:49:57,466
Here.

823
00:49:58,601 --> 00:50:00,336
Lie down, Dad.

824
00:50:03,172 --> 00:50:05,841
I'm not even sleepy.
Why do you keep insisting?

825
00:50:05,841 --> 00:50:06,709
No.

826
00:50:07,576 --> 00:50:09,411
You need to rest, Dad.

827
00:50:09,411 --> 00:50:11,981
Getting enough sleep is good
for your brain, too.

828
00:50:11,981 --> 00:50:12,882
Please rest.

829
00:50:13,749 --> 00:50:19,121
<i>Sleep well, my dad</i>

830
00:50:19,121 --> 00:50:20,656
Let's leave so Dad can rest.

831
00:50:20,656 --> 00:50:21,457
Yeah.

832
00:50:22,024 --> 00:50:22,992
Rest well.

833
00:50:28,297 --> 00:50:29,565
What should I do with this?

834
00:50:31,267 --> 00:50:32,301
Seriously.

835
00:50:34,403 --> 00:50:35,604
Na Ra...

836
00:50:35,805 --> 00:50:39,074
It hurts too much to face Dad like this.

837
00:50:39,642 --> 00:50:41,377
What Dad needs right now

838
00:50:42,178 --> 00:50:43,846
isn't our tears.

839
00:50:44,947 --> 00:50:46,248
You're right.

840
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:49,385
I can't sit here crying.

841
00:50:49,652 --> 00:50:51,120
I need to go buy groceries.

842
00:50:55,658 --> 00:50:58,394
What Dad needs right now...

843
00:51:05,301 --> 00:51:07,636
Mi Ran, it's me.

844
00:51:08,637 --> 00:51:10,773
I said some harsh things before, didn't I?

845
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:12,408
I'm sorry.

846
00:51:12,842 --> 00:51:15,744
I really want to apologize to you
face-to-face.

847
00:51:15,744 --> 00:51:17,113
Can we meet?

848
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:20,483
What the... This is kind of scary.

849
00:51:21,450 --> 00:51:23,652
(Kim Mi Ran)

850
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:25,888
Mi Ran!

851
00:51:26,088 --> 00:51:27,523
What? Why?

852
00:51:27,957 --> 00:51:29,291
What's going on?

853
00:51:29,992 --> 00:51:31,627
Wait a second!

854
00:51:35,965 --> 00:51:37,166
Take my bow first.

855
00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:44,273
What are you doing?

856
00:51:44,473 --> 00:51:45,541
What's wrong with you?

857
00:51:47,743 --> 00:51:48,677
Mi Ran...

858
00:51:49,411 --> 00:51:50,212
I mean...

859
00:51:51,013 --> 00:51:52,081
Mother...

860
00:51:53,349 --> 00:51:57,420
I've been really rude to you, haven't I?

861
00:51:58,087 --> 00:51:59,755
What do you want?

862
00:51:59,755 --> 00:52:02,057
Just act normal. You're scarier like this.

863
00:52:02,258 --> 00:52:03,993
No hidden motives, I swear.

864
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:07,730
I'm going to change from now on.

865
00:52:08,731 --> 00:52:11,867
I'll treat you really well, Mother.

866
00:52:12,802 --> 00:52:13,736
Really?

867
00:52:14,470 --> 00:52:15,404
Then...

868
00:52:16,272 --> 00:52:19,308
Could you maybe come back to my dad?

869
00:52:20,176 --> 00:52:21,110
Please?

870
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:23,279
Hey, you...

871
00:52:23,279 --> 00:52:25,714
Hey, why are you crying?

872
00:52:29,785 --> 00:52:31,821
My dad has dementia.

873
00:52:33,289 --> 00:52:35,324
He only looks for you, Mi Ran.

874
00:52:36,358 --> 00:52:37,226
What?

875
00:52:38,994 --> 00:52:42,164
I know it's a big thing to ask.

876
00:52:43,232 --> 00:52:43,999
But please...

877
00:52:44,934 --> 00:52:46,669
Could you come back?

878
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:48,637
Please...

879
00:52:49,472 --> 00:52:50,806
Please, Mi Ran.

880
00:52:53,175 --> 00:52:56,212
Okay. Let's hang up for now, okay?

881
00:52:56,212 --> 00:52:57,613
I'll think about it.

882
00:53:02,518 --> 00:53:06,422
Those girls think he
actually has dementia?

883
00:53:14,096 --> 00:53:15,364
I'm here.

884
00:53:18,267 --> 00:53:20,703
What if they find out?

885
00:53:22,004 --> 00:53:23,205
Mi Ran...

886
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:26,308
Mother, you're here?

887
00:53:27,543 --> 00:53:29,178
Mi... Mother...

888
00:53:29,178 --> 00:53:31,013
I'm so, so glad you came.

889
00:53:50,332 --> 00:53:51,534
Please help yourself.

890
00:53:51,734 --> 00:53:52,568
Mother.

891
00:53:54,670 --> 00:53:55,538
What?

892
00:53:55,871 --> 00:53:58,674
From now on, treat her with full respect.

893
00:53:59,141 --> 00:54:00,342
Respect, got it?

894
00:54:01,577 --> 00:54:02,678
Yes...

895
00:54:08,217 --> 00:54:09,351
It's pork...

896
00:54:09,785 --> 00:54:11,187
I thought it was beef.

897
00:54:13,489 --> 00:54:16,192
Pork is tasty too.

898
00:54:16,192 --> 00:54:17,793
Give this cut a try.

899
00:54:18,761 --> 00:54:20,529
- Calm down, Oh Na Ra.
- I'm not eating.

900
00:54:21,430 --> 00:54:23,966
Look how sharp Dad got
as soon as Mi Ran came.

901
00:54:25,334 --> 00:54:26,435
I'm sorry.

902
00:54:26,435 --> 00:54:29,205
I'll serve beef from tomorrow.

903
00:54:29,205 --> 00:54:30,773
Yeah, Mi... Mother.

904
00:54:30,773 --> 00:54:32,675
The meal was prepared in a hurry...

905
00:54:33,542 --> 00:54:37,480
It's not like I'm complaining
or anything...

906
00:54:39,181 --> 00:54:40,382
Anyways...

907
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:44,220
Where do we sleep now?

908
00:54:46,122 --> 00:54:47,223
Well, I guess...

909
00:54:47,957 --> 00:54:50,793
We can sleep in the living room...

910
00:54:52,461 --> 00:54:53,362
The living room?

911
00:54:53,362 --> 00:54:56,732
No way. Of course, you should
get the master bedroom.

912
00:54:59,201 --> 00:55:00,936
Then what about us?

913
00:55:01,137 --> 00:55:02,705
We...

914
00:55:02,705 --> 00:55:04,273
can sleep in Yi Na's room.

915
00:55:04,273 --> 00:55:05,074
What?

916
00:55:05,541 --> 00:55:06,642
Then what about me and Won Hee?

917
00:55:06,642 --> 00:55:08,444
You two sleep in Young Hoon's room.

918
00:55:10,513 --> 00:55:12,047
We... in one room?

919
00:55:13,816 --> 00:55:15,317
You two go to the living room.

920
00:55:15,317 --> 00:55:17,820
What is this?
Military barracks or something?

921
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:20,122
But Dad and Hyun Chul snore so loudly.

922
00:55:20,122 --> 00:55:21,724
My back hurts if I don't have a bed.

923
00:55:21,724 --> 00:55:22,691
Shut up.

924
00:55:23,392 --> 00:55:25,261
From now on,
Grandma and Grandpa come first.

925
00:55:25,761 --> 00:55:26,862
Got it?

926
00:55:26,862 --> 00:55:28,497
Yes.

927
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:33,569
This girl...

928
00:55:33,569 --> 00:55:35,938
only uses fancy stuff.

929
00:55:37,673 --> 00:55:39,442
So much of that?

930
00:55:42,778 --> 00:55:44,146
That feels good.

931
00:55:45,448 --> 00:55:47,917
So refreshing.

932
00:55:47,917 --> 00:55:49,952
You should come lie down too, Young Gyu.

933
00:55:53,656 --> 00:55:54,590
Still...

934
00:55:55,091 --> 00:55:58,227
Still, isn't it a bit much to lie to them?

935
00:55:58,227 --> 00:55:59,261
Quiet.

936
00:55:59,662 --> 00:56:03,332
You are only allowed to say
three things from now on.

937
00:56:04,266 --> 00:56:05,101
Number one.

938
00:56:06,235 --> 00:56:07,603
Who am I again?

939
00:56:08,137 --> 00:56:09,038
Number two.

940
00:56:09,472 --> 00:56:11,040
Where am I?

941
00:56:11,607 --> 00:56:12,508
Number three.

942
00:56:13,042 --> 00:56:14,944
Mi Ran. Got it?

943
00:56:15,978 --> 00:56:17,012
What are you doing?

944
00:56:19,882 --> 00:56:21,150
I mean...

945
00:56:21,150 --> 00:56:22,885
You don't even have dementia.

946
00:56:22,885 --> 00:56:25,121
If Yu Jin finds out I was hiding
at her place...

947
00:56:25,121 --> 00:56:26,288
They'll...

948
00:56:26,489 --> 00:56:29,725
They'll boil us, dry us,
and hang us out to die!

949
00:56:31,894 --> 00:56:33,162
What are you whispering about?

950
00:56:33,629 --> 00:56:35,798
Were you playing us all along?

951
00:56:35,798 --> 00:56:37,900
No, that's not it...

952
00:56:39,235 --> 00:56:40,102
Number one...

953
00:56:42,004 --> 00:56:43,372
Where is...

954
00:56:44,707 --> 00:56:46,142
Who am I? No...

955
00:56:46,142 --> 00:56:47,076
Oh my goodness.

956
00:56:47,076 --> 00:56:50,179
I... Where... Where am I again?

957
00:56:50,546 --> 00:56:51,480
Number four.

958
00:56:51,881 --> 00:56:53,983
Take a handful of supplements.

959
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:55,918
Open your mouth!

960
00:56:57,052 --> 00:56:59,221
Dad, I really thought you had dementia.

961
00:57:01,957 --> 00:57:03,392
And you expect us to believe that now?

962
00:57:04,994 --> 00:57:07,029
What could I do...

963
00:57:07,029 --> 00:57:10,466
when my son said he'd die
if I didn't send him money?

964
00:57:10,466 --> 00:57:13,803
Wait, is your son actually in the U.S.?

965
00:57:14,904 --> 00:57:15,871
He is.

966
00:57:15,871 --> 00:57:16,839
Forget that.

967
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,842
Bring back the money

968
00:57:19,842 --> 00:57:20,943
or I'll report you!

969
00:57:21,944 --> 00:57:22,778
Hey.

970
00:57:23,078 --> 00:57:24,647
It's my house and my money.

971
00:57:24,647 --> 00:57:26,749
Who are you to report her?

972
00:57:26,749 --> 00:57:29,485
Come on, calling the cops as a family...

973
00:57:30,252 --> 00:57:31,253
Family?

974
00:57:32,922 --> 00:57:35,958
That's my kid, too!

975
00:57:35,958 --> 00:57:38,260
He says he's in trouble.
You expect me to turn my back on him?

976
00:57:39,195 --> 00:57:41,097
If you were in trouble too,

977
00:57:41,097 --> 00:57:44,400
I would've sold my house
and helped all of you.

978
00:57:44,867 --> 00:57:46,969
Then why didn't you help him

979
00:57:46,969 --> 00:57:48,504
when he lost money in crypto?

980
00:57:49,171 --> 00:57:51,640
Why are we bringing that up again?

981
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:56,078
You have a perfectly healthy husband.

982
00:57:56,078 --> 00:57:58,013
I'm Mi Ran's husband!

983
00:57:58,013 --> 00:57:59,348
Enough already.

984
00:57:59,348 --> 00:58:01,617
- Sign the divorce papers.
- This is from building management.

985
00:58:01,617 --> 00:58:03,486
Otherwise, I'm not seeing you again.

986
00:58:03,953 --> 00:58:07,056
All residents, a fire drill
will begin shortly.

987
00:58:07,790 --> 00:58:09,091
I'm done too.

988
00:58:10,459 --> 00:58:12,294
Let's go, Mi Ran.

989
00:58:14,096 --> 00:58:15,731
- Mr. Oh.
- Move.

990
00:58:17,366 --> 00:58:18,601
Where are you going?

991
00:58:18,601 --> 00:58:19,568
Mom...

992
00:58:22,905 --> 00:58:23,806
(ERROR)

993
00:58:27,443 --> 00:58:29,578
You think I have nowhere else to go?

994
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:32,915
Let's go, Mi Ran.

995
00:58:34,083 --> 00:58:35,151
Where? Where to?

996
00:58:39,688 --> 00:58:43,259
(Five times)

997
00:58:44,026 --> 00:58:45,461
You said you had somewhere else to go.

998
00:58:46,095 --> 00:58:48,030
You're back here again?

999
00:58:52,902 --> 00:58:55,905
No sense at all, no sense.

1000
00:58:56,372 --> 00:58:59,008
It's not a bathroom,
so I won't get stuck at least.

1001
00:58:59,975 --> 00:59:01,977
No more mercy this time.

1002
00:59:06,649 --> 00:59:08,651
Is Dad really not coming back?

1003
00:59:09,752 --> 00:59:12,521
Leave him be.
He'll come back if he has nowhere else.

1004
00:59:15,057 --> 00:59:16,025
What is this?

1005
00:59:16,025 --> 00:59:16,959
What?

1006
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:18,494
What is it?

1007
00:59:19,328 --> 00:59:20,262
What?

1008
00:59:22,031 --> 00:59:22,965
What is it?

1009
00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:32,074
- What do we do?
- A fire has occurred.

1010
00:59:32,074 --> 00:59:32,975
Fire!

1011
00:59:33,476 --> 00:59:34,610
Isn't that just barbecue smell?

1012
00:59:34,610 --> 00:59:36,178
Can't you hear the alarm?

1013
00:59:37,313 --> 00:59:38,914
Fire!

1014
00:59:38,914 --> 00:59:39,982
Fire! It's fire!

1015
00:59:39,982 --> 00:59:42,651
Fire!

1016
00:59:42,651 --> 00:59:44,053
- Fire!
- Fire!

1017
00:59:45,488 --> 00:59:47,823
Don't breathe the smoke. Stay low!

1018
00:59:47,823 --> 00:59:49,125
There's a fire!

1019
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:54,830
Stay calm, everyone!

1020
00:59:56,532 --> 00:59:57,700
Chully and Jin Woo,

1021
00:59:57,700 --> 00:59:59,502
get towels wet from the bathroom!

1022
01:00:00,136 --> 01:00:02,271
Oh Yu Jin, take care of the kids!

1023
01:00:02,271 --> 01:00:03,205
Okay!

1024
01:00:03,205 --> 01:00:04,774
- Ba Da, come here.
- What should I do?

1025
01:00:05,775 --> 01:00:07,009
Call 911!

1026
01:00:07,009 --> 01:00:09,345
What's the number for 911?

1027
01:00:09,779 --> 01:00:11,480
Stay low.

1028
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:12,448
Stay low!

1029
01:00:12,882 --> 01:00:15,518
That's it, hurry!

1030
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:25,494
- It won't open?
- It's stuck!

1031
01:00:25,494 --> 01:00:27,596
Why won't it open? Move aside!

1032
01:00:29,799 --> 01:00:31,534
What is this? What's wrong?

1033
01:00:31,534 --> 01:00:33,068
Let me try, step aside.

1034
01:00:33,068 --> 01:00:34,103
Let's go!

1035
01:00:39,642 --> 01:00:40,543
What is going on?

1036
01:00:40,943 --> 01:00:43,145
Young Gyu, is it really a fire?

1037
01:00:43,446 --> 01:00:46,382
I don't know. Are all the kids out?

1038
01:00:47,650 --> 01:00:48,751
One, two, three.

1039
01:00:49,351 --> 01:00:50,319
One, two, three!

1040
01:00:52,088 --> 01:00:53,456
The kids are still inside.

1041
01:00:56,625 --> 01:00:57,960
What should we do...

1042
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:59,762
Mom, are we going to die?

1043
01:01:03,566 --> 01:01:05,401
Is the smoke getting worse?

1044
01:01:06,869 --> 01:01:09,205
Hey, Na Ra, Yu Jin!

1045
01:01:09,205 --> 01:01:10,306
Are you in there?

1046
01:01:10,673 --> 01:01:12,675
- Dad!
- Dad?

1047
01:01:12,675 --> 01:01:15,077
Grandpa, we're trapped in here!

1048
01:01:15,744 --> 01:01:18,681
Okay, Daddy, Grandpa's coming
to get you out!

1049
01:01:18,681 --> 01:01:20,182
- What do we do?
- Okay.

1050
01:01:21,751 --> 01:01:22,685
Quickly!

1051
01:01:28,791 --> 01:01:30,292
Young Gyu!

1052
01:01:31,427 --> 01:01:32,161
Dad!

1053
01:01:32,962 --> 01:01:34,196
Grandpa!

1054
01:01:34,196 --> 01:01:36,532
Hey, Kim Mi Ran, are you in there?

1055
01:01:36,532 --> 01:01:38,334
Na Ra, what do we do?

1056
01:01:38,968 --> 01:01:41,337
Young Gyu collapsed and can't get up.

1057
01:01:41,337 --> 01:01:43,439
What do we do?

1058
01:01:44,106 --> 01:01:45,674
Pull yourself together, Kim Mi Ran!

1059
01:01:46,242 --> 01:01:48,511
You've been married three times!

1060
01:01:49,445 --> 01:01:52,047
This is nothing
compared to what you've faced.

1061
01:01:52,815 --> 01:01:55,918
You're a woman who can do anything.

1062
01:01:55,918 --> 01:01:56,652
Right?

1063
01:01:58,454 --> 01:01:59,288
That's right.

1064
01:02:01,290 --> 01:02:03,626
I've been married three times.

1065
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:05,327
That's right.

1066
01:02:05,895 --> 01:02:07,696
I can do anything.

1067
01:02:09,665 --> 01:02:11,200
You can do it, Kim Mi Ran!

1068
01:02:11,667 --> 01:02:12,701
I can do it.

1069
01:02:19,975 --> 01:02:21,010
Last one!

1070
01:02:26,148 --> 01:02:27,850
It opened. Let's go!

1071
01:02:30,853 --> 01:02:33,689
Get out! Come on! Hurry!

1072
01:02:38,027 --> 01:02:40,096
- Are you okay, Mr. Oh?
- Dad, are you okay?

1073
01:02:40,096 --> 01:02:42,331
This is not the time. We need to go, now!

1074
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:46,335
Just get on my back!

1075
01:02:47,002 --> 01:02:49,271
I'm a man.

1076
01:02:50,072 --> 01:02:51,507
I can walk on my own.

1077
01:02:51,507 --> 01:02:52,875
Let's go! Hurry up!

1078
01:02:53,676 --> 01:02:55,010
Don't use the elevator!

1079
01:02:55,544 --> 01:02:57,446
Use the emergency stairs during a fire.

1080
01:02:57,446 --> 01:02:59,448
Right, you're right.

1081
01:02:59,682 --> 01:03:00,649
Wait!

1082
01:03:00,983 --> 01:03:03,052
If we open this door,

1083
01:03:04,019 --> 01:03:07,523
gas could rush in and we could all die.

1084
01:03:09,658 --> 01:03:14,130
I might end up dying,
so let me say this in advance.

1085
01:03:14,497 --> 01:03:15,598
Dad!

1086
01:03:15,598 --> 01:03:16,432
Mr. Oh...

1087
01:03:16,432 --> 01:03:18,267
Come on, don't say that!

1088
01:03:18,267 --> 01:03:19,969
Just listen for a second!

1089
01:03:28,077 --> 01:03:30,446
I may not have been

1090
01:03:32,081 --> 01:03:34,150
the best dad to you...

1091
01:03:34,817 --> 01:03:35,851
But to me... you girls...

1092
01:03:37,286 --> 01:03:40,756
were always the best daughters
I could ask for.

1093
01:03:40,756 --> 01:03:41,624
You know that, right?

1094
01:03:42,024 --> 01:03:43,159
Dad...

1095
01:03:44,226 --> 01:03:45,561
We're sorry too.

1096
01:03:46,662 --> 01:03:50,499
You were the best dad to us as well.

1097
01:04:00,242 --> 01:04:01,243
Hey, Kim Mi Ran.

1098
01:04:02,445 --> 01:04:04,647
Thank you for saving us.

1099
01:04:05,214 --> 01:04:08,184
What are you saying, we're a family.

1100
01:04:08,884 --> 01:04:11,053
Young Gyu's kid is my kid.

1101
01:04:11,053 --> 01:04:12,621
And mine is his.

1102
01:04:13,856 --> 01:04:16,659
Fine. From now on, I'm your kid.

1103
01:04:17,326 --> 01:04:19,528
That's right, you punk!

1104
01:04:20,729 --> 01:04:22,198
You punk...

1105
01:04:27,303 --> 01:04:28,370
- You okay?
- Are you okay?

1106
01:04:29,972 --> 01:04:30,840
Yeah...

1107
01:04:34,710 --> 01:04:35,578
Okay.

1108
01:04:36,579 --> 01:04:37,480
Alright.

1109
01:04:38,647 --> 01:04:39,849
Everyone ready?

1110
01:04:43,319 --> 01:04:44,053
We are going.

1111
01:04:47,556 --> 01:04:48,624
I'm opening the door.

1112
01:04:49,458 --> 01:04:50,426
One,

1113
01:04:51,494 --> 01:04:52,495
two,

1114
01:04:54,196 --> 01:04:55,264
three...

1115
01:04:59,401 --> 01:05:00,302
Mister!

1116
01:05:00,503 --> 01:05:02,571
What are you all doing here?

1117
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:06,175
We were evacuating from the fire...

1118
01:05:06,175 --> 01:05:08,444
That was just the fire drill alarm.

1119
01:05:08,444 --> 01:05:09,812
You didn't hear the announcement?

1120
01:05:10,746 --> 01:05:13,182
Oh, a drill? A fire drill...

1121
01:05:13,182 --> 01:05:15,251
A fire drill...

1122
01:05:18,454 --> 01:05:19,555
Seriously...

1123
01:05:19,955 --> 01:05:21,557
Did we just make a fuss?

1124
01:05:24,093 --> 01:05:26,562
We are alive!

1125
01:05:31,634 --> 01:05:34,336
Mom, I am doing well here.

1126
01:05:35,171 --> 01:05:36,672
Like a real family.

1127
01:05:36,672 --> 01:05:39,141
A little noisy and hectic,

1128
01:05:39,141 --> 01:05:41,010
sometimes a frustrating family.

1129
01:05:41,010 --> 01:05:42,411
But quite lovely too.

1130
01:05:43,746 --> 01:05:45,481
Lately I've had a concern.

1131
01:05:46,382 --> 01:05:48,684
Both Young Hoon and Kang confessed to me.

1132
01:05:49,819 --> 01:05:51,420
I haven't decided yet.

1133
01:05:52,788 --> 01:05:54,290
But in my heart,

1134
01:05:55,558 --> 01:05:56,692
in my heart...

1135
01:05:59,061 --> 01:06:00,696
Won Hee, let's take a picture.

1136
01:06:04,467 --> 01:06:06,335
Come here, Won Hee.

1137
01:06:06,335 --> 01:06:07,236
Okay.

1138
01:06:08,404 --> 01:06:09,872
- Do we look good?
- Yeah.

1139
01:06:13,576 --> 01:06:15,044
- I'll press it.
- Okay.

1140
01:06:16,712 --> 01:06:17,813
Hurry, come here.

1141
01:06:20,483 --> 01:06:21,383
It's working.

1142
01:06:21,383 --> 01:06:23,886
Okay. One, two, three.

1143
01:06:23,886 --> 01:06:25,287
Cheese.

1144
01:06:27,323 --> 01:06:28,557
What's with her?

1145
01:06:29,358 --> 01:06:31,594
Sorry, I don't know what's wrong with me.

1146
01:06:32,394 --> 01:06:33,329
Wait.

1147
01:06:34,897 --> 01:06:35,931
No way...

1148
01:06:37,733 --> 01:06:38,901
Come on...

1149
01:06:39,168 --> 01:06:40,169
Seriously?

1150
01:06:45,808 --> 01:06:46,742
Mr. Oh!

1151
01:06:48,210 --> 01:06:49,078
Mi Ran.

1152
01:06:49,545 --> 01:06:50,479
Dad!

1153
01:06:53,582 --> 01:06:54,817
Na Ra!

1154
01:06:56,619 --> 01:06:57,553
Na Ra!

1155
01:07:12,668 --> 01:07:16,172
