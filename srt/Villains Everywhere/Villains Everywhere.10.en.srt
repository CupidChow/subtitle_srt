1
00:00:00,534 --> 00:00:02,369
(Born as a Man)

2
00:00:02,369 --> 00:00:03,971
<i>Born into this world a man</i>

3
00:00:03,971 --> 00:00:06,406
<i>There's so much I have to do</i>

4
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:07,341
<i>So much to do</i>

5
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:08,909
<i>You and me</i>

6
00:00:08,909 --> 00:00:10,444
<i>living in glory</i>

7
00:00:10,444 --> 00:00:12,679
<i>protecting our land</i>

8
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:17,184
This takes me back.

9
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:19,386
Back when I served 36 months up north.

10
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:21,288
At the frontlines, remember?

11
00:00:21,288 --> 00:00:23,524
That's when I caught a North Korean spy.

12
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:25,125
Spy?

13
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:26,927
Look here, you see this? Right here.

14
00:00:26,927 --> 00:00:29,229
- What is it?
- Right there, see that?

15
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:30,464
That's a bullet scar.

16
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:32,266
Let me see, I couldn't...

17
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:36,670
To save a captured comrade
I fought off 30 spies.

18
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:40,040
A brutal fight, just me against 30 men.

19
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,842
And this is the scar I got from that.

20
00:00:41,842 --> 00:00:43,443
Wow, Mr. Oh.

21
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:45,512
You are a real man of men.

22
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:47,548
- Thirty to one.
- Thirty to one?

23
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:51,318
Nowadays, honor means nothing.

24
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,354
But men should live for something.

25
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:58,759
A man should live with loyalty,
you get that?

26
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:00,294
Loyalty, I'll remember that.

27
00:01:00,294 --> 00:01:01,695
- What's a man?
- Loyalty!

28
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:03,096
- What's a man again?
- Loyalty!

29
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:06,667
Here.

30
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:08,869
How many containers is this?

31
00:01:09,036 --> 00:01:10,704
One, two, three...

32
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:14,041
Why do we need ten containers
of aged kimchi?

33
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:15,776
There's no space in the fridge.

34
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:18,312
Better too much than none at all!

35
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:21,915
You can stir-fry it, stew it, wrap it,
so many options!

36
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,083
That's... actually true.

37
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:24,818
- Yu Jin
- Yes?

38
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:25,919
Why don't we make dumplings?

39
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:28,755
Sounds great. Let's go to the supermarket.

40
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:29,890
Put these on the balcony.

41
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,492
Hey honey, can we go out
after storing these?

42
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:35,829
I'm just going to play a game
of billiards with Mr. Oh real quick.

43
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:37,431
What billiards?

44
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:39,266
You need to help us make dumplings.

45
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:40,100
Come on.

46
00:01:40,868 --> 00:01:42,736
We went all the way

47
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:46,173
to Aunt's in Seosan for that kimchi.

48
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:47,674
I can't even play one game?

49
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,210
Fine, go ahead.

50
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,712
Just play one game, then come back.

51
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:52,779
Okay.

52
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:54,781
- Let's move it.
- Okay.

53
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,918
Hold on. We'll do it. Here we go.

54
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,589
It's heavy. So heavy.

55
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,393
Let's smell it.

56
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:09,997
Hurry up.
You want to go play pool, don't you?

57
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:11,532
This smells amazing.

58
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:14,301
Mr. Oh, smell this. It's great.

59
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,113
It's okay.
No problem if you wipe in three seconds.

60
00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:27,281
- Oh no!
- Use this.

61
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:28,048
Hyun Chul.

62
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:33,954
Yu Jin borrowed this scarf from Na Ra.

63
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:38,926
My goodness...

64
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,094
Why was it even there?

65
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,233
Dumplings, dumplings.

66
00:02:47,935 --> 00:02:48,869
Here.

67
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,473
We live on the 18th floor.

68
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:54,908
Who are you...?

69
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:57,244
Hello. I just moved in two days ago.

70
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:58,579
Do you live on the 18th floor too?

71
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:00,581
Yes.

72
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:03,517
She's in unit 1803, I am in unit 1804.

73
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:07,354
I just wanted to bring some rice cakes.

74
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:09,256
Oh my.

75
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:15,495
It's so heartwarming.

76
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:17,598
Right? And you look so nice too.

77
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:20,701
Thank you.
You ladies look so beautiful, too.

78
00:03:20,968 --> 00:03:22,035
Ladies?

79
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:33,046
He's got such a friendly vibe.

80
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,448
Totally.

81
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:36,817
Should we give him dumplings as well?

82
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:39,486
Good idea. Share some kindness on the way.

83
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:43,524
- What is it?
- Why are you just standing there?

84
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:44,992
Come sit down.

85
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:47,461
No, we're good right here.

86
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:49,329
Come on, Dad.

87
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:51,031
Have a seat.

88
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:55,402
Well... Standing is good for exercise.

89
00:03:58,138 --> 00:03:59,339
What's with you guys?

90
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:02,309
Honey, a new neighbor moved in downstairs.

91
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:03,610
Come, have some rice cake.

92
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,345
I'll just eat mine here.

93
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:07,447
What is going on?

94
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:10,317
Why is the home full of kimchi smell?

95
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:13,487
I know, right?

96
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:21,061
- Move.
- What?

97
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:24,631
I said move.

98
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:27,067
No, I'm really fine here...

99
00:04:29,837 --> 00:04:31,004
Move.

100
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,479
What the... Who did this?

101
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,582
What's wrong with the wall?

102
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:42,816
Well...

103
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:44,918
Jin Woo...

104
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:49,289
He fell while moving the kimchi container.

105
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,527
Don't be too hard on him, okay?

106
00:04:53,527 --> 00:04:54,461
I mean...

107
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:57,264
You can't even move
a single kimchi container?

108
00:04:57,264 --> 00:04:59,366
Song Jin Woo, what use are you?

109
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:01,502
- Seriously, what use?
- No, I...

110
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:04,271
If you messed up the wall,
at least clean it well.

111
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:05,606
What is this?

112
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:11,111
Oh my...

113
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,322
My scarf...!

114
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,992
It wasn't me. Hyun Chul used it to wipe.

115
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:27,561
Are you insane?

116
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:29,897
That's a limited edition
I can't buy again.

117
00:05:29,897 --> 00:05:31,899
What are you going to do about it?

118
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:34,601
Mr. Oh just tossed it to me,
so I wiped with it.

119
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:37,204
I didn't know what it was. I just wiped.

120
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:38,138
Dad!

121
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:41,074
You ungrateful...

122
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,910
I did that for you guys

123
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,444
You snitched on me first!

124
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:46,013
Shut up! You snitched on me.

125
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:50,684
Didn't I just say a man must have loyalty?

126
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:51,818
You call this loyalty?

127
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:52,953
Enough!

128
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,289
You know we live on rent, right?

129
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:57,491
Until it's restored to its original state,

130
00:05:57,491 --> 00:05:59,927
you can't move an inch.

131
00:05:59,927 --> 00:06:01,061
Seriously...

132
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:03,163
Hey, I mean...

133
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:07,267
Mi Ran's home alone.
I should check on her...

134
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:10,204
What, Mr. Oh?
I thought we were playing pool.

135
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:12,172
You said it was a men's bonding time.

136
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:14,474
Didn't you say you took a bullet
for a comrade?

137
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:15,676
How can you abandon us?

138
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:16,543
Shut up.

139
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,979
Do you all want to get masse in your head?

140
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,652
By the way,
why don't you show us how you do masse.

141
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:29,389
Let's go.

142
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:33,393
I'm seriously so pissed off.

143
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:39,333
Na Ra, anything else to mash?

144
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:44,471
Go ahead. Smash as much as you want.

145
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:45,606
Okay.

146
00:06:54,448 --> 00:06:56,550
Hey, come help make dumplings.

147
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,552
No way. This is a cultural activity.

148
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:00,053
I'm doing calculus here.

149
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:02,256
Really? Everyone's so busy?

150
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,157
Fine then.

151
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,095
Won Hee, let's make dumplings with me.

152
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:11,999
Hey.

153
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:16,503
What?

154
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:19,373
Weren't you busy with cultural activity
and calculus earlier?

155
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,109
Yeah, all done now.

156
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:23,110
I know all parts of calculus.

157
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:34,087
Wash your hands first.

158
00:07:34,388 --> 00:07:35,789
Oh, right, I should wash my hands.

159
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:38,592
Yeah, I'll go wash up.

160
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:43,297
This is going to take forever.

161
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,065
It's not just the time.

162
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:47,434
We've never done this before either.

163
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:52,873
Hyun Chul, Jin Woo.

164
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:56,944
I have an offer you can't refuse.

165
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:01,815
Let's go all in. Like real men.

166
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:03,317
All in?

167
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:05,485
One person is more than enough
for wallpapering.

168
00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:07,588
The rest go play pool.

169
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:08,822
How's that?

170
00:08:11,425 --> 00:08:12,092
Sure.

171
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:27,107
Alright, here it is.

172
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:30,444
Time to mix it.

173
00:08:30,444 --> 00:08:31,745
Let's mix it up.

174
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:34,481
Look at the smell!

175
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:35,516
You are nailing it.

176
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,985
Come on, mix it properly.

177
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,020
Looks delicious.

178
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:43,123
Who?

179
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:45,392
- I'll get it.
- Okay.

180
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:47,261
Who could it be?

181
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:51,331
What brings you up, neighbor?

182
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:53,634
Hello.

183
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:55,435
Well, it seemed a bit noisy up here.

184
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:59,706
I just wanted to check
if everything was okay.

185
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:03,477
We were mixing the dumpling dough.

186
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:06,380
Sorry if we were loud.

187
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,749
Not at all. It wasn't about the noise.

188
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,318
Actually, I...

189
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:13,620
I'm writing something important right now.

190
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,689
Writing? Are you a writer?

191
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:16,890
Poetry? Novels?

192
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:20,427
I write novels.

193
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:22,596
A literary man?

194
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:25,699
No wonder you seemed so knowledgeable.

195
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:28,168
We're done making noise. Sorry again.

196
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:30,504
Just asking for a little quiet, please.

197
00:09:31,205 --> 00:09:32,039
Of course.

198
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:33,707
Take care.

199
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:38,111
The more I see him,
the more polite and charming he is.

200
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:39,513
- Right?
- Totally.

201
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:44,051
Guys, try to stay quiet from now on, okay?

202
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:45,719
Yes.

203
00:09:54,695 --> 00:09:55,696
Come on in.

204
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:01,368
Na Ra, did you happen
to use the restroom?

205
00:10:05,239 --> 00:10:06,874
Yes.

206
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:11,478
From my room,

207
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:13,447
the flush sounded like a waterfall.

208
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:16,717
You flushed it three times
in a row, right?

209
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,588
You could hear that?

210
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:23,123
You must not know.

211
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:26,093
The toilet flush sound is
around 60.3 decibels,

212
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:28,195
which is about as loud as

213
00:10:28,195 --> 00:10:29,396
a blender machine.

214
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:32,833
A blender spinning on high.

215
00:10:34,568 --> 00:10:35,469
I'm sorry.

216
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:36,737
No, it's okay.

217
00:10:36,737 --> 00:10:39,039
It's fine.

218
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:42,709
Just please be mindful next time.

219
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:43,677
Till then.

220
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:45,646
- See you.
- Bye.

221
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,418
What is wrong with him?

222
00:10:51,585 --> 00:10:53,420
I can't even poop freely in my own place?

223
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,123
He's so sensitive.

224
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,825
He's probably just going through
the pain of creation or something.

225
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:02,196
That must be it.

226
00:11:03,397 --> 00:11:04,731
Here.

227
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:06,099
Well steamed.

228
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:08,101
Bon appetite!

229
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:13,407
Yum...

230
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,277
What? What's wrong?

231
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:18,912
- The dumplings...
- The dumplings?

232
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:22,950
Who put wasabi in here?

233
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:26,954
That was me.

234
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:28,255
What?

235
00:11:29,323 --> 00:11:30,257
That was a good one.

236
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:31,692
Why would you make that?

237
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:34,127
It's funny!

238
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:36,029
Again?

239
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:39,266
We didn't even poop this time.

240
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:41,335
Did someone poop?

241
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,138
No, not that.

242
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:46,473
The laughter echoes...

243
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:49,343
down the wall.

244
00:11:49,343 --> 00:11:52,012
How loud can it be?

245
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:53,447
102 decibels.

246
00:11:54,615 --> 00:11:56,917
That's equivalent to the subway noise.

247
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:03,457
If exposed continuously,

248
00:12:03,457 --> 00:12:05,459
it may cause hearing loss over time.

249
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,495
Please keep it down, ladies.

250
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:13,867
Noise doesn't only travel vertically
between floors.

251
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:19,206
My son won a science olympiad

252
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:21,375
so he's quite knowledgeable.

253
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,678
Not to brag, but I'm educated too.

254
00:12:24,678 --> 00:12:25,879
So,

255
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:29,650
I checked each unit where people live.

256
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:31,351
This house has the most people and

257
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:35,489
let's say, the liveliest activity.

258
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,359
So please,

259
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:43,697
just a little, very little,
please keep it down.

260
00:12:48,569 --> 00:12:49,503
What the...

261
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:51,705
So the rice cakes were

262
00:12:51,705 --> 00:12:53,740
just to check how many people live around?

263
00:12:53,974 --> 00:12:55,676
He's totally insane.

264
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:59,613
Still, he's our neighbor.
Let's be considerate.

265
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:04,518
No one shows more than six
upper or lower teeth.

266
00:13:05,052 --> 00:13:05,886
Got it.

267
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,124
(Tablecloth Pull)

268
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,059
Let's go.

269
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:20,968
Yes.

270
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:23,604
Alright, let's set the table properly.

271
00:13:23,604 --> 00:13:25,372
Let's see...

272
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,245
Alright.

273
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:37,284
Hey, hey.

274
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:38,485
What’s taking so long?

275
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,587
Stop stalling and just do it already.

276
00:13:40,587 --> 00:13:42,489
Mr. Oh, I'll do it for real this time.

277
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,164
Now it's your turn.

278
00:13:54,535 --> 00:13:56,470
(Tablecloth Pull)
(Hyun Chul (O), Jin Woo (O), Young Gyu)

279
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,149
Mom says to eat dumplings.

280
00:14:11,118 --> 00:14:14,454
Mom! Dad and Grandpa...

281
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:15,556
Hey, hey, catch him.

282
00:14:15,556 --> 00:14:16,823
Ba Da!

283
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:19,960
Let's play together, Ba Da.

284
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:33,373
Have some fruit.

285
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:35,142
Thank you.

286
00:14:35,676 --> 00:14:36,710
Thanks.

287
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:56,897
How am I supposed to eat an apple?

288
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:58,031
Suck on it.

289
00:14:58,398 --> 00:14:59,333
I see.

290
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:42,776
Ba Da, don't fart
wherever you feel like it.

291
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:44,711
Ba Da's not here, Kang.

292
00:15:58,192 --> 00:16:00,961
Did you hit the drums?

293
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:02,429
What?

294
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:03,363
I heard...

295
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:08,202
a loud booming sound just now.

296
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:17,544
My kid had some gas,

297
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:19,580
so that was him farting.

298
00:16:21,215 --> 00:16:23,217
You could hear that?

299
00:16:23,217 --> 00:16:26,153
He must have serious digestive issues.

300
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,156
But it sounds like the ceiling
might collapse.

301
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:31,124
Try probiotics, or maybe just...

302
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:33,060
a bit of courtesy.

303
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:37,531
Please, just a little consideration.

304
00:16:37,531 --> 00:16:38,966
Please.

305
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:56,316
This little punk...

306
00:16:58,619 --> 00:17:00,521
Na Ra, hold on. Okay? Hold on.

307
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:01,955
No, I won't hold back.

308
00:17:01,955 --> 00:17:02,956
I'm done holding back!

309
00:17:02,956 --> 00:17:04,525
- Wait, Na Ra.
- Mom!

310
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:05,893
- Na Ra, don't.
- Let me go.

311
00:17:05,893 --> 00:17:07,794
- Na Ra.
- Mom, please.

312
00:17:07,794 --> 00:17:09,696
Let go. Let me go.

313
00:17:10,664 --> 00:17:11,932
Why is she so strong?

314
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:17,271
Where is he?

315
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,108
It's the parcel.

316
00:17:21,642 --> 00:17:23,310
It must be the cloth I ordered
two days ago.

317
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:26,480
What? Why is it so heavy?

318
00:17:27,814 --> 00:17:30,317
I'll be unboxing...

319
00:17:30,317 --> 00:17:32,553
the new jacket and skirt.

320
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:37,024
What?

321
00:17:37,191 --> 00:17:38,792
Books?

322
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,964
There's no one at home to order a book.

323
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:46,366
Let me see.

324
00:17:47,501 --> 00:17:50,404
It's the downstairs neighbor's parcel.

325
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:51,471
Come on.

326
00:17:51,872 --> 00:17:55,876
So this is the novel he's working on?

327
00:17:55,876 --> 00:17:57,678
- What is it?
- What is it?

328
00:17:57,678 --> 00:17:58,912
This is ridiculous.

329
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,448
Look at that title.

330
00:18:01,448 --> 00:18:03,250
So childish.

331
00:18:04,051 --> 00:18:06,286
Why would anyone publish
13 volumes of this?

332
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:17,998
This is unbelievable.

333
00:18:17,998 --> 00:18:20,033
Some people really have no manners.

334
00:18:20,033 --> 00:18:22,069
How can you just open
someone else's package?

335
00:18:22,069 --> 00:18:24,071
We thought it was ours.

336
00:18:24,738 --> 00:18:26,240
Excuse me, Lady?

337
00:18:26,507 --> 00:18:30,043
The unit number
is clearly written here.

338
00:18:32,746 --> 00:18:36,650
Please, next time,

339
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,051
just a little more caution.

340
00:18:38,051 --> 00:18:40,420
Not a lot. Just this much.

341
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:43,457
I'm kindly asking you.

342
00:18:44,758 --> 00:18:45,826
Please.

343
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:54,968
What kind of guy is that?

344
00:18:55,169 --> 00:18:57,304
Keeps calling me "Lady" like that.

345
00:18:57,304 --> 00:18:59,306
Why would I be his "Lady," seriously?

346
00:19:00,874 --> 00:19:02,075
Want to get revenge?

347
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:04,111
Revenge?

348
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,483
Ba Da, don't tell Mom about this.
It's our secret.

349
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,784
Okay.

350
00:19:10,784 --> 00:19:12,252
- Promise.
- Promise.

351
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:13,353
Good. Promise.

352
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:14,254
Here you go.

353
00:19:14,254 --> 00:19:16,390
Anyway, Mr. Oh lost,

354
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:18,292
So you'll do the wallpapering, right?

355
00:19:18,292 --> 00:19:19,293
Yes.

356
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,827
Hey.

357
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:24,565
You guys...
What country are you guys from?

358
00:19:24,898 --> 00:19:26,967
- What?
- Korean.

359
00:19:27,234 --> 00:19:29,937
And Koreans believe in

360
00:19:30,103 --> 00:19:32,005
best of three, right?

361
00:19:32,206 --> 00:19:33,574
Come on...

362
00:19:33,941 --> 00:19:35,609
We have to do three rounds.

363
00:19:35,976 --> 00:19:39,346
(Game One: Tablecloth Pull)
(Young Gyu: one loss)

364
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:41,281
(Game Two: Bottle Cap Flick)

365
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:52,793
Nice shot, Hyun Chul.

366
00:19:55,495 --> 00:19:58,799
Do you know what my nickname was
in school?

367
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:00,834
I used to flick bottle caps everywhere.

368
00:20:00,834 --> 00:20:02,803
They called me the Bottle Cap Star.

369
00:20:02,803 --> 00:20:04,438
Stop goofing off and just go.

370
00:20:12,546 --> 00:20:15,849
Hey, Bottle Cap Star.
Step back. Out of the way.

371
00:20:16,617 --> 00:20:18,318
This kind of thing needs to be done
in a delicate manner.

372
00:20:18,318 --> 00:20:20,654
It's all about being delicate.

373
00:20:20,654 --> 00:20:23,857
It's not about power.

374
00:20:23,857 --> 00:20:25,692
When I was in the army,

375
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:28,795
you know what my position was?

376
00:20:28,795 --> 00:20:29,530
What?

377
00:20:29,863 --> 00:20:32,499
Sniper Gyu. I was "Sniper Gyu."

378
00:20:32,966 --> 00:20:36,103
One shot, one kill.

379
00:20:36,937 --> 00:20:37,905
Let's go.

380
00:20:51,418 --> 00:20:53,420
Oh no, Ba Da! It's okay, Ba Da.

381
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,322
Ba Da's not hurt. Ba Da's just fine.

382
00:20:56,156 --> 00:20:59,693
I'll buy you something yummy later, Ba Da.

383
00:20:59,693 --> 00:21:00,727
Something yummy later.

384
00:21:01,228 --> 00:21:03,697
(The Hidden Story of
the Woman Making Dumplings)

385
00:21:04,231 --> 00:21:06,066
(View Reviews)

386
00:21:08,035 --> 00:21:10,170
Yawn.

387
00:21:10,637 --> 00:21:13,006
This is incredibly boring.

388
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:15,209
It's trash disguised as romance.

389
00:21:15,409 --> 00:21:17,311
Bet the writer's never dated.

390
00:21:17,311 --> 00:21:18,745
Knows nothing about women.

391
00:21:18,745 --> 00:21:20,480
Anyone want to buy this used?

392
00:21:21,682 --> 00:21:24,084
A dumb, tedious romance

393
00:21:24,084 --> 00:21:25,819
wrapped in dumpling skin and filling.

394
00:21:26,386 --> 00:21:29,623
Maybe work on your writing skills
instead of noise complaints.

395
00:21:29,623 --> 00:21:31,091
Unbelievable.

396
00:21:31,091 --> 00:21:34,027
Talk to them nicely
and they think I am dumb.

397
00:21:34,761 --> 00:21:36,997
Min Jun's mom and Seung Chan's mom
are going to love this.

398
00:21:36,997 --> 00:21:37,998
Right?

399
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:42,536
- What is that?
- What?

400
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:45,539
(Strongly condemn unit 1803's
brainless noise pollution)

401
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:48,542
What kind of nonsense is this?

402
00:21:48,542 --> 00:21:52,045
You ridiculous little rascal.

403
00:21:52,045 --> 00:21:53,614
This jerk...

404
00:21:56,984 --> 00:21:59,086
He papered the whole place?

405
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:05,659
There he is.

406
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:07,261
Unit 1703!

407
00:22:08,262 --> 00:22:09,830
Seriously, what a joke.

408
00:22:10,464 --> 00:22:12,199
What are you doing here?

409
00:22:12,199 --> 00:22:15,102
You're the ones
who crossed the line first.

410
00:22:15,469 --> 00:22:17,404
- Excuse me
- Ma'am...

411
00:22:17,404 --> 00:22:19,439
Weren't you calling us "ladies" before?

412
00:22:19,439 --> 00:22:21,475
And now it's just "ma'am"?

413
00:22:21,475 --> 00:22:23,177
Yes, ma'am.

414
00:22:23,644 --> 00:22:26,446
Ma'am, ma'am.

415
00:22:26,747 --> 00:22:29,116
You left hateful comments on my book,
didn't you?

416
00:22:29,917 --> 00:22:33,287
So this is your way of getting back at us?

417
00:22:33,287 --> 00:22:34,821
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth.

418
00:22:34,821 --> 00:22:36,957
A hate comment for a hate comment.

419
00:22:37,191 --> 00:22:40,327
Even my lazy writing is a masterpiece.

420
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:42,095
A masterpiece?

421
00:22:43,997 --> 00:22:47,100
I graduated from a top university.

422
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:53,974
Such vulgar ladies.
Seriously, what a low level.

423
00:22:56,977 --> 00:22:58,312
This little...

424
00:22:58,312 --> 00:22:59,780
My eye! You hit my eye!

425
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,481
What did you say? Vulgar?

426
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:03,050
You crazy old hag.

427
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:05,185
I am a vulgar lady.

428
00:23:05,185 --> 00:23:06,153
Hold on.

429
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:11,158
Sir!

430
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:14,027
- Security, help me!
- Rip it off, rip it!

431
00:23:14,027 --> 00:23:15,562
Nice one, Oh Na Ra, good one.

432
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:16,463
What did you say?

433
00:23:16,463 --> 00:23:18,131
- Vulgar lady?
- Let go of me!

434
00:23:18,131 --> 00:23:21,702
Vulgar? You called us vulgar? You jerk.

435
00:23:21,702 --> 00:23:23,737
- Please help!
- Stop it!

436
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:25,672
That's enough!

437
00:23:25,672 --> 00:23:27,307
What the hell is going on?

438
00:23:27,307 --> 00:23:29,776
This is an apartment.
People live here together.

439
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,812
Try to be a little understanding.

440
00:23:31,812 --> 00:23:32,713
Understanding?

441
00:23:32,713 --> 00:23:35,682
Understanding has to go both ways, right?

442
00:23:35,682 --> 00:23:37,851
This is ridiculous.

443
00:23:37,851 --> 00:23:41,355
I'm holding back because
I have class and decency.

444
00:23:42,623 --> 00:23:45,025
Why are you glaring? Lower your eyes!

445
00:23:45,025 --> 00:23:46,393
Unbelievable.

446
00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:50,497
If I catch you one more time,

447
00:23:50,497 --> 00:23:53,967
I'll sue you and file a restraining order.

448
00:23:53,967 --> 00:23:55,435
A restraining order?

449
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:58,172
I wouldn't come near you
even if you begged me, jerk.

450
00:23:58,172 --> 00:23:59,973
Get lost, seriously.

451
00:23:59,973 --> 00:24:01,108
Whatever.

452
00:24:02,409 --> 00:24:04,178
Hey, we won.

453
00:24:04,378 --> 00:24:07,281
Of course.
In a fight, it's always Oh Na Ra.

454
00:24:07,281 --> 00:24:08,215
Come on.

455
00:24:14,521 --> 00:24:16,623
How dare she call me a jerk?

456
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:18,892
I'll definitely get my revenge.

457

Mr. Oh.

460
00:24:28,569 --> 00:24:30,070
This is seriously the last chance.

461
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,305
We won't go easy on you anymore.

462
00:24:31,305 --> 00:24:33,173
Okay.

463
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:44,484
Come on!

464
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:45,752
Nice!

465
00:24:46,753 --> 00:24:50,257
Dad, fire! Fire!

466
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:54,695
What do we do?

467
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:59,199
How are you going to fix this?

468
00:25:00,167 --> 00:25:02,636
If we leave it like this,
Yu Jin won't know.

469
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:07,074
Anyway, since we won this round too

470
00:25:07,074 --> 00:25:08,742
we're really leaving this time.

471
00:25:08,742 --> 00:25:10,844
No more excuses, okay?

472
00:25:10,844 --> 00:25:12,112
Alright, go.

473
00:25:12,112 --> 00:25:13,180
Let's go.

474
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,182
Whatever. Stay with Grandpa, okay?

475
00:25:15,182 --> 00:25:16,917
- Okay.
- Seriously.

You all

495
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:17,411
should know the pain
of having an awful neighbor.

Someone's dying in here.

507
00:27:21,041 --> 00:27:22,676
Here you go. Grandpa got it.

508
00:27:27,181 --> 00:27:29,249
Look at you eat. My sweet kid.

509
00:27:34,488 --> 00:27:35,789
Mr. Oh.

510
00:27:36,557 --> 00:27:39,493
We're going through all this
because of you.

511
00:27:51,238 --> 00:27:52,272
What is this?

512
00:27:52,272 --> 00:27:53,907
They say if you eat vanilla ice cream
and drink Coke,

513
00:27:53,907 --> 00:27:55,909
you're bound to explode like that.

514
00:27:55,909 --> 00:27:57,744
- Really?
- Yeah, it's famous.

515
00:27:57,744 --> 00:28:00,347
You know, when you throw mint candy
into Coke,

516
00:28:00,347 --> 00:28:02,015
it explodes.

517
00:28:02,516 --> 00:28:03,483
Really?

518
00:28:03,483 --> 00:28:05,452
I bet it shoots at least a meter up.

519
00:28:05,452 --> 00:28:07,087
A meter? That's nothing.

520
00:28:07,087 --> 00:28:09,790
With baking soda, it could go
two or three meters easily.

521
00:28:10,858 --> 00:28:12,125
- Really?
- Yeah.

522
00:28:12,526 --> 00:28:15,329
Then let's do it. Let's try it for real.

523
00:28:15,329 --> 00:28:16,530
- Try it?
- Yeah, let's try.

524
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:20,000
Let's see if it shoots up or not.
Let's just do it.

525
00:28:21,435 --> 00:28:23,237
- Really?
- That sounds so fun.

526
00:28:23,237 --> 00:28:25,372
Will it actually go up? Really?

527
00:28:29,309 --> 00:28:30,611
Coke! Get the Coke!

528
00:28:32,713 --> 00:28:33,947
Will it really work?

529
00:28:33,947 --> 00:28:34,982
Let's give it a try.

530
00:28:47,561 --> 00:28:51,164
Dad, it's raining Coke.

531
00:28:58,605 --> 00:29:00,774
Ba Da, it's dirty.

532
00:29:00,774 --> 00:29:03,410
That's not for drinking.

533
00:29:05,712 --> 00:29:08,615
Mr. Oh, what do we do?
This is so fun.

534
00:29:08,615 --> 00:29:10,584
If Yu Jin finds out, she'll kill me.

535
00:29:11,118 --> 00:29:12,986
It's fine.

536
00:29:12,986 --> 00:29:15,822
If we die, at least we die together.

537
00:29:26,333 --> 00:29:28,235
What is this?

538
00:29:28,535 --> 00:29:29,536
Are you crazy?

539
00:29:34,074 --> 00:29:35,876
If you surrender right now,

540
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:38,679
I'll spare your life.

541
00:29:39,613 --> 00:29:40,581
Well, the thing is...

542
00:29:41,982 --> 00:29:42,950
Here...

543
00:29:44,618 --> 00:29:45,619
Seriously?

544
00:29:48,188 --> 00:29:51,024
- You traitors.
- Filthy traitors.

545
00:29:52,626 --> 00:29:54,461
Where are you going?

546
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:55,596
Where are you off to?

547
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:00,334
- Dad.
- Mr. Oh, still...

548
00:30:00,334 --> 00:30:02,669
Still, wasn't it fun? It was fun, right?

549
00:30:02,669 --> 00:30:03,670
Yes.

550
00:30:04,104 --> 00:30:04,905
Come here.

551
00:30:18,385 --> 00:30:19,653
I'm hungry.

552
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:30,931
It's hot!

553
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,308
So good.

554
00:30:43,377 --> 00:30:44,912
Is anyone out there?

555
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,581
Please help me!

556
00:30:48,115 --> 00:30:50,017
Water! Please, just some water!

557
00:30:50,017 --> 00:30:52,819
Seriously, please help me!

558
00:30:57,357 --> 00:30:58,892
This is unbelievably good.

559
00:30:58,892 --> 00:31:01,795
Right? It's the kind of food you die for.

560
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:04,131
Quit the act.

561
00:31:04,865 --> 00:31:06,300
I'm not falling for that.

562
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:11,905
I don't know what it tastes like.

563
00:31:12,606 --> 00:31:14,174
Because I didn't get any dumplings.

564
00:31:14,174 --> 00:31:15,209
I see...

565
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:25,385
You don't have to taste it to know.

566
00:31:25,385 --> 00:31:26,620
It's good.

567
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:29,089
It tastes great even without dumplings.

568
00:31:30,557 --> 00:31:33,260
Please help. Is anyone there?

569
00:31:35,329 --> 00:31:38,131
Did you guys just hear something?

570
00:31:43,804 --> 00:31:44,671
You heard that?

571
00:31:45,873 --> 00:31:48,642
It's telling you to finish eating
and get the wallpaper done.

572
00:31:49,209 --> 00:31:50,410
Eat up. Hurry.

573
00:31:57,063 --> 00:31:57,897
(Lies upon lies)

574
00:31:57,899 --> 00:32:01,169
Rather than explaining everything,

575
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:03,238
it's better to just read it out.

576
00:32:04,006 --> 00:32:05,841
Our task is to give consumers

577
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:08,010
not just hope

578
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:10,612
but confidence.

579
00:32:10,612 --> 00:32:13,115
That's the key point of this
marketing campaign.

580
00:32:13,115 --> 00:32:14,549
So handsome.

581
00:32:20,288 --> 00:32:21,223
Intern Seo...

582
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:22,491
Intern Seo.

583
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:24,693
Intern Seo!

584
00:32:25,394 --> 00:32:27,429
Next slide. Let's move on.

585
00:32:30,732 --> 00:32:32,868
Chully, what's this on your underwear?

586
00:32:36,304 --> 00:32:37,439
Dad, did you poop yourself?

587
00:32:38,807 --> 00:32:40,175
What is this?

588
00:32:40,175 --> 00:32:41,777
Yi Na, this is a group chat.

589
00:32:41,777 --> 00:32:43,612
Hyun Chul's poopy underwear.

590
00:32:45,747 --> 00:32:47,683
What is going on?

591
00:32:48,917 --> 00:32:50,986
Intern Seo, the messenger.

592
00:32:50,986 --> 00:32:52,220
Wait, why is this...?

593
00:32:52,954 --> 00:32:55,190
Is the battery dead?

594
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:58,727
Turn it off. Hurry!

595
00:32:59,161 --> 00:33:00,929
Why won't it turn off?

596
00:33:09,338 --> 00:33:11,306
What is going on here!

597
00:33:11,606 --> 00:33:13,942
Come on, let's go.

598
00:33:14,643 --> 00:33:18,580
Seriously, Planning Team Two,
never handles anything properly.

599
00:33:20,349 --> 00:33:24,152
Wait, didn't you say
your father passed away?

600
00:33:26,188 --> 00:33:27,255
It's my stepdad.

601
00:33:34,029 --> 00:33:34,963
Hey.

602
00:33:35,697 --> 00:33:37,099
I need to tell you something.

603
00:33:37,332 --> 00:33:38,333
What is it?

604
00:33:38,533 --> 00:33:41,937
We really click, especially when we play.
Don't you think?

605
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:44,272
And?

606
00:33:44,539 --> 00:33:45,807
So, I mean...

607
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:47,442
Want to date?

608
00:33:49,177 --> 00:33:50,078
What?

609
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,982
- But...
- You'll think about it, right?

610
00:33:56,818 --> 00:33:57,953
Yeah.

611
00:33:58,754 --> 00:33:59,788
I'll wait.

612
00:34:00,389 --> 00:34:01,356
Let's go.

613
00:34:06,728 --> 00:34:07,929
No way.

614
00:34:09,031 --> 00:34:11,033
(Mong Player)

615
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:15,937
Welcome.

616
00:34:19,941 --> 00:34:22,711
Do you have the Chopin nocturne

617
00:34:22,711 --> 00:34:24,546
played by Maurizio Pollini?

618
00:34:25,113 --> 00:34:26,915
You might want to check upstairs.

619
00:34:34,156 --> 00:34:38,827
(To. Won Hee)

620
00:34:52,274 --> 00:34:53,208
Hello.

621
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:05,187
Excuse me.

622
00:35:05,187 --> 00:35:06,988
Can I get the one with a heart?

623
00:35:06,988 --> 00:35:08,423
If you buy the necklace now,

624
00:35:09,224 --> 00:35:10,359
you'll get this, too.

625
00:35:10,826 --> 00:35:12,327
It even has a voice recorder.

626
00:35:15,764 --> 00:35:17,265
This is Young Hoon.

627
00:35:17,265 --> 00:35:18,333
Want to date me?

628
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:20,168
Want to eat or die with me?

629
00:35:23,405 --> 00:35:24,539
Please date me.

630
00:35:25,707 --> 00:35:28,577
You know how I feel, right?

631
00:35:33,415 --> 00:35:36,151
As long as you know. That's enough.

632
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:41,156
It's six o'clock.

633
00:35:41,957 --> 00:35:43,225
I'm off for the day.

634
00:35:43,825 --> 00:35:47,062
I have a memorial today,
so I'll head out first.

635
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:48,563
See you all tomorrow.

636
00:35:54,936 --> 00:35:55,804
Aren't you going?

637
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:58,306
Aren't you leaving?

638
00:36:05,714 --> 00:36:07,049
Well then, take care.

639
00:36:10,218 --> 00:36:12,854
Mr. Go, you are an
engineering major, right?

640
00:36:13,388 --> 00:36:14,690
Yes, I am.

641
00:36:16,124 --> 00:36:17,959
Then can you fix this?

642
00:36:18,293 --> 00:36:19,961
It won't turn on.

643
00:36:19,961 --> 00:36:22,597
314 Hansan-daero, Hansan-gu, Seoul.

644
00:36:22,831 --> 00:36:23,598
Sorry?

645
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,701
That's the service center address.

646
00:36:25,701 --> 00:36:27,202
Go get it repaired.

647
00:36:27,803 --> 00:36:29,271
Total stonewall.

648
00:36:30,172 --> 00:36:31,807
I need a drink.

649
00:36:33,508 --> 00:36:36,111
Definitely a soju-beer night today.

650
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:36,978
Yeah?

651
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:41,016
I know a good place. Want to go?

652
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:43,352
What's with the sudden invite?

653
00:36:43,352 --> 00:36:45,687
Did he have feelings for me as well?

654
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:47,889
I'm in.

655
00:36:49,491 --> 00:36:50,292
Have a seat.

656
00:36:52,194 --> 00:36:55,464
This is your "good place?"

657
00:36:56,398 --> 00:36:58,900
Combo for three with extra cheese, okay?

658
00:36:59,901 --> 00:37:03,505
Love that decisive ordering.

659
00:37:03,505 --> 00:37:04,639
Do you like beef tripe hotpot?

660
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:07,509
I'd kill for it.

661
00:37:14,783 --> 00:37:15,684
Here you go.

662
00:37:19,254 --> 00:37:21,289
I could've done that.

663
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:24,026
The customer is the king.

664
00:37:25,327 --> 00:37:26,361
What?

665
00:37:27,462 --> 00:37:29,798
Bro, I boosted sales.

666
00:37:30,265 --> 00:37:32,768
Combo for three, beef tripe hotpot,
extra cheese.

667
00:37:33,235 --> 00:37:34,736
Well done, my brother.

668
00:37:39,408 --> 00:37:43,078
Did he just get me to increase sales?

669
00:37:45,747 --> 00:37:47,115
Where are you off to this late?

670
00:37:47,115 --> 00:37:48,884
Part-time job, then picking up Ba Da.

671
00:37:48,884 --> 00:37:50,152
Picking up Ba Da?

672
00:37:50,552 --> 00:37:51,586
Seriously...

673
00:37:52,821 --> 00:37:53,855
Here he is.

674
00:38:03,899 --> 00:38:05,467
Thanks to you, Yi Na's dad

675
00:38:05,467 --> 00:38:08,003
is known as the pants-pooper at work.

676
00:38:08,003 --> 00:38:11,073
Really? I'm sorry.

677
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:15,177
But no one knows that you're Yi Na's dad.

678
00:38:15,177 --> 00:38:17,379
Still, what if they find out?

679
00:38:20,148 --> 00:38:22,317
Are you mad at me?

680
00:38:22,984 --> 00:38:23,952
Don't.

681
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:28,156
Just because I smiled doesn't mean
I forgave you.

682
00:38:28,857 --> 00:38:32,027
The kids are coming home late today.

683
00:38:32,627 --> 00:38:35,330
How about we have some...

684
00:38:36,131 --> 00:38:37,799
fun prayer time together?

685
00:38:39,468 --> 00:38:42,471
You think that'll make me forgive you?

686
00:39:02,758 --> 00:39:04,526
Why are you here?

687
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:06,661
To ask Yi Na a math question.

688
00:39:07,295 --> 00:39:08,263
Yi Na?

689
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:10,732
You mean my sister, Seo Yi Na?

690
00:39:11,166 --> 00:39:12,768
Yeah. What about you?

691
00:39:14,636 --> 00:39:16,571
Me too!

692
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:18,040
You, study math?

693
00:39:19,374 --> 00:39:21,977
Let's go work out. Go on ahead.

694
00:39:23,011 --> 00:39:23,879
Okay.

695
00:39:44,032 --> 00:39:45,267
Are you leaving?

696
00:39:50,238 --> 00:39:54,142
Combo for three, beef tripe hotpot,
extra cheese.

697
00:39:57,346 --> 00:39:58,980
That's 148 dollars.

698
00:39:59,548 --> 00:40:03,118
But for you, 147 dollars.

699
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,555
You're brutal.

700
00:40:12,661 --> 00:40:14,096
The card's maxed out.

701
00:40:14,596 --> 00:40:17,666
Come on, we ate together.
Give me a discount.

702
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:21,336
You invited me. I thought you were paying.

703
00:40:22,137 --> 00:40:23,638
You cheap jerk.

704
00:40:26,708 --> 00:40:27,576
You are right.

705
00:40:28,744 --> 00:40:29,678
I'm cheap.

706
00:40:31,813 --> 00:40:34,583
Student loans, rent,

707
00:40:35,083 --> 00:40:36,451
and my younger brother's tuition fee.

708
00:40:37,219 --> 00:40:40,155
If I weren't cheap, I wouldn't survive.

709
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,467
Me too.

710
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:56,071
You know?

711
00:40:57,873 --> 00:40:59,074
Me too...

712
00:40:59,574 --> 00:41:01,309
What about you, Intern Seo?

713
00:41:03,145 --> 00:41:04,980
Do you know what day it is?

714
00:41:05,414 --> 00:41:06,481
What day?

715
00:41:06,481 --> 00:41:07,449
Today...

716
00:41:08,784 --> 00:41:11,319
is the anniversary of my dad's death.

717
00:41:20,028 --> 00:41:20,962
Then...

718
00:41:21,596 --> 00:41:23,065
You want to pay in installments?

719
00:41:25,667 --> 00:41:26,768
Go Ji Seok.

720
00:41:29,104 --> 00:41:31,006
You win.

721
00:41:31,573 --> 00:41:32,441
Intern Seo!

722
00:41:37,145 --> 00:41:39,147
- Here.
- There?

723
00:41:39,147 --> 00:41:41,083
No, maybe over there?

724
00:41:42,217 --> 00:41:43,719
Seriously...

725
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:45,721
You said you had a memorial to attend.

726
00:41:45,721 --> 00:41:47,823
Where on earth do you live?

727
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,562
This meat looks delicious.

728
00:41:53,562 --> 00:41:56,365
This meat with a drink
with Hyun Chul's, right?

729
00:41:56,365 --> 00:41:57,866
You want that?

730
00:41:58,767 --> 00:41:59,735
Why?

731
00:42:00,769 --> 00:42:02,371
Greasy smell.

732
00:42:02,871 --> 00:42:05,574
Some get a spa and massage

733
00:42:05,574 --> 00:42:08,076
after the memorial,

734
00:42:08,076 --> 00:42:10,412
while others slave away over pancakes.

735
00:42:11,113 --> 00:42:13,882
My sister-in-law is too old for this.

736
00:42:14,316 --> 00:42:16,084
You know what your father said to me?

737
00:42:16,084 --> 00:42:17,786
He said I look older than
my sister-in-law.

738
00:42:17,786 --> 00:42:19,254
That's how hard I've worked.

739
00:42:19,921 --> 00:42:21,289
What are you talking about?

740
00:42:23,258 --> 00:42:26,194
You look like a newborn to me.

741
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:29,631
So pretty, so smart, so sexy.

742
00:42:29,631 --> 00:42:32,634
I've never seen a woman like you.

743
00:42:32,634 --> 00:42:34,403
Funny.

744
00:42:34,569 --> 00:42:38,473
Even when you age,
you'll still be beautiful.

745
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,308
So please don't get upset.

746
00:42:48,684 --> 00:42:50,619
Seriously, where is it?

747
00:42:50,619 --> 00:42:51,586
Are you asleep?

748
00:42:52,354 --> 00:42:53,789
What? Are you sleeping?

749
00:42:54,156 --> 00:42:55,290
Come on.

750
00:42:59,194 --> 00:43:00,429
You must be crazy.

751
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:02,431
Mr. Song?

752
00:43:02,431 --> 00:43:03,598
Let me drive you crazier.

753
00:43:07,669 --> 00:43:09,371
These two are passionate.

754
00:43:15,844 --> 00:43:18,480
What if someone sees us?

755
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,716
Who cares? We're married.

756
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:23,919
This meat would be perfect
with rice wine-sprite.

757
00:43:27,756 --> 00:43:29,491
Okay, I'll go get some.

758
00:43:32,294 --> 00:43:34,796
Honey, I'm off.

759
00:43:34,796 --> 00:43:36,832
Vroom, vroom.

760
00:43:36,832 --> 00:43:37,799
Come on in.

761
00:43:42,337 --> 00:43:43,638
Honey.

762
00:43:43,638 --> 00:43:46,608
No, no.

763
00:43:49,044 --> 00:43:50,212
My back...

764
00:43:50,212 --> 00:43:52,047
- Are you okay??
- Seriously.

765
00:43:52,047 --> 00:43:54,182
You ruined the mood.

766
00:43:54,182 --> 00:43:55,617
Go pray by yourself.

767
00:43:55,617 --> 00:43:56,685
Don't be like that.

768
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:01,289
Chully wants to play with Na Ra.

769
00:44:03,058 --> 00:44:03,859
A little more.

770
00:44:04,292 --> 00:44:06,328
Wants to play. Wants to play more.

771
00:44:06,828 --> 00:44:07,696
Cute.

772
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:11,900
Yi Na has some hidden booze stashed away.

773
00:44:12,167 --> 00:44:13,869
Shall we take that?

774
00:44:13,869 --> 00:44:14,803
I'm in.

775
00:44:30,786 --> 00:44:32,087
Such a masterpiece here?

776
00:44:33,088 --> 00:44:35,757
Should I set the mood a bit?

777
00:44:37,492 --> 00:44:39,194
Dad.

778
00:44:40,095 --> 00:44:41,863
Dad!

779
00:44:42,164 --> 00:44:45,500
Here comes Yi Na, back in dog mode again.

780
00:44:45,667 --> 00:44:47,636
Dad!

781
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,742
Seo Yi Na! When will you stop...

782
00:44:56,144 --> 00:44:56,878
Mr. Seo?

783
00:44:58,780 --> 00:44:59,748
Mr. Go?

784
00:45:00,816 --> 00:45:02,918
What are you doing here?

785
00:45:04,686 --> 00:45:05,754
I live next door.

786
00:45:06,488 --> 00:45:09,891
They asked me to put in a nail...

787
00:45:10,225 --> 00:45:11,193
A nail?

788
00:45:12,527 --> 00:45:13,362
But...

789
00:45:15,464 --> 00:45:17,532
Why are you with Yi Na...

790
00:45:17,532 --> 00:45:19,568
No, with Intern Seo?

791
00:45:20,669 --> 00:45:23,939
She got drunk, so I came to drop her off.

792
00:45:23,939 --> 00:45:26,341
What's taking you so long to get inside?

793
00:45:29,444 --> 00:45:30,379
Mom.

794
00:45:33,749 --> 00:45:34,783
Mom!

795
00:45:36,618 --> 00:45:40,255
Is Intern Seo's mom in such a relationship
with Mr. Seo?

796
00:45:41,289 --> 00:45:42,190
What...

797
00:45:43,725 --> 00:45:45,027
What are you doing here?

798
00:45:45,027 --> 00:45:48,230
I told you to come home early!
Why are you always out so late?

799
00:45:50,699 --> 00:45:52,334
This here is my wife.

800
00:45:52,968 --> 00:45:53,835
Wait, what?

801
00:45:54,202 --> 00:45:57,572
Wasn't she the one kissing
Mr. Song earlier?

802
00:45:58,173 --> 00:46:01,576
(Mr. Seo's wife,
having an affair with Mr. Song?)

803
00:46:08,116 --> 00:46:10,085
You, go on inside first.

804
00:46:11,653 --> 00:46:12,788
I mean...

805
00:46:13,955 --> 00:46:16,291
Seriously, what's going on?

806
00:46:17,826 --> 00:46:19,728
What exactly is happening here?

807
00:46:21,029 --> 00:46:22,264
Hello.

808
00:46:22,264 --> 00:46:25,067
This is Planning Team Two's ace,

809
00:46:25,067 --> 00:46:27,436
Go Ji Seok.

810
00:46:27,436 --> 00:46:30,572
And he is here to drop off Intern Seo.

811
00:46:30,572 --> 00:46:31,373
Yes.

812
00:46:35,711 --> 00:46:37,446
Yes, I...

813
00:46:37,446 --> 00:46:40,382
So you're Mr. Go, right? Yes.

814
00:46:41,316 --> 00:46:43,452
- Let's bring Yi Na in first.
- Yes.

815
00:46:43,452 --> 00:46:44,419
Come in.

816
00:46:48,957 --> 00:46:50,158
What the...

817
00:46:54,062 --> 00:46:55,030
Excuse me.

818
00:46:56,231 --> 00:46:58,734
Didn't Mr. Seo and Mr. Song say

819
00:46:58,734 --> 00:47:00,469
they were in-laws?

820
00:47:01,403 --> 00:47:04,673
So, Mr. Song is having an affair
with his in-law?

821
00:47:04,673 --> 00:47:05,607
Mr. Go.

822
00:47:06,341 --> 00:47:08,310
- Yi Na's room is this way.
- Okay.

823
00:47:15,917 --> 00:47:19,855
Sorry, sorry.
Yi Na's room is really this way.

824
00:47:20,355 --> 00:47:21,223
Okay...

825
00:47:26,595 --> 00:47:27,796
This is...

826
00:47:28,163 --> 00:47:30,532
Just like that, the barracks smell
from eight years ago...

827
00:47:30,532 --> 00:47:34,136
This girl only knows how to clean herself,

828
00:47:34,136 --> 00:47:36,038
not the room.

829
00:47:36,038 --> 00:47:37,839
- Lay her down here.
- Okay.

830
00:47:45,714 --> 00:47:47,783
What do I do about the beef tripe bill?

831
00:47:47,783 --> 00:47:49,518
Should I just tell her now?

832
00:47:49,885 --> 00:47:52,521
Mr. Go, right?

833
00:47:52,521 --> 00:47:53,622
Yes.

834
00:47:53,622 --> 00:47:55,924
It's late, you can go home now.

835
00:47:57,893 --> 00:47:58,627
Actually...

836
00:47:59,795 --> 00:48:02,230
This is beef...

837
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:03,398
Hey, Go Ji Seok.

838
00:48:05,834 --> 00:48:06,935
Where are you going?

839
00:48:07,402 --> 00:48:08,070
Yes?

840
00:48:26,621 --> 00:48:28,724
- You okay?
- Yes.

841
00:48:29,358 --> 00:48:30,959
Hyun Chul, with meat and rice wine...

842
00:48:32,327 --> 00:48:33,295
Mr. Song?

843
00:48:33,562 --> 00:48:35,864
Mr. Go? What are you doing here?

844
00:48:35,864 --> 00:48:36,765
Honey.

845
00:48:38,367 --> 00:48:39,935
You're late today.

846
00:48:40,602 --> 00:48:41,503
Sorry?

847
00:48:42,437 --> 00:48:44,639
Mr. Song is Intern Seo's stepdad?

848
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:46,541
Mr. Go.

849
00:48:47,075 --> 00:48:49,778
See that door? That's the...

850
00:48:49,778 --> 00:48:50,812
bathroom.

851
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:56,351
There's such a thing.

852
00:48:56,952 --> 00:48:58,353
Just for today, call me honey.

853
00:49:05,527 --> 00:49:06,528
Then...

854
00:49:07,529 --> 00:49:10,198
That poop-pants dad is Mr. Song?

855
00:49:10,832 --> 00:49:14,136
Mr. Seo had an affair
with the sister-in-law,

856
00:49:14,136 --> 00:49:16,338
Mr. Song with the sister?

857
00:49:16,972 --> 00:49:20,208
What a messy family this is.

858
00:49:33,989 --> 00:49:36,491
What the... Where am I?

859
00:49:38,593 --> 00:49:40,162
Why am I here?

860
00:49:47,703 --> 00:49:51,106
Why would you tell such a lie
that would be exposed soon?

861
00:49:51,106 --> 00:49:54,943
Can you call Na Ra and ask

862
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:57,312
if Mr. Go went home?

863
00:49:58,347 --> 00:49:59,214
Why should I?

864
00:50:00,015 --> 00:50:01,316
Just this once...

865
00:50:02,417 --> 00:50:04,419
I'll buy you a dishwasher.

866
00:50:04,653 --> 00:50:06,288
That stupid dishwasher again?

867
00:50:07,155 --> 00:50:08,423
This time for real.

868
00:50:08,423 --> 00:50:09,524
For real.

869
00:50:13,628 --> 00:50:14,663
The phone can't be reached...

870
00:50:14,663 --> 00:50:15,964
She's not answering.

871
00:50:16,698 --> 00:50:17,699
She's not picking up?

872
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:19,901
What is going on?

873
00:50:19,901 --> 00:50:22,104
Surprised, right? There was a mix-up.

874
00:50:22,104 --> 00:50:23,205
Just pretend to be my husband for today.

875
00:50:23,205 --> 00:50:24,773
But morally, that's...

876
00:50:24,773 --> 00:50:26,842
Why won't you answer the phone?

877
00:50:27,075 --> 00:50:28,510
What happened to Mr. Go? Did he leave?

878
00:50:28,510 --> 00:50:29,277
Not yet.

879
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:33,615
You haven't sent him off yet?

880
00:50:33,615 --> 00:50:34,583
It's fine.

881
00:50:34,583 --> 00:50:37,586
I told him Jin Woo is Yi Na's dad.

882
00:50:37,586 --> 00:50:39,721
At least the poop story
won't be about you.

883
00:50:39,721 --> 00:50:42,190
So that's what that was about?

884
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:43,358
Pooper?

885
00:50:43,358 --> 00:50:45,260
Okay, that's crossing the line now.

886
00:50:45,694 --> 00:50:46,928
Hey, Mr. Go!

887
00:50:48,463 --> 00:50:49,831
Actually, I'm not Yi Na's...

888
00:50:52,034 --> 00:50:53,068
Mr. Go.

889
00:50:53,068 --> 00:50:54,803
I'm so sorry.

890
00:50:54,803 --> 00:50:56,838
I'll wash your clothes and

891
00:50:56,838 --> 00:50:58,640
send them to the office.

892
00:50:59,741 --> 00:51:01,209
Oh my, what happened to your hand?

893
00:51:02,344 --> 00:51:06,448
Intern Seo almost fell face
into the hot plate.

894
00:51:08,250 --> 00:51:10,385
Oh no, that must've hurt.

895
00:51:13,522 --> 00:51:14,990
How could you be so disloyal?

896
00:51:15,424 --> 00:51:18,026
How am I supposed to show my face
at work now?

897
00:51:18,026 --> 00:51:19,561
Please just cover for me.

898
00:51:19,895 --> 00:51:21,229
Then what about my face?

899
00:51:21,229 --> 00:51:23,398
I have some dignity too, you know.

900
00:51:23,398 --> 00:51:24,833
Mr. Go isn't the type

901
00:51:24,833 --> 00:51:27,903
to run his mouth like you do all the time.

902
00:51:27,903 --> 00:51:31,006
When did I ever run my mouth?

903
00:51:31,006 --> 00:51:33,709
Just go and be honest.

904
00:51:34,843 --> 00:51:37,179
You really want me to be honest?

905
00:51:37,179 --> 00:51:38,113
Yes.

906
00:51:38,113 --> 00:51:40,549
That bicycle you said costs 500 dollars?

907
00:51:40,549 --> 00:51:41,717
It actually costs over 5,000...

908
00:51:43,018 --> 00:51:45,454
How could you do that to me, Hyun Chul?

909
00:51:45,454 --> 00:51:46,788
That mouth of yours...

910
00:51:49,091 --> 00:51:50,659
Unbelievable.

911
00:51:56,698 --> 00:51:57,632
Thank you.

912
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,669
He's totally, 100 percent into Yi Na,
right?

913
00:52:00,936 --> 00:52:03,772
He burned his hand for her.
That's 120 percent.

914
00:52:05,707 --> 00:52:07,876
How old are you this year?

915
00:52:07,876 --> 00:52:09,478
I'm twenty-eight.

916
00:52:09,778 --> 00:52:11,813
Twenty-eight.

917
00:52:11,813 --> 00:52:13,482
I see, twenty-eight...

918
00:52:13,482 --> 00:52:15,684
Rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon,
snake, horse, sheep...

919
00:52:15,684 --> 00:52:17,152
You were born in the year of the tiger.

920
00:52:17,786 --> 00:52:19,988
Yi Na was born in the year of the snake.

921
00:52:19,988 --> 00:52:21,556
You're a perfect match.

922
00:52:21,890 --> 00:52:22,824
What?

923
00:52:32,434 --> 00:52:34,603
Why aren't they sending him home?

924
00:52:35,337 --> 00:52:37,305
Go and send Mr. Go home.

925
00:52:37,305 --> 00:52:39,374
Why should I?

926
00:52:39,374 --> 00:52:41,877
Right now, this is your home, remember?

927
00:52:43,245 --> 00:52:47,916
Oh, right. This is my home right now.

928
00:52:50,252 --> 00:52:51,486
Excuse me. Sorry.

929
00:52:54,589 --> 00:52:56,058
What is he doing?

930
00:52:58,493 --> 00:53:00,562
Mr. Go.

931
00:53:00,562 --> 00:53:03,165
It's late. Why not just sleep here?

932
00:53:03,165 --> 00:53:04,199
Are you out of your mind?

933
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,669
You must be tired.
You should get going now.

934
00:53:07,869 --> 00:53:10,205
Why are you coming from there...

935
00:53:10,405 --> 00:53:11,273
What?

936
00:53:12,908 --> 00:53:17,212
I still haven't nailed that thing yet.

937
00:53:18,113 --> 00:53:21,350
We're still not done talking.

938
00:53:21,350 --> 00:53:22,584
So, honey, please go inside.

939
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:26,788
I mean, Hyun Chul.

940
00:53:29,291 --> 00:53:30,258
Hyun Chul...

941
00:53:31,793 --> 00:53:32,728
Anyways.

942
00:53:33,929 --> 00:53:38,100
So, what did you say your parents do?

943
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:39,701
Oh, they...

944
00:53:39,701 --> 00:53:42,270
They've been running a dry cleaner
for forty years.

945
00:53:43,605 --> 00:53:46,308
Dry cleaner? Not a company?

946
00:53:46,308 --> 00:53:47,142
Yes.

947
00:53:48,243 --> 00:53:50,045
Oh, a dry cleaner.

948
00:53:50,479 --> 00:53:52,481
So they run a dry cleaning shop.

949
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:57,252
Then, do you have siblings?

950
00:53:57,252 --> 00:53:58,720
Are you an only child? Siblings?

951
00:53:59,588 --> 00:54:01,923
Do you live on rent? Lease?

952
00:54:03,859 --> 00:54:05,560
- Mr. Go.
- Yes.

953
00:54:07,863 --> 00:54:10,098
Good. Send him out. Now.

954
00:54:10,098 --> 00:54:12,000
You must stay the night today.

955
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,103
You carried Yi Na all the way here.
You must be tired.

956
00:54:15,103 --> 00:54:16,772
You even hurt your hand.

957
00:54:18,907 --> 00:54:22,010
Song Jin Woo,
are you really trying to start a fight?

958
00:54:22,277 --> 00:54:24,813
But today is the memorial...

959
00:54:25,347 --> 00:54:26,415
Memorial?

960
00:54:26,682 --> 00:54:27,816
What memorial?

961
00:54:28,183 --> 00:54:30,719
It's the anniversary of
Intern Seo's late father...

962
00:54:43,799 --> 00:54:45,200
Oh, right.

963
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,903
The memorial. That's right.

964
00:54:48,537 --> 00:54:51,707
You should head home now.

965
00:54:51,707 --> 00:54:55,277
- We've got lots to do.
- Yes.

966
00:54:56,078 --> 00:54:57,913
Here, wear this on your way out.

967
00:54:57,913 --> 00:55:00,949
Leaving already?
At least finish your juice.

968
00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:04,152
Yeah, it's memorial day. A memorial.

969
00:55:06,088 --> 00:55:08,623
Okay, go on in now.

970
00:55:08,623 --> 00:55:10,659
Too bad you're leaving so soon.

971
00:55:20,569 --> 00:55:23,572
Why? Did you forget something?

972
00:55:23,572 --> 00:55:24,506
Yes.

973
00:55:25,073 --> 00:55:28,043
I just thought it'd be better
to clear this up.

974
00:55:33,248 --> 00:55:34,449
What's this?

975
00:55:34,449 --> 00:55:37,219
This is what Yi Na ate.
I wanted to settle the bill.

976
00:55:37,219 --> 00:55:39,054
Why are you giving that to me?

977
00:55:39,054 --> 00:55:42,057
You're her dad, so you should pay.

978
00:55:42,057 --> 00:55:44,659
Wait, my wallet... What are you...

979
00:55:45,193 --> 00:55:46,428
Here.

980
00:55:46,928 --> 00:55:48,530
Keep the change.

981
00:55:49,064 --> 00:55:51,066
Thank you. See you tomorrow.

982
00:55:51,066 --> 00:55:53,035
All right. Take care.

983
00:55:57,406 --> 00:55:59,474
You took everything!

984
00:55:59,474 --> 00:56:00,676
You're her dad.

985
00:56:07,816 --> 00:56:09,217
Do you know how to ride a bike?

986
00:56:11,353 --> 00:56:12,387
I know how.

987
00:56:13,388 --> 00:56:14,389
I'm jealous.

988
00:56:14,556 --> 00:56:15,757
Was it good?

989
00:56:15,757 --> 00:56:19,861
It had a slightly spicy
and sweet-savory flavor.

990
00:56:19,861 --> 00:56:21,329
Can you handle spicy food?

991
00:56:21,329 --> 00:56:22,230
Yes.

992
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:23,365
That's awesome.

993
00:56:39,948 --> 00:56:41,450
I'm home.

994
00:56:41,450 --> 00:56:43,318
- Hey, you're back?
- You're back?

995
00:56:43,318 --> 00:56:44,286
Did you eat?

996
00:56:44,286 --> 00:56:45,420
Yeah, I did...

997
00:56:49,324 --> 00:56:50,258
But...

998
00:56:50,792 --> 00:56:52,828
I'm a little hungry again.

999
00:56:52,828 --> 00:56:54,563
Can I have some rice?

1000
00:56:54,563 --> 00:56:55,797
Me too.

1001
00:56:55,797 --> 00:56:56,898
Oh, really?

1002
00:56:57,232 --> 00:56:59,668
We brought back some food
from the memorial.

1003
00:57:00,035 --> 00:57:01,837
Want to eat and watch TV together?

1004
00:57:01,837 --> 00:57:04,106
Yeah, sounds great. I'll set the table.

1005
00:57:04,406 --> 00:57:06,141
What's gotten into you, Young Hoon?

1006
00:57:15,617 --> 00:57:17,719
Still, it was a memorial.

1007
00:57:18,153 --> 00:57:20,922
It wouldn't feel right
to just leave like that.

1008
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:25,727
Mr. Go?

1009
00:57:26,461 --> 00:57:28,530
He seemed like a decent guy.

1010
00:57:29,231 --> 00:57:31,166
You can't tell just by looking.

1011
00:57:31,166 --> 00:57:33,635
We should've seen how he is
when he drinks.

1012
00:57:33,969 --> 00:57:35,103
Too bad.

1013
00:57:35,303 --> 00:57:36,204
Right?

1014
00:57:39,307 --> 00:57:40,709
- I'll move this.
- Okay.

1015
00:57:42,644 --> 00:57:43,445
- I'll do it.
- Let me.

1016
00:57:44,179 --> 00:57:44,880
What?

1017
00:57:48,884 --> 00:57:49,918
What are you doing?

1018
00:58:00,228 --> 00:58:01,863
Seriously...

1019
00:58:09,504 --> 00:58:11,406
Hey, I was watching that.

1020
00:58:12,641 --> 00:58:14,609
There's an A-match coming up soon.

1021
00:58:15,777 --> 00:58:17,713
Match or not, go watch that at your place.

1022
00:58:18,213 --> 00:58:19,348
Seriously.

1023
00:58:32,627 --> 00:58:35,364
I just thought it'd be rude
to leave like this.

1024
00:58:35,364 --> 00:58:37,366
So I brought some liquor
before heading out.

1025
00:58:39,801 --> 00:58:42,571
My goodness.

1026
00:58:43,872 --> 00:58:46,008
How thoughtful you are.

1027
00:58:46,408 --> 00:58:48,343
You shouldn't have.

1028
00:58:48,343 --> 00:58:49,378
It's late, you should go now.

1029
00:58:49,378 --> 00:58:53,081
No, no, come in.

1030
00:58:53,081 --> 00:58:54,883
You brought liquor.
I can't just let you go.

1031
00:58:54,883 --> 00:58:57,185
That wouldn't be right.

1032
00:58:57,386 --> 00:59:01,223
Even my late brother-in-law
would've appreciated this.

1033
00:59:03,825 --> 00:59:06,128
So, the memorial hasn't started yet?

1034
00:59:07,429 --> 00:59:09,197
Yeah, we're just about to begin.

1035
00:59:09,197 --> 00:59:10,999
Come help me set the table.

1036
00:59:10,999 --> 00:59:14,436
Everyone, come over here. Move the couch.

1037
00:59:14,436 --> 00:59:15,570
- Come here.
- Us?

1038
00:59:19,241 --> 00:59:21,410
Over here. Push it all against the wall.

1039
00:59:22,644 --> 00:59:23,645
Who's that guy?

1040
00:59:24,246 --> 00:59:25,247
No idea.

1041
00:59:25,247 --> 00:59:26,481
Whose memorial is this?

1042
00:59:26,481 --> 00:59:27,349
Don't know.

1043
00:59:34,623 --> 00:59:37,092
Are we really holding a fake memorial?

1044
00:59:37,559 --> 00:59:38,894
All because of that lie.

1045
00:59:41,229 --> 00:59:44,800
Aren't you putting up
a photo of Intern Seo's father?

1046
00:59:46,935 --> 00:59:48,303
The photo...

1047
00:59:48,704 --> 00:59:51,173
Let's put it up now.

1048
00:59:51,173 --> 00:59:52,407
Ba Da, hand me that.

1049
00:59:55,344 --> 00:59:58,680
All these are public faces.

1050
00:59:58,847 --> 00:59:59,681
Honey?

1051
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:03,285
W, Who...?

1052
01:00:04,286 --> 01:00:05,954
Oh, hey, honey...

1053
01:00:12,894 --> 01:00:14,229
My ex-brother-in-law.

1054
01:00:18,667 --> 01:00:20,068
What the hell...?

1055
01:00:23,305 --> 01:00:25,007
That's my grandpa...

1056
01:00:42,791 --> 01:00:43,959
Whose memorial is this again...?

1057
01:00:43,959 --> 01:00:44,960
You kids!

1058
01:00:50,699 --> 01:00:54,469
How could you forget a day like today?

1059
01:00:57,406 --> 01:00:59,474
Everyone, come inside.

1060
01:01:08,183 --> 01:01:09,718
Kids these days...

1061
01:01:10,552 --> 01:01:12,354
They don't care about memorials...

1062
01:01:12,354 --> 01:01:14,189
No respect for ancestors.

1063
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:16,858
Exactly. They need to be scolded.

1064
01:01:22,597 --> 01:01:24,900
Here, take this. Here you go.

1065
01:01:27,602 --> 01:01:29,171
- Okay.
- Dad, but...

1066
01:01:29,338 --> 01:01:31,406
Don't ask why.
You saw that man outside, right?

1067
01:01:31,907 --> 01:01:34,976
Until that man leaves, none of you

1068
01:01:34,976 --> 01:01:36,545
say a single word.

1069
01:01:36,545 --> 01:01:37,579
But Grandpa...

1070
01:01:37,813 --> 01:01:41,516
No, just don't open your mouth, okay?

1071
01:01:42,084 --> 01:01:43,518
Close.

1072
01:01:44,052 --> 01:01:46,121
Starting now, okay?

1073
01:01:49,391 --> 01:01:51,927
Still, don't you think
this is going too far?

1074
01:01:53,061 --> 01:01:55,464
Dad's alive and well
with his eyes wide open.

1075
01:01:56,565 --> 01:01:57,566
So what now?

1076
01:01:59,101 --> 01:02:00,802
What are you going to do at this point?

1077
01:02:07,309 --> 01:02:09,111
Don't you smell something burning?

1078
01:02:09,111 --> 01:02:10,145
Burning...

1079
01:02:10,912 --> 01:02:14,249
Oh my, I was simmering braised ribs.
I totally forgot!

1080
01:02:14,249 --> 01:02:16,084
- Na Ra!
- I'll go get it...

1081
01:02:23,959 --> 01:02:26,428
Oh, thanks.
Make sure to turn it off properly.

1082
01:02:26,595 --> 01:02:29,731
Mr. Go, just pour one
and head out quickly.

1083
01:02:30,098 --> 01:02:33,368
Why are you all so eager to kick him out?

1084
01:02:33,368 --> 01:02:36,405
Why, what, are you hiding something?

1085
01:02:39,508 --> 01:02:41,710
Come on, me? What would I even...

1086
01:02:44,046 --> 01:02:45,480
Not at all!

1087
01:02:46,581 --> 01:02:48,183
Chopin?

1088
01:02:49,685 --> 01:02:52,254
There's a whole bunch of stuff
written on the back.

1089
01:02:52,254 --> 01:02:52,988
It says...

1090
01:02:59,761 --> 01:03:01,830
Kang, what are you doing?

1091
01:03:01,830 --> 01:03:04,666
There's no trivet, right?
That's why, right?

1092
01:03:06,168 --> 01:03:07,636
- Oh my.
- What the...

1093
01:03:10,205 --> 01:03:11,006
Seriously.

1094
01:03:14,576 --> 01:03:15,711
Kang!

1095
01:03:17,779 --> 01:03:19,114
Wait for me!

1096
01:03:19,114 --> 01:03:20,582
My shoes...

1097
01:03:20,582 --> 01:03:23,151
Wait for me!

1098
01:03:23,151 --> 01:03:24,986
I want to watch Pocketping too...

1099
01:03:27,556 --> 01:03:28,557
What is this?

1100
01:03:29,624 --> 01:03:31,460
I guess I should get going...

1101
01:03:31,793 --> 01:03:32,961
Hey, Go Ji Seok.

1102
01:03:33,528 --> 01:03:35,097
Where do you think you're going?

1103
01:03:35,630 --> 01:03:38,233
Have one more drink with me before you go.

1104
01:03:39,568 --> 01:03:41,236
Give that back.

1105
01:03:43,372 --> 01:03:44,506
You punk!

1106
01:03:45,540 --> 01:03:47,843
How dare you mess with your noble sister?

1107
01:03:47,843 --> 01:03:49,378
Seriously...

1108
01:03:49,878 --> 01:03:50,946
It's me, Young Hoon.

1109
01:03:50,946 --> 01:03:51,980
What's going on?

1110
01:03:54,449 --> 01:03:55,851
Actually, I...

1111
01:03:56,284 --> 01:03:57,219
I...

1112
01:04:10,165 --> 01:04:11,199
What are you staring at?

1113
01:04:16,405 --> 01:04:18,340
What's up with everyone today?

1114
01:04:23,779 --> 01:04:25,213
What's up with her?

1115
01:04:25,847 --> 01:04:26,948
Dad

1116
01:04:28,050 --> 01:04:29,217
Dad!

1117
01:04:31,053 --> 01:04:32,554
The kids...

1118
01:04:32,554 --> 01:04:34,189
Whenever it's their dad's memorial day,

1119
01:04:34,189 --> 01:04:36,591
they completely lose control like this.

1120
01:04:36,591 --> 01:04:37,726
Poor things.

1121
01:04:37,726 --> 01:04:38,994
Won Hee, give me a hand.

1122
01:04:40,095 --> 01:04:41,463
Come here.

1123
01:04:41,463 --> 01:04:43,765
You're not going anywhere.

1124
01:04:47,936 --> 01:04:48,870
This is fun.

1125
01:04:50,439 --> 01:04:51,973
Lie down, quick. Lie down!

1126
01:04:55,143 --> 01:04:58,613
She's not leaving this room, never.

1127
01:04:58,613 --> 01:05:00,549
- I got this.
- Right.

1128
01:05:03,285 --> 01:05:04,820
Go Ji Seok.

1129
01:05:09,124 --> 01:05:10,726
Yi Na's biological father,

1130
01:05:10,726 --> 01:05:13,562
my ex-brother-in-law loved drinking.

1131
01:05:13,562 --> 01:05:16,131
He would've loved that you brought this.

1132
01:05:16,131 --> 01:05:17,866
- Have a glass.
- Yes.

1133
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:20,268
Memorial toast as well?

1134
01:05:23,305 --> 01:05:25,340
Isn't this going a bit too far?

1135
01:05:25,674 --> 01:05:29,277
Whatever. There's no turning back now.

1136
01:05:31,146 --> 01:05:34,349
But how exactly did
Intern Seo's dad pass away?

1137
01:05:34,850 --> 01:05:36,718
- What?
- She was crying

1138
01:05:37,152 --> 01:05:39,287
her heart out earlier.

1139
01:05:42,691 --> 01:05:45,961
How did he die again?

1140
01:05:45,961 --> 01:05:49,064
It was... while fishing?

1141
01:05:49,664 --> 01:05:53,135
Right, my dad...

1142
01:05:53,135 --> 01:05:57,039
I mean, her dad loved fishing.

1143
01:05:57,039 --> 01:05:58,206
Yeah.

1144
01:05:58,740 --> 01:06:01,443
He slipped

1145
01:06:01,443 --> 01:06:03,578
while trying to catch a giant grouper.

1146
01:06:06,715 --> 01:06:10,185
All for some fancy fish...

1147
01:06:12,187 --> 01:06:15,357
Honey...

1148
01:06:16,291 --> 01:06:20,495
All that... just for a stupid fish.

1149
01:06:20,929 --> 01:06:21,797
Broth...

1150
01:06:21,797 --> 01:06:25,934
No, brother-in-law... That dang fish...

1151
01:06:27,235 --> 01:06:28,904
Such a heartbreaking story...

1152
01:06:28,904 --> 01:06:30,505
Our poor ex-brother-in-law...

1153
01:06:32,841 --> 01:06:34,076
Why is the door open?

1154
01:06:35,344 --> 01:06:38,580
Hey! I caught a giant grouper today!

1155
01:06:49,624 --> 01:06:51,259
I'm out.

1156
01:06:51,626 --> 01:06:54,429
Why is Dad even here? What do we do?

1157
01:06:54,863 --> 01:06:57,265
Act like you didn't see him.

1158
01:06:57,866 --> 01:07:00,502
Hey! I caught a monster fish!

1159
01:07:02,404 --> 01:07:03,605
Oh, that one!

1160
01:07:03,605 --> 01:07:06,008
That was the time
I caught a 30-centimeter-long grouper.

1161
01:07:06,475 --> 01:07:08,577
This one's even bigger!

1162
01:07:08,577 --> 01:07:09,811
A real whopper!

1163
01:07:09,811 --> 01:07:13,415
It's filling the entire cooler down there!

1164
01:07:15,951 --> 01:07:17,619
You kids, seriously.

1165
01:07:18,020 --> 01:07:20,922
I came, and not a single one of you
greets me.

1166
01:07:21,957 --> 01:07:24,059
Come on, everyone, say hello now.

1167
01:07:27,295 --> 01:07:30,465
- Oh, honey.
- Oh, our dear brother-in-law.

1168
01:07:30,465 --> 01:07:32,300
Brother-in-law.

1169
01:07:35,871 --> 01:07:38,306
See? I told you we should've sent
Mr. Go home earlier.

1170
01:07:38,306 --> 01:07:40,342
Is this really the time to argue
about whose fault it is?

1171
01:07:40,342 --> 01:07:41,710
What are we going to do now.

1172
01:07:46,448 --> 01:07:49,384
You brats, an elder is speaking.

1173
01:07:49,618 --> 01:07:50,852
Why aren't you standing up?

1174
01:07:53,255 --> 01:07:55,857
The fish will die. Let's go grab it now.

1175
01:07:56,391 --> 01:07:58,326
The deceased...

1176
01:08:00,328 --> 01:08:02,130
The deceased has arrived.

1177
01:08:02,130 --> 01:08:02,998
Hey.

1178
01:08:03,665 --> 01:08:05,100
Who are you?

1179
01:08:06,034 --> 01:08:07,336
I... I am...

1180
01:08:10,639 --> 01:08:12,808
Hey, you come with me too.

1181
01:08:14,109 --> 01:08:15,444
Bring the fish with you.

1182
01:08:16,111 --> 01:08:17,312
Come on, help me carry this.

1183
01:08:21,516 --> 01:08:23,318
What's wrong with this guy?

1184
01:09:00,288 --> 01:09:03,592
(Villains Everywhere)

1185
01:09:03,592 --> 01:09:05,761
I won a humanoid robot?

1186
01:09:05,761 --> 01:09:07,763
It looks so real.

1187
01:09:07,763 --> 01:09:08,764
Nice to meet you, master.

1188
01:09:08,764 --> 01:09:10,632
What kind of robot has these features?

1189
01:09:10,632 --> 01:09:13,301
I'm a robot beyond what you can imagine.

1190
01:09:13,301 --> 01:09:16,338
Since you came, nothing's gone right...

1191
01:09:16,738 --> 01:09:18,440
Do I look like a joke to you?

1192
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:19,441
What are you doing?

1193
01:09:19,441 --> 01:09:21,443
- Na Ra.
- Kang Woo, are you okay?

1194
01:09:21,443 --> 01:09:23,378
Why does my stomach feel so upset?

1195
01:09:23,979 --> 01:09:26,515
Hyun Chul has colorectal cancer.

1196
01:09:28,316 --> 01:09:31,153
My life is pitiful enough.

1197
01:09:31,153 --> 01:09:32,354
This has the best anti-cancer effects.

1198
01:09:32,354 --> 01:09:34,890
Until we find the golden
long-living mushroom...

1199
01:09:34,890 --> 01:09:35,691
Here it is.

1200
01:09:35,691 --> 01:09:36,391
There...

1201
01:09:41,496 --> 01:09:43,498
