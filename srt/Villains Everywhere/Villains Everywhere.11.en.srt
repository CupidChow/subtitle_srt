1
00:00:00,701 --> 00:00:04,171
(Goodbye, My Na Ra)

2
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:06,206
Honey, what are you doing?

3
00:00:06,206 --> 00:00:09,209
Do you want to go
to that newly opened IKEO?

4
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:10,878
- IKEO?
- Yes.

5
00:00:10,878 --> 00:00:12,546
I want to go too,

6
00:00:12,546 --> 00:00:15,349
but I have to do the laundry
and clean the bathroom.

7
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:16,817
There's so much to do.

8
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:19,219
Where did everyone else go,
leaving it all to you?

9
00:00:19,987 --> 00:00:23,590
Chully went to work even on the weekend
to feed the family,

10
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,360
and the kids don't stay at home either.

11
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:39,039
Seriously.

12
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:41,642
That darn tendinitis.

13
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:45,179
Is there a robot or something...

14
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:47,781
to replace this tiring housekeeping?

15
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:50,484
You know, Samsin recently...

16
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:54,555
developed a humanoid housekeeper robot.

17
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:58,225
The one that looks just like a human?

18
00:00:58,458 --> 00:00:59,459
Look.

19
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:00,894
Isn't it super handsome?

20
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:04,665
Actually, I signed up for this.

21
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:05,732
Really?

22
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,901
They said they'd only give one out...

23
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,736
for testing before the launch.

24
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,338
I hope I get it.

25
00:01:11,338 --> 00:01:12,739
That would be awesome.

26
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:19,079
Okay.

27
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:20,247
Seriously.

28
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:22,783
You're making a bad move
after thinking so long.

29
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:24,151
Just make it quick.

30
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:26,286
If I win this round,

31
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:28,388
you'll treat lunch for a week, right?

32
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:31,091
Okay, just make your move quickly.

33
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,093
Good.

34
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:36,430
Not the cafeteria,
but proper dining out.

35
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,398
Fine.

36
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:40,067
(My Na Ra)

37
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:46,440
Hello, honey.

38
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:48,175
Why?

39
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:50,177
Chully.

40
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:51,945
Where are you? At work?

41
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,082
Yes, I'm still at work.

42
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,651
I haven't finished yet.

43
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:02,189
Mr. Go, what is this report?

44
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:04,024
Rewrite it, again.

45
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:07,494
But honey, what's up?

46
00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:12,766
It's just...
that my wrist is really aching.

47
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:16,270
I have to wash the blankets
and the curtains today.

48
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,005
There's a lot to do.

49
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:21,008
But the kids aren't home,
and Yu Jin isn't answering the phone.

50
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:23,043
The time is up,
how about the nine-hole...

51
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,182
What?

52
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:30,684
Nine-hole?

53
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:33,854
Honey, it's not like that...

54
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:35,722
You said you were going to the office
on the weekend,

55
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:38,659
so I made you breakfast, ironed your suit,
and polished your shoes.

56
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,127
But what? Nine-hole?

57
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:42,963
What should we do?

58
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:47,334
We're dead when we go home.

59
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:49,636
Then, Hyun Chul.

60
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:52,706
How about one last nine-hole
before we die?

61
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:55,209
Shall we?

62
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:04,251
But Young Hoon,
you're totally into Korean food.

63
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:06,153
You sure you can handle this part-time
carbonara eating show?

64
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:09,456
What do you mean?
Carbonara is totally my staple.

65
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:11,358
I'm totally into Western food.

66
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,063
Kang, how about you?
You have a small appetite.

67
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:18,165
You have to keep eating while it's live.

68
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:20,100
I have a big appetite.

69
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,702
As big and long as my arms and legs.

70
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,104
Koo Won Hee?

71
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:25,439
Yes.

72
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:26,807
You came as a shampoo model, right?
This way.

73
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:28,308
What? No.

74
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:30,744
We came for the carbonara eating show.

75
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:32,346
Didn't you get the message?

76
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,681
That got postponed,
so we decided to do the shampoo first.

77
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:35,816
What?

78
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:38,185
(On Air)

79
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:42,256
Are you worried
about losing hair and thinning?

80
00:03:42,256 --> 00:03:44,258
This shampoo will protect...

81
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:46,393
every precious strand of yours.

82
00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:48,061
It's a newly launched product.

83
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,230
They're so confident
in their product that,

84
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,765
for the first time
in the shampoo product history,

85
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:54,468
we've prepared a hair-washing
demonstration in the studio.

86
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:56,403
Curious? Let me show you right away.

87
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:59,640
I have a sensitive scalp,
so I can't use just anything.

88
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:02,409
My hair looks good today.

89
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:05,479
Are you okay with washing your hair?

90
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:07,648
Yes.

91
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:09,783
I'm okay.

92
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,854
Cue.

93
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:16,523
Conditioner, treatment, or whatever.

94
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:18,759
There are so many things to use
after shampoo.

95
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:22,162
But with this shampoo,
you don't need that.

96
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:23,697
With just this shampoo,
which I'll show you now,

97
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:27,167
you can maintain silky hair.

98
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:28,802
Come on in.

99
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:39,713
Everyone, can you see this volume?

100
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:41,715
Even though they only used shampoo,

101
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:44,451
it has so much volume.

102
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:46,620
Isn't it amazing?

103
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,156
Our three models tried it themselves.

104
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:50,224
How was it?

105
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,526
It was...

106
00:04:55,062 --> 00:04:57,397
This is super soft...

107
00:04:58,398 --> 00:04:59,733
and the volume is awesome.

108
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,038
Even with just a blow-dry,

109
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,307
the volume stays alive, which is great.

110
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,910
It's so soft
that I can feel each strand of hair.

111
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,045
It's really nice.

112
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:21,955
Just wait until he gets home.

113
00:05:22,623 --> 00:05:24,992
He lied and went to play golf?

114
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:26,360
Seriously.

115
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,462
I might turn him into a side dish.

116
00:05:46,914 --> 00:05:47,848
My phone.

117
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:52,019
My wrist.

118
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:56,623
Hello?

119
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,561
Yes, this is Oh Na Ra.

120
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,031
What?

121
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:08,702
I won the humanoid robot?

122
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,172
My goodness.

123
00:06:17,311 --> 00:06:19,179
It really looks like a human.

124
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:24,751
Look at its sharp nose.

125
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:36,897
Nice to meet you, master.

126
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:40,267
I am the humanoid robot here
to assist with your household chores.

127
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:41,735
I'm HK25.

128
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,439
Yes, hello.

129
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:47,341
I mean, hi.

130
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,576
Master, what can I assist you with?

131
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:51,211
Master?

132
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:53,614
I got goosebumps.

133
00:06:53,614 --> 00:06:55,082
That's a little cringe.

134
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:57,518
If the title makes you uncomfortable,
should I call you differently?

135
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:00,020
What else is there?

136
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:02,523
Just call me Na Ra.

137
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,825
Nice to meet you.

138
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,226
My Na Ra.

139
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,866
Why are there so many modes?

140
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:14,601
Historical drama mode?

141
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:16,103
Cutesy guy mode?

142
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,772
Sexy guy mode? Tough guy mode?

143
00:07:19,173 --> 00:07:20,207
Idol mode?

144
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:22,643
Then...

145
00:07:24,178 --> 00:07:25,379
Historical drama mode.

146
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:37,024
Madam, leave the cleaning to me.

147
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:37,925
You...

148
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:41,094
just sit here and rest.

149
00:07:41,662 --> 00:07:42,996
That's really funny.

150
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:44,565
Wait.

151
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,769
Yes, Na Ra, what can I help you with?

152
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:50,137
You're good.

153
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:52,873
Cutesy guy mode.

154
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:56,476
Sexy guy mode.

155
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:02,216
Seriously.

156
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:05,652
It's so relaxing and nice.

157
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:12,259
I washed the blankets.

158
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:14,828
Now I will start mopping the floor.

159
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,497
No, you should rest too.

160
00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:18,932
I'm okay.

161
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:19,833
What?

162
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:25,405
He's working really hard.

163
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:29,943
Hey...

164
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:32,579
Robot.

165
00:08:34,882 --> 00:08:37,084
Yes, Na Ra, do you need anything?

166
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:40,354
I don't know what to call you.

167
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:42,789
I'm the humanoid robot HK25.

168
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:44,091
Not that.

169
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:47,194
Like a name
that you and I can call each other.

170
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:50,063
Name?

171
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:52,699
Yes, I'm Na Ra, and you...

172
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,402
What should I call you?

173
00:08:57,171 --> 00:08:58,038
Right.

174
00:08:58,438 --> 00:09:00,107
I'll call you Kang Woo.

175
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:01,508
Kang Woo.

176
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:03,110
How is it?

177
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:05,145
Kang Woo.

178
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:08,048
It's a really nice name.
I really like it.

179
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,350
Really? That's a relief.

180
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:12,352
Actually,

181
00:09:12,853 --> 00:09:15,222
it's the name of my first love
in high school.

182
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,724
- First love?
- Yes.

183
00:09:18,926 --> 00:09:20,661
He was the president
of the waltz club.

184
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:24,364
Now that I think about it,
you kind of resemble him.

185
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:28,569
It reminds me of those times.

186
00:09:34,508 --> 00:09:35,576
This music...

187
00:09:41,048 --> 00:09:41,982
Shall we dance?

188
00:09:42,482 --> 00:09:43,417
Really?

189
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:53,493
My goodness.

190
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:55,429
Right, let's do it.

191
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:03,570
You're good at this.

192
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:07,074
But...

193
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:11,445
what am I doing,
stopping the mopping to do this?

194
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:12,746
Don't worry.

195
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:15,349
I'm still mopping right now.

196
00:10:15,349 --> 00:10:16,183
What?

197
00:10:20,354 --> 00:10:23,423
What kind of robot
has all these functions?

198
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:26,393
Because I'm a robot
beyond your imagination.

199
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:42,876
Na Ra, your heart is beating.

200
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:45,078
Something I don't have.

201
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:01,962
What?

202
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:03,297
Hey, Kang Woo.

203
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:05,832
What's wrong?
Why is your face so red?

204
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,134
Did you overheat
from working so hard?

205
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:13,407
Your ears are red, your neck is red,
your eyes are red too.

206
00:11:13,407 --> 00:11:14,341
I need to cool you down.

207
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:21,982
Oh Na Ra.

208
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:26,920
You finally crawled in?

209
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:28,288
Why?

210
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:31,525
Did you play not just nine holes
but 99 holes?

211
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:33,560
This bastard.

212
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,461
Who are you?

213
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:38,665
Who are you to be like this
with my woman?

214
00:11:40,501 --> 00:11:41,502
You're here, Hyun Chul.

215
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:43,370
My wrist.

216
00:11:45,506 --> 00:11:48,208
But how does this guy know my name?

217
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,443
I'm the housekeeper robot
Kang Woo...

218
00:11:49,443 --> 00:11:51,178
starting work here today.

219
00:11:52,446 --> 00:11:53,313
Nice to meet you, Hyun Chul.

220
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,082
Housekeeper robot?

221
00:11:55,449 --> 00:11:56,884
I ordered it.

222
00:11:57,251 --> 00:11:59,653
Why? Didn't you tell me
to do whatever I want?

223
00:12:00,754 --> 00:12:02,756
Yes, nice to meet you.

224
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:03,724
Kang Woo.

225
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:05,292
Tough guy mode.

226
00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:06,159
Yes, Na Ra.

227
00:12:21,175 --> 00:12:23,143
Australopicus, he said, picus.

228
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:30,751
You even fold the laundry so well.

229
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,154
You're so lucky.

230
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:35,822
I am lucky.

231
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,658
So jealous.

232
00:12:37,658 --> 00:12:39,393
What's there to be jealous of?

233
00:12:39,393 --> 00:12:41,228
You have Jin Woo, remember?

234
00:12:47,034 --> 00:12:47,868
Turbo mode.

235
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:50,971
- Cutesy mode.
- Cutesy mode.

236
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,007
But I'm still jealous.

237
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:55,709
What's wrong with this? Is it broken?

238
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:59,046
That can't be.

239
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,182
If Auntie's TV is also broken,

240
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:04,251
where will I watch TV now?

241
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:05,319
Hey, Ba Da.

242
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:08,322
Machines just need to be turned off
and on once.

243
00:13:12,326 --> 00:13:12,926
What?

244
00:13:14,695 --> 00:13:17,030
Move aside. You just have to...

245
00:13:18,065 --> 00:13:20,100
- Hey.
- hit the machine.

246
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,402
Hey, don't break it.

247
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:23,937
Let me take a look.

248
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:25,205
What?

249
00:13:26,607 --> 00:13:29,042
The current TV software version is old.

250
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:31,278
It appears to have caused a system crash.

251
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:33,046
If updated to the latest version,

252
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:37,451
there is a 97.8% chance
it will function normally.

253
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:41,555
How do you update
when the TV doesn't even turn on?

254
00:13:41,555 --> 00:13:42,322
Exactly.

255
00:13:42,756 --> 00:13:43,590
Update?

256
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:44,725
Just leave it.

257
00:13:44,725 --> 00:13:46,793
I'll call for service tomorrow.

258
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:48,829
Using my system,

259
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:50,564
I'll directly transmit the firmware.

260
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:51,932
Update.

261
00:13:51,932 --> 00:13:54,168
(System update in progress)

262
00:13:55,402 --> 00:13:56,637
Update in progress.

263
00:13:56,637 --> 00:13:58,639
(System update in progress)

264
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,074
What?

265
00:14:05,112 --> 00:14:07,915
Kang Woo, you had such abilities?

266
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:18,325
Kang Woo.

267
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:20,460
What's this? Why is it like this?

268
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:23,030
Kang Woo, did you switch it?

269
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:26,500
I switched it
to Na Ra's favorite drama channel.

270
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:32,606
Kang Woo hits all my preferences.

271
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:39,112
Seriously.

272
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:42,082
Even if I made some mistakes,

273
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:45,085
why would you suddenly buy something
that costs so much?

274
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:48,522
And "Kang Woo?"

275
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:51,391
Why use such a name
that sounds like a weasel?

276
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:06,573
Do you need anything, Na Ra?

277
00:15:07,474 --> 00:15:08,075
What?

278
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:11,512
No, I just can't sleep.

279
00:15:17,551 --> 00:15:20,120
Chamomile tea
is good for insomnia, Na Ra.

280
00:15:20,821 --> 00:15:22,055
Thanks.

281
00:15:24,825 --> 00:15:26,426
Be careful, it's hot.

282
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:40,807
How can someone change like that?

283
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:43,844
Who changed, Na Ra?

284
00:15:44,411 --> 00:15:46,113
Chully, my husband.

285
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:50,784
He used to treat me
like gold and jade in the past.

286
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:52,953
Did he?

287
00:15:59,693 --> 00:16:01,695
The thing flowing down
your cheek is tears...

288
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:04,364
Is it tears, Na Ra?

289
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,534
I'm being silly, why am I crying?

290
00:16:13,073 --> 00:16:14,107
Are you okay?

291
00:16:14,942 --> 00:16:17,744
I'm okay.

292
00:16:17,744 --> 00:16:19,379
I guess I was a bit upset.

293
00:16:20,714 --> 00:16:21,882
Upset.

294
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:26,386
I will never make you upset, Na Ra.

295
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,472
- Hyun Chul.
- What?

296
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:47,641
Just go now.

297
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:50,644
You said there's a lot of work
since you're a newbie.

298
00:16:52,446 --> 00:16:53,914
No matter how much work there is,

299
00:16:53,914 --> 00:16:56,416
nothing is more important
than your appendectomy...

300
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,318
to me.

301
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:00,220
Hyun Chul.

302
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:03,257
I do feel touched,

303
00:17:03,257 --> 00:17:05,692
but my gas is about to explode now.

304
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:08,161
Just go, please.

305
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,765
You cut all my nails.

306
00:17:11,765 --> 00:17:13,667
Just go now.

307
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:16,170
- What are you saying?
- What?

308
00:17:16,637 --> 00:17:18,138
I should cut your toenails too.

309
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:30,217
It's a fart.

310
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:32,152
What are you doing?

311
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:34,021
Doctor!

312
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:39,860
Na Ra farted.

313
00:17:40,594 --> 00:17:44,598
She let out a satisfying fart.

314
00:17:44,598 --> 00:17:47,301
Hurry, quickly.

315
00:17:47,301 --> 00:17:48,569
Stop it.

316
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:53,340
My goodness.
Na Ra, you can fart so well.

317
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,042
Why did you make me anxious?

318
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:00,948
Good job, I'm proud of you.

319
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:03,417
Great job, Na Ra.

320
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:04,351
Stop it.

321
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:18,866
And one slice of cucumber.

322
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,168
Wait.

323
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:24,605
Na Ra doesn't like cucumbers.

324
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:25,939
That was close.

325
00:18:30,911 --> 00:18:34,948
Let me see,
Na Ra's favorite hazelnut coffee...

326
00:18:54,067 --> 00:18:57,037
Honey, I made this for you.

327
00:18:57,037 --> 00:18:59,373
I made a cheese sandwich.

328
00:18:59,373 --> 00:19:00,407
Do you want to try it?

329
00:19:01,275 --> 00:19:02,209
No, thanks.

330
00:19:02,209 --> 00:19:04,878
Why? Just try a little.

331
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,216
I also brewed some coffee
with expensive beans.

332
00:19:09,216 --> 00:19:10,384
Try it.

333
00:19:12,085 --> 00:19:15,289
What's with the fuss?

334
00:19:16,056 --> 00:19:18,091
Here you go.

335
00:19:21,395 --> 00:19:22,396
What did you put in it?

336
00:19:24,965 --> 00:19:26,099
What?

337
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:27,801
You know I don't eat cucumbers.

338
00:19:27,801 --> 00:19:29,436
Why is this in here...

339
00:19:29,436 --> 00:19:30,470
You forgot, didn't you?

340
00:19:31,305 --> 00:19:33,473
Soon you'll forget your wife too.

341
00:19:33,473 --> 00:19:35,709
No, I didn't put it in, really.

342
00:19:35,709 --> 00:19:37,177
Stop lying.

343
00:19:37,578 --> 00:19:38,412
That's not it...

344
00:19:38,412 --> 00:19:39,346
Seriously.

345
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,088
I prepared the pumpkin soup...

346
00:19:48,088 --> 00:19:50,524
and an avocado sandwich
that you like, Na Ra.

347
00:19:51,825 --> 00:19:52,759
Really?

348
00:19:55,896 --> 00:19:58,065
Thank you.

349
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:05,105
I wish you were my husband.

350
00:20:05,806 --> 00:20:09,042
How do you know my mind so well,

351
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:10,310
as if you read everything
in my mind?

352
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:14,047
I want to know everything
about you, Na Ra.

353
00:20:14,481 --> 00:20:16,483
Thank you for the food.

354
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:20,521
It's too big.

355
00:20:21,755 --> 00:20:23,090
You little.

356
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:25,158
Did you just laugh at me?

357
00:20:25,158 --> 00:20:27,027
I naturally have a smiling face,
Hyun Chul.

358
00:20:27,027 --> 00:20:29,296
Why does a robot dare to talk back...

359
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,131
It's you, right?

360
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:34,401
I don't know what you're talking about,
Hyun Chul.

361
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:36,036
You put it in, right? That cucumber.

362
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:39,606
You're the one who put the cucumber
in Na Ra's cheese sandwich!

363
00:20:39,606 --> 00:20:40,541
What?

364
00:20:40,774 --> 00:20:42,743
Why are you accusing an innocent person?

365
00:20:42,743 --> 00:20:44,912
How is this a person?
It's a tin can robot.

366
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:46,113
A tin can?

367
00:20:46,113 --> 00:20:48,282
Kang Woo, don't listen to that.

368
00:20:48,282 --> 00:20:50,617
Kang Woo,
you're not a tin can robot.

369
00:20:50,617 --> 00:20:51,518
Seriously.

370
00:20:53,153 --> 00:20:56,156
Kang Woo, could you hang the laundry
on the veranda?

371
00:20:56,957 --> 00:20:57,925
Yes, Na Ra.

372
00:20:58,792 --> 00:20:59,760
Thank you.

373
00:21:04,364 --> 00:21:05,699
Did you see that?

374
00:21:11,505 --> 00:21:12,840
That little...

375
00:21:16,343 --> 00:21:17,211
Hey.

376
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:18,879
What?

377
00:21:20,781 --> 00:21:23,851
What? Did you just talk back to me?

378
00:21:23,851 --> 00:21:25,786
Yes, I'm in informal mode.

379
00:21:25,786 --> 00:21:27,688
Why are you changing modes
on your own?

380
00:21:27,688 --> 00:21:28,522
Because I want to.

381
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:32,960
That tin can,
how dare you to a person...

382
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,862
If you're a person, act like one.

383
00:21:34,862 --> 00:21:36,096
Na Ra told me.

384
00:21:36,096 --> 00:21:37,431
That you're less of a person.

385
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:43,670
She said she wished I were her husband
instead of a man like you.

386
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:12,432
I've been weird lately, right?

387
00:22:13,767 --> 00:22:15,435
What's wrong with you?

388
00:22:16,603 --> 00:22:20,073
I'm really reflecting on myself a lot.

389
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:23,343
Honey.

390
00:22:24,745 --> 00:22:27,814
I dressed up a bit today,
want to see?

391
00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:37,524
What's up with you?

392
00:22:38,225 --> 00:22:41,028
I won't let you sleep tonight.

393
00:22:45,098 --> 00:22:48,936
Na Ra, I made green onion kimchi,
would you try it?

394
00:22:48,936 --> 00:22:50,437
You made green onion kimchi?

395
00:22:50,437 --> 00:22:53,240
How proud of you.

396
00:22:57,044 --> 00:22:58,912
We were almost there.

397
00:22:58,912 --> 00:23:00,280
That tin can bastard.

398
00:23:06,019 --> 00:23:06,954
Hey, tin can.

399
00:23:08,422 --> 00:23:09,223
Come here.

400
00:23:10,424 --> 00:23:11,325
Sit there.

401
00:23:14,795 --> 00:23:17,331
I feel like I've been too...

402
00:23:20,133 --> 00:23:22,002
indifferent to you.

403
00:23:22,669 --> 00:23:24,004
So here's a drink to reconcile.

404
00:23:25,973 --> 00:23:27,875
Wait.

405
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:31,912
You're not a human,
so you can't drink this, right?

406
00:23:31,912 --> 00:23:33,580
My goodness.

407
00:23:33,881 --> 00:23:36,083
Why can't I drink it?
I can drink it too.

408
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:37,651
Really?

409
00:23:38,151 --> 00:23:38,852
Really?

410
00:23:39,253 --> 00:23:41,388
Then, cheers.

411
00:23:59,206 --> 00:24:01,375
Bottoms up.

412
00:24:14,188 --> 00:24:15,088
Bottoms up.

413
00:24:21,061 --> 00:24:21,995
I mean...

414
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:25,532
for a robot,

415
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,436
why aren't you getting drunk?

416
00:24:29,436 --> 00:24:32,005
Why aren't you breaking down?

417
00:24:32,773 --> 00:24:36,777
Since you came into this house,

418
00:24:36,777 --> 00:24:39,646
nothing has worked out.

419
00:24:39,646 --> 00:24:43,183
You tin can robot.

420
00:24:44,718 --> 00:24:45,452
What?

421
00:24:45,786 --> 00:24:49,122
Did you just laugh at me?

422
00:24:49,122 --> 00:24:51,058
Do I look ridiculous to you?

423
00:24:51,825 --> 00:24:53,493
Do I look ridiculous?

424
00:24:53,927 --> 00:24:55,329
What are you doing right now?

425
00:24:58,665 --> 00:25:00,267
You're here?

426
00:25:01,335 --> 00:25:03,303
Did you just give alcohol
to a robot?

427
00:25:03,737 --> 00:25:05,939
What if it breaks down?

428
00:25:07,407 --> 00:25:09,910
I did give it a drink, but...

429
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:11,912
this tin can is fine,

430
00:25:11,912 --> 00:25:14,748
and I'm just a bit tipsy.

431
00:25:14,748 --> 00:25:16,850
No,

432
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:20,087
don't blame Hyun Chul, I'm okay...

433
00:25:20,087 --> 00:25:23,223
- What's wrong?
- I'm okay, okay.

434
00:25:23,223 --> 00:25:25,359
Kang Woo, wait, no.

435
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:27,561
Kang Woo, get a grip.
Are you okay?

436
00:25:27,561 --> 00:25:29,596
I'm okay, no, okay, no.

437
00:25:29,596 --> 00:25:32,099
I'm not okay, no, I'm okay,
no not okay.

438
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:34,535
You're okay, right?

439
00:25:34,535 --> 00:25:35,969
I'm ok, okay.

440
00:25:35,969 --> 00:25:38,272
No, Kang Woo.

441
00:25:38,272 --> 00:25:40,007
No.

442
00:25:40,007 --> 00:25:41,441
I'm okay.

443
00:25:42,543 --> 00:25:45,179
Are you okay, Kang Woo?
What are you doing?

444
00:25:46,246 --> 00:25:47,014
Hey.

445
00:25:49,183 --> 00:25:51,218
Kang Woo, don't die.

446
00:25:51,752 --> 00:25:53,620
What will I do without you?

447
00:25:54,421 --> 00:25:55,355
Kang Woo.

448
00:26:00,127 --> 00:26:02,062
Kang Woo, are you okay?

449
00:26:04,164 --> 00:26:05,299
I'm okay.

450
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,169
I'm just worried
you might have been too shocked.

451
00:26:11,071 --> 00:26:12,639
Kang Woo, get up.

452
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,141
Can you get up?

453
00:26:15,075 --> 00:26:16,276
You're heavy.

454
00:26:18,045 --> 00:26:19,513
Kang Woo, are you okay?

455
00:26:21,148 --> 00:26:22,082
I'm okay.

456
00:26:22,082 --> 00:26:24,084
What are you two doing right now?

457
00:26:24,918 --> 00:26:26,119
Where do you think
you're crawling to?

458
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,588
Get out!

459
00:26:31,992 --> 00:26:34,261
Okay, Kang Woo.
Continue what you were doing.

460
00:26:35,229 --> 00:26:38,065
Poor Kang Woo.

461
00:26:41,268 --> 00:26:42,503
What is this music?

462
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:45,939
It's nice.

463
00:26:47,074 --> 00:26:47,975
Kang Woo.

464
00:26:52,246 --> 00:26:57,017
He was really fine in front of me.

465
00:26:57,417 --> 00:27:00,354
We'll have to use the last resort.

466
00:27:00,354 --> 00:27:01,188
What?

467
00:27:01,722 --> 00:27:02,356
Hyun Chul.

468
00:27:03,824 --> 00:27:06,059
Dispose of that bastard.

469
00:27:08,395 --> 00:27:09,429
Dispose?

470
00:27:17,771 --> 00:27:19,540
That little.

471
00:27:25,045 --> 00:27:26,580
Where did the manual go?

472
00:27:28,348 --> 00:27:29,249
Is it here?

473
00:27:31,018 --> 00:27:31,952
Here it is.

474
00:27:37,891 --> 00:27:40,427
(This device is designed to be waterproof
and chemically resistant.)

475
00:27:40,427 --> 00:27:42,996
(It remains operational
even if exposed to water or alcohol.)

476
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,901
Why did Kang Woo...

477
00:27:49,336 --> 00:27:50,103
Na Ra.

478
00:27:53,407 --> 00:27:54,308
What are you doing here?

479
00:27:57,978 --> 00:27:58,879
I...

480
00:28:00,581 --> 00:28:02,149
think I have a fever.

481
00:28:04,585 --> 00:28:05,986
Why did you do that, Kang Woo?

482
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:12,125
You don't break down when you touch water.

483
00:28:12,993 --> 00:28:14,528
You have waterproof functionality.

484
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:19,600
Was it you who put the cucumber...

485
00:28:20,234 --> 00:28:21,201
in the sandwich?

486
00:28:25,639 --> 00:28:27,374
I did it because I like you so much.

487
00:28:28,542 --> 00:28:30,611
Na Ra, you are my everything.

488
00:28:31,678 --> 00:28:32,513
What?

489
00:28:32,513 --> 00:28:34,381
I can do anything for you, Na Ra.

490
00:28:34,715 --> 00:28:37,684
I wanted to be by your side
instead of Hyun Chul.

491
00:28:37,684 --> 00:28:40,988
You said you wished
I were your husband too.

492
00:28:42,356 --> 00:28:43,557
I beg you like this.

493
00:28:43,557 --> 00:28:44,992
I will do my best.

494
00:28:45,425 --> 00:28:47,394
I can do anything for Na Ra.

495
00:28:47,394 --> 00:28:50,097
I beg you like this, Na Ra.

496
00:28:57,804 --> 00:28:58,372
Na Ra.

497
00:28:59,106 --> 00:29:00,841
Kang Woo, wait.

498
00:29:02,543 --> 00:29:03,977
I want to be alone.

499
00:29:06,547 --> 00:29:07,214
Na Ra.

500
00:29:32,472 --> 00:29:33,674
What are you doing, Hyun Chul?

501
00:29:33,674 --> 00:29:35,309
I'm going to dispose of you,
you bastard.

502
00:29:35,809 --> 00:29:37,077
Don't do this.

503
00:29:37,077 --> 00:29:38,345
It's my choice.

504
00:29:38,345 --> 00:29:40,380
I'm human, and you're a robot.

505
00:29:40,781 --> 00:29:41,715
Don't do this.

506
00:29:41,715 --> 00:29:42,983
Just go inside.

507
00:29:45,452 --> 00:29:47,421
Go inside and stay there.

508
00:29:47,421 --> 00:29:48,522
Both of you, stop it.

509
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,661
Kang Woo.

510
00:29:56,063 --> 00:29:59,433
I don't think we can live
together anymore.

511
00:30:03,437 --> 00:30:04,805
They'll come to pick you up.

512
00:30:07,674 --> 00:30:08,609
Na Ra.

513
00:30:09,543 --> 00:30:10,811
You heard that, tin can?

514
00:30:12,212 --> 00:30:13,046
Honey.

515
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,448
Na Ra.

516
00:30:15,048 --> 00:30:15,949
Honey.

517
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:38,739
I'm here to collect the humanoid robot.

518
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:42,075
Yes, I'm coming.

519
00:30:44,144 --> 00:30:45,679
- You're returning it, right?
- Yes.

520
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,214
Verify the return address...

521
00:30:47,214 --> 00:30:48,115
Kang Woo.

522
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:51,451
I'm sorry to send you away like this.

523
00:30:51,785 --> 00:30:54,821
I love you.

524
00:30:55,389 --> 00:30:56,590
I'm sorry about that too.

525
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:58,692
Do you not like me
because I'm a robot?

526
00:30:59,626 --> 00:31:00,594
I...

527
00:31:01,395 --> 00:31:03,130
love my husband.

528
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:04,565
Even though he makes you upset?

529
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:07,467
I can be your perfect husband.

530
00:31:08,502 --> 00:31:12,072
My husband isn't perfect like you.

531
00:31:12,072 --> 00:31:14,074
He's oblivious and pathetic, but...

532
00:31:14,975 --> 00:31:16,343
I love him.

533
00:31:18,078 --> 00:31:19,112
Love is...

534
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:23,483
accepting the messy
and chaotic aspects...

535
00:31:24,251 --> 00:31:26,186
just as they are.

536
00:31:27,454 --> 00:31:31,158
Just like how he's done for me
so far.

537
00:31:33,527 --> 00:31:35,395
Then please,
put it in the box quickly.

538
00:31:35,395 --> 00:31:36,163
Okay.

539
00:31:36,163 --> 00:31:37,965
Right, the charger.

540
00:31:44,338 --> 00:31:45,205
It's dangerous.

541
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:46,507
Don't touch it.

542
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,941
What do you mean, don't?

543
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:50,944
Don't touch it.

544
00:32:05,259 --> 00:32:06,159
Kang Woo.

545
00:32:06,527 --> 00:32:07,261
No.

546
00:32:08,095 --> 00:32:10,531
Don't touch me.

547
00:32:11,732 --> 00:32:13,534
Tin can, why did you...

548
00:32:14,535 --> 00:32:17,938
Because you're Na Ra's love.

549
00:32:20,541 --> 00:32:21,542
Kang Woo.

550
00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:23,177
That's strange.

551
00:32:23,443 --> 00:32:25,078
How can a robot
have human emotions...

552
00:32:26,346 --> 00:32:28,248
Is it broken after all?

553
00:32:34,188 --> 00:32:35,088
Goodbye,

554
00:32:37,891 --> 00:32:39,293
my Na Ra.

555
00:32:40,894 --> 00:32:42,095
Thank you.

556
00:32:42,896 --> 00:32:46,433
My perfect housekeeper, Kang Woo.

557
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,852
Na Ra, honey.

558
00:33:04,852 --> 00:33:06,053
Wake up.

559
00:33:06,353 --> 00:33:07,421
Honey.

560
00:33:09,756 --> 00:33:11,124
- Chully.
- Yes.

561
00:33:11,859 --> 00:33:12,926
- Let me get up...
- Okay.

562
00:33:15,028 --> 00:33:16,730
What's going on?

563
00:33:18,532 --> 00:33:19,633
You came back from a nine-hole?

564
00:33:21,134 --> 00:33:23,270
No, it's just...

565
00:33:24,304 --> 00:33:26,573
- If it weren't for Kang Woo...
- What?

566
00:33:27,341 --> 00:33:29,409
You oblivious, pathetic human.

567
00:33:30,611 --> 00:33:31,378
What?

568
00:33:37,451 --> 00:33:38,452
I love you.

569
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:54,005
(Thornback Fish)

570
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:00,646
Before I die,

571
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,082
I want to sprint freely...

572
00:34:03,683 --> 00:34:05,584
like a hyena.

573
00:34:06,619 --> 00:34:08,087
Do you know
the Kamchatka Peninsula?

574
00:34:09,221 --> 00:34:10,423
I just want to...

575
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:21,334
Sure, you might as well
do deliveries too.

576
00:34:21,667 --> 00:34:23,703
No, that's not the place for that...

577
00:34:24,603 --> 00:34:28,140
Forget it.

578
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:32,545
Hey, Zhuge, Mencius.
A roe deer at the 4 o'clock position.

579
00:34:32,545 --> 00:34:34,146
We need to catch that roe deer, okay?

580
00:34:34,146 --> 00:34:37,083
Talking about deer again.

581
00:34:37,616 --> 00:34:39,652
I told you to clean up the trash properly.

582
00:34:42,421 --> 00:34:43,723
Isn't this a report card?

583
00:34:45,591 --> 00:34:46,826
His report card is out?

584
00:34:47,827 --> 00:34:48,728
Let me see.

585
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:50,663
(March Mock Exam Report Card)

586
00:34:50,663 --> 00:34:51,664
(ALL 9)

587
00:35:02,608 --> 00:35:03,843
Mom.

588
00:35:03,843 --> 00:35:06,545
You little jerk,
how will you get into college like this?

589
00:35:06,545 --> 00:35:08,481
- Mom.
- How?

590
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:09,849
Dad, do something about her...

591
00:35:09,849 --> 00:35:11,617
Who does he take after
to be like that?

592
00:35:11,617 --> 00:35:13,252
I was told I take after the maternal side.

593
00:35:13,252 --> 00:35:14,120
Grandpa said so.

594
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,755
That jerk is asking for it.

595
00:35:19,458 --> 00:35:20,393
That's domestic violence.

596
00:35:20,393 --> 00:35:21,627
Go outside.

597
00:35:21,627 --> 00:35:24,330
Go outside, I'll handle this.

598
00:35:24,697 --> 00:35:26,265
Grade nine?

599
00:35:27,266 --> 00:35:28,567
Why is Mom like that?

600
00:35:28,567 --> 00:35:31,671
Hey, I'm not asking for much.

601
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:35,041
Just get grade three,
and I won't ask for anything else.

602
00:35:35,041 --> 00:35:37,176
Okay, I got it.

603
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:38,744
I'll get it.

604
00:35:38,744 --> 00:35:39,979
How hard could that be?

605
00:35:41,647 --> 00:35:42,581
Ta-da.

606
00:35:43,983 --> 00:35:45,217
Do you know what this is?

607
00:35:46,152 --> 00:35:49,088
This is what you call a truffle.

608
00:35:49,088 --> 00:35:49,955
Truffle?

609
00:35:51,724 --> 00:35:52,692
Mushroom.

610
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:55,594
A very rare mushroom.

611
00:35:56,329 --> 00:35:57,296
Here.

612
00:36:01,967 --> 00:36:04,003
Did you buy it? Where did you get it?

613
00:36:04,003 --> 00:36:06,305
Mom got it as a gift
from her workplace.

614
00:36:06,305 --> 00:36:07,940
Your mom is the best, right?

615
00:36:08,741 --> 00:36:09,842
I'll call Auntie's family over.

616
00:36:09,842 --> 00:36:10,977
No.

617
00:36:10,977 --> 00:36:14,180
Auntie doesn't like mushrooms.

618
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:17,316
Right, your mom likes mushrooms.

619
00:36:18,651 --> 00:36:19,552
- Honey.
- What?

620
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:21,587
Good job, here.

621
00:36:25,091 --> 00:36:25,992
What are you all doing?

622
00:36:26,525 --> 00:36:28,094
Why?

623
00:36:28,094 --> 00:36:29,161
Are you eating?

624
00:36:29,595 --> 00:36:32,098
Yes, Auntie. We're eating...

625
00:36:32,098 --> 00:36:33,432
The truck...

626
00:36:33,766 --> 00:36:36,135
sold broccoli.
We're making a purée with it.

627
00:36:36,669 --> 00:36:37,603
Purée...

628
00:36:37,603 --> 00:36:40,239
Why did you come?

629
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:42,141
I'm going mad because of Young Hoon.

630
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,276
His report card...

631
00:36:44,276 --> 00:36:47,446
Attention,
this is the management office speaking.

632
00:36:47,446 --> 00:36:49,882
A woman in her early twenties...

633
00:36:49,882 --> 00:36:52,752
is currently drunk and causing a scene
in front of Building 109.

634
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:54,220
That's Yi Na.

635
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,122
If you think she belongs
to your household,

636
00:36:56,122 --> 00:36:58,090
- That's Yi Na.
- That's Yi Na.

637
00:36:59,959 --> 00:37:01,594
Yi Na's Mom.

638
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:03,929
Take care of your daughter, go.

639
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:14,674
Seriously.

640
00:37:18,044 --> 00:37:19,345
Do we really have to go this far?

641
00:37:19,345 --> 00:37:21,647
You said even a single bean
should be shared.

642
00:37:21,647 --> 00:37:24,150
Hey, if it were a single bean,
we would have shared it.

643
00:37:24,817 --> 00:37:25,951
What, are you roasting beans?

644
00:37:29,889 --> 00:37:32,091
Why, again?

645
00:37:32,091 --> 00:37:33,292
Why are you doing to be so surprised?

646
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:34,327
My shoulder...

647
00:37:34,327 --> 00:37:35,628
Look at the smoke.

648
00:37:36,696 --> 00:37:39,031
What do you mean?
We're doing the laundry.

649
00:37:39,031 --> 00:37:43,069
Yes, we were doing the laundry.

650
00:37:43,836 --> 00:37:45,004
But why?

651
00:37:45,004 --> 00:37:47,807
Yi Na, she got drunk again.

652
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,842
I'm so embarrassed
to live in this neighborhood.

653
00:37:50,343 --> 00:37:51,110
Is it this?

654
00:37:58,951 --> 00:37:59,919
Why...

655
00:38:03,389 --> 00:38:07,293
Why are you running
someone else's laundry, why?

656
00:38:12,365 --> 00:38:16,102
Why does my stomach feel so off
these days?

657
00:38:19,271 --> 00:38:21,607
Even doing the laundry causes a fuss.

658
00:38:21,607 --> 00:38:22,708
You were here?

659
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:25,678
What are you doing?

660
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:26,646
What?

661
00:38:28,547 --> 00:38:29,515
What is this?

662
00:38:30,216 --> 00:38:31,584
Why are you pooping blood?

663
00:38:35,388 --> 00:38:36,255
Chully.

00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:42,762
(Surim Hospital)

665
00:38:42,762 --> 00:38:44,230
Mr. Seo Hyun Chul.

666
00:38:45,064 --> 00:38:45,798
Yes.

667
00:38:45,798 --> 00:38:47,066
The biopsy results show...

668
00:38:47,767 --> 00:38:49,001
that you have colon cancer.

669
00:38:49,669 --> 00:38:50,736
Colon cancer?

670
00:38:51,437 --> 00:38:53,539
You should start preparing yourself
mentally.

671
00:39:05,618 --> 00:39:06,619
Hey.

672
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:14,260
It's too much trouble for the family.

673
00:39:16,429 --> 00:39:18,397
Let's not talk about it for a while.

674
00:39:21,133 --> 00:39:22,301
Okay.

675
00:39:42,288 --> 00:39:45,057
I don't want to say this,
but it's a bit embarrassing.

676
00:39:45,057 --> 00:39:48,094
Right, it's embarrassing.

677
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:50,496
It's embarrassing for a moment.
When else will we get to eat this?

678
00:39:50,496 --> 00:39:53,132
Right, there's a reason.

679
00:39:55,401 --> 00:39:57,003
What are you all doing?

680
00:40:00,139 --> 00:40:01,874
This is the last truffle...

681
00:40:16,756 --> 00:40:17,957
Na Ra...

682
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:22,628
We weren't trying to eat this
just by ourselves.

683
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:23,829
It was too...

684
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:26,966
tiny...

685
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:32,471
Let's just go home.

686
00:40:33,005 --> 00:40:35,841
Sorry, Na Ra.
I'll go buy it first thing tomorrow.

687
00:40:35,841 --> 00:40:37,009
Hyun Chul...

688
00:40:38,711 --> 00:40:40,880
has colon cancer.

689
00:40:47,186 --> 00:40:48,020
What?

690
00:40:48,421 --> 00:40:49,622
Dad has what?

691
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:57,129
Chully...

692
00:41:04,337 --> 00:41:06,105
Lying like this...

693
00:41:06,105 --> 00:41:09,575
reminds me of five years ago in winter
when we went to Gangneung.

694
00:41:10,643 --> 00:41:12,678
Back then, Jin Woo messed up
the condo reservation,

695
00:41:13,579 --> 00:41:15,715
so we all slept in a small inn room,
remember?

696
00:41:17,616 --> 00:41:20,186
Right, he did.

697
00:41:22,421 --> 00:41:24,190
That was so much fun.

698
00:41:24,423 --> 00:41:25,992
The briquette gas leaked,

699
00:41:25,992 --> 00:41:27,426
so we almost all died.

700
00:41:28,594 --> 00:41:30,162
Seo Young Hoon...

701
00:41:30,162 --> 00:41:33,132
is definitely still drunk from the gas
he inhaled back then.

702
00:41:33,132 --> 00:41:33,833
My goodness.

703
00:41:35,468 --> 00:41:36,702
But how did you survive?

704
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:39,038
Hyun Chul got up
to go to the bathroom at dawn.

705
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:41,374
He carried us all out.

706
00:41:41,374 --> 00:41:44,410
Uncle was like Superman.

707
00:41:45,277 --> 00:41:46,245
Right.

708
00:42:06,032 --> 00:42:08,100
We're telling a fun story.

709
00:42:09,268 --> 00:42:10,469
Why is everyone crying?

710
00:42:32,024 --> 00:42:35,194
What's all this?

711
00:42:35,695 --> 00:42:37,797
Dad, I've decided.

712
00:42:38,831 --> 00:42:40,666
I'm quitting all games.

713
00:42:41,233 --> 00:42:42,902
I'm going to start anew from today.

714
00:42:43,336 --> 00:42:44,203
Really?

715
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:47,440
Look at you, you're finally growing up.

716
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,409
Dad, I'm cutting back
on drinking starting today.

717
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:53,079
I'm going to throw away all this alcohol.

718
00:42:53,079 --> 00:42:54,880
- Really?
- Of course.

719
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,350
Compared to you, this is nothing.

720
00:42:58,651 --> 00:42:59,785
Hey,

721
00:43:00,853 --> 00:43:02,621
I have no regrets if I die now.

722
00:43:03,422 --> 00:43:04,857
What are you talking about?

723
00:43:05,324 --> 00:43:07,960
I'm going to nail this presentation
and become a full-time employee.

724
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,128
You have to see that too.

725
00:43:09,929 --> 00:43:10,863
Right.

726
00:43:11,163 --> 00:43:13,733
I'm going to improve to grade six
in this mock exam.

727
00:43:14,166 --> 00:43:17,103
I'll get into Korea University.
You have to see that too.

728
00:43:17,336 --> 00:43:18,237
Okay.

729
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:21,374
- Dad.
- Dad.

730
00:43:25,044 --> 00:43:27,046
- See you.
- Yes.

731
00:43:27,046 --> 00:43:28,047
See you later.

732
00:43:28,547 --> 00:43:29,849
Don't be sick.

733
00:43:37,256 --> 00:43:41,694
At least we raised those kids well, right?

734
00:43:42,194 --> 00:43:43,596
Just the kids?

735
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:46,999
Your wife is even better.

736
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:49,902
Ta-da.

737
00:43:51,604 --> 00:43:54,940
How did you get this?

738
00:43:55,675 --> 00:43:57,510
For you, this is nothing.

739
00:44:00,546 --> 00:44:01,647
Here, give me your nose.

740
00:44:08,587 --> 00:44:09,522
So handsome.

741
00:44:10,122 --> 00:44:11,390
But...

742
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:14,694
how do I go to work like this?

743
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,095
Who said to go to work?

744
00:44:16,529 --> 00:44:18,364
Quit work.

745
00:44:18,664 --> 00:44:20,499
Become a hyena.

746
00:44:20,499 --> 00:44:24,103
And run freely on the Kamchatka
or Kamchikichaka, whatever.

747
00:44:26,772 --> 00:44:27,540
Honey.

748
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:31,110
Na Ra.

749
00:44:33,012 --> 00:44:35,781
What are you doing?
Go start the engine.

750
00:45:25,898 --> 00:45:27,833
It's not like I'm Kim Yu Sin's horse
or anything.

751
00:45:28,401 --> 00:45:30,302
How did I end up here?

752
00:45:31,904 --> 00:45:34,173
Seo Hyun Chul, you're so you.

753
00:45:39,845 --> 00:45:41,013
You scared me.

754
00:45:41,814 --> 00:45:44,250
Who is it? Mr. Seo?

755
00:45:45,084 --> 00:45:46,152
What a sight...

756
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,457
What's wrong with the way I look?

757
00:45:53,025 --> 00:45:55,895
Are you a cow?

758
00:45:55,895 --> 00:45:57,730
With that ugly thing in your nose,

759
00:45:57,730 --> 00:45:59,465
why are you wearing this and that?

760
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:05,104
Did I do anything wrong
because I pierced my nose?

761
00:46:07,006 --> 00:46:10,609
Then, did you complete the report
I asked for yesterday?

762
00:46:11,077 --> 00:46:13,612
Yes, I did.

763
00:46:15,047 --> 00:46:17,516
Then you must have a lot of time.

764
00:46:17,516 --> 00:46:20,853
Then go and wash my car.

765
00:46:33,933 --> 00:46:36,235
Got it.

766
00:46:42,241 --> 00:46:43,242
Hey, Mr. Seo.

767
00:46:43,609 --> 00:46:45,678
I told you to wash the car,
why did you...

768
00:46:52,652 --> 00:46:54,420
What are you...

769
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:55,655
Are you crazy?

770
00:46:55,955 --> 00:46:58,057
You got nine lives or something?

771
00:46:58,057 --> 00:47:01,060
No, I only have one life.

772
00:47:01,927 --> 00:47:05,564
Even if it's just one,
I can't let my life...

773
00:47:06,565 --> 00:47:08,668
go to waste.

774
00:47:10,269 --> 00:47:12,104
Hey, you...

775
00:47:12,104 --> 00:47:14,674
You're not going to shoot, are you?

776
00:47:17,943 --> 00:47:19,245
(Resignation Letter)

777
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,082
Resignation Letter?

778
00:47:23,916 --> 00:47:24,817
Kim Duk Hyun.

779
00:47:25,184 --> 00:47:26,852
It's been dirty.

780
00:47:26,852 --> 00:47:28,521
Let's never see each other again.

781
00:47:28,821 --> 00:47:29,922
Ever.

782
00:47:38,831 --> 00:47:39,899
Hello?

783
00:47:39,899 --> 00:47:41,901
Mr. Seo Hyun Chul.

784
00:47:41,901 --> 00:47:43,636
The test results...

785
00:47:44,370 --> 00:47:46,472
were swapped with someone else's.

786
00:47:46,672 --> 00:47:47,473
What?

787
00:47:48,941 --> 00:47:51,544
The test results were swapped?

788
00:47:51,544 --> 00:47:53,813
Yes, it's not colon cancer.

789
00:47:54,447 --> 00:47:55,414
You have hemorrhoids.

790
00:47:55,614 --> 00:47:58,851
Hemorrhoids? I have hemorrhoids?

791
00:47:58,851 --> 00:48:01,287
Looking at your anal area,
it's quite worn out.

792
00:48:01,287 --> 00:48:03,289
Should we schedule
an emergency surgery today?

793
00:48:03,489 --> 00:48:05,324
- What?
- Or not?

794
00:48:05,524 --> 00:48:08,961
Yes, please schedule it.

795
00:48:09,628 --> 00:48:10,629
Thank you.

796
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:32,852
Hyun Chul, why...

797
00:48:33,352 --> 00:48:34,553
I...

798
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:37,957
I...

799
00:48:41,193 --> 00:48:42,928
Crap.

800
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:44,864
My resignation letter.

801
00:48:45,564 --> 00:48:46,732
No.

802
00:48:49,435 --> 00:48:50,403
Hyun Chul.

803
00:48:52,872 --> 00:48:54,740
Hyun Chul's suffering so much,

804
00:48:55,374 --> 00:48:57,810
but look at you,
without loyalty or anything,

805
00:48:57,810 --> 00:48:59,645
just sitting and eating truffles.

806
00:49:01,113 --> 00:49:03,916
Seo Hyun Chul, this bastard.

807
00:49:08,821 --> 00:49:10,056
Why...

808
00:49:10,056 --> 00:49:12,258
Why? Are you going to pour water again?

809
00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:18,631
Mr. Kim.

810
00:49:18,964 --> 00:49:20,966
I have been reborn today.

811
00:49:24,804 --> 00:49:25,671
Hey, Mr. Seo.

812
00:49:26,205 --> 00:49:27,239
Until I die,

813
00:49:27,239 --> 00:49:30,910
no, even after I die,
I will be loyal to you.

814
00:49:31,477 --> 00:49:33,579
So let's pretend this never happened...

815
00:49:33,579 --> 00:49:34,413
Let go, you jerk.

816
00:49:36,382 --> 00:49:37,750
You know.

817
00:49:38,317 --> 00:49:40,853
My son hasn't even gone to college yet.

818
00:49:40,853 --> 00:49:44,623
There's still a lot left
on the apartment loan.

819
00:49:44,623 --> 00:49:46,225
Please, just save me this once.

820
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:49,562
Look at you.

821
00:49:50,129 --> 00:49:51,097
Here.

822
00:49:52,298 --> 00:49:53,799
- Wipe it.
- Yes.

823
00:49:53,799 --> 00:49:54,667
Wipe it.

824
00:49:57,336 --> 00:49:59,005
It's cold. Be gentle.

825
00:50:00,873 --> 00:50:01,807
Be gentle.

826
00:50:03,009 --> 00:50:04,477
You jerk.

827
00:50:22,028 --> 00:50:23,295
That jerk.

828
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:26,565
Now he's sucking on toes
in a closed room.

829
00:50:31,203 --> 00:50:34,073
I should quit this darn company.

830
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:38,911
The door's at it again.

831
00:50:43,015 --> 00:50:45,284
Fine, I'll quit.

832
00:50:51,424 --> 00:50:53,359
This is Planning Team Two
Intern Seo Yi Na.

833
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:57,296
Mr. Song is unavailable right now.
I'll send it over right away.

834
00:50:58,064 --> 00:50:59,065
Yes.

835
00:51:03,069 --> 00:51:04,537
She's working so hard.

836
00:51:05,237 --> 00:51:07,974
Should I hold off on the surgery
until the presentation?

837
00:51:10,076 --> 00:51:13,612
Seo Hyun Chul,
Yi Na's future depends on your butt.

838
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:16,849
Hold tight and endure somehow.

839
00:51:18,084 --> 00:51:20,252
I brought every book
about mushrooms I could find.

840
00:51:21,287 --> 00:51:22,888
Well done.

841
00:51:26,993 --> 00:51:28,627
- Colon cancer.
- My eyes.

842
00:51:30,129 --> 00:51:32,865
Is there truly nothing
like the Meshimakobu?

843
00:51:34,367 --> 00:51:36,669
Golden Fresh Longevity Mushroom.

844
00:51:36,669 --> 00:51:38,371
- What?
- There's something like that?

845
00:51:38,371 --> 00:51:40,072
It has excellent anti-cancer effects.

846
00:51:40,873 --> 00:51:43,442
But it's a rare mushroom.
Where can we get this?

847
00:51:45,978 --> 00:51:48,681
I know. I know someone who knows.

848
00:51:48,681 --> 00:51:49,548
Really?

849
00:51:52,118 --> 00:51:54,387
Seung Chan's Mom, it's me.

850
00:51:54,387 --> 00:51:56,722
Do you know that mushroom...

851
00:51:56,722 --> 00:52:00,626
Golden Fresh Longevity Mushroom.

852
00:52:01,193 --> 00:52:02,228
You know it?

853
00:52:02,428 --> 00:52:03,663
- Yes.
- How does she know?

854
00:52:03,663 --> 00:52:05,464
Okay, thanks.

855
00:52:08,567 --> 00:52:09,301
Let's go.

856
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:27,253
You're weak in math,
so let's start with equations.

857
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:28,454
Equations?

858
00:52:28,454 --> 00:52:29,622
That guy named Equations from class five?

859
00:52:30,156 --> 00:52:31,424
What about him?

860
00:52:31,424 --> 00:52:32,425
Let's talk about him next time.

861
00:52:32,625 --> 00:52:34,727
- Let's start with sets instead.
- Okay.

862
00:52:34,727 --> 00:52:36,195
But how many people are in the set?

863
00:52:36,195 --> 00:52:37,963
If we call Zhuge and Mencius,

864
00:52:37,963 --> 00:52:39,665
I think we can call about twenty people.

865
00:52:40,099 --> 00:52:42,034
Let's call them next time.

866
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:44,503
Let's just start with English.

867
00:52:44,503 --> 00:52:45,438
Start reading from here.

868
00:52:49,275 --> 00:52:53,913
Knife safety should...

869
00:52:53,913 --> 00:52:57,350
always be a priority...

870
00:52:57,350 --> 00:52:59,218
in the kitchen...

871
00:53:02,355 --> 00:53:03,556
Is that German?

872
00:53:08,928 --> 00:53:10,162
What's wrong?

873
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:13,933
Just hold on a little longer.

874
00:53:13,933 --> 00:53:16,902
By tomorrow, the test
and the presentation will be over.

875
00:53:17,603 --> 00:53:19,071
Why is this so difficult?

876
00:53:19,639 --> 00:53:20,573
Dad?

877
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:22,308
What?

878
00:53:23,275 --> 00:53:26,379
Dad, what's going on?

879
00:53:26,379 --> 00:53:27,480
Can I try this on?

880
00:53:28,214 --> 00:53:29,815
Sure, you can try it on.

881
00:53:30,883 --> 00:53:33,586
But why are you out here
instead of studying?

882
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:35,921
Dad, lie down here.

883
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:38,991
- Hold on...
- Just lie down.

884
00:53:38,991 --> 00:53:41,227
We saw this on YouTube.

885
00:53:41,227 --> 00:53:43,162
There's a massage
that's good for the colon.

886
00:53:43,162 --> 00:53:45,164
I'm okay.

887
00:53:45,164 --> 00:53:47,400
Uncle, lift your upper body.

888
00:53:48,467 --> 00:53:49,335
More.

889
00:53:50,236 --> 00:53:52,505
Dad, you have to tighten your stomach,
okay?

890
00:53:52,505 --> 00:53:53,806
Hey, press.

891
00:53:56,075 --> 00:53:57,043
One more time.

892
00:53:58,044 --> 00:54:00,613
Why are you pressing it like that?

893
00:54:00,613 --> 00:54:02,882
Just stick it in.

894
00:54:06,886 --> 00:54:07,753
Dad?

895
00:54:09,322 --> 00:54:10,556
- Uncle.
- Dad.

896
00:54:10,556 --> 00:54:12,558
- Dad.
- Uncle.

897
00:54:16,395 --> 00:54:19,265
Dad, it's been hours.

898
00:54:19,265 --> 00:54:20,566
I'm tired.

899
00:54:20,566 --> 00:54:21,734
Just hold on.

900
00:54:21,734 --> 00:54:25,271
Let's find
the Golden Fresh Longevity Mushroom.

901
00:54:25,271 --> 00:54:27,807
We got this!

902
00:54:27,807 --> 00:54:28,708
Let's go.

903
00:54:29,408 --> 00:54:31,210
Honey, just wait a bit.

904
00:54:31,877 --> 00:54:34,013
Be careful.

905
00:54:34,013 --> 00:54:35,715
Honey, come here.

906
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:42,054
Where is it?

907
00:54:43,556 --> 00:54:45,658
Where on earth is it?

908
00:54:49,428 --> 00:54:50,463
The mushroom...

909
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:52,732
is nowhere to be found.

910
00:54:53,165 --> 00:54:55,468
It's because I lack sincerity.

911
00:54:56,335 --> 00:54:59,271
Seung Chan's mom said
we could find it here.

912
00:55:01,073 --> 00:55:03,075
Don't say that.

913
00:55:04,477 --> 00:55:06,112
Just to save Hyun Chul,

914
00:55:06,679 --> 00:55:08,347
you read at least ten books today,

915
00:55:08,347 --> 00:55:10,850
books you didn't even look at
during the college entrance exam.

916
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:12,952
Without Hyun Chul,

917
00:55:13,486 --> 00:55:15,988
I'm not sure I can keep living,
Yu Jin.

918
00:55:20,192 --> 00:55:22,595
Mom, Auntie.

919
00:55:22,595 --> 00:55:24,597
Don't cry.

920
00:55:30,569 --> 00:55:31,337
What is that?

921
00:55:31,337 --> 00:55:32,805
Why?

922
00:55:33,906 --> 00:55:35,207
That...

923
00:55:36,342 --> 00:55:37,276
Over there...

924
00:55:43,983 --> 00:55:46,118
It's the Golden Fresh Longevity Mushroom!

925
00:55:47,753 --> 00:55:48,721
But...

926
00:55:49,555 --> 00:55:51,157
Over there...

927
00:56:01,367 --> 00:56:04,103
Okay, stay calm.

928
00:56:04,103 --> 00:56:05,037
Back away.

929
00:56:05,037 --> 00:56:07,173
The mushroom...

930
00:56:11,043 --> 00:56:12,044
What do we do?

931
00:56:16,916 --> 00:56:18,084
- Na Ra.
- What?

932
00:56:19,819 --> 00:56:20,753
I'll distract it.

933
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,121
What?

934
00:56:24,256 --> 00:56:25,658
Dad.

935
00:56:31,364 --> 00:56:34,400
Hyun Chul. Although I betrayed you
for a bite of truffle,

936
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:35,267
look.

937
00:56:36,869 --> 00:56:39,238
This is my true sincerity.

938
00:56:44,744 --> 00:56:46,012
Come if you dare.

939
00:56:46,946 --> 00:56:49,281
You wild boar.

940
00:57:16,342 --> 00:57:18,644
I won't forget your sacrifice.

941
00:57:22,281 --> 00:57:24,917
You're the coolest man in the world.

942
00:57:26,519 --> 00:57:27,553
Here.

943
00:57:29,722 --> 00:57:31,757
Mom, Auntie, come.

944
00:57:38,064 --> 00:57:40,399
It's the Golden Fresh Longevity Mushroom.

945
00:57:41,967 --> 00:57:44,136
Chully, I'm coming.

946
00:57:50,643 --> 00:57:52,078
Be gentle.

947
00:57:57,216 --> 00:57:58,150
Honey.

948
00:57:59,352 --> 00:58:01,654
What happened to you?

949
00:58:02,288 --> 00:58:03,255
We...

950
00:58:04,490 --> 00:58:05,825
got this.

951
00:58:07,193 --> 00:58:09,762
This isn't just a mushroom.

952
00:58:10,563 --> 00:58:12,565
It's a mushroom with our wishes

953
00:58:13,032 --> 00:58:15,267
for you to get healthy again.

954
00:58:16,335 --> 00:58:17,737
No.

955
00:58:17,737 --> 00:58:20,539
You didn't have to go that far.

956
00:58:20,539 --> 00:58:22,041
That far?

957
00:58:22,341 --> 00:58:25,778
We can do anything for you.

958
00:58:33,019 --> 00:58:35,621
Honey, actually...

959
00:58:35,621 --> 00:58:36,856
You should rest.

960
00:58:37,490 --> 00:58:38,891
I'll brew this strong.

961
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:42,395
Hyun Chul, please sit and rest.

962
00:58:42,395 --> 00:58:44,563
- No.
- Sit down.

963
00:58:50,169 --> 00:58:51,437
Dad.

964
00:58:51,971 --> 00:58:54,707
You must really be unwell.

965
00:58:57,643 --> 00:58:58,644
Honey.

966
00:58:59,945 --> 00:59:01,080
Drink it all.

967
00:59:02,315 --> 00:59:05,117
I have to fast for tomorrow's surgery.

968
00:59:06,352 --> 00:59:08,554
I appreciate it, but...

969
00:59:08,921 --> 00:59:10,790
I don't have an appetite right now...

970
00:59:10,790 --> 00:59:12,758
You don't eat medicine for the taste.

971
00:59:12,758 --> 00:59:13,793
That's right, Hyun Chul.

972
00:59:13,793 --> 00:59:16,262
We went through so much trouble
to pick this.

973
00:59:17,830 --> 00:59:19,765
Just try a little bit.

974
00:59:21,901 --> 00:59:25,738
If you leave it here, I'll drink it later.

975
00:59:25,738 --> 00:59:28,941
Medicine is the most effective
when it's freshly brewed.

976

Drink it all.

977
00:59:30,876 --> 00:59:33,112
No, actually...

978
00:59:33,112 --> 00:59:33,846
This won't do.

979
00:59:35,081 --> 00:59:35,848
Kids.

980
00:59:36,615 --> 00:59:37,483
Yes.

981
00:59:38,718 --> 00:59:41,454
- No...
- Honey, take one sip.

982
00:59:41,454 --> 00:59:42,755
Drink it all.

983
00:59:44,290 --> 00:59:48,194
Open your mouth wide.

984
00:59:48,194 --> 00:59:50,696
Open...

985
00:59:54,367 --> 00:59:56,168
Open your mouth wide.

986
00:59:56,168 --> 00:59:57,269
There you go.

987
00:59:57,269 --> 00:59:58,671
Drink. It's going in.

988
00:59:58,671 --> 01:00:01,374
That's it, drink it.

989
01:00:01,374 --> 01:00:02,541
Good job.

990
01:00:04,944 --> 01:00:07,947
What's good for the mouth
is bitter for the body.

991
01:00:09,315 --> 01:00:10,883
Go and get some good rest.

992
01:00:10,883 --> 01:00:12,685
Kids, escort him.

993
01:00:12,685 --> 01:00:13,686
Okay.

994
01:00:13,686 --> 01:00:14,620

01:00:17,423 --> 01:00:18,290
Wait.

996
01:00:23,195 --> 01:00:24,163
Success.

This is the mushroom we picked today.

1000
01:00:48,421 --> 01:00:53,192
This mushroom looks similar
to the Golden Fresh Longevity Mushroom.

1001
01:00:53,192 --> 01:00:54,960
There's a high chance of confusion.

1002
01:00:55,928 --> 01:00:58,064
It's a toxic poisonous mushroom.

1003
01:00:58,731 --> 01:01:01,367
If a person eats it, dehydration...

may occur...

brew and make me drink?

1007
01:01:21,854 --> 01:01:23,756
This is going to kill me...

1008
01:01:25,391 --> 01:01:28,361
Still, I have to endure...

1009
01:01:29,595 --> 01:01:32,398

just drink a cup of coffee and go in.

1020

What?

1021
01:02:38,030 --> 01:02:39,065
What's wrong with this?

1022
01:02:39,865 --> 01:02:41,000
Why won't it open?

1023
01:02:43,836 --> 01:02:45,771
Why won't it open?

all this time?

What happened with the presentation?

1033

Is it over?

1034
01:03:32,284 --> 01:03:33,352
Is that even a question?

Forgive you?

what's there to forgive? You fool.

I'm here... but what is this?

1112
01:08:50,302 --> 01:08:51,837
Na Ra took the mattress too?

1113
01:08:51,837 --> 01:08:54,607
Oh Na Ra,
you think I'd just sit back and take it?

1114
01:08:54,607 --> 01:08:55,608
There's no reconciliation.

1115
01:08:55,608 --> 01:08:56,742
It's war from now on.

1116
01:09:00,313 --> 01:09:02,415
I've never seen a score like 91 before.

1117
01:09:02,415 --> 01:09:04,850
Can you give me a chance
to fill in the remaining nine points?

1118
01:09:04,850 --> 01:09:05,651
Press it.

1119
01:09:06,952 --> 01:09:08,321
- What?
- Did you read it?

1120
01:09:09,322 --> 01:09:11,957
Is it true that Mi Ran
ran off with the money?

1121
01:09:11,957 --> 01:09:13,592
Mi Ran's not that kind of person!

1122
01:09:14,026 --> 01:09:15,094
What are you doing, Dad?

1123
01:09:17,563 --> 01:09:19,432
I'm going to catch Mi Ran.

1124
01:09:19,432 --> 01:09:21,067
They say if elderly people are shocked,

1125
01:09:21,067 --> 01:09:23,069
it could lead to dementia.

1126
01:09:25,738 --> 01:09:27,740
