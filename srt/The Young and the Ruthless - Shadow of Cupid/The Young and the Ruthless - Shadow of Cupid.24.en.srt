Dad sent you guys to come save me?

18
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,839
Mr, Ka molt at sent a message to you.

19
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,199
The duty of a servant dog is to die for its master

20
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,839
As for you Kula chart,

21
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,079
your real parents are waiting for you in hell!

22
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,679
Doktian Taksasut

23
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,839
Tian will come to work in the administration department.

24
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,319
I will be working behind the scenes :

25
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,679
Any other questions?

26
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,599
What about Mr Kula chart?

27
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,199
Where is he?

28
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,599
What about Mr Rome, Ms. Tian?

29
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,599
Where is he?

30
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,519
If there are no more,

31
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,559
I'll end the press conference.

32
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,799
Wait please!

33
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,479
Please answer our questions

34
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,559
Yes, please!

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,359
Where are they?

36
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,079
I have a question!

37
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,279
Mr. Kula chart

38
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,759
Since Tian won't take the inheritance,

39
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,079
can l take it instead?

40
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,039
How did you survive?

41
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,319
Your real parents are waiting for you in hell!

42
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,039
Mr. Poh!

43
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,319
Put the weapon down!

44
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,799
You're all surrounded!

45
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,399
Hurry!

46
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,439
You're lucky.

47
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,359
Kula chart.

48
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,719
Pats a korn.

49
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,599
We're enemies.

50
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,399
Why did you save me?

51
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,439
We're not enemies Kula chart.

52
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,479
Your father

53
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,639
is my enemy

54
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,719
He's not my father?

55
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,399
You ordered to have Kula chart be killed

56
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,359
and accept Tian as your daughter

57
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,639
In hopes of receiving your father's inheritance.

58
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,119
Good thing

59
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,359
Pit p lern opened her eyes and saved him.

60
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,519
Otherwise,your plan would have been a success.

61
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:50,599
Pit.

62
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,399
After we got the call from Mr. Rome,

63
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:53,999
we tracked Pats a korn's GPS signal

64
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,359
So we were able to save Kula chart in time.

65
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,759
Both of them

66
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,639
gave the same statement

67
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,119
that Mr. Ka molt at

68
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,759
ordered them to be killed

69
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,279
Is that true?

70
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,559
Is it true Mr. Ka molt at?

71
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,959
Why would you do that?

72
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,439
-ls it true?
-- Did you really do it?

73
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:14,959
Is it true?

74
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,879
-ls it true?
What do you say, Ka molt at?

75
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,519
Do you have anything to say to the person in front of you?

76
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,039
Why did you send Uncle Pats a korn to kill me?

77
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,839
What did I do wrong?

78
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,919
Is it because I'm not your real son?

79
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,599
Why did you do it?!

80
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,279
Why did you have him be killed?!

81
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:37,799
This time,

82
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,359
you're going to pay for the karma you've caused

83
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,439
Ka molt at.

84
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,319
Is what Mr. Rome and Mr. Kula chart said true?

85
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,679
Is it true?

86
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,239
Is it true Mr. Ka molt at?

87
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,439
-Please answer.
- It's not true!

88
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,719
They're all slandering me!

89
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,039
Don't believe them!

90
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,039
Ka molt at!

91
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,199
It was you

92
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,399
that plan

93
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,679
to switch your daughter Tian

94
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,159
with Kula chart, the servant's son.

95
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,079
And you...

96
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,759
ordered me to go kill the doctor who knew the truth

97
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,119
You ordered me

98
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,599
to cut the brakes in your brother Kama it hon's car.

99
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,799
You ordered me

100
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,479

who was pregnant

103
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,239
Liar!

104
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,759
Rome.

105
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,519
You told him to say these things, didn't you?!

106
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:33,839
And you...

107
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,559
ordered me

108
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,159
to burn down Rome's factory.

109
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,559
You also ordered I me

110
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,199
to kill Kula chart

111
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,839
even though he got his evil nature from you.

112
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,199
willingly did your dirty work

113
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,079
but you wanted to kill me.

114
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,239
Arrest him!

What the hell are you doing?!

134
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,039
Put the gun down!

135
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,679
Is n't he the murderer?

136
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,639

I won't take you!

148
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,519

Put the gun down

156
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,439
You don't need to receive any more karma

157
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,679

Calm down.

161
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,359
He is your father.

162
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,999
He raised and took care of you til now

163
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,999
Raised me like a dog!

164
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,279
He feeds me when he's happy.

165
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,799
He hits and kicks me when he's upset!

166
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,119
But in truth,

167
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,599

00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,759
Kula chart.

169
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,359
It's my fault.

170
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,199
I knew the truth

171
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,199
but l didn't tell you.

172
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,439

It's my fault.

177
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,519
It's my fault I came and stole the love from you.

178
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,719

You tricked me into loving you!

185

Pats a korn knew all of Ka mol tat's secrets

198
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,119
How did they let him go?

199
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,719
That's Pa tsakorn and Mont ira.

200
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,439
Wait Jane!

201
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,359
Where are you going?

202
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,399
It's dangerous

203
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,239
If you're worried, follow me.

204
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,039
Where do you want me to go?

205
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:04,719
Keep driving.

206
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,759

212
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,359

How are they?

216
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,439
Pats a korn didn't make it.

217
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,479
Mont ira just fainted!

218
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,039
But I can't take Mont ira out of the car by myself

219
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,159
I'll help you.

220
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,399
My leg.

221
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,679
It doesn't look good

222
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,119
Can you put pressure on your foot?

223
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,759
I'm okay.

224
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,839
Go help Mon. Ill be fine.

225
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,479
What are you doing?!

226
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,919
What do you mean fine?

227
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,479
I think your leg is broken.

228
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,479
Stop acting so tough

229
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,319
You have to be okay

230
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,439
The ambulance will be here soon.

231
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:14,799
Pit.

232
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,239
I don't want to die yet.

233
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,159
I want to stay with our daughter.

234
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,039
Tian.

235
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,919
I never wanted to kill you

236
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,559
I swear.

237
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,039
I believe you.

238
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,439
But just hang in there.

239
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,999
You're going to be okay.

240
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:37,759
Tian.

241
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,919
Can you call me dad just once?

242
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,479
Yes.

243
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,799
Dad.

244
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:16,839
Kula chart!

245
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:18,959
Stay calm.

246
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,599
Okay?

247
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,719
Slowly step back

248
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,559
Don't jump.

249
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,079
You're still young.

250
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,239
You have a bright future ahead of you.

251
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,439
It's over.

252
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,239
I have no place to go

253
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,319
Kula chart.

254
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,079
Don't do it.

255
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,639
Kula chart!

256
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,479
Rome

257
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,319
Ill call the nurse

258
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:10,879
Rome.

259
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,639
What's wrong with me?

260
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,799
You were in an accident.

261
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,759
You passed out for days.

262
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,479
I'm awake now.

263
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,519
You can call the police to come arrest me. I'm ready.

264
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,599
l was worried

265
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,679
sol came to visit

266
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,759
Don't worry about the medical expenses.

267
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,159
l took care of everything

268
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,479
As for the bail money,

269
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,719
Il wired it back to you.

270
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,479
You're doing all this...

271
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,559
for what?

272
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,519
So we don't have any unfinished business with each other,

273
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:49,759
Mont ira.

274
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,719
Rome.

275
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,399
Can we start over again?

276
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,479
You should start over.

277
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,159
But not with me.

278
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,319
I hope you find good love.

279
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:18,959
Goodbye.

280
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,079
What can I do for you,

281
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,999
Chairwoman?

282
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:54,479
I wanted to invite the foreign affairs manager to go eat something delicious together

283
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,319
Wow!

284
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,359
Is a t here translating a bunch of paperwork

285
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,399
And you're paying me back with just one meal?

286
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,359
Well, I did offer you a monthly salary but you didn't want that.

287
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,519
So what did you want me to do?

288
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,079
Such a struggle talking to a rich person.

289
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,279
Let me think about how much I should charge you.

290
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,679
Should I ask one that will cover my life?

291
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,959
If it's my money, I would give you everything.

292
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,119
Why are you talking so weird?

293
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,759
This is your company

294
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,559
I never thought of this place as mine.

295
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:40,079
I thought when Kula chart gets better,he can come back and manage the place.

296
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,319
Eat some food Kula chart.

297
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,039
It's your favorite today.

298
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:58,799
Here.

299
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,399
I won't eat it! Don't bother me!

300
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,559
Kula chart

301
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,279
Why won't you eat?

302
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,359
You'll starve.

303
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,279
Who are you?

304
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,679
Are you here to steal my toy?

305
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,959
Go away!

306
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,519
I won't steal your toy.

307
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,599
Mom!

308
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,799
Where did Dad go?

309
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,439
Ms. Thip.

310
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,239
Thank you so much for taking care of Kula chart.

311
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,119
mistreated you in the past.

312
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,159
Whatever I can do to help your family.

313
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,999
I am happy to do it.

314
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,759
Thanks

315
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,359
for not being angry at me.

316
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,359
I'm going to work now Mom.

317
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,679
Asleep.

318
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,679
Hey you.

319
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,199
-Can you --
What is this?

320
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:55,599
This.

321
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,239
We have to see first

322
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,559
how close our project is to the community.

323
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,039
Is it near the road?

324
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,559
Are all the electrical system there?

325
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,319
Then we can plan whether we should build a housing estate,

326
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,599
commerce building,

327
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,879
or shopping mall.

328
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,279
This is difficult.

329
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:19,679
Even a small mistake in interrupting the street,we will definitely get sued

330
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:24,799
Jane :

331
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,279
Come sit with us.

332
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,679
What's the matter?

333
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,199
Nothing.

334
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,759
I'm just thirsty. I came down to drink water

335
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,279
Jane.

336
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,479
Have you seen Boss around?

337
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,919
Or has he called?

338
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,559
Rome is busy with the case.

339
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,679
Don't worry about him. He can manage. He's tough

340
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:54,839
You...

341
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,839
should focus on your stuff.

342
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,119
Mr, Lak, business is just too hard for me!

343
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,639
This is just reading the paperwork.

344
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,999
We need to go check out the location first before you make any decision.

345
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:12,959
Okay?

346
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:19,799
What's next?

347
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,719
Regarding the beach land in Ranong

348
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,439
the votes are still the same

349
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,239
There's no change Ms. Tian

350
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,799
I think we should cancel the development of that land

351
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,079
Do you know

352
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,319
how difficult it is to obtain every land title deed?

353
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,559
Your father had set that place for a big project.

354
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,439
He wanted to build a five star hotel by the beach.

355
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,559
But you're disagreeing

356
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,559
This is the most shittiest thin g I've
ever seen as an executive

357
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,439
You're in a meeting.

358
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,399
Let's talk like educated people

359
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,199
Let's not use our emotions

360
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,279
Mr. Lak is right.

361
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:07,999
Everyone here has received a high education.

362
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:12,319
Ms. Tian is the only person here that only finished high school!

363
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,479
I'm sorry that I have to be blunt.

364
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,599
This is called a business smile

365
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,399
I use it when I talk to clients I don't like

366
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,519
Try,it.

367
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,559
That's right.

368
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,719
I only finished high school.

369
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,959
But there is one thing I know that doesn't require a higher education

370
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,879
That is our company getting boycott from society

371
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,919
If you check online,you will see that our company

372
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,639
is currently being under watched and criticized!

373
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,879
I think this is a good opportunity to create a good image for the company.

374
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,319
We will give back all the land title deed to the villagers

375
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,639
We will allow the villagers to repay their debts without any conditions for land repossession

376
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,599
You speak well.

377
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,759
We will not cancel the project and give the villagers back their land.

378
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,039
Does everyone think that this place is charity?

379
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,919
We should do a vote

380
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,359
Does anyone agree to this?

381
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,479
Let's not vote yet.

382
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,239
Can l pull in a helper?

384
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,159
Your house is on the beach by the ocean

385
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,679
where we're going to build the hotel?

386
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,959
So what?

387
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,039
The place where you guys want to build it on

388
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,119
is my house!

389
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,039
The villagers there are farmers and fishermen

390
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,479
No one wants your money.

391
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,439
We have been doing CHR

392
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,439
We've done a lot for the community

393
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,919
Everyone was willing to sell their land to us.

394
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:35,159
We even informed them that we were going to use their land to build a hotel.!

395
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,159
We will give them jobs.

396
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,359
We were civil about it.

397
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,719
You guys used dirty tactics!

398
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,199
The villagers didn't want to sell their land

399
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,239
They only mortgaged the title deed!

400
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,079
But you guys

401
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,959
took their land away

402
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,039
by using dirty tricks.

403
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,439
Some villagers had a gun pointed at their heads,

404
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,039
threatening them

405
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:03,999
That's civil?

406
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,519
My father,

407
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,679
my friends,

408
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,039
Chiew,

409
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,079
everyone in the village

410
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,119
almost died because of you people

411
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,919
-Bastard!
-Calm down!

412
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,599
Let me go!

413
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,519
Jane. Calm down!

414
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,999
-Jane!
-Remember this!

415
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,119
My dad almost died because of you!

416
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:26,679
Calm down!

417
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,639
Let me go!

418
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,799
I need to talk to them!

419
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,759
Didn't you want me to talk to them?

420
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,959
Why did you drag me out here?

421
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,599
-Let me go talk to them.
Jane.

422
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,599
Calm down.

423
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,039
You did great.

424
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,519
What are you talking about?

425
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,679
What you said in there was very useful

426
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:48,959
Calm down.

427
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,599
Let me and Tian handle the rest.

428
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,839
Wait here.

429
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,679
Don't go anywhere.

430
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,559
Where did she go?

431
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,199
Tian.

432
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:47,879
Hello.

433
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,719
I can't get a holdof Rome either.

434
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,719
Come to think of it, it's been a long time.

435
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,999
I know

436
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,119
At first I thought he was just busy with the case.

437
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,199
Regarding the case,

438
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,479
Rome gave the power to his attorney to handle everything

439
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,639
There's nothing to worry about.

440
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,879
How are you?

441
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,119
I will let you know if I get in touch with Rome.

442
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,119
Okay.

443
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,239
He probably went to ordain by now

444
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,239
Take it down a notch!

445
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,599
Look what he did.

446
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,719
All this chaos is because of him.

447
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,879
If it were me,

448
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,079
I would leave everything behind to ordain too.

449
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,079
You're cruel Boss.

450
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,479
Disappearing like this,

451
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,279
when you come back I'm gonna stay forever.mad at you!

452
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,039
Jane!

453
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,159
How's it going Jane?

454
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,399
-Tada!

455
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,639
What do you think of my new house?!

456
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,199
Who are you looking for?

457
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:17,879
Boss.

458
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,559
Food!

459
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,919
Stir-fried shrimp with stink beans

460
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,119
Chiew made it for you

461
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,479
Also,

462
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,959
your three sets of clothes like you ordered

463
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,879
After you finish eating.

464
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,679
you can change your clothes.

465
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,679
It's very ghetto

466
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,119
What do you mean ghetto?

467
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,959
This is Serm's clothes.

468
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,639
borrowed it for days so I feel considerate

469
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,399
So, is your leg healed? You took off the cast.

470
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,479
You're observant.

471
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,879
The complete opposite of your brother

472
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,719
We live in the same house

473
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,759
but he doesn't ask me about it at all

474
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,199
What are you gossiping about, troublemaker?

475
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,359
I heard you.

476
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,199
How did you get here?

477
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,399
Are you shocked to see me?

478
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:10,079
No valuable items are missing.
Just a few pieces of clothes.

479
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,319
So she's working with Rome.

480
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,599
After that, it wasn't hard to guess.

481
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,399
You would come back here.

482
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,719
Smart.

483
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,039
Canny.

484
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,519
Canny is used on dogs

485
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,079
Rome.

486
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,319
Why are you hiding out here?

487
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,439
You turned off your phone

488
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,199
Do you i know everyone is worried about you?

489
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,839
Especially Tian.

490
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,159
Why are you worried about me?

491
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,519
Everyone's life is their own.

492
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,039
We should live our own life

493
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,279
I don't care what reasons you have.

494
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,039
But I'm taking you home

495
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,439
Don't bother me.

496
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,639
You can't even fix

497
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,399
your own problem.

498
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,679
What do you mean?

499
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,759
You promised her father you would take care of her.

500
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:05,879
Why didn't you?

501
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:06,879
Well,

502
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,639
-Don't make excuses.

503
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,959
If you want to make excuses,

504
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,039
go make it up to her.

505
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:17,759
Hey!

506
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,919
Don't walk so fast!

507
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,239
Your leg just healed. You might break it again.

508
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,079
Whether it breaks or not,it's my leg

509
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,679
Why are you bothering me?

510
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,239
Jane.

511
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,359
Are you mad at me?

512
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,319
I'm not mad.

513
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,439
Okay, lim sorry that l was always working.

514
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,639
I didn't give you much attention.

515
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,399
Who asked you to care?

516
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,599
It's good that I'm not there.

517
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,999
So that no one will get in the way of your love.

518
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:46,999
Go home.

519
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:48,479
Go!

520
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:51,919
So it's about this

521
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,199
You understood correctly

522
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,879
I love Tian b

523
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,999
But like a sister.

524
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,799
Things between me and Tian are in the past now

525
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,159
Because li know...

526
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,199
I'm not the person in Tian's heart.

527
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,079
So?

528
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,719
I have to believe you?

529
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,399
You held her hands, hugged her.

530
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,639
Doing that makes you two look like a couple.

531
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,719
Are you jealous?

532
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,319
Who'sjealous?

533
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,399
I'm jealous?

534
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,439
I thought you like someone who acts like a man?

535
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,439
If you're jealous, just say it.

536
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,719
You're not making any sense!

537
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,199
Can you speak properly?!

538
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,999
There's trouble!

539
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,319
Boss left

540
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,399
Boss...

541
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,079
left?

542
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:47,799
To where?

543
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,639
He just drove off.

544
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,279
He didn't say where he was going.

545
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:58,879
Boss told me to tell you not to look for him again

546
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,239
Are you guys having some kind of problem?

547
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,439
He's just running away from his problems

548
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,879
I'm going to go look for him.

549
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:08,839
Tian.

550
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,239
Calm down.

551
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,839
We are looking for him too.

552
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,879
We found him last time because he was in contact with Jane.

553
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:19,119
But he just suddenly left us again

554
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,319
He probably thinks we'll be okay if he does this.

555
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,359
So.

556
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,279
what about the workers?

557
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,759
There's hundreds of them

558
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,119
Is he just gonna abandon them?

559
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:30,919
No way

560
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,039
Rome isn't-air responsible person

561
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,159
If he were to leave,

562
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,399
he would i have told the workers.

563
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:49,919
Jane.

564
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,959
I'm sorry.

565
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,959
I was busy working that l didn't give you much attention.

566
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,679
I'm sorry Jane.

567
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,519
Do you still love me?

568
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,399
Of course.

569
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,959
We're getting married

570
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,679
H uh?!
-Huh?!

571
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,839
Is this true?

572
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,639
This is the invitation.

573
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,719
Say yes! Say yes! Say yes!

574
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,239
She's marrying Jane?!

575
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,759
And you're okay with that?

576
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,319
Not okay.

577
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,079
But what can I do?

578
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,159
Jane already confessed her love to Tian before.

579
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,679
Then Tian.reciprocated the love and now they're getting married!

580
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,719
That's faster than 5 G.

581
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:05,199
So that means you're heartbroken now.

582
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:09,239
You're neither Ms. Tian or Jane's boyfriend

583
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:10,759
Je ab

584
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:11,999
What are you saying?!

585
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,079
l almost died!

586
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,839
I'm speaking the truth.

587
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:18,239
Women can read each other.

588
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,679
Jane has feelings for you.

589
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,359
I can see it from Mars.

590
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,199
Knowing now

591
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,359
is already too late.

592
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:37,559
At-this moment, I welcome all devotees to today'swedding ceremony

593
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,079
Are there any objections?

594
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,559
Alright.

595
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,039
If there are no objections

596
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,999
I hereby announce you --

597
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,159
I object.

598
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,119
Boss.

599
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,079
Tian.

600
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,679
What's going on?

601
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,599
You can't spite me by marrying Jane.

602
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,799
Why can't I?

603
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,479
We used to be a couple before, right Jane?

604
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,959
Since the man doesn't love me, I might as well marry another woman.

605
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,759
We're allowed to have same sex marriage now.

606
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,359
Tian.

607
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,999
This isn't what we planned

608
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,479
What plan?

609
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,119
Well..

610
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,999
Jane and I planned

611
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,959
to have a fake wedding

612
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,039
to lure you out.

613
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,679
Boss.

614
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,399
Go!

615
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:24,799
I'll be back.

616
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,279
Boss!

617
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,759
Stop right there

618
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,159
What?

619
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,159
This was all your plan?

620
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,959
If l didn't marry Jane,would you come out to see me?

621
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,999
Boss

622
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,519
Listen to me first.

623
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:52,719
Tian!

624
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,639
What's wrong?

625
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,119
Tian!

626
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,199
I caught you!

627
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,359
You tricked me again?

628
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,679
You conniving kid!

629
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,959
Conniving like who?

630
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,239
Boss.

631
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,319
You really don't want to see my face anymore?

632
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,919
If l didn't,

633
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,479
why would I come to the wedding?

634
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,679
Then stay here with me.

635
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,199
Everyone was in chaos because of you,

636
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,479
Jane

637
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,319
I told you it was Tian's idea.

638
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,959
Why is everyone blaming me?

639
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,519
It takes two to tango.

640
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:06,519
If you didn't participate, this wouldn't have happened.

641
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,639
Oh come on.

642
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,639
At least we lured Rome out

643
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,759
Stop it Pao.

644
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,079
It's a waste of time

645
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,559
upsetting, and feelings are hurt.

646
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:19,679
Lak.

647
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,679
How are you looking after Jane

648
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,119
to let this happen?

649
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,279
Yeah.

650
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,159
Bad teacher

651
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,199
so student is bad too

652
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:27,799
Huh?

653
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,559
Take it down a notch.

654
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,279
You've never considered me your teacher before.

655
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,479
My daughter is the ungrateful one.

656
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,079
From now on,

657
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,359
I will entrust her to you

658
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,959
You heard that Lak?

659
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,079
If Jane causes more trouble,

660
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,199
you must take responsibility.

661
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,319
Alright.

662
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,359
Let'sgo party instead

663
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,719
Come on.

664
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,199
Hey.

665
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,679
Let's jump in the water.

666
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,359
Hurry

667
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:06,719
Huh?

668
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,479
Let's go play in the water

669
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,159
Can l ask you something?

670
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,039
What?

671
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,519
You want to criticize me?

672
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,759
However you want to'criticize me, go right ahead

673
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,399
I just wanted to ask

674
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,679
if you get married in the future,

675
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,599
will you wear at uxor adress?

676
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,999
A tux like this.

677
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,119
Weirdo!

678
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,479
Why?

679
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,359
Il like it this way.

681
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:48,679
Yeah.

682
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,879
Dress whatever you want.

683
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,159
I won't mind.

684
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,839
What are you saying?!

685
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,479
We'll talk about it after you graduate.

686
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,719
What do you mean graduate?

687
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,679
What are you talking about?

688
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,159
Look.

689
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,839
Don't be making stuff up.

690
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,679
J won't marry you.

691
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,559
Someone like me will marry you?

692
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,119
Look over there.

693
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,159
If I wasn't getting married,

694
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,519
were you really not going to come see me?

695
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:25,759
Yeah.

696
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,039
My intention was

697
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,399
to go into the woods...

698
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,679
ordain for the rest of my life

699
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,519
My goodness.

700
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,039
The old man is very sensitive.

701
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:40,959
It's your fault.

702
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,159
Why did you trick an old person into loving you?

703
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,359
When did you fall in love with me?

704
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,959
Since the first day l met you.

705
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,559
What about you?

706
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,839
I don't know.

707
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,519
Tian.

708
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,159
I answered you already.

709
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,079
I don't know because

And l don't know when it'll end!
