P The word love that doesn't seem sincere

00:00:39,143 --> 00:00:42,422

What are you doing?

16
00:01:36,183 --> 00:01:36,582
Well,

17
00:01:36,943 --> 00:01:38,022
we're a couple.

18
00:01:38,383 --> 00:01:39,702
We're in a motel.

19
00:01:39,903 --> 00:01:41,022
What do you think?

20
00:01:41,263 --> 00:01:41,982
Where are you going?

21
00:01:42,023 --> 00:01:42,742
Let me go!

22
00:01:44,183 --> 00:01:44,822
Rome!

23
00:01:45,143 --> 00:01:46,742
I'm begging you.

24
00:01:47,103 --> 00:01:48,862
I never asked anything from you

25
00:01:49,503 --> 00:01:51,462
Can you please forgive Kula chart?

26
00:01:51,783 --> 00:01:52,822
For Th on's sake,

27
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,342
for our-friendship,

28
00:01:56,743 --> 00:01:57,742
I will forgive him.

29
00:01:58,343 --> 00:01:58,862
Let go!

30
00:02:13,063 --> 00:02:13,502
Help her.

31
00:02:13,783 --> 00:02:14,702
She's in critical condition

32
00:02:28,303 --> 00:02:28,902
What's wrong?

33
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:29,902
You look stressed

34
00:02:30,743 --> 00:02:32,422
We now know the truth that

35
00:02:32,463 --> 00:02:34,022
Tia nis Kamol tat'sdaughter.

36
00:02:34,543 --> 00:02:35,782
What will you do next?

37
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:40,382
Continue with our plan.

38
00:02:41,623 --> 00:02:44,582
But using the daughter to get revenge on the father

39
00:02:44,743 --> 00:02:46,222
is just immoral.

40
00:02:47,183 --> 00:02:49,222
Getting revenge on Ka molt at is one thing.

41
00:02:50,263 --> 00:02:51,062
But Tian

42
00:02:51,743 --> 00:02:53,222
must.get justice

43
00:02:53,743 --> 00:02:55,982
for having to get disposed from being his child.

44
00:02:56,423 --> 00:02:58,542
All due to his own selfish greed

45
00:02:59,743 --> 00:03:01,102
The plan we have prepared for

46
00:03:02,063 --> 00:03:03,102
is close to the finish line

47
00:03:04,383 --> 00:03:05,902
It's Tian's time.

48
00:03:06,623 --> 00:03:07,862
What do you mean?

49
00:03:09,303 --> 00:03:10,662
It's time this world

50
00:03:11,743 --> 00:03:14,542
knows the real identity of the girl named.

51
00:03:15,463 --> 00:03:16,422
Dok tian

52
00:03:17,383 --> 00:03:18,142
Taks as ut.

53
00:03:20,423 --> 00:03:24,062
Gigi, no one has ever done this to me before!

54
00:03:24,503 --> 00:03:25,622
Think about it.

55
00:03:25,623 --> 00:03:29,462
Rome left me in the middle of the road because of Tian.

56
00:03:29,623 --> 00:03:30,782
I really want to know

57
00:03:31,143 --> 00:03:33,142
how is she better than me?

58
00:03:33,303 --> 00:03:36,462
She's just much younger and pure than me!

59
00:03:37,023 --> 00:03:37,862
...

60
00:03:39,863 --> 00:03:42,182
Don't talk about how your man left you due to your womanhood

61
00:03:42,623 --> 00:03:46,182
You're smarter than her and graduated from overseas.

62
00:03:46,263 --> 00:03:48,822
You can't surrender to that country bumpkin girl.

63
00:03:51,103 --> 00:03:55,902
But Gigi, I really don't know what to do now!

64
00:03:57,703 --> 00:03:58,262
I have a plan.

65
00:04:01,423 --> 00:04:02,422
You have a plan?

66
00:04:02,663 --> 00:04:05,022
If you can make Rome come back to me

67
00:04:05,103 --> 00:04:07,262
I will give you whatever you want.

68
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:09,662
I just want

69
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:11,742
you to finally divorce Sam

70
00:04:11,943 --> 00:04:13,902
and all of his inheritance from overseas

71
00:04:14,823 --> 00:04:15,942
I'dlike10 percent of it

72
00:04:18,743 --> 00:04:19,462
Sure.

73
00:04:19,623 --> 00:04:21,342
You ask,

74
00:04:21,423 --> 00:04:22,942
you shall get.

75
00:04:23,503 --> 00:04:23,982
Deal.

76
00:04:27,103 --> 00:04:28,982
Welcome members.

77
00:04:31,223 --> 00:04:31,902
Mon.

78
00:04:32,023 --> 00:04:33,262
Why are you here?

79
00:04:33,783 --> 00:04:34,422
Well...

80
00:04:34,863 --> 00:04:37,462
I am jobless and have no income.

81
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:40,462
It just so happen that this place is hiring receptionists.

82
00:04:40,903 --> 00:04:42,742
I applied for it.

83
00:04:42,863 --> 00:04:45,822
I don't know if lill pass probation or not.

84
00:04:47,983 --> 00:04:51,662
What service would you like to receive today?

85
00:04:52,103 --> 00:04:52,942
Please.

86
00:04:55,223 --> 00:04:55,902
Hello.

87
00:04:56,143 --> 00:04:57,022
Please come inside.

88
00:04:58,543 --> 00:04:59,382
Please,

89
00:05:08,343 --> 00:05:09,022
Here.

90
00:05:11,863 --> 00:05:13,182
How do I play?

91
00:05:13,223 --> 00:05:14,422
I don't know how

92
00:05:14,703 --> 00:05:17,062
I only know how to play badminton

93
00:05:19,503 --> 00:05:21,382
Okay, Il teach you.

94
00:05:21,503 --> 00:05:25,062
When l used to date Rome

95
00:05:25,183 --> 00:05:26,902
we would come play here often

96
00:05:28,103 --> 00:05:28,942
Watch me.

97
00:05:36,063 --> 00:05:37,462
Just like this.

98
00:05:39,383 --> 00:05:40,462
-Hit it.
-Mont ira.

99
00:05:43,503 --> 00:05:44,862
If you're not a coach

100
00:05:45,423 --> 00:05:47,942
the employee has no right to play with the member.

101
00:05:50,343 --> 00:05:51,462
I'm sorry.

102
00:05:52,023 --> 00:05:55,862
I didn't know the rules so I let her teach me.

103
00:06:07,863 --> 00:06:10,422
Boss, it looks so hard.

104
00:06:11,903 --> 00:06:14,062
don't know how to play, I can't do it.

105
00:06:16,263 --> 00:06:17,182
You haven't started.

106
00:06:17,303 --> 00:06:18,022
Giving up already?

107
00:06:18,903 --> 00:06:20,382
I really hate it

108
00:06:20,743 --> 00:06:22,182
when people give up

109
00:06:22,543 --> 00:06:23,742
and not fight their problems

110
00:06:25,183 --> 00:06:25,982
Let's hit it Boss.

111
00:06:26,783 --> 00:06:27,302
Come on!

112
00:06:30,343 --> 00:06:31,582
Stay focus.

113
00:06:40,223 --> 00:06:41,822
Look at the ball.

114
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:48,742
I'm sorry.

115
00:06:50,183 --> 00:06:51,382
Are you hurt?

116
00:06:51,623 --> 00:06:52,862
I'm okay.
ON TIRA

117
00:06:57,063 --> 00:06:58,662
Do we know each other?

118
00:07:01,143 --> 00:07:02,102
I don't think so.
T MON TIRA

119
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,742
This is my first day working here.
T. MON TIRA

120
00:07:06,463 --> 00:07:08,102

121
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:11,062
T. MON TIRA The golf course is that way.

122
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:11,702
Excuse me.

123
00:07:11,703 --> 00:07:12,702
Wait.

124
00:07:14,143 --> 00:07:15,062
We have met.

125
00:07:16,143 --> 00:07:18,102
You're Rome'sex girlfriend

126
00:07:44,223 --> 00:07:45,302
Boss!

127
00:07:45,623 --> 00:07:46,422
Are you hurt?!

128
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:47,982
Are you okay?

129
00:07:49,223 --> 00:07:50,102
Of course it hurts!

130
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,902
Who knows if you fractured my skull or not.

131
00:07:53,063 --> 00:07:54,982
It's red Boss.

132
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,062
Here, let me blow on it.

133
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,022
Presto! Presto!

134
00:07:58,063 --> 00:07:59,182
Hey Tian!

135
00:07:59,823 --> 00:08:00,942
What are you doing?

136
00:08:01,183 --> 00:08:02,542
You got saliva all over my face now.

137
00:08:03,143 --> 00:08:06,262
It was just my breath. I wasn't spitting on you.

138
00:08:09,143 --> 00:08:10,502
You want my pain to go away?

139
00:08:11,223 --> 00:08:11,742
Yes.

140
00:08:12,263 --> 00:08:12,782
Come here.

141
00:08:13,703 --> 00:08:14,942
You want my pain to go away?

142
00:08:19,543 --> 00:08:21,262
How's it going?

143
00:08:21,943 --> 00:08:23,702
How many sets have you played?

144
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:26,462
Someone wants to join you

145
00:08:27,543 --> 00:08:28,542
How's it going buddy?

146
00:08:28,743 --> 00:08:29,742
Are you well?

147
00:08:30,623 --> 00:08:33,862
Mr. Ka molt at,said he's your best friend

148
00:08:33,943 --> 00:08:35,102
So I brought him here

149
00:08:36,063 --> 00:08:36,902
Wait.

150
00:08:38,263 --> 00:08:39,742
Are you still mad at my son?

151
00:08:40,463 --> 00:08:42,582
I apologize on his behalf.

152
00:08:43,383 --> 00:08:44,262
And...

153
00:08:45,103 --> 00:08:46,862
I have to thank you

154
00:08:47,143 --> 00:08:48,902
for not pressing charges

155
00:08:49,423 --> 00:08:51,222
The one who didn't press charges was Boss.

156
00:08:55,543 --> 00:08:56,222
Really?

157
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:58,502
That's unbelievable.

158
00:08:58,983 --> 00:09:00,342
Thank you so much.

159
00:09:01,063 --> 00:09:03,902
You're worth being Thon's friend.

160
00:09:04,463 --> 00:09:05,382
Let's just say

161
00:09:05,463 --> 00:09:07,462
I will take care of everything today.

162
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,302
My treat.

163
00:09:11,623 --> 00:09:12,742
If Thon was still here,

164
00:09:13,663 --> 00:09:14,662
he probably...

165
00:09:15,023 --> 00:09:16,622
don't want gratitude

166
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,742
But more of a confession.

167
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:23,942
Right..

168
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:27,622
I should have Chart

169
00:09:27,823 --> 00:09:29,182
come apologize to you.

170
00:09:29,463 --> 00:09:31,902
Have you discipline him a little

171
00:09:32,383 --> 00:09:35,062
The truth is we're like relatives

172
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:37,782
Just let bygones be bygones

173
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:39,942
Let'sjust get along

174
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:45,902
I won't pursue the matter this time

175
00:09:46,783 --> 00:09:48,022
Not for anyone's sake.

176
00:09:49,063 --> 00:09:52,502
But it's because you saved Tian the last time.

177
00:09:52,623 --> 00:09:53,582
We're even now.

178
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,382
From now on,

179
00:09:57,183 --> 00:09:59,862
we're just old acquaintances like before.

180
00:10:04,623 --> 00:10:05,342
Let's go Tian.

181
00:10:11,383 --> 00:10:12,102
Rome.

182
00:10:18,063 --> 00:10:19,742
T. MON TIRA What issues do you have with Rome?

183
00:10:19,823 --> 00:10:21,462
He seems mad at you

184
00:10:22,143 --> 00:10:22,702
Oh

185
00:10:23,383 --> 00:10:24,742
he misunderstood me.

186
00:10:24,983 --> 00:10:27,742
He thinks I stole my brother's inheritance

187
00:10:27,903 --> 00:10:29,982
and thinks I bullied him

188
00:10:30,303 --> 00:10:32,022
causing him to go bankrupt

189
00:10:32,823 --> 00:10:34,782
The truth is I have nothing to do with it.

190
00:10:35,303 --> 00:10:36,222
Rome...

191
00:10:36,383 --> 00:10:37,702
never told you about this?

192
00:10:38,303 --> 00:10:39,182
No.

193
00:10:39,343 --> 00:10:40,582
He didn't tell me.

194
00:10:40,903 --> 00:10:42,382
I just know that

195
00:10:42,503 --> 00:10:44,582
his factory got burned down

196
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,622
and he was really sad about it.

197
00:10:46,743 --> 00:10:48,462
So he avoided me

198
00:10:48,903 --> 00:10:50,662
and refused to let me see him

199
00:10:51,503 --> 00:10:53,982
So I left overseas and got married.

200
00:10:55,743 --> 00:10:56,742
What a shame.

201
00:10:57,983 --> 00:10:59,742
You and Rome suit each other

202
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:02,342
I regret it too.

203
00:11:03,703 --> 00:11:05,102
I don't want to walk away from him.

204
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:09,782
I will cheer for you if you want to get back together with him.

205
00:11:11,063 --> 00:11:14,782
It's better than seeing him eat young grass.

206
00:11:15,983 --> 00:11:20,502
But Do kti an told meshe'sjust a child that Rome took under his care

207
00:11:22,183 --> 00:11:23,062
You believe that?

208
00:11:23,743 --> 00:11:24,422
I don't.

209
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,382
I'll be honest.

210
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:29,782
I'm interested in that kid!

211
00:11:31,303 --> 00:11:32,582
We can join forces.

212
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:45,622
Wait Rome!

213
00:11:49,343 --> 00:11:51,182
I'm sorry.

214
00:11:51,383 --> 00:11:52,782
I didn't know

215
00:11:53,063 --> 00:11:55,302
you and Ka molt at don't get along

216
00:11:57,663 --> 00:11:58,302
l understand.

217
00:12:00,103 --> 00:12:02,742
I need your help with something.

218
00:12:03,783 --> 00:12:04,262
What is it?

219
00:12:05,903 --> 00:12:08,502
I'm financially struggling right now.

220
00:12:08,623 --> 00:12:09,942
I have no income.

221
00:12:10,983 --> 00:12:14,062
I have to do everything for money just to feed myself.

222
00:12:20,543 --> 00:12:21,542
Im happy to help.

223
00:12:21,903 --> 00:12:23,422
Don't misunderstand me.

224
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,942
I'm not asking to borrow money from you.

225
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:29,982
I want you to help me indirectly.

226
00:12:37,143 --> 00:12:38,342
Calm down Pa

227
00:12:39,103 --> 00:12:40,102
We're on the same team

228
00:12:40,863 --> 00:12:42,702
If you leave, who will I consult with?

229
00:12:43,743 --> 00:12:45,022
I can't take this anymore

230
00:12:45,343 --> 00:12:47,742
I can tolerate your dictatorship.

231
00:12:48,063 --> 00:12:50,302
But you want me and Tian to go see

232
00:12:50,543 --> 00:12:51,982
and attend Mon tira's event,

233
00:12:52,183 --> 00:12:53,382
can't accept that

234
00:12:53,663 --> 00:12:56,062
Did you forget what this woman did to you?

235
00:12:57,463 --> 00:12:58,622
The condo launch event

236
00:12:58,783 --> 00:12:59,902
where Mon is the broker,

237
00:13:00,463 --> 00:13:01,742
it's just a bridge

238
00:13:02,263 --> 00:13:04,662
for me to introduce Tian to society, that's all

239
00:13:05,943 --> 00:13:06,622
Most importantly

240
00:13:07,503 --> 00:13:08,542
Mon

241
00:13:08,863 --> 00:13:10,622
invited Ka mol tat tothis event.

242
00:13:11,343 --> 00:13:12,182
So?

243
00:13:12,703 --> 00:13:15,022
You want to shock everyone with Tian's reveal?

244
00:13:16,863 --> 00:13:17,862
It's not time.

245
00:13:19,183 --> 00:13:20,622
Have to wait for the right moment

246
00:13:22,223 --> 00:13:23,982
Do you not pity Tian?

247
00:13:25,383 --> 00:13:26,342
I'm sorry

248
00:13:26,823 --> 00:13:28,662
but I won't get involved in this.

249
00:13:38,503 --> 00:13:40,462
You're suddenly flying back

250
00:13:40,743 --> 00:13:42,702
It's that urgent?

251
00:13:43,143 --> 00:13:45,382
The items l ordered for the customers arrived.

252
00:13:45,463 --> 00:13:46,582
I have to go check out the items.

253
00:13:46,943 --> 00:13:50,022
And another thing, the flight to Ranong ist only.available today.

254
00:13:52,783 --> 00:13:56,022
Can you ask Boss if you can take me back to Ranong too?

255
00:13:56,383 --> 00:13:57,382
I'm good at selling things

256
00:13:57,423 --> 00:14:00,182
I will go help you sell things. Please!

257
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,702
Gosh kiddo.

258
00:14:01,863 --> 00:14:02,542
Thanks.

259
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:06,502
Take care of yourself and don't trust anyone so easily.

260
00:14:07,823 --> 00:14:08,342
Okay.

261
00:14:08,823 --> 00:14:10,062
Gosh Pa.

262
00:14:10,423 --> 00:14:12,782
You talk as if Tian will get deceived by someone

263
00:14:13,023 --> 00:14:14,422
I'll be here.

264
00:14:15,663 --> 00:14:18,862
Hey! You're the troublemaker! How many times have you messed up?

265
00:14:19,263 --> 00:14:20,862
Next time, I won't mess up.

266
00:14:21,063 --> 00:14:22,302
I promise you.

267
00:14:24,783 --> 00:14:25,342
I'll get going.

268
00:14:25,383 --> 00:14:25,822
Okay

269
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:58,062
Iim bored!

270
00:14:58,503 --> 00:14:59,822
I'm so so bored!

271
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:05,982
Don't bring me any food

272
00:15:06,223 --> 00:15:07,222
I won't eat it

273
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,662
Tell Dad I will go on a hunger strike

274
00:15:09,983 --> 00:15:11,222
Until he lets me go home

275
00:15:12,663 --> 00:15:14,262
You don't have to do that much

276
00:15:14,783 --> 00:15:17,142
Mr K a molt at told me to come take you home

277
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:18,302
So you can get ready

278
00:15:18,703 --> 00:15:19,742
for an event tonight.

279
00:15:20,303 --> 00:15:21,022
Event?

280
00:15:21,463 --> 00:15:21,942
Hey!

281
00:15:22,263 --> 00:15:23,022
Don't tell me

282
00:15:23,263 --> 00:15:24,862
he's going to make me marry Napa

283
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:27,102
I won't marry her.

284
00:15:27,663 --> 00:15:28,782
I will only marry Tian.

285
00:15:31,943 --> 00:15:34,262
If you can make Tian marry you,

286
00:15:34,943 --> 00:15:36,262
I will reserve a five star hotel

287
00:15:36,383 --> 00:15:38,302
and throw you a wedding for three straight days

288
00:15:38,943 --> 00:15:39,422
Dad.

289
00:15:54,863 --> 00:15:58,662
Don't tell me you called me here because you can't choose an outfit for the event

290
00:16:00,423 --> 00:16:01,222
You already know

291
00:16:01,863 --> 00:16:03,342
my taste in fashion isn't so great

292
00:16:05,103 --> 00:16:06,462
Gosh Rome

293
00:16:06,503 --> 00:16:09,422
You already know I'm busy right now.

294
00:16:10,383 --> 00:16:11,662
So busy that...

295
00:16:12,303 --> 00:16:14,422
you don't have a beautiful dress for this event?

296
00:16:16,823 --> 00:16:18,902
Are you tempting me with a dress?

297
00:16:20,743 --> 00:16:21,822
Fine.

298
00:16:22,303 --> 00:16:24,262
You made the effort to leave your dungeon

299
00:16:24,463 --> 00:16:26,862
to attend a social event for me.

300
00:16:27,823 --> 00:16:28,342
Good.

301
00:16:28,903 --> 00:16:29,742
Let's start.

302
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:31,222
Tian!

303
00:16:32,143 --> 00:16:33,662
Come let Mon see you.

304
00:16:41,103 --> 00:16:41,782
Hello.

305
00:16:43,423 --> 00:16:46,582
Don't tell me you want me to pick out a dress for Tian?

306
00:16:48,023 --> 00:16:49,622
I can wear any suit.

307
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:51,542
But for this event.

308
00:16:52,143 --> 00:16:54,502
I want Tian to look the most beautiful there.

309
00:17:03,943 --> 00:17:06,142
Miss,do you need help?

310
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:07,742
No need.

311
00:17:10,383 --> 00:17:14,342
You said Rome sent you to study abroad?

312
00:17:15,463 --> 00:17:16,182
Yes.

313
00:17:16,503 --> 00:17:19,022
Boss sent me to study in England

314
00:17:20,423 --> 00:17:22,062
Where did you study? What city?

315
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:25,342
Don't get mad at me.

316
00:17:25,423 --> 00:17:27,382
l asked because

317
00:17:27,623 --> 00:17:30,302
J want to get closer to you

318
00:17:31,983 --> 00:17:35,062
I went to study there for a little over a year.

319
00:17:36,663 --> 00:17:38,662
Your Thai is very fluent.

320
00:17:39,223 --> 00:17:41,502
You don't have any British accent at all.

321
00:17:42,383 --> 00:17:44,022
What high school did you go to?

322
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:45,742
Is everything going well?

323
00:17:46,303 --> 00:17:46,982
Yes!

324
00:17:47,183 --> 00:17:48,182
Excuse me.

325
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,782
The leading lady is here!

326
00:18:02,303 --> 00:18:02,622
0% O

327
00:18:22,663 --> 00:18:24,742
Just like Cinderella, right?

328
00:18:34,423 --> 00:18:35,902
Especially if you wear the pearl necklace,

329
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:38,462
you look very beautiful.

330
00:18:41,743 --> 00:18:42,942
Of course.

331
00:18:43,303 --> 00:18:45,742
You picked out this necklace for me.

332
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:52,622
Can l take a photo for our Insta gram page?

333
00:18:52,703 --> 00:18:54,862
Both beautiful and handsome. You suit each other

334
00:18:55,863 --> 00:18:58,862
You can't. They didn't give permission so you're violating them.

335
00:18:59,703 --> 00:19:00,502
It's fine.

336
00:19:01,303 --> 00:19:04,022
It's once in a while that I get dressed up.

337
00:19:04,503 --> 00:19:05,662
I want a photo of it.

338
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:20,662
Bastard!

339
00:19:21,063 --> 00:19:22,422
What's taking him so long?

340
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:23,702
Have someone go get him

341
00:19:25,543 --> 00:19:26,582
I can go get him.

342
00:19:27,223 --> 00:19:28,702
I'm coming!

343
00:19:30,263 --> 00:19:31,902
I've been ready to go for a long time!

344
00:19:32,063 --> 00:19:32,622
Yo!

345
00:19:33,023 --> 00:19:33,942
Let's go Dad.

346
00:19:35,503 --> 00:19:36,982
What the hell are you wearing?!

347
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:39,062
You made me wait so long for you

348
00:19:39,223 --> 00:19:40,982
just so you can dress ugly like this?!

349
00:19:41,423 --> 00:19:42,462
I won't go with you!

350
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,342
I only had this much time to get ready

351
00:19:46,743 --> 00:19:48,302
I was rushed out of the safehouse

352
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,142
Whatever I see within reach

353
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:51,702
I grab.

354
00:19:52,063 --> 00:19:52,702
See?

355
00:19:52,863 --> 00:19:54,062
Y2 K style.

356
00:19:54,103 --> 00:19:55,702
You don't understand Dad!

357
00:19:56,823 --> 00:19:57,462
Oh.

358
00:19:57,903 --> 00:19:59,622
This is Y2 K style?

359
00:20:05,223 --> 00:20:06,342
It's awesome.

360
00:20:07,703 --> 00:20:09,262
This is Y2 K style!

361
00:20:10,423 --> 00:20:11,422
That hurts Dad!

362
00:20:12,383 --> 00:20:13,222
Mom help me!

363
00:20:13,743 --> 00:20:15,622
Why are you violent with him?

364
00:20:15,703 --> 00:20:16,502
Look at him.

365
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,702
Who knows if he needs stitches or not!

366
00:20:19,303 --> 00:20:19,982
Go.

367
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:21,662
Go take off all the earrings!

368
00:20:21,743 --> 00:20:23,182
Or else I'll cut your ear off!

369
00:20:24,383 --> 00:20:27,022
You're going there as a Taks asu t heir.

370
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:28,382
Not a bimbo on the street!

371
00:20:28,863 --> 00:20:29,342
Go!

372
00:20:30,423 --> 00:20:31,422
Mom let'sgo.

373
00:20:40,903 --> 00:20:41,942
Guys,

374
00:20:42,063 --> 00:20:44,262
this is Rome Pak an ant.

375
00:20:44,423 --> 00:20:47,062
CEO of SG Seafood.

376
00:20:47,183 --> 00:20:49,142
He owns a frozen seafood factory

377
00:20:49,263 --> 00:20:50,582
Thai Talay brand.

378
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:51,582

00:24:15,503 --> 00:24:16,942
This is called a business smile.

448
00:24:18,343 --> 00:24:20,622
I use it when I talk to clients I don't like.

449
00:24:22,903 --> 00:24:23,742

00:36:14,783 --> 00:36:15,782
I came to save you.

601
00:36:26,383 --> 00:36:28,262
'Foot Touches the Face "move!

602
00:36:33,863 --> 00:36:35,062
Where are you going?!

603
00:36:35,463 --> 00:36:36,462
Why are you hurting me?

604
00:36:36,783 --> 00:36:38,302
I'm the hero who saved you!

605
00:36:38,503 --> 00:36:39,382
What hero?

606
00:36:39,503 --> 00:36:41,582
You can only be a bimbo on the street

607
00:36:42,503 --> 00:36:44,142
Tian calm down!

608
00:36:44,183 --> 00:36:45,822
What happened?!

609
00:36:46,823 --> 00:36:47,382
Mom.

610
00:36:48,543 --> 00:36:50,942
Just practicing a role.

611
00:36:51,183 --> 00:36:54,462
But too bad the hero of this show almost got beaten to death by the heroine

612
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:56,102
Where are you going?

613
00:36:56,143 --> 00:36:58,222
-Wait.

614
00:36:58,223 --> 00:36:58,742

615
00:36:59,263 --> 00:37:00,062
Hold on!

616
00:37:00,423 --> 00:37:01,662
What happened?

617
00:37:01,903 --> 00:37:02,462
Tian.

618
00:37:03,543 --> 00:37:05,422
I think there's some misunderstanding

619
00:37:06,063 --> 00:37:06,822
There's nothing.

620
00:37:09,583 --> 00:37:10,262
Boss.

621
00:37:10,583 --> 00:37:11,622
How was that?

622
00:37:11,623 --> 00:37:14,182
Did I make an impression?

623
00:37:14,863 --> 00:37:15,982
Am I skillful?

624
00:37:16,343 --> 00:37:17,262
Were you drinking wine?

625
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:19,742
No.

626
00:37:20,063 --> 00:37:22,502
I didn't drink there d one

627
00:37:22,783 --> 00:37:24,102
I drank that glass

628
00:37:27,463 --> 00:37:28,302
Come here.

629
00:37:30,423 --> 00:37:31,062

So what really happened?

631
00:37:34,703 --> 00:37:37,142
Just kids'problems. Nothing to worry about

632
00:37:37,263 --> 00:37:39,382
Is Tian actually

633
00:37:39,903 --> 00:37:42,062
being shipped with Mr. Kula chart?

634
00:37:42,223 --> 00:37:44,822
No wonder, Mr s. P itplern seem so close with Tian.

635
00:37:46,223 --> 00:37:48,982
It's not that, It's not time yet.

636
00:37:49,023 --> 00:37:51,742
If there's anything, I will let you know.

637
00:37:59,023 --> 00:37:59,662
DH

DH

00:38:01,303 --> 00:38:02,302
You got beat up by a girl.

641
00:38:02,463 --> 00:38:03,582
So pathetic!

642
00:38:04,143 --> 00:38:05,622
I love her and want to be serious with her.

643
00:38:05,943 --> 00:38:07,182
How can I fight back?

644
00:38:07,703 --> 00:38:09,262
She will be the mother of my children.

645
00:38:09,823 --> 00:38:11,782
You two will get to carry a grandchild soon.

646
00:38:11,943 --> 00:38:13,222
If she becomes my wife,

647
00:38:13,343 --> 00:38:15,182
I will do anything you want me to do.

648
00:38:15,343 --> 00:38:17,182
It's impossible Kula chart.

649
00:38:17,623 --> 00:38:21,022
Our relationship with that side ls n't too good.

650
00:38:21,383 --> 00:38:22,342
And you...

651
00:38:22,663 --> 00:38:24,462

652
00:38:24,543 --> 00:38:25,582
You have Napa.

653
00:38:25,583 --> 00:38:26,262
Pit.

654
00:38:27,143 --> 00:38:28,102
Stop talking.

655
00:38:29,583 --> 00:38:31,542
Why are you trying to stop our son from turning a new leaf?

656
00:38:33,103 --> 00:38:34,422
DH

657
00:38:34,423 --> 00:38:36,702

You know I hate people who break promises?

663
00:39:09,383 --> 00:39:11,022
I'm sorry Boss.

664
00:39:13,103 --> 00:39:14,782
I told you before not to drink

665
00:39:16,023 --> 00:39:16,902
Well..

666
00:39:17,743 --> 00:39:19,822
It looked like orange juice so...

667
00:39:19,903 --> 00:39:22,062
I didn't think I would get drunk.

668
00:39:25,623 --> 00:39:26,782
Stop making excuses

669
00:39:27,943 --> 00:39:29,102
