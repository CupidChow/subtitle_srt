PI trust you with everything?

But today your embrace feels empty

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,839
P The word love that doesn't seem sincere

6
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,399

Go take it out for me

17
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,079
I can't.

18
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:37,759
Damn!

19
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:38,959
What the hell?

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,559
So difficult. Get out of here!

21
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,199
has no money to spend!

22
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,119
with my long lost daughter

23
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,679
For this gratitude,

24
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,279
I will repay you.

25
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,799
Ka molt at!

26
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,639
Rome!

27
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,399
Don't Boss!

28
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:57,999
Tian.

29
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,799
You're willing to take the hit for him?!

30
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,079
Why do you have to pretend to be sicker?

31
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,919
You want me to lie to our daughter

32
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,439
that you...

33
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,359
have terminal brain tumor?

34
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,959
Can Pit and I

35
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,199
do our jobs as parents for you?

36
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,359
Hello.

37
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,359
Why are you here?

38
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,279
What business do you have?

39
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,559
To congratulate Tian

40
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,719
that she gets to live with her parents now.

41
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,799
In the end,

42
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,839
you are the real Cinderella.

43
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,399
What's wrong Mr. Ka molt at?

44
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,719
Why are you in a wheelchair?

45
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,119
He has terminal brain tumor

46
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,319
But he'll be cured soon

47
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,319
Tian.

48
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,119
Ever since l bailed Rome out,

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,679
why haven't you visited him?

50
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,799
I will never go back to that house.

51
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,199
That's right.

52
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,119
We for gave each other. We should just live our lives.

53
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,119
Tian, let's go. I want to rest.

54
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,439
Don't worry about me

55
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,639
Thanks for working

56
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,119
I'll see you after I'm done here

57
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:48,479
Does your employees at Ranong question what kind of trouble you will cause next?

58
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,039
I hope this will make you get over Tian

59
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,719
Because Tian isn't stupid i to abandon the title of Taks as ut heiress

60
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,679
that will give her an easy life for you

61
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,319
Mont ira is right

62
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,199
Get over her

63
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,639
Tian is happy now.

64
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,519
You can go pick up your medicine.

65
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,799
Thank you.

66
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,479
Sure.

67
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,199
Thank you.

68
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,719
Hello.

69
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,919
What's up Rome?

70
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,679
What?

71
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,759
You want me to investigate

72
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,079
Ka mol tat's illness again?

73
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,959
Dream on

74
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,959
I told you l won't break the law or violate medical ethics for you again.

75
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,119
This is my last plea.

76
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,439
Jw on't askanymore

77
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,359
Why are you doing this?

78
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,719
Ka mol tat's.

79
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,439
condition can't worsen this quickly.

80
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,519
He's lying.

81
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,439
He's deceiving Tian and us.

82
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,879
You heard what happened at the police station.

83
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,719
Just let Tian go.

84
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,319
He's her father and Tian is a smart kid.

85
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,999
She won't get deceived that easily

86
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,359
o I can't let go.

87
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,359
Don't you know

88
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,599
how evil Kamolt at is?

89
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,319
Once Tian receives the inheritance,

90
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,599
he's going to kill her

91
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,439
and definitely claim the inheritance as the father

92
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,559
He did it to his own brother.

93
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,079
So never mind a daughter that he's never raised like Tian.

94
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,919
I can't let him go.

95
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,559
Chai, Thom ya

96
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,399
I don't want anything.

97
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,799
I didn't expect this kind of life either

98
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,879
What should I do?

99
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,439
Tian.

100
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,239
Boss :

101
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,839
Why are you here?

102
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,679
Should we run away together?

103
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,679
What are you doing?

104
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,919
You're not resisting

105
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,399
so that means you agree

106
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,119
Your accommodation is ready Boss

107
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,759
Oh.

108
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,519
Tian.

109
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,759
You can wear Jane's clothes for now

110
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,479
Okay.

111
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:17,959
Hey!

112
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,759
Don't worry about the dried and raw food

113
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,679
I've prepared it for you

114
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,119
Or you can let me'show off my cooking skills for you.

115
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,999
I used to live with Aunt Fai

116
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,759
No need

117
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,279
I brought my own personal cook

118
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,079
Right, Chef?

119
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,119
Gosh!

120
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,239
Tian.

121
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,719
Don't be shy

122
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,719
I won't stay to be the third wheel.

123
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,799
If he does

124
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,479
I will kick him til he flips over

125
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,479
Chiew!

126
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,119
You're going to kick me?

127
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,719
You're gonna get it.

128
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,319
What?

129
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,239
What's it gonna be?!

130
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,799
Alright, enough. Don't argue with each other.

131
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,559
In conclusion,

132
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,839
this place is safe, right?

133
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,999
A million per cent

134
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,799
The investors missed out on surveying this area the other day.

135
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,559
So Serm had us build a hu there

136
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,799
He'll stop by when he has time

137
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,159
Good.

138
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:11,759
Thank you so much

139
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,359
I almost forgot.

140
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,719
Serm left a small boat here for you.

141
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,679
In case there's anemergency,
you can take it with you.

142
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,359
Thanks :

143
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,639
No problem

144
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,759
Boss.

145
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,079
The beach here is nice

146
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,959
From now on,

147
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,279
we'will start our new lives here

148
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,079
Tian.

149
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,839
We will forget the past

150
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,999
It'll be just us

151
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,279
Let's just go home.

152
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,519
Pa and Mr. Lak are probably worried sick about you

153
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,559
Besides,

154
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,159
I'm scared my parents might worry about me too.

155
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,119
Parents?

156
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,879
You're calling them your parents now?

157
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,279
Isn't it the truth?

158
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,639
Right.

159
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,199
You accept being Ka mol tat'sdaughter even though you know how evil he is.

160
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,279
Because soon,

161
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,559
you will be Taks as ut's heiress.

162
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,999
You will live a luxurious life unlike living with me.

163
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,199
I never thought like that.

164
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,599
But I just want to live in reality.

165
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,759
What reality?

166
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,959
They're lying to you.

167
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,519
Ka molt at came up with this plan

168
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,999
to trap you in it.

169
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,359
He's not actually sick.

170
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,639
He's fine Tian.

171
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,679
Who exactly

172
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,439
has been planning to deceive me all along

173
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,759
and kept the truth from me?

174
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,559
I won't argue with you anymore.

175
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,359
You're not getting it.

176
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:04,959
I'm also hungry.

177
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,079
I'm gonna go cook.

178
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,639
Why didn't you watch her?

179
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,879
How could you let her leave?!

180
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,719
So stupid!

181
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:17,999
Well.

182
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,959
she promised us

183
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,639
she will stay with us

184
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,439
Calm.down.

185
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,239
May be Tian just took a trip

186
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,839
Trip?

187
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,479
Why turn off her phone then?

188
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,159
I've been calling that my phone is burning up!

189
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:35,879
Unless...

190
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,079
she got kidnapped

191
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,079
I checked Ms. Tian's room

192
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,959
She didn't take anything with her.

193
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,239
She didn't take her belongings or clothes either

194
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,199
You see?

195
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,759
That must be it

196
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,879
Rome must have kidnapped her.

197
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,359
That son of a bitch!

198
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,799
You can't go inside!

199
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,279
Rome!

200
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,039
Where are you?!

201
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,919
Boss and Ms. Tiana ren't home!
-Tian!

202
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,359
What happened?

203
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,279
Why are you yelling in my house?

204
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,279
What's going on?

205
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:11,679
Well.

206
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,279
Tian is missing

207
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,799
Just tell me Pa

208
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,919
if Tian is here or not.

209
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,079
Tell us

210
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,079
where Rome is keeping Tian at

211
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,759
Your child is missingandyou're looking for her at someone's house?

212
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,439
She's your daughter.

213
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,119
You can't even look after her.

214
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,599
Don't call yourselves parents :

215
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,839
Because some bastard kidnapped her

216
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,399
Go drag your brother out here

217
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,199
Hey!

218
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,239
You'rean aristocrat for nothing

219
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,079
Try to have some manners.

220
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,959
I don't need to have manners with people like you.

221
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,799
If I don't find my daughter today.

222
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,239
don't even hope you can live in peace.

223
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,679
Pa.

224
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,959
Calm down.

225
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,639
Rome isn't home right now.

226
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,999
Don't worry I will call him for you.

227
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:12,879
Call won't connect.

228
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,239
guess he turned off his phone.

229
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,599
Well?

230
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,119
It's clear right?

231
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,719
I will call the police to arrest Rome

232
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,119
and all of you!

233
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,199
Geez.

234
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,519
Is it good to rely on the police?

235
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,159
If you want to file a report.

236
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,359
we can also file reports

237
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,639
You want to compete

238
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,199
who goes to prison first?

239
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,239
Hey.

240
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,479
Let's not have any problems

241
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,199
Let's file a complaint right now

242
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,359
Trespassing.

243
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,479
You -
- Defamation is another one

244
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,559
Hey.

245
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,159
Let's go.

246
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,399
I think

247
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,879
Tian isn't here.

248
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,719
Let Rome know

249
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,839
that he can't beat me

250
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,799
I'll see to it!

251
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,719
It's connecting!

252
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,639
Yes Mom?

253
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:20,839
Tian :

254
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,039
Where are you?

255
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,239
Are you safe?

256
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,839
I'm safe.

257
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,159
Don't worry I ill be home soon.

258
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,159
Why did you turn off your phone?

259
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,719
Are you really safe?

260
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,199
I'm safe.

261
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,519
I have to go.

262
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,479
Do you want me to send the driver to pick you up?

263
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,719
Hello?!

264
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,599
She hung up.

265
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:43,479
Oh

266
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,879
why didn't you ask where she was?

267
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,679
Gosh!

268
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,159
You're so ignorant!

269
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,599
She said she's safe

270
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,279
She'll be home soon.

271
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,239
Rome must be pointing a gun to her to make her,say that.

272
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,879
Sir.

273
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,319
Rome abducted Tian.

274
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,599
I checked every surveillance camera

275
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,279
Well?

276
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:09,919
You see?

277
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,199
What did I just say?

278
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,479
A bastard will always be a bastard.

279
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,839
I should have talked to her myself

280
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,759
Mr s. P itplern.

281
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,239
When you were on the phone

282
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,399
did you hear anything in the background?

283
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,639
I heard..

284
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,879
the sound of waves and the sea breeze

285
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,639
Maybe he took her back to his house in Ranong.

286
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:39,999
It's possible.

287
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,079
In that case,

288
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,399
follow the camera footage

289
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,079
When you have the chance to kill him,

290
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,279
do it!

291
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,399
Let's not kill anyone.

292
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,999
Don't,stop me!

293
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,399
Can't you see

294
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,639
he's Mara to our happiness?!

295
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,919
If he doesn't die, our family will never be at peace!

296
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,479
Ka molt at is probably hunting down Tian and Rome right now

297
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,439
We have to find Boss and Tian before they do.

298
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,719
Otherwise, they're going to kill Boss.

299
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,479
l agree with Jane.

300
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,079
-But Lak We have to find them before Ka molt at does

301
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,919
At least not to let things get any worse.

302
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,759
There's sweet shrimps

303
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,279
and fried eggs

304
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,359
with spicy grouper to my um soup

305
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,639
Think of it as eating to satisfy hunger or prevent death.

306
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,519
It might.

307
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,799
not be fancy like the food at your father'shouse

308
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,639
Boss.

309
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,039
Is everything you'redoing only to get revenge on Ka molt at?

310
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,359
No.

311
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,919
If not,

312
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,759
then take me back to the Taks as ut house

313
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,159
Forgive Ka molt at for everything and end all the problems.

314
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,159
Things between me and Ka molt at

315
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,919
have ended.

316
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,879
From now on,

317
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,799
it's about me and you

318
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,799
Don't be cruel to me.

319
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,799
Just a bite my dear

320
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,039
Delicious fried eggs.

321
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,079
To m yum is also delicious.

322
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,199
t's not my fault if you die from hunger.

323
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,079
The weather is nice today

324
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,759
It's breezy.

325
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,519
You told me once

326
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,719
you don't have to live in a fancy home

327
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,839
As long as you get to live with me.

328
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,239
Yes.

329
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,319
I remember everything about us.

330
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,119
Setting this net is difficult

331
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,039
But don't worry. I won't let you sleep with mosquitoes biting you.

332
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,119
Here Il do it

333
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,959
I used to it often for Mom as a kid

334
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,159
Here.

335
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,439
I'm sorry

336
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,679
that l have to make you suffer again.

337
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,399
Once things die down,

338
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,879
I'll find a way to get us to move overseas.

339
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,279
No one knows us there.

340
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,599
We'll leave the past here

341
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,599
Boss.

342
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,599
I'm not afraid to suffer

343
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,319
What I want the most is...

344
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,319
seeing the person l love happy.

345
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,639
You're my everything

346
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,359
You're my life Tian

347
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,279
This is...

348
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,759
Boss Rome

349
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,559
and Tian.

350
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,519
I met them before

351
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,439
Mr. Ka molt at wants them?

352
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,039
Yes.

353
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,599
You.

354
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,159
Go tell all of your friends

355
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,319
if they find Rome,

356
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,279
call me immediately.

357
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,039
I have a reward

358
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,399
Sure.

359
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,919
This checkpoint here...

360
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,439
where's the barricade?

361
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,159
It's the villagers here.

362
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,799
They're stubborn.

363
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,839
They refused to sell their land to TS Group.

364
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,039
To enter or exit, they need to get past this checkpoint.

365
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,999
Mr. Kula chart told the villagers they can get through.

366
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,959
So we haven't been strict.

367
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,159
Where are you going Tian?

368
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,319
I noticed it's a little chilly so I wanted to put a blanket on you.

369
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,879
Thanks.

370
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,439
Sure.

371
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,479
You're tired. Get some rest.

372
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,999
I won't go anywhere.

373
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,399
Really?

374
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,319
What?

375
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,079
You haven't found them yet?!

376
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,839
What the hell were you guys doing?!

377
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,879
Also,

378
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,519
don't let my daughter have any marks or scratches on her.

379
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:12,879
As for Rome.

380
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,319
kill him when you see him

381
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,159
Why don't you knock before you enter?

382
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,399
Do I have to teach you?!

383
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,079
I'm sorry.

384
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,559
Sir.

385
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,319
know you resent Mr. Rome

386
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,719
But to want to kill him,

387
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,119
it's

388
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:49,719
What?

389
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,999
Are you worried about him?

390
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,879
Or do you want to die along with your former boss?

391
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:57,679
I'm...

392
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,039
I'm sorry.

393
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,479
I'm just curious

394
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,559
I'm not worried.

395
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,679
I swear to death

396
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,719
Don't be scared

397
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,519
As long as you're on my side

398
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,279
Ha I won't hurt you.

399
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,359
I'm on your-side, sir

400
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:29,919
Then...

401
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,399
show me your loyalty

402
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,399
Ms, Thip.

403
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,559
Mr s. P itplern

404
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,279
What's the matter?

405
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,079
Right now,

406
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:15,119
you're my husband's favorite woman

407
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,759
I need your help

408
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,559
With what?

409
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,879
Rome is in danger.

410
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,519
Ka molt at sent people to kill him

411
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,919
If you and l help each other persuade...

412
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,439
Ka molt at,

413
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,879
What are you guys scheming?!

414
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,399
lam comforting your new woman.

415
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,279
At your age

416
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,999
are you still lustful and don't want to stop?

417
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,759
Because l have an un as my wife

418
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,399
Sol had to find someone to help

419
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,719
You want to blame someone, blame yourself

420
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,199
You made me this way

421
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,039
Soon,

422
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,199
you will be leaving this world.

423
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,519
I'm begging you.

424
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,399
Leave some good deeds for those who are still alive to remember

425
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,519
Not constantly commit sins and karma

426
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,519
If you're asking me to spare Rome's life,

427
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,039
dream on!

428
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,479
Even if you go pray to Buddha

429
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,999
I'm not going to let him go!

430
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,399
He deserves only death

431
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,519
Sister.

432
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,839
Have you seen the girl in this photo before?

433
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,039
No.

434
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,319
Oh.

435
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,319
Thanks.

436
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,719
In the market,

437
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,279
no one has seen Tian or Boss

438
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,159
Hello.

439
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,439
Hi Dad. It's me Jane

440
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,439
Hey!

441
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,439
Jane!

442
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,039
How are you able to call me?

443
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,279
Listen up.

444
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,679
Did Boss and Tian go see you recently?

445
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,119
What's wrong?

446
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:33,839
Nothing.

447
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,359
What did you say earlier?

448
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,199
I asked if Boss and Tian went to see you recently

449
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,999
Why are you making me repeat myself?

450
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,039
Boss and Tian...

451
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,639
are in Bangkok!

452
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,559
Why would they come see me?

453
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,519
Boss ran away with Tian

454
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,239
I've been looking everywhere and can't find them.

455
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,679
Boss is being hunted down by Ka molt at right now

456
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,959
How do you know?

457
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,879
Bad signal!

458
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,679
I was just guessing.

459
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,399
You know the signal is bad here.

460
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:09,839
Dad.

461
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,639
Listen carefully to me.

462
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,639
If you hear anything from him

463
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,679
you have to tell me right away,got it?

464
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,719
Yeah!

465
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,359
I'm sorry.

466
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,399
I'm scared you might be worried.

467
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,399
So I didn't tell the truth

468
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,119
about taking Tian to hide from Ka molt at.

469
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,359
Ka molt at just keeps getting evil.

470
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,679
I guess he's upset that you and Tian helped us

471
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,879
But don't worry

472
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,919
We will protect you.

473
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:15,959
Be careful

474
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,679
Okay

475
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,119
It's pretty, right?

476
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,759
N If you like it,

477
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,359
we don't have to go overseas.

478
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,719
We'll live here,just the two of us

479
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,599
Over there,

480
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,839
we will build a pier bridge

481
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:39,759
Adjust the landfill to be a hill and J over there,

482
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,639
To the left,

483
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,199
we will grow vegetables.

484
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,359
To the right,

485
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,079
we will make a flower bed.

486
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:51,799
Sounds good?

487
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,279
If you move here

488
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,919
what about the factory, the house in Bangkok,

489
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,239
and the company?

490
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,399
Well,

491
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,319
have Lak and Pa handle it.

492
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,439
I'm tired of those businesses.

493
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,039
Besides,

494
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,999
there's a lot of pollution on land!

495
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,359
J rather be an islander or fisherman here.

496
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,879
That's true.

497
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,919
The beach here is pretty and peaceful

498
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,039
l'vealways dreamed of having a house by the beach.

499
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,439
Now,

500
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,319
it's come true.

501
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,079
Boss, food is almost done!

502
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,159
Pretty decent.

503
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,679
To my um fish soup?

504
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:47,719
Yes.

505
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,479
Flavor isn't so bad

506
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,679
Of course

507
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,559
Thom ya taught me

508
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,239
You will be amazed if you know what else I can do.

509
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,479
You always surprise me.

510
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,679
Boss, can you put some in a bowl?

511
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,759
I'll go wash my hands.

512
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,479
Okay.

513
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,919
Where did my phone go?

514
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,159
I threw it away.

515
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,999
We don't need to use the phone living here

516
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,919
But that's my phone.

517
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,599
You can't do that.

518
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,119
What do you need it for?

519
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,919
You don't need to contact anyone here

520
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,199
What will you do?

521
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,799
Who's they?

522
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,759
You heard me talking to Serm?

523
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,119
Tian.

524
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,759
Don't be scared!

525
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,879
No one is going to find us.

526
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,439
I promise.

527
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,119
I will protect you with my life.

528
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,599
What business do you guys have?

529
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,039
Ti heard that

530
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,159
you know Boss Rome

531
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,159
and Tian.

532
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:37,679
Is that right?

533
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,199
Whether I know or don't know,

534
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,999
it's none of your business

535
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,479
Since l talked nicely to you

536
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,999
and you didn't like it.

537
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,719
I'll have to use another method.

538
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,519
Let's go.

539
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,759
Wait.

540
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:02,759
Hey.

541
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,159
Where are you guys going?

542
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,039
If you take another step

543
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,279
I will call the police for trespassing!

544
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,239
Yeah!

545
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,279
Sit down first.

546
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,479
Let my men do the work.

547
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,639
Chuen!

548
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,319
Chiew!

549
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,759
Let them go in.

550
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,599
Don't get in their way.

551
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,079
Oh.

552
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:31,879
Move!

553
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,039
They're not here.

554
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,319
Let's go!

555
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,799
Do not let anyone in or out

556
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,279
Search every house!

557
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,239
Those that obstruct.

558
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,599
shoot them dead!

559
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,599
Come here!

560
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:00,479
Come!

561
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,679
Let go?!

562
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,479
They're not here either.

563
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,279
If you tell me,

564
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,439
I will reward you

565
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,399
Well?

566
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,319
I really don't know!

567
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,279
You're not lying?!

568
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,839
Pin.

569
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:27,999
Geez.

570
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,479
Look at you.

571
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,839
Small like her, she even got beaten up.

572
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,599
What should we do Chiew?!

573
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,799
I don't know.

574
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,839
I called the police.

575
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,559
But no one showed up.

576
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,599
Chiew, Chuen.

577
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,399
We're going to fight them.

578
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,159
That's right.

579
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,439
We're not scared

580
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,239
Hey!

581
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,759
This isn't a joke!

582
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,879
Do you not see all of them had a gun?!

583
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,599
You guys are n't scared?!

584
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,079
No.

585
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,239
If Jane and Tian were here,

586
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,479
they would tell us to fight!

587
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,919
Right guys?

588
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,959
Right!

589
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:10,879
Hey!

590
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,039
I think we should call Jane to come help.

591
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:14,679
Yeah.

592
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,359
Come on.

593
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,239
You can't!

594
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,479
You guys can't let Jane know

595
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:28,799
Chiew.

596
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,559
Yes?

597
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,319
Go get all the men in the village.

598
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,719
We're going to fight them!

600
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,679
I'm sorry Boss

601
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,199
But I don't want you and the others risking your lives for me again

602
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,039
Boss.

603
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,559
You really think you can get out of here in the middle of the night?

604
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,839
As for this handcuff

605
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,239
I have an extra copy of the key

606
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,439
I didn't know

607
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,359
that you're mad

608
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,359
and hate me this much

609
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,439
It's not like that Boss

610
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,479
But I don't want anyone to die or be in danger because of me again

611
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,599
Besides,

612
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,439
Mr. Kamol tat is really sick.

613
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,119
I don't know how long he'll live.

614
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,359
He's lying!

615
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,479
There will be no more revenge

616
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,199
Believe me just this once

617
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,999
Ka molt at lied to you so you can stay with him.

618
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,279
I know him well.

619
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:24,279
Whether it's true or not, let me prove it myself

620
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,199
Let me do my job as the daughter just once

621
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,039
Why would you want to do your job as the daughter to someone who's never been a father?!

622
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,279
He switched you with Kula chart

623
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,439
in exchange for the inheritance

624
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,079
He doesn't actually love you

625
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,399
Once he gets the inheritance.

626
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,519
he's going to kill you just like he did to Thon.

627
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,679
I won't let that happen.

628
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,079
So actually

629
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,559
you knew the truth from the beginning?

630
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,039
But you chose not to tell me.

631
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,919
You took me in

632
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,039
just to use me for revenge, right?

633
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,079
Am I understanding it correctly?

634
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,039
Tian.

635
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,359
It's...

636
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:37,999
Tian!

637
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,919
Wait Tian!

638
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,759
Tian, stop!

639
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,359
Tian!

640
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,039
I'm sorry.

641
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,479
You lied to me.

642
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,599
You used me.

643
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,239
No one is sincere with me

644
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,519
I can't even trust my biological parents.

645
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,079
Everyone lied to me!

646
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,039
All of you lied!

647
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,359
Yes.

648
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,039
I used you.

649
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,959
Once Thon died,

650
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,479
my heart was filled with vengeance.

651
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,839
But when you came in

652
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,479
nothing else mattered to me

653
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,839
Screw vengeance

654
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,519
Screw Ka molt at.

655
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,639
I just want you

656
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,679
I promise

657
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,479
from this very second til the day I die.

658
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,799
I won't lie to you again.

659
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,039
You're lying to me.

660
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,039
Tian.

661
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,279
You're hurting me!

662
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,719
Let me go!

663
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,439
- Let me go!
- Tian!

664
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:10,839
Tian!

665
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,719
What's wrong?

666
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,439
I stepped on something

667
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,839
It hurts!

668
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,079
Probably a sea nettle

669
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,559
Let's get back to the hut.

670
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,279
It's vinegar.

671
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,959
It'll sting a little.

672
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,399
Better?

673
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,879
Yes.

674
00:39:59,200 --> 00:39:59,999
Slowly.

675
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,359
I'm sorry Tian.

676
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,519
It's my fault.

677
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,479
You don't need to apologize

678
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:16,959
No.

679
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,839
It's all my fault.

680
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,439
I'm sorry.

681
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,719
I caused problems for you again.

682
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,999
I'm sorry.

683
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,439
My license :

684
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,639
What's this?

685
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:48,679
Get down from the car

686
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,119
There's no way out.

687
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,879
Be prepared to go be with your best friend, Kama it hon.

688
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,039
My last request

689
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,999
is to spare Tian's life.

690
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,079
Spare Tian's life?!

691
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,719
