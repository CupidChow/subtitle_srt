But today your embrace feels empty

00:00:35,423 --> 00:00:38,742
P The word love that doesn't seem sincere

6
00:00:39,143 --> 00:00:42,422
P The closer you get,the further you are away

15

When you said

16
00:01:34,383 --> 00:01:35,742
Tian's life is really important.

17
00:01:35,863 --> 00:01:36,942
What did you mean?

18
00:01:36,983 --> 00:01:37,942
Someday you will know.

19
00:01:37,983 --> 00:01:41,542
Kula chart has to fly to England to study business administration.

20
00:01:41,543 --> 00:01:46,102
develop the company and not disappoint everyone

21
00:01:46,223 --> 00:01:48,222
I managed to make him look good in public

22
00:01:48,263 --> 00:01:49,422
and look what he did!

23
00:01:49,583 --> 00:01:51,382
Who would do this?

24
00:01:51,463 --> 00:01:53,222
Must be people with bad intentions

25
00:01:53,263 --> 00:01:54,542
There are only a few months left

26
00:01:54,623 --> 00:01:56,502
before the will is due.

27
00:01:57,343 --> 00:01:58,182
I think

28
00:01:58,623 --> 00:02:00,102
you should prepare to celebrate.

29
00:02:02,183 --> 00:02:03,342
Who are you?!

30
00:02:04,623 --> 00:02:05,382
Stop!

31
00:02:05,383 --> 00:02:06,502
You wanna get hit like this?!

32
00:02:06,863 --> 00:02:08,062
Like this?!

33
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:08,982
Stop!

34
00:02:09,823 --> 00:02:10,662
Don't meddle!

35
00:02:16,143 --> 00:02:16,502
So,

36
00:02:17,143 --> 00:02:17,822
where did Tian go?

37
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:20,582
She didn't go with you?

38
00:02:22,143 --> 00:02:22,902
You dog!

39
00:02:23,263 --> 00:02:24,382
You can only beat up women.

40
00:02:28,143 --> 00:02:29,542
I need to teach you a lesson.

41
00:02:37,383 --> 00:02:38,022
Tian!

42
00:02:38,983 --> 00:02:39,822
What happened?

43
00:02:39,983 --> 00:02:40,862
Why did you hit him?

44
00:02:41,503 --> 00:02:42,782
That man

45
00:02:43,063 --> 00:02:44,582
was hurting this woman first

46
00:02:45,223 --> 00:02:48,022
I stopped him but he wouldn't listen sol had to teach him a lesson

47
00:02:48,103 --> 00:02:48,662
Tian!

48
00:02:49,183 --> 00:02:50,182
Look Boss!

49
00:02:57,103 --> 00:02:58,222
Mont ira?!

50
00:02:59,863 --> 00:03:00,502
See?

51
00:03:00,823 --> 00:03:02,262
I told you I saw her.

52
00:03:09,383 --> 00:03:09,902
You!

53
00:03:10,103 --> 00:03:10,902
Manager

54
00:03:11,463 --> 00:03:12,942
You need to be my witness.

55
00:03:13,423 --> 00:03:15,102
This woman tried to kill me.

56
00:03:15,183 --> 00:03:16,702
She kicked me in the water and l almost died

57
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:18,102
Please stay calm.

58
00:03:19,223 --> 00:03:20,622
Let's just talk this out

59
00:03:20,743 --> 00:03:21,822
Don't press charges.

60
00:03:22,143 --> 00:03:23,302
Let's come to an agreement.

61
00:03:25,263 --> 00:03:26,822
How much compensation do you want?

62
00:03:27,743 --> 00:03:29,062
It's wasting my time.

63
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:30,942
It's okay.

64
00:03:30,943 --> 00:03:32,582
Let's just end things here.

65
00:03:32,743 --> 00:03:35,902
It's probably a small misunderstanding

66
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,022
Yes, a misunderstanding.

67
00:03:38,143 --> 00:03:40,022
It's a trivial thing. Let's just end it here

68
00:03:40,063 --> 00:03:40,582
Shut up!

69
00:03:42,103 --> 00:03:43,182
You want to clear this?

70
00:03:43,463 --> 00:03:44,902
Wire50,000!

71
00:03:47,263 --> 00:03:48,822
can only give you 30,000.

72
00:03:49,543 --> 00:03:50,742
If you're not okay with that

73
00:03:51,223 --> 00:03:52,142
then go talk to the police.

74
00:03:53,623 --> 00:03:54,342
30,000?

75
00:03:54,383 --> 00:03:55,142
For what?

76
00:03:55,303 --> 00:03:56,662
Why are you giving it to him?

77
00:03:57,183 --> 00:04:00,822
You getting kicked like that, maxis500!

78
00:04:00,863 --> 00:04:01,462
Tian!

79
00:04:03,183 --> 00:04:04,142
You're being rude.

80
00:04:05,743 --> 00:04:06,822
You can't Rome.

81
00:04:08,183 --> 00:04:09,102
30,000?

82
00:04:10,303 --> 00:04:12,942
You have no wounds, Aren't you asking too much?

83
00:04:13,183 --> 00:04:14,022
It's not.

84
00:04:14,543 --> 00:04:15,502
It's to end his annoyance.

85
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:17,382
Manager.

86
00:04:17,623 --> 00:04:18,022
Yes?

87
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,422
I'll pay for the damages.

88
00:04:19,983 --> 00:04:20,862
Sure Mr. Rome

89
00:04:22,023 --> 00:04:22,422
Let's go.

90
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:37,742
That's enough Rome!

91
00:04:38,863 --> 00:04:40,462
Why are you so upset at Tian?

92
00:04:41,023 --> 00:04:42,182
Don't stop me.

93
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:44,062
This applies to you too.

94
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:45,662
How were you teaching Tian

95
00:04:45,943 --> 00:04:47,942
to let her keep punching and kicking people?

96
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:50,302
- Don't blame --
- Stop talking!

97
00:04:51,543 --> 00:04:53,022
You're being way too belligerent.

98
00:04:53,223 --> 00:04:53,982
Why?

99
00:04:54,303 --> 00:04:56,662
You can't stand seeing your ex with her new boyfriend?

100
00:05:06,143 --> 00:05:07,862
Don't talk to me like that Pa.

101
00:05:08,903 --> 00:05:11,702
You already know things between me and Mon ended a long time ago.

102
00:05:12,463 --> 00:05:14,422
-Who is Mon?
-Don't talk about other people.

103
00:05:14,943 --> 00:05:16,222
I haven't punished you yet.

104
00:05:16,703 --> 00:05:17,902
Tian already told you

105
00:05:18,103 --> 00:05:20,022
that guy was hurting Mon.

106
00:05:20,303 --> 00:05:22,742
Is there no better way than using violence

107
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:24,022
Boss.

108
00:05:24,343 --> 00:05:25,382
I was wrong.

109
00:05:25,423 --> 00:05:27,582
You can hit me or punish me however you want.

110
00:05:27,623 --> 00:05:28,662
But I'm begging you

111
00:05:29,503 --> 00:05:31,502
Don't be mad and argue with Pa.

112
00:05:31,903 --> 00:05:33,262
It's my fault.

113
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:37,862
It's alright.

114
00:05:38,023 --> 00:05:40,062
No one is hurt.

115
00:05:40,383 --> 00:05:40,822
Right?

116
00:05:41,063 --> 00:05:41,462
Come.

117
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,022
Let's go.

118
00:05:42,303 --> 00:05:45,062
Let's go rest. I've prepared your room and Tian's.

119
00:05:45,663 --> 00:05:46,102
No.

120
00:05:46,823 --> 00:05:47,622
I changed my mind.

121
00:05:48,423 --> 00:05:49,902
I'm taking Tian home right now.

122
00:05:53,143 --> 00:05:53,902
Rome!

123
00:05:57,183 --> 00:05:57,862
Look at him.

124
00:05:58,023 --> 00:06:00,262
Your best friend is becoming more belligerent everyday.

125
00:06:00,823 --> 00:06:02,062
I pity Tian.

126
00:06:04,183 --> 00:06:05,182
It's your fault.

127
00:06:05,623 --> 00:06:08,662
You shouldn't have said anything about Mon.

128
00:06:09,263 --> 00:06:11,782
You know that's Rome's weakness

129
00:06:13,663 --> 00:06:14,702
Speaking of Mon,

130
00:06:15,143 --> 00:06:16,782
why is she back haunting us?

131
00:06:16,983 --> 00:06:18,662
Should have gone to a good place by now.

132
00:06:22,623 --> 00:06:24,062
Why are you doing this to me?!

133
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,742
Are you siding with them?!

134
00:06:28,743 --> 00:06:29,342
Sam!

135
00:06:30,263 --> 00:06:32,422
I'm sorry.

136
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,822
I didn't know! I didn't mean to!

137
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:37,142
Sam!

138
00:07:23,183 --> 00:07:24,782
This is the resort you reserved?

139
00:07:28,703 --> 00:07:29,742
This is our bridal house.

140
00:07:29,903 --> 00:07:30,302
Huh?

141
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:43,782
Will you marry me, Mon?

142
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:47,342
Rome!

143
00:07:55,023 --> 00:07:58,742
Rome took out a10 million baht loan to buy this bridal house.

144
00:08:00,423 --> 00:08:01,702
Why a loan?

145
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:03,702
Don't worry

146
00:08:03,943 --> 00:08:07,862
The furniture business he took over for Dad is going great right now.

147
00:08:08,143 --> 00:08:10,022
There are orders that crossover from last year that production is being delayed.

148
00:08:10,143 --> 00:08:11,622
The loan is fine.

149
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:14,302
Hey,

150
00:08:15,063 --> 00:08:16,942
Are you gossiping about me, Pa?

151
00:08:17,943 --> 00:08:18,462
Mon

152
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,582
Don't listen to her She likes to tell lies.

153
00:08:21,223 --> 00:08:22,222
What lie?!

154
00:08:22,343 --> 00:08:24,422
J was praising my brother

155
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:26,382
Now you don't see the good in me.

156
00:08:27,503 --> 00:08:29,502
Oh, I was kidding.

157
00:08:31,943 --> 00:08:32,542
Pa.

158
00:08:32,623 --> 00:08:35,142
I'm going to Paris with Mon

159
00:08:35,503 --> 00:08:36,422
Do you want anything?

160
00:08:37,823 --> 00:08:39,222
Save your money,

161
00:08:39,783 --> 00:08:40,942
You have your wedding,

162
00:08:40,983 --> 00:08:43,302
and other things to buy for that house,no?

163
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:48,022
Rome,you don't have to do this much for me

164
00:08:48,463 --> 00:08:48,782
I can even live in a tiny hut.

165
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:58,502
So corny!

166
00:09:00,703 --> 00:09:03,102
Eat up, Don't feel corny.

167
00:09:13,743 --> 00:09:14,862
I have nothing left Mon.

168
00:09:19,983 --> 00:09:21,342
My father's factory..

169
00:09:24,663 --> 00:09:26,262
Mon! Mon!

170
00:09:28,263 --> 00:09:29,342
Please don't go.

171
00:09:30,343 --> 00:09:31,662
I will find a way.

172
00:09:33,103 --> 00:09:34,022
Find a way?

173
00:09:35,063 --> 00:09:36,622
The bridal house is about to get seized

174
00:09:37,463 --> 00:09:39,262
Your burned down factory didn't have insurance.

175
00:09:40,143 --> 00:09:41,542
What way will you find?

176
00:09:43,063 --> 00:09:43,942
I'll fix this crisis.

177
00:09:45,743 --> 00:09:47,782
Just don't leave me, okay?

178
00:09:48,703 --> 00:09:49,782
Please Mon.

179
00:09:50,303 --> 00:09:51,462
What about the wedding?

180
00:09:51,703 --> 00:09:52,342
What's it gonna be?

181
00:09:53,303 --> 00:09:54,942
We can postpone it to next year.

182
00:09:55,783 --> 00:09:56,742
Postpone?

183
00:09:57,383 --> 00:09:58,462
I can't!

184
00:09:59,023 --> 00:10:00,542
J passed out all the invitations already.

185
00:10:00,783 --> 00:10:02,942
All of them are celebrities :

186
00:10:02,983 --> 00:10:03,942
If we postpone it

187
00:10:04,023 --> 00:10:05,902
it will be humiliating for me.

188
00:10:09,223 --> 00:10:10,502
Just let her go Rome

189
00:10:10,983 --> 00:10:12,782
You know when someone loves you or not

190
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,302
is during times of hardship

191
00:10:14,903 --> 00:10:15,822
Hardship?

192
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,102
He's getting all his properties taken away

193
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,022
It's called going broke.

194
00:10:21,263 --> 00:10:22,102
In this life,

195
00:10:22,183 --> 00:10:24,142
J don't know if you're able to pay off all your debt

196
00:10:25,023 --> 00:10:26,382
Why are you saying that?

197
00:10:27,343 --> 00:10:29,142
I thought you said you can live in a tiny hut.

198
00:10:29,943 --> 00:10:31,822
What a shame I gave you my brother.

199
00:10:32,543 --> 00:10:33,622
People like you are...

200
00:10:34,783 --> 00:10:35,822
Pa, no!

201
00:10:35,863 --> 00:10:37,622

00:10:38,983 --> 00:10:39,582
Rome.

203
00:10:40,783 --> 00:10:41,542

204
00:10:42,543 --> 00:10:44,502
we are considered'strangers

205
00:11:39,543 --> 00:11:40,702
This is good stuff.

206
00:11:46,263 --> 00:11:47,062
Hi Dad.

207
00:11:49,023 --> 00:11:49,902
Where are you going?

208
00:11:50,703 --> 00:11:51,302
I'm...

209
00:11:52,303 --> 00:11:53,622
going to study English with friends

210
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:56,622
Study English?

211
00:11:58,103 --> 00:11:59,622
Take this as studying English!

212
00:12:01,063 --> 00:12:01,822
What's this?

213
00:12:02,063 --> 00:12:02,542
Come here!

214
00:12:02,543 --> 00:12:03,822
Come here. Sit.

215
00:12:07,463 --> 00:12:08,622
Open your eyes and look!

216
00:12:10,303 --> 00:12:11,542

Get up!

219
00:12:17,623 --> 00:12:18,222
What?

220
00:12:32,863 --> 00:12:33,422
What's this?

221
00:12:35,423 --> 00:12:36,302
Herbal inhaler.

222
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:38,902
There's a lot of PM 2.5 dust right now.

223
00:12:39,503 --> 00:12:40,382
It's for vertigo

224
00:12:41,503 --> 00:12:42,902
You think I'm stupid?

225
00:12:42,983 --> 00:12:43,502
Huh?!

226
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:44,982
Why?

227
00:12:45,623 --> 00:12:46,982
Did I do a bad job at raising you?

228
00:12:47,303 --> 00:12:49,222
Whatever you wanted, I gave it to you!

229
00:12:50,183 --> 00:12:51,822
Why are you so bad?

230
00:12:52,823 --> 00:12:54,382
I will make you quit.

231
00:12:56,983 --> 00:12:58,902
Mom, help me! Dad is going to kill me!

232
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:04,662
Mom!

233
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:06,102
That's enough!

234
00:13:06,143 --> 00:13:06,702
Enough!

235
00:13:06,743 --> 00:13:07,182
Mom.

236
00:13:07,223 --> 00:13:07,742
That's enough.

237
00:13:09,943 --> 00:13:11,782
Why do you have be so violent?

238
00:13:12,383 --> 00:13:13,142
This is little.

239
00:13:13,303 --> 00:13:14,302
This is considered little!

240
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:15,302
Get out the way!

241
00:13:15,743 --> 00:13:16,542
Stop!

242
00:13:17,743 --> 00:13:19,342
Why are you hitting him again?

243
00:13:19,463 --> 00:13:20,302
Look carefully.

244
00:13:20,423 --> 00:13:22,222
Your beloved son was doing drugs!

245
00:13:23,783 --> 00:13:24,822
Bad bloodline

246
00:13:25,543 --> 00:13:26,782

247
00:13:27,303 --> 00:13:28,382
Bloodline of a scum!

248
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,742
Scum's child this.

249
00:13:32,463 --> 00:13:33,822
Am I not yours on?

250
00:13:35,383 --> 00:13:36,342

00:13:37,423 --> 00:13:38,062

I will discipline him

256
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,542
Kula chart.

257
00:13:53,623 --> 00:13:55,782
Tell your father you will change.

258
00:13:55,903 --> 00:13:57,422
You won't upset him again.

259
00:13:59,623 --> 00:14:00,142
Fine.

260
00:14:01,063 --> 00:14:01,982
I want to quit too

You --

264
00:14:07,023 --> 00:14:07,582
Stop!

265
00:14:07,743 --> 00:14:08,462
-Help!
Stop!

266
00:14:09,743 --> 00:14:10,182
Hey!

267
00:14:10,303 --> 00:14:12,382
Don't meddle if you don't want him to die! Come here!

268
00:14:12,703 --> 00:14:13,142
Mom!

269
00:14:14,503 --> 00:14:15,062
Let me go!

270
00:14:15,343 --> 00:14:16,422
Don't come out!

271
00:14:16,943 --> 00:14:17,382
Let go!

272
00:14:21,223 --> 00:14:21,822
Mom!

273
00:14:23,263 --> 00:14:24,862
Mom, help me!

274
00:14:25,663 --> 00:14:26,862
What are you doing?

275
00:14:27,223 --> 00:14:28,422
I can't stand him anymore.

276
00:14:28,623 --> 00:14:29,822
If you can't discipline him,

277
00:14:30,023 --> 00:14:31,262
I will do it!

278
00:14:32,463 --> 00:14:33,622
Mom help me!

279
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:34,142
Mom!

280
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,142
Help me!

281
00:14:46,703 --> 00:14:47,342
Rome.

282
00:14:47,743 --> 00:14:48,822
Did you get back this morning?

283
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,262
thought you were sleeping over at Pa's house.

284
00:14:52,943 --> 00:14:53,822
where's Tian?

285
00:14:54,503 --> 00:14:56,422
Miss Tian is still in her room

286
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:58,382
Is she sick?

287
00:14:58,903 --> 00:15:01,502
Usually she is an early bird

288
00:15:01,743 --> 00:15:04,062
Ms, Thip said Miss Tian...

289
00:15:04,743 --> 00:15:07,502
got grounded by Mr. Rome

290
00:15:10,263 --> 00:15:11,382
What did Tian do?

291
00:15:11,783 --> 00:15:13,422
Why did you imprison her?

292
00:15:14,983 --> 00:15:15,942
grounded her.

293
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:17,982
I did not chain her up

294
00:15:18,103 --> 00:15:18,942
or locked the door.

295
00:15:19,703 --> 00:15:22,502
But I had to punish her by making her read in her room.

296
00:15:23,143 --> 00:15:24,262
Tian was drunk

297
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,782
She assaulted someone

298
00:15:28,783 --> 00:15:30,342
You are forbidden to talk to her.

299
00:15:31,023 --> 00:15:32,622
Don't take her out of the room too.

300
00:15:57,703 --> 00:15:58,862
Unbelievable

301
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:01,462
You went out for one night and already caused problems

302
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:06,622
I really don't understand why Mr, Rome took you in

303
00:16:08,103 --> 00:16:09,422
Thank you so much Ms. Thip.

304
00:16:09,863 --> 00:16:12,462
But you actually can let Je ab bring it to me.

305
00:16:12,703 --> 00:16:13,702
No need for the trouble.

306
00:16:20,863 --> 00:16:22,782
There will be more trouble for me

307
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:25,102
as long as you're still here.

309
00:18:26,703 --> 00:18:27,982
Means she doesn't wanna talk about it

310
00:18:40,143 --> 00:18:42,222
You want to send Kula chart to study abroad

311
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,662
Why didn't you tell me?

312
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:45,862
I'm telling you now

313
00:18:46,183 --> 00:18:47,822
He did his Visa already

314
00:18:48,063 --> 00:18:49,582
They accepted him already

315
00:18:49,743 --> 00:18:50,902
He's ready to go.

316
00:18:51,183 --> 00:18:52,862
Why so soon?

317
00:18:53,783 --> 00:18:54,942
What's the point in having money

318
00:18:55,183 --> 00:18:56,342
if you live a slow life?

319
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:58,422
But don't worry.

320
00:18:58,543 --> 00:19:01,262
I'm having my secretary Napa go with him

321
00:19:01,903 --> 00:19:03,702
If he doesn't change himself this time.

322
00:19:04,383 --> 00:19:05,942
I will (cut ties /with him

323
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:12,422
All the paperwork is done

324
00:19:15,183 --> 00:19:16,942
You just need to sign.

325
00:19:17,103 --> 00:19:17,902
Then it's done.

326
00:19:18,543 --> 00:19:20,142
I can then buy your ticket.

327
00:19:26,943 --> 00:19:27,862
I won't go!

328
00:19:28,343 --> 00:19:29,142
Don't bother me!

329
00:19:33,303 --> 00:19:35,022
You think I want to bother you?

330
00:19:35,343 --> 00:19:35,742
Huh?

331
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:39,182
am only following your father's orders.

332
00:19:41,103 --> 00:19:42,342
Just sign it.

333
00:19:42,743 --> 00:19:43,982
I have other things to do

334
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,182
Don't be complicated

335
00:19:47,343 --> 00:19:48,342
I won't go!

336
00:19:53,823 --> 00:19:54,742
Kula chart.

337
00:19:55,863 --> 00:19:56,622
Mom.

338
00:19:57,143 --> 00:19:57,942
Look at this.

339
00:19:58,303 --> 00:19:59,382
Dad doesn't love me anymore

340
00:19:59,663 --> 00:20:01,382
He's sending me overseas

341
00:20:01,703 --> 00:20:02,862
I don't wanna go!

342
00:20:03,103 --> 00:20:04,342
I hate English!

343
00:20:06,103 --> 00:20:07,382
I'm going to miss you

344
00:20:08,663 --> 00:20:10,382
Stay calm Kula chart.

345
00:20:11,703 --> 00:20:12,462
Miss.

346
00:20:12,943 --> 00:20:14,462
Can I speak with him alone?

347
00:20:15,143 --> 00:20:16,062
I think

348
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:17,902
it's too abrupt

349
00:20:18,623 --> 00:20:19,702
I can't.

350
00:20:20,143 --> 00:20:22,142
I have to follow Mr. Kamol tat'sorders.

351
00:20:23,863 --> 00:20:24,982
In that case,

352
00:20:25,223 --> 00:20:28,342
push it back to a few months.

353
00:20:28,423 --> 00:20:29,422
Mr s. P itplern

354
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:32,582
I know you love your son and is worried about him.

355
00:20:33,183 --> 00:20:36,302
But sometimes you have to stay strong for his future

356
00:20:36,943 --> 00:20:38,462
Spoiling him like this

357
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,222
won't do him any good

358
00:20:40,543 --> 00:20:41,622
You bitch!

359
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:43,222
How can you talk to my mom like that?!

360
00:20:43,663 --> 00:20:46,262
Don't think you're Dad's mistress,you can say whatever you want in here!

361
00:20:52,223 --> 00:20:52,822
I'm sorry.

362
00:20:54,823 --> 00:20:56,462
If lam the main wife and have a child,

363
00:20:57,343 --> 00:20:58,942
my child would be better than you

364
00:20:59,103 --> 00:20:59,822
Kula chart.

365
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:01,062
Crazy bitch!

366
00:21:01,423 --> 00:21:02,542
Is that a face or cement?!

367
00:21:02,543 --> 00:21:03,822
Kula chart!

368
00:21:04,343 --> 00:21:04,982
Mom!

369
00:21:05,943 --> 00:21:07,022
I didn't mean to!

370
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:08,222
Stop!

371
00:21:08,663 --> 00:21:09,662
What's going on here?!

372
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:10,982
This

373
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:12,102
It's Napa.

374
00:21:12,423 --> 00:21:14,062
She was talking bad about Mom!

375
00:21:14,743 --> 00:21:15,822
I stopped her but she won't listen.

376
00:21:16,863 --> 00:21:18,222
Fire her Dad!

377
00:21:32,023 --> 00:21:33,542
Why did you slap me?

378
00:21:34,263 --> 00:21:35,502
You crossed the line.

379
00:21:37,743 --> 00:21:38,542
But I --

380
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:39,462
Remember,

381
00:21:39,823 --> 00:21:41,142
don't be aggressive with my wife again.

382
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:42,782
Or else you're gonna get hit more!

383
00:21:44,863 --> 00:21:45,422
Okay.

384
00:21:47,263 --> 00:21:49,342
Take care of Chart's situation for me

385
00:21:50,623 --> 00:21:51,942
Do whatever you can to make him graduate.

386
00:21:52,343 --> 00:21:53,502
If he won't go to school,

387
00:21:53,543 --> 00:21:54,622
you have to go with him.

388
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:56,142
Once he graduates.

389
00:21:56,623 --> 00:21:57,862
you will get everything you want

390
00:22:00,303 --> 00:22:01,062
Yes, sir.

391
00:22:15,623 --> 00:22:16,422
Thank you Ms, Thip.

392
00:22:19,303 --> 00:22:20,222
Mr. Rome

393
00:22:21,023 --> 00:22:23,022
I want to talk to you about Tian

394
00:22:24,663 --> 00:22:25,342
What's the matter?

395
00:22:27,183 --> 00:22:28,182
I think this kid

396
00:22:28,343 --> 00:22:29,662
isn't ordinary

397
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:31,182
She's one thing in front of us.

398
00:22:31,463 --> 00:22:32,822
But behind our backs'she's another thing.

399
00:22:33,383 --> 00:22:35,222
I don't know how she,was raised.

400
00:22:35,663 --> 00:22:36,462
I think

401
00:22:37,143 --> 00:22:38,782
can't teach her anymore.

402
00:22:43,623 --> 00:22:46,062
t's probably about how she was raised like you said

403
00:22:49,023 --> 00:22:50,182
We need i to be calm

404
00:22:51,223 --> 00:22:52,382
and slowly teach her.

405
00:22:55,143 --> 00:22:56,102
I feel like

406
00:22:56,303 --> 00:22:58,902
this kid is very important to you.

407
00:22:58,983 --> 00:22:59,622
Yes.!

408
00:23:01,503 --> 00:23:02,862
That's why l asked you to help.

409
00:23:17,823 --> 00:23:18,742
I'm sorry!

410
00:23:18,783 --> 00:23:19,462
Mr, Rome!

411
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:20,982
I'm sorry.

412
00:23:21,023 --> 00:23:22,982
I'll wipe it for you.

413
00:23:24,103 --> 00:23:26,462
That's okay, I'll I do it.

414
00:23:26,783 --> 00:23:28,382
I'm so awful

415
00:23:28,663 --> 00:23:31,262
guess I stayed up too late last night.

416
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:33,582
Whatever...

417
00:23:34,263 --> 00:23:35,742
you want,

418
00:23:36,303 --> 00:23:38,262
I can do it for you

419
00:23:40,063 --> 00:23:40,902
Rome!

420
00:23:41,543 --> 00:23:43,622
I'll brew you a new one.

421
00:23:45,743 --> 00:23:46,342
Rome

422
00:23:46,463 --> 00:23:48,462
Read this. It just got posted

423
00:23:51,303 --> 00:23:53,502
Big entrepreneur, Ka molt at

00:23:57,023 --> 00:23:59,582
to study abroad, hoping to get a degree soon.

426
00:24:03,223 --> 00:24:04,262
We can't delay any longer.

427
00:24:05,143 --> 00:24:07,022
We need to change our plan or we'll be late.

428
00:24:07,943 --> 00:24:08,982
Late?

429
00:24:09,223 --> 00:24:09,702
Yes.

430
00:24:10,423 --> 00:24:11,302
Kula chart

431
00:24:12,103 --> 00:24:13,702
is about to be of legal age

432
00:24:14,463 --> 00:24:15,742
All of Taks as ut's assets

433
00:24:15,903 --> 00:24:17,262

to make it easy

437
00:24:25,023 --> 00:24:26,622
for him to get all the inheritance.

438
00:24:48,503 --> 00:24:49,502
Yes?

439
00:25:17,943 --> 00:25:19,422
You disobeyed my orders

440
00:25:20,343 --> 00:25:21,342
and talked to Lak?

441
00:25:23,903 --> 00:25:25,502
I wasn't talking.

442
00:25:26,103 --> 00:25:26,622
Well,

443
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:29,702
it's true Mr, Lak came to teach me English

444
00:25:30,383 --> 00:25:31,782
But we didn't talk at all

445
00:25:32,023 --> 00:25:34,542
We were writing on paper.

446
00:25:35,263 --> 00:25:37,342
I wouldn't dare disobey you.

447
00:25:39,743 --> 00:25:41,222
If you don't believe me,

448
00:25:41,863 --> 00:25:44,622
I can swear to have lightning strike on a dog.

449
00:25:54,903 --> 00:25:55,982
No dogs howling

450
00:25:57,783 --> 00:25:58,782
Means you're telling the truth

451
00:26:04,343 --> 00:26:05,262
Boss.

452
00:26:05,343 --> 00:26:07,782
You're no longer mad at me?

453
00:26:14,343 --> 00:26:16,542
Pack all your personal belongings

454
00:26:17,223 --> 00:26:19,662
and the clothes I bought you to travel.

455
00:26:24,143 --> 00:26:24,862
You...

456
00:26:25,823 --> 00:26:26,782
won't.

457
00:26:27,143 --> 00:26:28,862
let me stay here anymore?

458
00:26:29,383 --> 00:26:30,062
Yes.

459
00:26:34,743 --> 00:26:36,262
I'm taking you to Bangkok

460
00:26:39,263 --> 00:26:40,302
Bangkok?

461
00:26:41,103 --> 00:26:41,742
Why?

462
00:26:42,623 --> 00:26:43,422
You don't want to go?

463
00:26:45,183 --> 00:26:46,062
Bangkok?

464
00:26:48,103 --> 00:26:48,942
I do!

465
00:26:49,623 --> 00:26:51,062
I want to go to Bangkok!

466
00:26:51,103 --> 00:26:52,622
want to go anywhere that

467
00:26:52,863 --> 00:26:53,942
#
you go

468
00:26:54,623 --> 00:26:56,422
You're really taking me to Bangkok?

469
00:26:58,703 --> 00:27:00,462
I'm going to Bangkok?!

470
00:27:00,743 --> 00:27:04,182
Thank you! Thank you Boss! You're the nicest!

471
00:27:04,263 --> 00:27:04,902
Then.

472
00:27:05,303 --> 00:27:07,582
I'm going to go pack.

473
00:27:08,503 --> 00:27:09,302
Thank you!

474
00:27:13,663 --> 00:27:15,062
I send him to study in England

475
00:27:15,103 --> 00:27:18,702
people will see me as a devoted father

476
00:27:19,623 --> 00:27:22,142
Once he's of legal age and returns home,

477
00:27:22,343 --> 00:27:23,342
we can

478
00:27:24,023 --> 00:27:27,702
Have Kula chart sign a delegation of authority to you for all management work

479
00:27:29,263 --> 00:27:30,462
When he comes back

480
00:27:30,703 --> 00:27:32,142
graduate or not.

481
00:27:33,143 --> 00:27:34,062
Who cares?

482
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:37,542
I will open a crappy company for him to manage.

483
00:27:38,303 --> 00:27:40,502
Give him money so he can do drugs all day.

484
00:27:41,583 --> 00:27:42,822
If he makes any mistakes,

485
00:27:43,063 --> 00:27:44,702
it will look good for me

486
00:27:44,703 --> 00:27:46,222
of being the hero coming to his rescue.

487
00:27:47,463 --> 00:27:48,942
I'm afraid of one thing.

488
00:27:50,903 --> 00:27:51,662
What?

489
00:27:52,823 --> 00:27:55,702
Afraid he will get a wife and signs the marriage certificate

490
00:27:56,943 --> 00:27:58,622
There will be more problems for you

491
00:27:59,063 --> 00:28:01,102
And if they end up having a kid..

492
00:28:02,463 --> 00:28:06,262
your position will go down and will become the second heir

493
00:28:14,983 --> 00:28:17,982
You has to send your secretary to go be with Kula chart in England.

494
00:28:18,143 --> 00:28:21,982
That means you have high expectations from Kula chart.

495
00:28:22,183 --> 00:28:23,742
Is he going for a doctorate degree?

496
00:28:24,583 --> 00:28:28,662
That's up to him but he has my full support

497
00:28:28,943 --> 00:28:30,702
Is there a specific university you're eyeing?

498
00:28:31,983 --> 00:28:33,102
Bachelor's in America

499
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:34,782
Master's in England

500
00:28:35,143 --> 00:28:36,622
Then my doctorate degree in Koh Kong.

501
00:28:36,783 --> 00:28:37,742
Cambodia.

502
00:28:40,263 --> 00:28:41,942
My son is a funny kid.

503
00:28:42,783 --> 00:28:46,022
I was going to ask if you will come back to open a casino?

504
00:28:46,463 --> 00:28:48,222
I want to open a massage parlor instead

505
00:28:50,703 --> 00:28:51,782
You see how much humor he has?

506
00:28:54,263 --> 00:28:57,942
Can we take some pictures of the father and son?

507
00:28:57,983 --> 00:28:58,982
Scoot closer please.

508
00:28:59,543 --> 00:29:01,262
Excuse us now.

509
00:29:01,303 --> 00:29:05,742
It's almost time. I!have to get Mr. Kula chart checked in at Do n Mueang airport

510
00:29:05,823 --> 00:29:08,902
Okay Safe travels then.

511
00:29:10,983 --> 00:29:12,502
If you don't graduate,

512
00:29:12,943 --> 00:29:15,382
you will receive a punishment that you least expect.

513
00:29:15,423 --> 00:29:16,582
You bastard son!

514
00:29:28,063 --> 00:29:29,102
Wait here.

515
00:29:29,103 --> 00:29:30,222
Watch Tian too

516
00:29:30,463 --> 00:29:31,102
As for you Lak.

517
00:29:31,343 --> 00:29:32,022
come with me

518
00:29:32,383 --> 00:29:33,702
Find a car to come pick us up.

519
00:29:34,223 --> 00:29:36,382
I can't get a hold of them. Don't know if they're on their way or not

520
00:29:36,823 --> 00:29:37,342
Okay.

521
00:29:44,463 --> 00:29:45,982
Tian, do you want a burger?

522
00:29:47,063 --> 00:29:48,342
can't.

523
00:29:49,183 --> 00:29:51,542
I can't eat anything or else it's gonna come right back up.

524
00:29:52,703 --> 00:29:55,102
Wait here, I'll be back.

525
00:30:06,143 --> 00:30:06,662
b uwa

526
00:30:06,823 --> 00:30:07,582
buu a Yes sir?

527
00:30:08,583 --> 00:30:09,502
Sure.

528
00:30:09,983 --> 00:30:11,222
I'm on my way

529
00:30:12,623 --> 00:30:14,062
I will make it on time.

530
00:30:14,423 --> 00:30:14,982
Yes.

531
00:30:15,503 --> 00:30:16,782
Yes, bye.

532
00:30:18,743 --> 00:30:19,262
Pat.

533
00:30:19,503 --> 00:30:22,742
Go back to the company and get the document on my desk

534
00:30:23,023 --> 00:30:25,702
Then hurry to see me at Director Suw it's house.

535
00:30:27,063 --> 00:30:27,662
I'll leave it to you.

536
00:30:27,863 --> 00:30:28,462
Yes, sir.

537
00:30:28,503 --> 00:30:29,302
Where's the key?

538
00:30:30,423 --> 00:30:30,942
Here.

539
00:30:32,063 --> 00:30:32,622
Thanks.

540
00:30:54,503 --> 00:30:55,502
What the hell?!

541
00:31:02,183 --> 00:31:02,942
Pa.

542
00:31:04,183 --> 00:31:05,102
Boss.

543
00:31:50,143 --> 00:31:51,222
What's wrong with your car?

544
00:31:53,423 --> 00:31:55,622
I don't know. It won't start

545
00:31:57,183 --> 00:31:58,662
Can I take a look?

546
00:32:07,743 --> 00:32:08,942
Where did Tian go?

547
00:32:14,663 --> 00:32:16,222
She doesn't have a cell phone

548
00:32:23,343 --> 00:32:24,502
Rome is waiting in the car.

549
00:32:25,023 --> 00:32:25,702
So,

550
00:32:25,703 --> 00:32:26,302
where's Tian?

551
00:32:27,223 --> 00:32:28,622
I don't know where she went.

552
00:32:30,543 --> 00:32:31,982
Try starting it now.

553
00:32:50,423 --> 00:32:51,342
It works!

554
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:53,622
You're really good

555
00:32:55,543 --> 00:32:56,262
Thanks a lot.

556
00:32:58,983 --> 00:33:00,182
How did you do it?

557
00:33:00,583 --> 00:33:02,382
The power plug was loose.

558
00:33:03,623 --> 00:33:04,462
Thanks again.

559
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:05,462
But...

560
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:07,342
how could you fix cars?

561
00:33:08,143 --> 00:33:09,662
My dad taught me.

562
00:33:10,903 --> 00:33:11,862
What does your dad do?

563
00:33:12,983 --> 00:33:14,342
He was a gardener.

564
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:17,382
He opened a car shop back home so I was able to help him

565
00:33:17,783 --> 00:33:18,182
Okay.

566
00:33:18,303 --> 00:33:19,862
- I'll give you some money.

567
00:33:20,183 --> 00:33:20,782
So,

568
00:33:21,023 --> 00:33:22,782
where do you live and who do you live with?

569
00:33:22,823 --> 00:33:23,342
Boss.

570
00:33:24,143 --> 00:33:25,462
If you'll excuse me!

571
00:33:26,503 --> 00:33:27,142
Young lady!

572
00:33:32,383 --> 00:33:33,022
Huh?

573
00:33:33,983 --> 00:33:35,062
How did she go missing?

574
00:33:37,063 --> 00:33:37,662
No need.

575
00:33:37,983 --> 00:33:38,782
I'l go back.

576
00:33:43,263 --> 00:33:44,142
Boss.

577
00:33:45,743 --> 00:33:46,302
Tian.

578
00:33:46,303 --> 00:33:46,742
Hey!

579
00:33:47,103 --> 00:33:48,262
Where were you?

580
00:33:49,583 --> 00:33:50,142
So,

581
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:52,422
why are your hands dirty like this?

582
00:33:53,503 --> 00:33:56,582
I was looking for you and Pa but couldn't find you.

583
00:33:57,183 --> 00:34:00,302
But l saw someone whose car broke down sol went to help them.

584
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:02,942
You're too much.

585
00:34:03,543 --> 00:34:06,222
Do you know other people were worried and went looking for you?

586
00:34:07,103 --> 00:34:07,742
Who do you think you are?

587
00:34:08,903 --> 00:34:12,102
A charity foundation that you have to help everyone all the time?

588
00:34:12,983 --> 00:34:14,062
Didn't I tell you

589
00:34:14,503 --> 00:34:16,102
not to meddle in people's business?

590
00:34:19,903 --> 00:34:20,422
Go.

591
00:34:20,423 --> 00:34:21,022
Get in the car.

592
00:34:24,543 --> 00:34:25,942
Hey Lak, I found Tian.

593
00:34:26,143 --> 00:34:27,302
Yeah. Go to the car

594
00:34:29,863 --> 00:34:30,782
Mr. Rome.

595
00:34:36,503 --> 00:34:37,422
Boss

596
00:34:37,903 --> 00:34:40,062
I think it's too short

597
00:34:43,223 --> 00:34:45,822
Don't stare at me, I'm shy.

598
00:34:46,343 --> 00:34:48,422
I never wore anything this short before.

599
00:34:48,943 --> 00:34:51,102
But this is a skort Miss

600
00:34:51,183 --> 00:34:52,142
It's safe

601
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,142
We'll take this

602
00:35:04,183 --> 00:35:05,822
Where are you taking me?

603
00:35:05,983 --> 00:35:07,862
Why have me dressed like this?

604
00:35:09,823 --> 00:35:10,982
Excuse me.

605
00:35:11,223 --> 00:35:12,382
Please come this way.

606
00:35:18,343 --> 00:35:19,782
You're going to play golf?

607
00:35:20,943 --> 00:35:21,822
Not me.

608
00:35:22,743 --> 00:35:23,742
But you are

609
00:35:24,063 --> 00:35:24,502
Huh?!

610
00:35:24,703 --> 00:35:25,542
Me?!

611
00:35:26,223 --> 00:35:27,622
Why are you being loud?

612
00:35:27,703 --> 00:35:29,302
Just do what l tell you to do.

613
00:35:30,783 --> 00:35:32,382
I never played golf before

614
00:35:32,623 --> 00:35:34,382
At home, I usually hit mosquitoes.

615
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:42,782
Here.

616
00:35:43,503 --> 00:35:45,222
Your golf club.

617
00:35:55,423 --> 00:35:56,182
It's not hard.

618
00:35:58,223 --> 00:36:00,222
Hold it firmly.

619
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:02,782
Like this, Okay.

620
00:36:02,783 --> 00:36:03,462
Posture..

621
00:36:05,583 --> 00:36:06,982
Spread my legs out a little

622
00:36:07,023 --> 00:36:08,342
Bend a little.

623
00:36:09,263 --> 00:36:10,502
Yes, correct.

624
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:14,022
To hit it,

625
00:36:15,263 --> 00:36:16,102
you have to..

626
00:36:16,583 --> 00:36:17,862
look at the line.

627
00:36:18,663 --> 00:36:20,262
Put the club against the ball.

628
00:36:20,343 --> 00:36:21,902
and swing for the hole ahead

629
00:36:22,823 --> 00:36:24,462
Like this and go slowly.

630
00:36:26,423 --> 00:36:28,462
Do this when you swing it.

631
00:36:29,783 --> 00:36:30,342
Can you do it?

632
00:36:33,143 --> 00:36:33,822
Try.

633
00:36:43,143 --> 00:36:44,182
That's your first swing?

634
00:36:45,143 --> 00:36:46,702
You have skills.

635
00:36:46,743 --> 00:36:47,422
Really?

636
00:36:47,703 --> 00:36:49,942
Then can I hit it again?

637
00:36:50,663 --> 00:36:51,102
Yeah.

638
00:36:51,663 --> 00:36:53,902
Stay here, I'll be back

639
00:36:54,983 --> 00:36:56,182
Where are you going?

640
00:36:58,063 --> 00:36:59,862
To do some business around here.

641
00:37:00,703 --> 00:37:02,102
Stay here,don't go anywhere.

642
00:37:02,143 --> 00:37:02,742
Okay?

643
00:37:03,303 --> 00:37:03,902
Sure.

644
00:37:12,783 --> 00:37:13,942
Are you sure you investigated?

645
00:37:14,263 --> 00:37:16,142
Ive looked everywhere at the sports club and l don't see him.

646
00:37:17,503 --> 00:37:18,142
What?

647
00:37:19,103 --> 00:37:20,342
Try looking at the golf course?

648
00:37:22,503 --> 00:37:23,302
Okay.

649
00:37:24,943 --> 00:37:29,142
7birdies in 18 holes. You still have the skills, Director

650
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,022
That's too much of a compliment

651
00:37:36,903 --> 00:37:39,862
As for the mega project on the plot of lands near the sea,

652
00:37:39,943 --> 00:37:40,582
don't worry.

653
00:37:43,023 --> 00:37:44,702
It was because of you

654
00:37:45,103 --> 00:37:47,102
that I was able to get that plot of land.

655
00:37:49,143 --> 00:37:50,342
Don't talk here.

656
00:37:50,623 --> 00:37:51,662
It'll become news.

657
00:37:54,503 --> 00:37:55,342
It's late.

658
00:37:55,423 --> 00:37:56,622
I have to go pick up my grandchild.

659
00:37:57,463 --> 00:37:58,222
Sure.

660
00:37:58,303 --> 00:37:59,182
Bye.

661
00:38:14,423 --> 00:38:15,062
Young gir k.

662
00:38:15,223 --> 00:38:16,382
Do you want me to teach you?

663
00:38:19,903 --> 00:38:21,582
Did you not see someone here?!

664
00:38:21,663 --> 00:38:22,862
Who knows if you broke my leg or not.

665
00:38:23,383 --> 00:38:24,262
I'm sorry.

666
00:38:24,703 --> 00:38:25,662
I didn't mean to.

667
00:38:27,343 --> 00:38:28,982
Pay for the damage.

668
00:38:31,543 --> 00:38:33,702
I don't have money for you

669
00:38:34,503 --> 00:38:36,302
Then go get your parents.

670
00:38:38,223 --> 00:38:39,422
Or else lim telling the cops.

671
00:38:40,543 --> 00:38:41,542
Hurry!

672
00:38:43,063 --> 00:38:44,422
Where is Boss?

673
00:38:53,343 --> 00:38:54,142
Are you hurt?

674
00:38:55,823 --> 00:38:56,422
You!

675
00:38:56,743 --> 00:38:57,302
Sir,

676
00:39:00,543 --> 00:39:01,902
I'm sorry too.

677
00:39:02,063 --> 00:39:02,902
Are you hurt?

678
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:04,342
No.

679
00:39:08,503 --> 00:39:11,622
The man who got hit with the golf club only has bruises.

680
00:39:12,423 --> 00:39:13,542
I informed him already

681
00:39:13,583 --> 00:39:18,022
to get checked out at the hospital and that you're willing to pay his bills.

682
00:39:18,703 --> 00:39:19,662
But once he knew

683
00:39:19,903 --> 00:39:21,742
that the chairman of TS Group

684
00:39:21,983 --> 00:39:23,462
was the young lady's guardian

685
00:39:24,423 --> 00:39:26,102
he withdrew his complaint.

686
00:39:26,383 --> 00:39:29,342
He also said he knows your reputation well.

687
00:39:30,983 --> 00:39:31,942
Thanks a lot.

688
00:39:45,023 --> 00:39:46,262
Thank you so much

689
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:48,262
It would be bad for me if it wasn't for you

690
00:39:50,463 --> 00:39:53,062
I'm happy to see you again.

691
00:39:53,863 --> 00:39:55,702
It's a small world

692
00:39:56,503 --> 00:39:58,102
Who did you come with?

693
00:39:58,183 --> 00:39:59,062
Your parents?

694
00:39:59,503 --> 00:40:00,262
No.

695
00:40:00,463 --> 00:40:01,302
I came with..

696
00:40:02,383 --> 00:40:03,382
my guardian.

697
00:40:05,743 --> 00:40:07,302
We'll probably meet soon

698
00:40:08,463 --> 00:40:09,222
Are you hungry?

699
00:40:09,343 --> 00:40:10,662
You can order.

700
00:40:11,023 --> 00:40:11,702
My treat.

701
00:40:12,503 --> 00:40:15,342
Consider me returning the favor for helping me.

702
00:40:16,503 --> 00:40:16,902
I just don't like seeing people struggle

703
00:40:18,903 --> 00:40:19,782
If there's anything I can help with, I will help

704
00:40:21,663 --> 00:40:23,902
I don't expect anything in return.

705
00:40:26,543 --> 00:40:28,382
I'm jealous of your parents.

706
00:40:29,543 --> 00:40:32,222
They have a sweet and beautiful daughter.

707
00:40:33,023 --> 00:40:35,542
Kind-hearted, has generosity

708
00:40:38,143 --> 00:40:39,982
My parents died.

709
00:40:41,863 --> 00:40:42,462
Really?

710
00:40:44,903 --> 00:40:45,942
I'm sorry.

711
00:40:46,783 --> 00:40:48,422
We have n't introduced each other yet.

712
00:40:48,903 --> 00:40:49,862
What's your name?

713
00:40:50,623 --> 00:40:51,462
My name is --

714
00:40:51,503 --> 00:40:51,982
Tian!

715
00:41:00,703 --> 00:41:01,782
Mr, Ka molt at

716
00:41:07,543 --> 00:41:09,702
I feel too considerate already

717
00:41:09,863 --> 00:41:11,142
You even dropped me off.

718
00:41:13,183 --> 00:41:15,142
Wake up, student.

719
00:41:15,783 --> 00:41:17,582
Do you want to get punished by the teacher again?

720
00:41:19,543 --> 00:41:21,182
Whoever hurts Boss,

721
00:41:21,263 --> 00:41:23,142
that means they hurt me too

722
00:41:23,303 --> 00:41:24,982
I will not surrender to them

723
00:41:25,103 --> 00:41:26,382
Take me to see him

724
00:41:26,463 --> 00:41:27,302
