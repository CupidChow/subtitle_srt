I'm very interested in that kid.

20
00:01:36,383 --> 00:01:37,742
We can join forces.

21
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:42,582
Mr K a molt at told me to come take you home.

22
00:01:42,623 --> 00:01:43,702
So you can get ready

23
00:01:44,063 --> 00:01:45,102
for an event tonight.

24
00:01:47,103 --> 00:01:48,422
Your job today

25
00:01:48,743 --> 00:01:50,542
is to impress everyone at the event.

26
00:01:51,463 --> 00:01:52,142
Take this.

27
00:01:58,383 --> 00:02:01,502
I had to quickly buy this place

28
00:02:01,703 --> 00:02:03,822
because l want it to be an engagement gift

29
00:02:03,983 --> 00:02:07,062
for my son and Tian,

30
00:02:07,943 --> 00:02:10,342
the child under Mr, Rome Pak an ant's care.

31
00:02:13,623 --> 00:02:15,742
Will you marry me, Candle?

32
00:02:17,023 --> 00:02:17,702
You're crazy!

33
00:02:17,863 --> 00:02:19,022
Who wants to marry you?

34
00:02:31,263 --> 00:02:31,622
Hey.

35
00:02:32,063 --> 00:02:32,782
0000

36
00:02:45,703 --> 00:02:48,582
Thank you so much Mr. Ka molt at

37
00:02:49,263 --> 00:02:50,582
for respecting me and Tian

38
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:53,142
I'd like to rejoice in your merit

39
00:02:54,343 --> 00:02:55,382
that you

40
00:02:55,863 --> 00:02:57,942
are doing for the orphans

41
00:02:58,943 --> 00:03:00,902
Which should alleviate the sins

42
00:03:01,503 --> 00:03:02,982
that you have caused.

43
00:03:04,343 --> 00:03:05,022
more or less.

44
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:11,422
As for the engagement.

45
00:03:12,463 --> 00:03:13,582
since Tian

46
00:03:13,983 --> 00:03:17,222
is a noble daughter who was entrusted to my care

47
00:03:18,183 --> 00:03:20,342
if she was to have a partner, I would.

48
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,022
have to take it more into consideration.

49
00:03:23,863 --> 00:03:24,422
Those.

50
00:03:24,823 --> 00:03:26,102
with a good front

51
00:03:27,303 --> 00:03:28,502
but rotten back

52
00:03:29,783 --> 00:03:30,862
I won't accept.

53
00:03:51,263 --> 00:03:52,662
I'd like to buy the condo

54
00:03:52,943 --> 00:03:54,782
for Tian at the same price

55
00:03:55,783 --> 00:03:57,222
and donate money

56
00:03:57,703 --> 00:03:59,462
to orphans without a home

57
00:04:00,103 --> 00:04:01,822
in the amount of one million baht

58
00:04:19,263 --> 00:04:19,862
Dad.

59
00:04:20,503 --> 00:04:21,822
Why didn't it go according to plan?

60
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,622
Why did you give in to Rome?

61
00:04:24,663 --> 00:04:25,822
lim embarrassed!

62
00:04:26,023 --> 00:04:29,022
Soon,people are going to start talking how we're incompetent.

63
00:04:30,423 --> 00:04:32,182
Just let Tian go.

64
00:04:32,623 --> 00:04:34,622
It's a matter of fate.

65
00:04:34,863 --> 00:04:35,382
Pit!

66
00:04:36,023 --> 00:04:38,102
You think fate is playing a trick on us?

67
00:04:39,063 --> 00:04:41,622
Don't make me say anything more.

68
00:04:41,903 --> 00:04:42,982
You know that well.

69
00:04:43,463 --> 00:04:44,342
So therefore,

70
00:04:44,783 --> 00:04:46,862
don't commit anymore karma with them.

71
00:04:46,983 --> 00:04:48,502
Listen carefully to me.

72
00:04:49,383 --> 00:04:50,742
Karma is from our actions

73
00:04:51,183 --> 00:04:54,262
What I am today is because I made it.

74
00:04:55,183 --> 00:04:56,662
Whoever does it first, wins first.

75
00:04:58,303 --> 00:04:59,182
What are you guys talking about?

76
00:04:59,423 --> 00:05:00,462
I don't understand!

77
00:05:00,863 --> 00:05:02,822
So will I get to marry Candle?

78
00:05:05,183 --> 00:05:06,142
Mr. Ka molt at.

79
00:05:07,743 --> 00:05:09,182
You and your mom go wait for me in the car.

80
00:05:10,103 --> 00:05:12,262
-What about --
-I said go wait for me in the car!

81
00:05:13,903 --> 00:05:14,542
Fine.

82
00:05:18,503 --> 00:05:19,582
I don't understand!

83
00:05:19,623 --> 00:05:20,942
What was that about?

84
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:28,102
I didn't imagine Rome would be this dedicated to the kid like this.

85
00:05:29,183 --> 00:05:30,542
We both lost in this round.

86
00:05:31,663 --> 00:05:33,422
But if we don't give up.

87
00:05:34,103 --> 00:05:35,582
if you still love Rome,

88
00:05:35,943 --> 00:05:38,462
maybe you have to lose something to win something.

89
00:05:39,263 --> 00:05:40,382
What do you mean?

90
00:05:41,543 --> 00:05:42,382
You'll know soon.

91
00:05:43,303 --> 00:05:44,702
Look Mr. Ka molt at.

92
00:05:44,903 --> 00:05:46,422
Let me ask you seriously.

93
00:05:46,783 --> 00:05:48,822
You're taking Tian from Rome

94
00:05:49,023 --> 00:05:52,062
because you have a personal vendetta with him don't you?

95
00:05:53,063 --> 00:05:53,822
Ms. Mon.

96
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,502
I for gave him a long time ago.

97
00:05:57,303 --> 00:05:58,422
But after this day.

98
00:05:58,463 --> 00:06:01,462
if anything bad were to happen to him,

99
00:06:02,103 --> 00:06:03,662
it's because of karma

100
00:06:03,783 --> 00:06:05,302
and bad luck.

101
00:06:13,183 --> 00:06:16,262
K AVE

102
00:06:16,263 --> 00:06:18,782
Did you really have to buy the condo?

103
00:06:21,303 --> 00:06:22,342
I signed the contract already

104
00:06:22,943 --> 00:06:24,502
Besides, this condo

105
00:06:24,863 --> 00:06:25,862
has a good location.

106
00:06:27,143 --> 00:06:28,622
But it's such a waste of money

107
00:06:28,783 --> 00:06:29,982
It costed a lot.

108
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:34,702
If Ka molt at wants to show off how rich he is then let him

109
00:06:34,943 --> 00:06:37,782
Because regardless, I am not marrying that douche.

110
00:06:40,143 --> 00:06:42,542
Do you think someone like me is poor and inferior

111
00:06:43,463 --> 00:06:45,302
that I can't compete with Ka molt at?

112
00:06:46,383 --> 00:06:48,622
You think he's better and richer than me?

113
00:06:49,423 --> 00:06:51,462
I don't mean that.

114
00:06:52,343 --> 00:06:54,462
But I'm just worried about you.

115
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:03,702
What is it Bee?

116
00:07:05,463 --> 00:07:06,782
There's a gas leak Boss.

117
00:07:07,303 --> 00:07:08,542
What do we do?

118
00:07:08,823 --> 00:07:10,222
I don't know what to do now!

119
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:12,342
Evacuate everyone out of there immediately!

120
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,862
I'll call and ask for help.

121
00:07:14,023 --> 00:07:16,622
K AVE

122
00:07:16,623 --> 00:07:17,742
What happened?
AVE

123
00:07:23,223 --> 00:07:24,262
Tian.

124
00:07:25,063 --> 00:07:26,262
You came home alone?

125
00:07:26,503 --> 00:07:27,982
Where's Rome?

126
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,462
Driving to Ranong.

127
00:07:31,023 --> 00:07:32,062
Tonight?

128
00:07:32,783 --> 00:07:33,182
So...

129
00:07:33,943 --> 00:07:35,102
what's so urgent?

130
00:07:35,903 --> 00:07:37,302
I don't know either.

131
00:07:37,463 --> 00:07:38,982
Boss didn't tell me anything.

132
00:07:42,743 --> 00:07:44,422
You just want to defeat Rome.

133
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:45,342
I know.

134
00:07:45,703 --> 00:07:49,262
But is it to the point of having to bet on Kula chart's future?

135
00:07:51,543 --> 00:07:52,342
Gosh.

136
00:07:53,103 --> 00:07:55,142
Chart is just a self-centered kid!

137
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:56,742
He's spoiled.

138
00:07:57,943 --> 00:07:59,342
He's like that because of you.

139
00:07:59,463 --> 00:08:00,862
You spoil him too much

140
00:08:01,623 --> 00:08:02,862
But I think

141
00:08:03,303 --> 00:08:04,902
if Tian becomes his wife,

142
00:08:05,463 --> 00:08:07,942
he might become a better person

143
00:08:08,503 --> 00:08:09,382
Tian can tame him.

144
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:10,822
You saw it yourself

145
00:08:11,223 --> 00:08:13,782
What about your conflict with Rome?

146
00:08:14,303 --> 00:08:17,902
I see that it's getting worse and worse everyday

147
00:08:18,463 --> 00:08:20,382
What I'm doing

148
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,702
is for the sake of reconciliation and strengthening our relationship

149
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:27,022
If two big families become in laws,

150
00:08:27,103 --> 00:08:28,502
the conflict will end.

151
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:29,622
Look.

152
00:08:29,983 --> 00:08:31,462
I was willing to lose face

153
00:08:31,703 --> 00:08:33,342
You should be taking my side

154
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,062
There's Napa and her baby

155
00:08:36,343 --> 00:08:37,582
What will you do?

156
00:08:39,183 --> 00:08:40,942
Napa and I have come to an agreement

157
00:08:41,303 --> 00:08:42,622
I will handle everything.

158
00:08:42,903 --> 00:08:46,622
I as sure you Napa's situation will not be a problem for us anymore.

159
00:09:05,543 --> 00:09:07,302
I was willing to give Rome a chance.

160
00:09:07,943 --> 00:09:09,342
But he still humiliated me.

161
00:09:10,823 --> 00:09:12,102
I will corner him

162
00:09:12,383 --> 00:09:13,622
and leave him with no options

163
00:09:15,623 --> 00:09:16,742
What about your job?

164
00:09:17,183 --> 00:09:18,542
Did you burn his factory down yet?

165
00:09:21,703 --> 00:09:24,262
Rome has insurance.

166
00:09:25,263 --> 00:09:25,942
As of now,

167
00:09:26,463 --> 00:09:28,542
I took care of the ammonia.

168
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:29,702
I made it leak

169
00:09:31,463 --> 00:09:32,182
This time,

170
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:34,742
Rome will completely go broke.

171
00:09:36,103 --> 00:09:36,942
Hurry!

172
00:09:38,023 --> 00:09:40,502
Support the people out of here.

173
00:09:41,503 --> 00:09:42,342
Help out!

174
00:09:44,423 --> 00:09:46,022
I thought you were in Ranong.

175
00:09:46,143 --> 00:09:47,982
What did Rome force you to do this time?

176
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,142
Her name is Napa.

177
00:09:53,623 --> 00:09:55,382
She was Ka mol tat's secretary.

178
00:09:57,023 --> 00:09:57,742
Also,

179
00:09:58,463 --> 00:09:59,742
she was hurt by them.

180
00:10:00,943 --> 00:10:01,822
Ka molt at?!

181
00:10:02,423 --> 00:10:04,022
What the hell is wrong with Rome again?!

182
00:10:04,263 --> 00:10:06,142
Why does he like seeking problems for himself?

183
00:10:06,863 --> 00:10:07,542
I know.

184
00:10:09,103 --> 00:10:11,022
What's more worrisome than Nap a's condition

185
00:10:11,823 --> 00:10:17,102
is that if the people that assaulted her know that she is still alive

186
00:10:17,623 --> 00:10:18,702
it'll be a problem for us.

187
00:10:22,103 --> 00:10:23,742
How is she doing?

188
00:10:26,823 --> 00:10:28,582
Her brain lacked oxygen for a short period of time

189
00:10:28,823 --> 00:10:30,142
Luckily we saved her in time

190
00:10:30,943 --> 00:10:34,222
Her body is responding better to the treatment.

191
00:10:34,983 --> 00:10:36,062
Nothing to worry about now.

192
00:10:47,823 --> 00:10:48,782
Pao.

193
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:52,302
Hey!

194
00:10:53,063 --> 00:10:54,702
That's Rome's factory!

195
00:10:55,623 --> 00:10:56,542
What happened?

196
00:10:59,903 --> 00:11:00,222
Bee.

197
00:11:01,903 --> 00:11:02,582
How did it go?

198
00:11:03,903 --> 00:11:05,942
The authorities were able to control the situation

199
00:11:07,943 --> 00:11:08,502
Pardon me

200
00:11:08,823 --> 00:11:10,982
Can we open up like usual tomorrow?

201
00:11:11,263 --> 00:11:14,022
Not yet. We have to wait for the remaining toxins to be gone from the area first.

202
00:11:14,463 --> 00:11:15,182
How long?

203
00:11:15,623 --> 00:11:17,902
We have to assess first No less than two weeks

204
00:11:19,223 --> 00:11:23,182
Important ordersthatneed tobe delivered
we haven't produced half of them yet.

205
00:11:23,463 --> 00:11:24,902
What are we going to do?

206
00:11:25,383 --> 00:11:27,142
If we can't open up the factory like this

207
00:11:27,183 --> 00:11:28,902
we'll be in trouble.

208
00:11:33,183 --> 00:11:34,102
Boss! Boss!

209
00:11:34,263 --> 00:11:35,142
Boss!

210
00:11:37,103 --> 00:11:38,342
I know who did it.

211
00:11:45,783 --> 00:11:46,502
Whatever you know,

212
00:11:46,863 --> 00:11:47,862
tell me everything.

213
00:11:50,263 --> 00:11:51,062
It's Mann.

214
00:11:51,783 --> 00:11:52,862
Mann forced..

215
00:11:53,303 --> 00:11:54,982
us to drink with him.

216
00:11:59,223 --> 00:12:00,262
Mann is a good person.

217
00:12:01,063 --> 00:12:02,542
He shouldn't have done this to me.

218
00:12:03,903 --> 00:12:05,382
Did someone'order him to do it?

219
00:12:08,023 --> 00:12:09,382
Go all out!

220
00:12:09,543 --> 00:12:10,662
No need to pay.

221
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:12,382
Someone like you

222
00:12:12,743 --> 00:12:14,462
can afford to treat us to drinks?

223
00:12:14,863 --> 00:12:17,422
Gosh Uncle, U have a supplier

224
00:12:17,423 --> 00:12:19,782
Just drink up. Don't be difficult. It's free.

225
00:12:20,263 --> 00:12:21,222
SECUR Cheers!
SECUR

226
00:12:21,263 --> 00:12:21,782
SECUR Fine.
SECUR

227
00:12:21,903 --> 00:12:22,542
SECUR Sis :

228
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,262
The money for all the drinks on that table

229
00:12:27,143 --> 00:12:28,182
Thank you.

230
00:12:29,863 --> 00:12:31,022
Someone we don't know

231
00:12:31,463 --> 00:12:32,662
paid for his drinks.

232
00:12:33,383 --> 00:12:34,702
But listening to the description,

233
00:12:35,183 --> 00:12:36,582
it's not someone local.

234
00:12:38,743 --> 00:12:39,062
Do you know where Mann is right now?

235
00:12:42,903 --> 00:12:43,662
Ever since the incident,

236
00:12:43,783 --> 00:12:44,662
he just disappeared

237
00:12:45,903 --> 00:12:47,382
He probably worked with the perpetrator.

238
00:12:48,463 --> 00:12:48,822
It's fine.

239
00:12:49,383 --> 00:12:50,262
I'll handle it.

240
00:12:51,543 --> 00:12:52,142
When we catch Mann,

241
00:12:53,703 --> 00:12:54,902
we will then know the truth.

242
00:12:56,103 --> 00:12:56,742
Well,

243
00:12:57,103 --> 00:12:59,062
we have to apologize to you

244
00:12:59,463 --> 00:13:01,782
for committing a serious mistake.

245
00:13:02,343 --> 00:13:04,542
Drinking while on the job

246
00:13:04,623 --> 00:13:05,862
and while on patrol.

247
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:07,222
Um...

248
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,942
You won't fire us will you?

249
00:13:11,343 --> 00:13:11,702
Next time

250
00:13:13,383 --> 00:13:14,062
don't let this happen again.

251
00:13:16,263 --> 00:13:17,222
Yes Boss

252
00:13:17,543 --> 00:13:18,222
Thank you!

253
00:13:26,663 --> 00:13:27,022
Huh?!

254
00:13:27,103 --> 00:13:27,822
What?

255
00:13:33,423 --> 00:13:38,102
Officials have successfully closed the ammonia valve that was leaking from the frozen food factory.

256
00:13:38,183 --> 00:13:40,182
But there are still remaining residues in the system

257
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:43,022
The firefighters have used water spray.
-That's Mr, Rome's factory.

258
00:13:43,103 --> 00:13:45,342
...to reduce the concentration of ammonia.

259
00:13:45,383 --> 00:13:49,982
From where I'm standing now, there's still a lingering smell of ammonia in the air.

260
00:13:50,343 --> 00:13:54,222
Residents in the area had to evacuate from the area to go stay at a nearby temple.

261
00:13:54,383 --> 00:13:57,262
A team of doctors from Ranong went to observe their symptoms

262
00:13:57,343 --> 00:14:01,142
in case some people may experience side effects from inhaling ammonia.

263
00:14:01,143 --> 00:14:01,462
BREAKING NEWS

264
00:14:01,463 --> 00:14:05,062
BREAKi NG The estimated damage is no less than 150 million baht

265
00:14:08,703 --> 00:14:10,622
Mr. Rome is in trouble.

266
00:14:12,623 --> 00:14:13,422
Boss.

267
00:14:22,383 --> 00:14:22,942
Tian.

268
00:14:22,983 --> 00:14:23,782
Where are you going?

269
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:24,582
Let go.

270
00:14:24,623 --> 00:14:25,822
I'm gonna go help Boss.

271
00:14:26,183 --> 00:14:27,582
I can't let you go.

272
00:14:28,063 --> 00:14:28,862
If you go,

273
00:14:29,103 --> 00:14:30,462
you can't help Rome anyway.

274
00:14:31,023 --> 00:14:31,502
But...

275
00:14:35,623 --> 00:14:37,062
He lost his products

276
00:14:38,063 --> 00:14:39,422
and will be sued for the damages ON FWS

277
00:14:39,703 --> 00:14:40,302
Good.

278
00:14:40,943 --> 00:14:42,142
So he'll know

279
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:45,102
he shouldn't be arrogant with someone like me

280
00:14:45,623 --> 00:14:49,982
Now I just have to sit and wait for him to come begging me.

281
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:52,422
It won't be long.

282
00:14:53,863 --> 00:14:54,662
Pat.

283
00:14:55,503 --> 00:14:56,782
What about that worker?

284
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:58,022
How are you looking after him?

285
00:14:58,623 --> 00:15:00,182
I sent someone to go visit him already

286
00:15:05,103 --> 00:15:06,022
I'm done.

287
00:15:07,103 --> 00:15:07,822
Boss.

288
00:15:11,663 --> 00:15:12,342
It's me.

289
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,222
You act like you just saw a ghost.

290
00:15:16,143 --> 00:15:17,702
No. It's just...

291
00:15:17,743 --> 00:15:21,022
I was cleaning up the house. I didn't think you would show up here.

292
00:15:23,183 --> 00:15:24,022
Is Mann home?

293
00:15:25,343 --> 00:15:26,062
No.

294
00:15:26,103 --> 00:15:26,662
No!

295
00:15:26,863 --> 00:15:27,622
He went...

296
00:15:28,543 --> 00:15:31,142
He went to visit his mother in Chaiyaphum. She's sick.

297
00:15:31,503 --> 00:15:32,262
For how long?

298
00:15:32,903 --> 00:15:34,022
He left many days ago.

299
00:15:37,823 --> 00:15:38,342
If Mann'comes back,

300
00:15:40,063 --> 00:15:40,862
tell him to call me right away.

301
00:15:42,623 --> 00:15:44,502
I need to talk to him about an important matter.

302
00:15:44,943 --> 00:15:45,982
Yes Boss.

303
00:16:05,343 --> 00:16:06,142
-Mann!
-Gun!

304
00:16:16,023 --> 00:16:16,502
Damn!

305
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:17,062
Let's go!

306
00:16:31,863 --> 00:16:32,542
Mann.

307
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:38,982
Boss.

308
00:16:40,823 --> 00:16:41,382
Mann!

309
00:16:41,383 --> 00:16:42,182
Stay with me.

310
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:43,662
I'm taking you to the hospital

311
00:16:45,783 --> 00:16:46,942
They...

312
00:16:47,303 --> 00:16:48,422
hired me to do it.

313
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:53,582
Opening the ammonia valve at the factory?

314
00:16:53,983 --> 00:16:55,022
He...

315
00:16:55,103 --> 00:16:56,182
is from Bangkok.

316
00:17:00,503 --> 00:17:01,142
took...

317
00:17:03,943 --> 00:17:05,022
his photo

318
00:17:06,223 --> 00:17:07,022
Don't talk

319
00:17:07,423 --> 00:17:08,542
Let's go to the hospital first

320
00:17:09,943 --> 00:17:10,262
Kaew...

321
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:11,982
has cancer.

322
00:17:12,983 --> 00:17:14,182
I had to do it.

323
00:17:17,223 --> 00:17:19,022
Please forgive me.

324
00:17:20,103 --> 00:17:20,742
Boss :

325
00:17:26,103 --> 00:17:26,782
Mann!

326
00:17:38,903 --> 00:17:40,142
Ka mol tat's subordinate

327
00:17:44,303 --> 00:17:46,062
So it was you who did it.

328
00:17:52,143 --> 00:17:52,902
Gosh!

329
00:17:55,183 --> 00:17:56,302
Boss.

330
00:17:56,383 --> 00:17:58,662
When you can,please call me back.

331
00:17:58,743 --> 00:18:00,422
Im very worried about you

332
00:18:03,063 --> 00:18:05,142
Mr. Rome has lots of business to do

333
00:18:06,103 --> 00:18:07,582
Why call to bother him?

334
00:18:10,463 --> 00:18:12,102
I'm just worried about him.

335
00:18:12,503 --> 00:18:14,982
I want to hear updates on him.

336
00:18:16,783 --> 00:18:17,702
Why are you worried?

337
00:18:18,343 --> 00:18:20,222
He has to work.

338
00:18:20,503 --> 00:18:22,622
He can'thang with you all the time

339
00:18:27,343 --> 00:18:28,142
Hello.

340
00:18:28,543 --> 00:18:29,342
It's me.

341
00:18:30,903 --> 00:18:31,862
Mister...

342
00:18:32,983 --> 00:18:33,862
Ka molt at?

343
00:18:42,023 --> 00:18:42,582
Yes

344
00:18:43,023 --> 00:18:43,382
Look.

345
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:44,982
Don't hang up just yet.

346
00:18:45,223 --> 00:18:47,142
I have an important matter to discuss with you.

347
00:18:47,783 --> 00:18:48,542
It's about Rome.

348
00:18:49,063 --> 00:18:50,662
Say what you need to say

349
00:18:51,223 --> 00:18:54,502
You probably know by now that Rome lost millions in money.

350
00:18:54,783 --> 00:18:55,302
Huh?

351
00:18:56,103 --> 00:18:57,702
Why did he lose the money?

352
00:18:59,103 --> 00:18:59,542
Hey,

353
00:18:59,983 --> 00:19:01,302
he didn't tell you yet?

354
00:19:01,943 --> 00:19:05,022
A gas leaked a t his factory in Ranong.

355
00:19:05,423 --> 00:19:07,102
If he can't deliver his products on time,

356
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,222
there will be a lawsuit.

357
00:19:11,103 --> 00:19:13,222
Even if that happens,it'll be fine.

358
00:19:13,503 --> 00:19:15,542
Boss is a good and skillful person

359
00:19:15,703 --> 00:19:17,462
He will fix the problem.

360
00:19:19,943 --> 00:19:21,782
It's good that you think that way.

361
00:19:22,423 --> 00:19:24,142
I'm just worried

362
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:26,902
He had to spend money on buying the condo

363
00:19:27,143 --> 00:19:28,782
then spend money on the lawsuit

364
00:19:29,503 --> 00:19:30,502
It's over a hundred million.

365
00:19:33,903 --> 00:19:34,462
Yes.

366
00:19:34,503 --> 00:19:35,462
Over a hundred million.

367
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,382
With so much money like that.

368
00:19:37,823 --> 00:19:39,982
would be tired too if it were me.

369
00:19:40,743 --> 00:19:41,182
Hey.

370
00:19:41,983 --> 00:19:44,142
Please tell Rome that I'm worried about him

371
00:19:45,263 --> 00:19:48,302
If there's anything I can do to help, I am happy to do it.

372
00:19:49,663 --> 00:19:50,782
Most importantly

373
00:19:51,263 --> 00:19:52,542
Pit pler n and I

374
00:19:53,063 --> 00:19:54,502
adore you and are worried about you.

375
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,662
We're afraid you might have to struggle with him.

376
00:20:12,383 --> 00:20:13,302
Mr. Lak!

377
00:20:14,503 --> 00:20:15,262
Let's go!

378
00:20:17,103 --> 00:20:17,622
Tian.

379
00:20:17,903 --> 00:20:18,902
Take it easy.

380
00:20:19,183 --> 00:20:20,622
Talk it out.

381
00:20:21,143 --> 00:20:22,422
We have to pack up.

382
00:20:22,463 --> 00:20:23,982
We have to go see Boss right now.

383
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:24,462
Hurry.

384
00:20:24,503 --> 00:20:25,022
Tian.

385
00:20:25,503 --> 00:20:26,262
Why are we going?

386
00:20:26,743 --> 00:20:28,462
Rome will scold you if you go.

387
00:20:29,223 --> 00:20:30,142
Mr, Lak.

388
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:31,742
Boss is in trouble right now.

389
00:20:31,823 --> 00:20:33,822
He's getting sued.

390
00:20:33,863 --> 00:20:35,222
How can we stay calm?

391
00:20:35,383 --> 00:20:36,702
How do you know about this?

392
00:20:36,983 --> 00:20:37,822
Who told you?

393
00:20:38,703 --> 00:20:39,382
Ka molt at.

394
00:20:39,543 --> 00:20:41,262
He called and told me everything

395
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,542
That dude again.

396
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:45,302
Tian.

397
00:20:46,303 --> 00:20:47,782
You need to stay calm.

398
00:20:48,143 --> 00:20:49,182
Don't believe him so much

399
00:20:49,543 --> 00:20:52,222
J think we should wait and hear the news from Rome.

400
00:20:52,943 --> 00:20:54,662
I have to get to the school now.

401
00:20:54,903 --> 00:20:57,302
I have to go supervise the guards guarding the things they destroyed.

402
00:20:57,503 --> 00:20:58,982
We'll talk when I get back

403
00:20:59,663 --> 00:21:00,142
But...

404
00:21:00,503 --> 00:21:01,662
Mr, Lak...

405
00:21:07,663 --> 00:21:08,822
Boss.

406
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:19,902
I'm just worried.

407
00:21:20,223 --> 00:21:22,662
He had to spend money on buying the condo

408
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,542
then spend money on the lawsuit.

409
00:21:25,023 --> 00:21:26,062
It's over a hundred million.

410
00:21:53,303 --> 00:21:55,702
8na4960

411
00:21:55,703 --> 00:21:56,102
8n4960

412
00:21:56,103 --> 00:21:56,902

413
00:21:57,943 --> 00:21:58,582
Ms. Mon.

414
00:22:01,503 --> 00:22:02,702
Where are you going?

415
00:22:05,063 --> 00:22:06,342
am going to Ranong.

416
00:22:06,943 --> 00:22:07,702
Ranong?

417
00:22:07,983 --> 00:22:10,782
Why do you have to climb over the gate?

418
00:22:11,823 --> 00:22:13,262
I'm worried about Boss

419
00:22:13,383 --> 00:22:15,582
There's a problem with his factory right now.

420
00:22:16,263 --> 00:22:18,302
How come no one is going with you?

421
00:22:18,343 --> 00:22:19,582
How can you go alone?

422
00:22:21,823 --> 00:22:24,062
Everyone at home are all busy.

423
00:22:24,263 --> 00:22:26,662
I can't just sit around and wait for news.

424
00:22:27,103 --> 00:22:29,382
I wanted to take the bus to go see him.

425
00:22:30,743 --> 00:22:31,582
Mon.

426
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:34,622
lim begging you, Please don't tell anyone at home yet.

427
00:22:34,823 --> 00:22:36,662
I will call and let them know myself

428
00:22:38,903 --> 00:22:39,942
Wait Tian.

429
00:22:53,183 --> 00:22:53,822
Tian.

430
00:22:53,943 --> 00:22:56,582
Let me use the restroom and put in gas first.

431
00:22:56,863 --> 00:22:59,742
Don't be impatient. I will quickly drop you off.

432
00:22:59,783 --> 00:23:00,622
One moment.

433
00:23:00,703 --> 00:23:01,422
Okay.

434
00:23:25,943 --> 00:23:27,062
Tian is with me

435
00:23:27,463 --> 00:23:30,382
If you want Kula chart to get with her...

436
00:23:41,023 --> 00:23:42,022
Kula chart.

437
00:23:42,823 --> 00:23:44,182
What's the hurry son?

438
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,462
Dad called me

439
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:47,982
and said l should go take care of his future daughter in law.

440
00:23:49,743 --> 00:23:50,742
Tian?

441
00:23:50,943 --> 00:23:52,022
Correct!

442
00:23:52,263 --> 00:23:53,342
Candle

443
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:54,742
or my beloved Tian.

444
00:23:54,863 --> 00:23:56,262
My whole heart.

445
00:23:56,983 --> 00:23:57,982
Kula chart.

446
00:23:58,343 --> 00:23:59,662
Whatever you do,

447
00:23:59,903 --> 00:24:01,222
think it through first

448
00:24:01,703 --> 00:24:02,582
Gosh Mom.

449
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,622
I won't disappoint you and Dad.

450
00:24:05,183 --> 00:24:05,942
Just wait and see

451
00:24:06,143 --> 00:24:07,022
This time

452
00:24:07,223 --> 00:24:08,862
Tian will accept my love.

453
00:24:09,623 --> 00:24:11,182
Just prepare the khan mak for me.

454
00:24:26,103 --> 00:24:27,022

00:24:29,223 --> 00:24:32,062
Sit and wait here, I'll go buy you your ticket

456
00:24:32,063 --> 00:24:32,622
Sure.
Jara

457
00:24:32,663 --> 00:24:33,102
Okay.

458
00:24:33,663 --> 00:24:34,222
Jara

459
00:24:44,703 --> 00:24:46,382
Tian is waiting at the transport station.

460
00:24:47,023 --> 00:24:47,902
Come here quickly.

461
00:24:52,623 --> 00:24:53,302
u arda

462
00:24:59,383 --> 00:25:02,502
Surprise my Candle!

463
00:25:02,943 --> 00:25:03,342
Hey.

464
00:25:03,663 --> 00:25:04,542
How did you get here?

465
00:25:05,983 --> 00:25:07,662
It's destiny.

466
00:25:10,703 --> 00:25:12,502
Do you wanna get kicked in front of people?

467
00:25:12,983 --> 00:25:14,222
Gosh Tian.

468
00:25:14,343 --> 00:25:16,182
Why are you so cruel to me?

469
00:25:16,743 --> 00:25:17,982
dropped off a friend here

470
00:25:18,343 --> 00:25:20,542
I saw you sitting here so I came to say hi

471
00:25:23,783 --> 00:25:24,902
A coincidence like this,

472
00:25:25,383 --> 00:25:27,622
perhaps we are soulmates.

473
00:25:28,303 --> 00:25:29,982
Don't bother me!

474
00:25:30,023 --> 00:25:30,942
Tian!

475
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:35,462
To Ranong please

476
00:25:35,543 --> 00:25:38,262
The bus just left five minutes ago.

477
00:25:38,823 --> 00:25:40,942
What time does the next one leave?

478
00:25:41,063 --> 00:25:41,862
One moment.

479
00:25:43,343 --> 00:25:44,942
Next one is full.

480
00:25:45,063 --> 00:25:47,382
Do you want to reserve the next one after?

481
00:25:47,423 --> 00:25:49,702
It'll be about two hours

482
00:25:49,983 --> 00:25:51,342
before the bus get into queue.

483
00:25:51,663 --> 00:25:52,822
Two hours?

484
00:25:57,503 --> 00:26:00,822
I will check other routes that go through Ranong. Please have a seat first.

485
00:26:01,023 --> 00:26:01,662
" Okay

486
00:26:18,023 --> 00:26:19,182
With my honor.

487
00:26:19,343 --> 00:26:20,622
I promise you

488
00:26:20,703 --> 00:26:23,782
I will drop you off at your destination safe and sound

489
00:26:24,063 --> 00:26:24,862
Two,

490
00:26:25,503 --> 00:26:26,382
along the way,

491
00:26:26,463 --> 00:26:28,022
I will not do anything to you

492
00:26:28,303 --> 00:26:29,102
If I do --

493
00:26:29,143 --> 00:26:30,022
Enough!

494
00:26:34,463 --> 00:26:35,662
I'll let you drop me off.

495
00:26:37,103 --> 00:26:37,862
But one,

496
00:26:38,783 --> 00:26:41,102
do not touch me.

497
00:26:43,023 --> 00:26:43,782
Two,

498
00:26:44,263 --> 00:26:46,062
stay at least-two people away from me.

499
00:26:47,103 --> 00:26:48,582
It's a distance that I...

500
00:26:49,023 --> 00:26:50,822
am able to fight in close combat.

501
00:26:51,383 --> 00:26:53,662
If you mess up, you will get hurt.

502
00:26:54,743 --> 00:26:55,182
Okay,

503
00:26:55,783 --> 00:26:58,422
I remember how you kick and punch

504
00:27:09,543 --> 00:27:11,542
DO NOT DISTURB

505
00:27:14,463 --> 00:27:15,902
Getting more arrogant everyday.

506
00:27:16,543 --> 00:27:18,222
You think I want to get involved with you?

507
00:27:42,783 --> 00:27:43,782
It's auto gear

508
00:27:43,863 --> 00:27:44,662
No need to keep touching it.

509
00:27:45,743 --> 00:27:46,462
Okay.

510
00:27:52,223 --> 00:27:55,462
Chart, up ahead at the gas pump, there's a restaurant.

511
00:27:55,503 --> 00:27:57,582
Can you stop there? lim hungry.

512
00:27:57,783 --> 00:27:59,142
Just hang in there for a bit.

513
00:27:59,303 --> 00:28:00,462
Once we enter the city.

514
00:28:00,623 --> 00:28:01,862
we can stop at a hotel.

515
00:28:02,983 --> 00:28:04,102
There's air conditioner

516
00:28:04,463 --> 00:28:05,702
Good vibes

517
00:28:06,383 --> 00:28:07,902
Gosh Tian.

518
00:28:07,983 --> 00:28:08,862
I meant

519
00:28:09,263 --> 00:28:11,262
we can go to a coffee shop inside the hotel instead!

520
00:28:11,503 --> 00:28:13,142
The vibe is much better than on the side of the road

521
00:28:13,943 --> 00:28:15,942
I like the flavors from that restaurant

522
00:28:16,183 --> 00:28:17,342
You got a problem?

523
00:28:18,623 --> 00:28:19,542
No.

524
00:28:20,303 --> 00:28:21,262
As you wish then.

525
00:28:24,183 --> 00:28:25,942
l'dlike one stir-fried glass noodles

526
00:28:26,783 --> 00:28:28,022
one to my um goong,

527
00:28:28,783 --> 00:28:30,382
and.

528
00:28:30,783 --> 00:28:31,742
stir-fried vegetables

529
00:28:32,263 --> 00:28:32,902
Okay.

530
00:28:33,263 --> 00:28:34,582
Order more Tian.

531
00:28:34,823 --> 00:28:36,822
It's once in a while that I treat you.

532
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:38,902
Thank you so much Chart

533
00:28:38,943 --> 00:28:41,542
But I think that will get me full already

534
00:28:41,903 --> 00:28:43,782
If'you want to order more,go ahead

535
00:28:45,783 --> 00:28:46,782
Then...

536
00:28:47,543 --> 00:28:50,182
can I get two fried rice and one fried chicken?

537
00:28:50,943 --> 00:28:51,502
Okay.

538
00:29:05,943 --> 00:29:07,022
What's that bottle Tian?

539
00:29:07,463 --> 00:29:10,022
Why do you have to wrap it in a handkerchief?

540
00:29:11,143 --> 00:29:12,502
It's herbal medicine

541
00:29:12,663 --> 00:29:14,702
I bought it to give it to Boss

542
00:29:15,463 --> 00:29:19,702
But they said if a man drinks it, he'll feel excited and pleased!

543
00:29:21,143 --> 00:29:24,062
But l don't understand what that actually means though

544
00:29:26,143 --> 00:29:28,022
I'm going to go use the restroom first.

545
00:29:28,343 --> 00:29:28,982
Go ahead.

546
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:32,662
To arouse.

547
00:29:38,823 --> 00:29:39,942
May I serve you water?

548
00:29:40,063 --> 00:29:40,822
Go ahead.

549
00:30:07,903 --> 00:30:08,822
Remember.

550
00:30:09,343 --> 00:30:11,462
Take advantage of Tian.

551
00:30:12,023 --> 00:30:13,222
This is your last chance.

552
00:30:13,743 --> 00:30:14,462
When you get back,

553
00:30:14,543 --> 00:30:15,542
you can get married.

554
00:30:18,823 --> 00:30:19,422
Is this a good idea?

555
00:30:26,503 --> 00:30:27,262
I can't.

556
00:30:29,223 --> 00:30:30,102
Having sex when one is sleeping,

557
00:30:30,743 --> 00:30:32,062
you won't feel anything Dad.

558
00:30:33,143 --> 00:30:33,782
You don't know anything.

559
00:31:13,343 --> 00:31:14,702
Excited and pleased!

560
00:31:15,503 --> 00:31:16,662
No matter how hard you fight.

561
00:31:16,703 --> 00:31:18,342
I am not scared!

562
00:31:19,223 --> 00:31:20,422
Here we go!

563
00:31:20,943 --> 00:31:22,862
From night to morning.

564
00:31:27,143 --> 00:31:28,262
Here is'your food

565
00:31:55,063 --> 00:31:56,062
Put it all away.

566
00:31:56,383 --> 00:31:56,822
Okay.

567
00:32:03,143 --> 00:32:03,862
Ms. Thip.

568
00:32:04,023 --> 00:32:05,062
What's there to eat?

569
00:32:05,463 --> 00:32:07,942
I'm so hungry l can faint.

570
00:32:08,663 --> 00:32:10,262
I was just putting the food away.

571
00:32:10,543 --> 00:32:12,622
I thought you wouldn't make it back home to eat.

572
00:32:13,463 --> 00:32:13,942
Je ab.

573
00:32:14,503 --> 00:32:15,662
Warm it up for him

574
00:32:21,303 --> 00:32:22,302
Why is Tian calling?

575
00:32:23,063 --> 00:32:23,702
Ms. Thip.

576
00:32:24,103 --> 00:32:25,382
Has Tian eaten yet?

577
00:32:27,703 --> 00:32:28,982
She locked herself in the room.

578
00:32:29,423 --> 00:32:31,302
She put up the do not disturb sign.

579
00:32:31,623 --> 00:32:33,262
So I didn't want to bother her

580
00:32:33,543 --> 00:32:35,662
She will think I'm bothering and controlling her again.

581
00:32:45,103 --> 00:32:45,622
Tian.

582
00:32:47,663 --> 00:32:48,502
Let's eat.

583
00:33:01,543 --> 00:33:02,542
There's a problem Ms. Thip!

584
00:33:02,743 --> 00:33:04,022
Tian went outside!

585
00:33:04,903 --> 00:33:06,102
She's not in her room?

586
00:33:06,263 --> 00:33:07,102
No.

587
00:33:09,103 --> 00:33:10,302
She must have went to Ranong.

588
00:33:33,503 --> 00:33:34,502
You troublemaker.

589
00:33:34,863 --> 00:33:38,542
I hope this time you get kidnapped and get sold.

590
00:33:49,583 --> 00:33:51,022
You'l I just stress thinking about it.

591
00:33:51,903 --> 00:33:52,382
You'll get high blood pressure again.

592
00:33:54,143 --> 00:33:54,982
I think

593
00:33:56,023 --> 00:33:58,382
you should tell the police everything.

594
00:33:59,343 --> 00:34:00,742
Tell them as much as you can.

595
00:34:02,063 --> 00:34:02,742
True.

596
00:34:03,263 --> 00:34:05,262
We shouldn't be defensive like this.

597
00:34:05,783 --> 00:34:07,342
He might be planning his next attack

598
00:34:07,623 --> 00:34:10,062
We can't be at ease with someone evil like Ka molt at.

599
00:34:11,063 --> 00:34:12,462
I'm not scared of him attacking me

600
00:34:14,143 --> 00:34:14,782
He's trying to find ways to get close to Tian right now.

601
00:34:17,583 --> 00:34:18,822
I'm more worried about her.

602
00:34:28,063 --> 00:34:28,942
Hey Lak, what's up?

603
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:32,542
When?!

604
00:34:38,903 --> 00:34:40,342
What did Lak say?

605
00:34:41,583 --> 00:34:41,902
Tian left home.

606
00:34:43,503 --> 00:34:44,062
She is coming here looking for me.

607
00:34:50,183 --> 00:34:52,062
I really like the fried chicken here

608
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:53,662
It's so sweet.

609
00:34:53,903 --> 00:34:54,662
Do you know why?

610
00:34:55,103 --> 00:34:55,822
Why?

611
00:34:56,023 --> 00:34:57,502
Because I'm serving it to you

612
00:35:00,303 --> 00:35:02,542
I told you this is my favorite restaurant.

613
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:03,342
Everything is delicious

614
00:35:04,703 --> 00:35:05,382
Gosh.

615
00:35:05,863 --> 00:35:07,382
It's like you can see the future.

616
00:35:10,463 --> 00:35:11,982
In the near future

617
00:35:12,663 --> 00:35:14,102
we should do You tube together

618
00:35:14,623 --> 00:35:15,542
Let's name it..

619
00:35:15,823 --> 00:35:17,702
His Excellency Traveler Chart with

620
00:35:17,823 --> 00:35:19,262
Taster Tian.

621
00:35:20,143 --> 00:35:20,862
Goes well together!

622
00:35:22,823 --> 00:35:23,462
Sound's good.

623
00:35:30,183 --> 00:35:30,902
What's wrong?

624
00:35:31,503 --> 00:35:33,982
I'm gonna go use the restroom. I can't hold it in.

625
00:35:43,583 --> 00:35:44,182
What you ordered!

626
00:35:48,343 --> 00:35:49,142
There's a problem

627
00:35:49,503 --> 00:35:50,462
What do we do?

628
00:35:50,543 --> 00:35:53,222
He has been pooping out before he even reached the door

629
00:35:55,503 --> 00:35:56,902
His car is parked over there.

630
00:35:57,343 --> 00:35:59,022
He's a big million aire's son.

631
00:35:59,103 --> 00:36:00,542
Call his father to come pick him up

632
00:36:00,623 --> 00:36:00,982
Okay.

633
00:36:01,023 --> 00:36:01,782
I'll leave him to you.

634
00:36:11,423 --> 00:36:12,062
Tian!

635
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:13,182
Hello Pa.

636
00:36:15,703 --> 00:36:17,062
Why did you leave Lak?

637
00:36:17,183 --> 00:36:17,822
Tian.

638
00:36:18,143 --> 00:36:20,182
Do you know how worried Rome is?

639
00:36:20,583 --> 00:36:22,702
He had his subordinates go wait for you at the transport station,

640
00:36:22,743 --> 00:36:24,062
train station.

641
00:36:24,903 --> 00:36:26,342
Why did you do this?

642
00:36:26,343 --> 00:36:28,262
The situation here isn't so great either

643
00:36:28,983 --> 00:36:32,462
Rome and Pao have been checking every bus stops too.

644
00:36:36,743 --> 00:36:38,902
I'm worried about Boss

645
00:36:48,383 --> 00:36:49,222
Boss

646
00:36:53,623 --> 00:36:54,742
Why did you do something crazy like this?!

647
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:57,462
You're not a kid anymore!

648
00:36:58,383 --> 00:36:59,862
Do you know how worried everyone is?!

649
00:37:00,583 --> 00:37:02,702
You don't think and you keep making mistakes over and over again!

650
00:37:04,183 --> 00:37:05,662
I'm sorry.

651
00:37:05,863 --> 00:37:07,342
I was worried about you so..

652
00:37:10,743 --> 00:37:11,422
Rome

653
00:37:11,743 --> 00:37:13,022
Calm down.

654
00:37:13,503 --> 00:37:14,062
Your'stress is driving you mad right now

655
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:18,622
This is too much Rome.

656
00:37:19,023 --> 00:37:21,502
Tian was worried about you, that's why she came here.

657
00:37:21,903 --> 00:37:23,822
You don't care for her feelings at all, do you?

658
00:37:24,463 --> 00:37:26,142
Do you want Tian to run away again?

659
00:37:26,823 --> 00:37:27,582
Come on Tian.

660
00:37:40,943 --> 00:37:41,622
Rome.

661
00:37:44,383 --> 00:37:45,862
You've changed a lot.

662
00:37:46,503 --> 00:37:48,382
You're not the Romel know

663
00:38:02,703 --> 00:38:03,862
Don't be sad!

664
00:38:03,983 --> 00:38:05,622
Don't be mad at Rome.

665
00:38:06,223 --> 00:38:08,062
He's having problems

666
00:38:08,343 --> 00:38:10,022
They're all bad.

667
00:38:12,143 --> 00:38:16,982
So how is his company and factory?

668
00:38:17,423 --> 00:38:19,302
Are there damages?

669
00:38:20,383 --> 00:38:21,182
And...

670
00:38:21,703 --> 00:38:22,902
will Boss

671
00:38:23,583 --> 00:38:28,582
get sued from the clients and go broke like Ka molt at said?

672
00:38:29,623 --> 00:38:32,382
Ka molt at told you this?

673
00:38:34,983 --> 00:38:35,742
Yes.

674
00:38:36,623 --> 00:38:38,462
Ka molt at told me

675
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:41,982
He also said he's worried about Boss.

676
00:38:42,623 --> 00:38:43,942
He wants to help him.

677
00:38:46,063 --> 00:38:47,702
I will never seek help from him.

678
00:38:50,583 --> 00:38:52,182
Don't scold Tian.

679
00:38:52,503 --> 00:38:54,622
Ka molt at called Tian himself

680
00:38:54,663 --> 00:38:55,982
It's not Tian's fault.

681
00:38:56,903 --> 00:38:58,262
I know it's not.

682
00:38:59,543 --> 00:39:01,622
Do you think I'm some evil monster?

683
00:39:28,703 --> 00:39:29,542
I'm sorry.

684
00:39:35,143 --> 00:39:36,422
It's not your fault.

685
00:39:37,423 --> 00:39:38,942
I was stubborn.

686
00:39:40,383 --> 00:39:42,862
I deserve to get scolded.

687
00:40:02,583 --> 00:40:03,582
Will you stay with me

688
00:40:05,663 --> 00:40:06,622
be by my side,

689
00:40:09,063 --> 00:40:10,662
and help me get revenge?

690
00:40:14,583 --> 00:40:15,462
Yes.

691
00:40:17,303 --> 00:40:19,302
I will help you get revenge

692
00:40:20,703 --> 00:40:23,142
and will do whatever you tell me to do

694
00:40:40,943 --> 00:40:42,982
I did everything in our plan.

695
00:40:43,103 --> 00:40:44,942
But you played outside the game.

696
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:48,702
I was raped and harassed in so many ways.

697
00:40:50,343 --> 00:40:53,062
When he sent me to go look after Kula chart at home,

698
00:40:54,343 --> 00:40:57,502
Kula chart raped me as well.

699
00:40:57,903 --> 00:40:59,142
What's your condition?

700
00:40:59,663 --> 00:41:01,462
Tian must marry Kula chart.
