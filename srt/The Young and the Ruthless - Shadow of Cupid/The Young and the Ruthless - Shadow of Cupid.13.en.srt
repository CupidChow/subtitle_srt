I can't resolve the problem on my own.

21
00:01:38,863 --> 00:01:39,702
Mr. Ka molt at

22
00:01:40,143 --> 00:01:42,542
has l ended me his hand to help.

23
00:01:44,183 --> 00:01:45,742
He is my benefactor.

24
00:01:46,143 --> 00:01:48,942
My Kula chart and Rome's Tian

25
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:50,942
will be getting married soon.

26
00:01:52,463 --> 00:01:54,382
You don't need to explain anything.

27
00:01:56,263 --> 00:01:58,782
Anything you deem appropriate,

28
00:01:59,423 --> 00:02:01,022
T agree with you as well

29
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:05,902
I will organize the wedding.

30
00:02:05,943 --> 00:02:08,462
collateral for the loan?

31
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:10,982
If Boss can't pay Kamoltat back the money,

32
00:02:11,623 --> 00:02:13,662
he will take Boss'sl and?

33
00:02:17,383 --> 00:02:18,622
J really don't understand

34
00:02:18,743 --> 00:02:19,142
MASTER KDC

35
00:02:19,143 --> 00:02:20,502
what Rome is thinking.
MASTER KDC

36
00:02:20,943 --> 00:02:24,062
He's offering both his land and Tian to his enemy.

37
00:02:25,503 --> 00:02:30,062
I don't understand either why he's suddenly becoming a victim for Ka molt at.

38
00:02:30,303 --> 00:02:32,302
Especially letting Tian get married.

39
00:02:32,823 --> 00:02:34,902
I thought he was going to keep Tian as his last resort

40
00:02:35,463 --> 00:02:36,142
I think

41
00:02:37,143 --> 00:02:40,102
Rome is hiding something from us.

42
00:02:54,143 --> 00:02:55,102
Boss.

43
00:02:55,663 --> 00:02:56,222
Tian.

44
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:57,102
You're not asleep yet?

45
00:02:58,663 --> 00:03:00,182
I'm not sleepy.

46
00:03:00,983 --> 00:03:02,822
Did you choose your dress today?

47
00:03:08,783 --> 00:03:09,622
Boss

48
00:03:12,703 --> 00:03:14,142
You once told me

49
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,262
you love your factory in Ranong very much.

50
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:19,102
Yes

51
00:03:20,143 --> 00:03:20,862
Why?

52
00:03:25,023 --> 00:03:25,862
Nothing.

53
00:03:26,343 --> 00:03:27,662
You should get some rest.

54
00:03:38,703 --> 00:03:39,822
Chairman

55
00:03:39,823 --> 00:03:41,342
You have a guest.

56
00:03:43,183 --> 00:03:44,062
I have an appointment?

57
00:03:44,343 --> 00:03:45,422
No.

58
00:03:48,863 --> 00:03:49,742
I'm busy.

59
00:03:49,983 --> 00:03:51,822
Reschedule another appointment with my secretary.

60
00:03:56,023 --> 00:03:57,702
Stop! He won't let you see him!

61
00:04:02,103 --> 00:04:04,382
I tried stopping her but she wouldn't listen.

62
00:04:04,463 --> 00:04:05,942
She was adamant to come in

63
00:04:07,743 --> 00:04:08,262
Tian.

64
00:04:08,423 --> 00:04:09,822
I'm very surprised!

65
00:04:10,263 --> 00:04:12,382
Why are you here?

66
00:04:14,743 --> 00:04:15,422
Get out.

67
00:04:22,703 --> 00:04:24,582
I have something important to talk to you about.

68
00:04:28,223 --> 00:04:29,822
What's the matter? Have a seat first.

69
00:04:33,143 --> 00:04:34,142
I know

70
00:04:34,543 --> 00:04:36,542
you and Boss have been enemies for a long time.

71
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:40,062
Also, there's some unfinished business.

72
00:04:41,863 --> 00:04:43,462
But you're the winner right now.

73
00:04:44,943 --> 00:04:46,222
Why are you talking like that?

74
00:04:46,543 --> 00:04:49,342
-We're going to be --
-You asked for me to be your in law

75
00:04:50,263 --> 00:04:52,142
just to insult him, no?

76
00:04:53,783 --> 00:04:55,662
Since you've succeeded,

77
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:59,982
I would like to ask for Boss's title deed to his factory back.

78
00:05:02,623 --> 00:05:04,342
Rome told you to ask me?

79
00:05:05,783 --> 00:05:06,462
No.

80
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,582
Boss doesn't know about this.

81
00:05:09,303 --> 00:05:10,942
I came to see you myself.

82
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:18,502
I spent hundreds of millions helping your boss.

83
00:05:19,863 --> 00:05:22,342
lf you're going to ask for the return of the collateral

84
00:05:22,423 --> 00:05:24,982
and he doesn't pay, I would lose the money for free.

85
00:05:26,383 --> 00:05:27,942
You got my body

86
00:05:28,263 --> 00:05:29,742
and my life.

87
00:05:31,663 --> 00:05:32,902
I promise you

88
00:05:33,103 --> 00:05:36,502
I will be a good daughter in law and obey all of your orders.

89
00:05:37,983 --> 00:05:39,342
If you think I'm worthy enough

90
00:05:41,943 --> 00:05:42,622
Fine.

91
00:05:43,703 --> 00:05:45,622
If you ask, I shall give

92
00:05:46,823 --> 00:05:49,302
I will give him back the title deed at the wedding.

93
00:05:50,063 --> 00:05:50,982
But...

94
00:05:51,503 --> 00:05:53,582
the wedding must be pushed j up to the day after tomorrow.

95
00:05:54,503 --> 00:05:55,182
Deal?

96
00:06:01,863 --> 00:06:02,782
In two days?

97
00:06:03,743 --> 00:06:04,742
Why?

98
00:06:05,503 --> 00:06:07,142
Did Ka molt at threaten you?

99
00:06:08,183 --> 00:06:09,022
No.

100
00:06:09,303 --> 00:06:10,982
No one threatened me.

101
00:06:11,463 --> 00:06:13,342
But they got a new date.

102
00:06:14,663 --> 00:06:16,102
You went and talked to him?

103
00:06:18,063 --> 00:06:18,862
Yes.

104
00:06:19,703 --> 00:06:22,942
Since I'm about to get married, I thought...

105
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:26,462
I get familiar with him.

106
00:06:28,383 --> 00:06:29,502
Excuse me now.

107
00:06:37,023 --> 00:06:37,822
Rome.

108
00:06:38,783 --> 00:06:40,302
You're not going to do anything?

109
00:06:42,543 --> 00:06:43,502
Tian made her decision

110
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:45,582
I have nothing to say.

111
00:06:51,063 --> 00:06:52,822
What the hell is going on Pa?

112
00:07:00,183 --> 00:07:08,022
Subtitles by oh sweet haven.com Timing by Angel Lakorns

113
00:07:34,423 --> 00:07:35,182
Tian.

114
00:07:36,543 --> 00:07:37,622
Can l talk to you?

115
00:07:41,143 --> 00:07:43,262
I'm about to shower.

116
00:07:43,983 --> 00:07:45,742
Can we talk tomorrow?

117
00:07:51,543 --> 00:07:52,742
You don't sound good.

118
00:07:54,263 --> 00:07:55,262
Is something wrong?

119
00:08:00,103 --> 00:08:01,462
No.

120
00:08:20,543 --> 00:08:21,582
Pushing it up is good.

121
00:08:23,463 --> 00:08:24,502
So it can end quicker.

122
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:41,662
Thank you Dad.

123
00:08:41,863 --> 00:08:43,102
You're really awesome.

124
00:08:43,743 --> 00:08:45,222
I will never forget your gratitude

125
00:08:47,263 --> 00:08:50,862
I hope after you get married, you will become a better person like you said you will.

126
00:08:51,543 --> 00:08:52,542
las sure you

127
00:08:52,863 --> 00:08:54,742
I will be your noble son.

128
00:08:55,303 --> 00:08:58,182
I will also be a noble husband to Tian

129
00:09:00,783 --> 00:09:01,462
Mom.

130
00:09:01,863 --> 00:09:03,382
Can you take me to get pampered?

131
00:09:05,423 --> 00:09:06,062
Come.

132
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:24,902
Wait!

133
00:09:28,663 --> 00:09:29,822
I'll have the driver drop you off.

134
00:09:31,823 --> 00:09:32,582
No need.

135
00:09:33,063 --> 00:09:34,782
I don't want to be l indebted to you again

136
00:09:35,703 --> 00:09:37,142
People like you

137
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,702
always expects something in return.

138
00:09:41,863 --> 00:09:42,742
What about Rome?

139
00:09:43,463 --> 00:09:44,662
If he's really a good person,

140
00:09:44,983 --> 00:09:47,822
why did he trade you for money to pay off his debt?

141
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:52,262
I am happy to do it.

142
00:09:53,263 --> 00:09:56,182
If ll didn't want to do it, there's no way that Boss can force me.

143
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:59,142
That's what makes him different from you.

144
00:10:06,223 --> 00:10:08,502
I just came to bring you coffee.

145
00:10:12,303 --> 00:10:13,822
Pick up the envelope and title deed for me

146
00:10:19,423 --> 00:10:19,982
Here you go.

147
00:10:25,263 --> 00:10:26,822
Sir stop!

148
00:10:26,863 --> 00:10:29,142
Please pity me! Don't hurt me!

149
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:32,182
Please take pity!

150
00:10:35,383 --> 00:10:36,942
There's another thing

151
00:10:37,463 --> 00:10:38,862
that he's better than you on.

152
00:10:40,143 --> 00:10:43,542
He would never harass or bully anyone weaker than him.

153
00:10:44,463 --> 00:10:45,702
Especially with women.

154
00:11:04,943 --> 00:11:05,702
Get out.

155
00:11:11,223 --> 00:11:13,702
Why do I have to care about that girl'swords?

156
00:11:27,303 --> 00:11:28,302
Wow!

157
00:11:28,543 --> 00:11:31,702
You look so elegant and beautiful.

158
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,982
But...

159
00:11:33,223 --> 00:11:34,742
you need to smile a little.

160
00:11:34,943 --> 00:11:36,302
It'san auspicious event.

161
00:11:39,463 --> 00:11:41,182
Thank you so much.

162
00:11:43,023 --> 00:11:44,502
No need to thank me.

163
00:11:45,183 --> 00:11:47,902
You're Rome'srelative so you're like my relative.

164
00:11:49,143 --> 00:11:50,662
If lim no longer here,

165
00:11:52,143 --> 00:11:54,222
can you look after Boss?

166
00:11:55,943 --> 00:11:57,182
No need to ask me.

167
00:11:57,463 --> 00:11:59,822
I will look after him

168
00:12:00,263 --> 00:12:02,982
because Rome has been mine since the beginning.

169
00:12:04,063 --> 00:12:05,222
You mean

170
00:12:05,983 --> 00:12:08,422
you won't leave him again?

171
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:10,982
Tian.

172
00:12:15,383 --> 00:12:17,702
One of Ka mol tat's people delivered this for you

173
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:55,742
Tian.

174
00:12:57,023 --> 00:12:58,182
Are you done getting ready?

175
00:13:02,663 --> 00:13:04,942
need five minutes of your time.

176
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,582
Sure.

177
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:16,822
Boss.

178
00:13:19,143 --> 00:13:21,342
I wish for you to stay strong

179
00:13:22,623 --> 00:13:25,302
and get through all the obstacles.

180
00:13:26,703 --> 00:13:28,782
I also wish for you

181
00:13:29,903 --> 00:13:32,022
to be happy with the person you love

182
00:13:39,503 --> 00:13:41,342
Goodbye Boss.

183
00:14:11,983 --> 00:14:13,462
You once told me

184
00:14:14,183 --> 00:14:16,542
you love your factory in Ranong very much

185
00:14:18,063 --> 00:14:18,542
Yes

186
00:14:19,383 --> 00:14:20,022
Why?

187
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:25,262
Nothing.

188
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,022
You should get some rest.

189
00:14:30,943 --> 00:14:32,662
You pushed up the wedding

190
00:14:33,343 --> 00:14:34,422
in exchange for the title deed?

191
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:38,102
Stupid kid.

192
00:14:45,063 --> 00:14:45,702
Tian.

193
00:15:02,663 --> 00:15:03,662
Where have you been?

194
00:15:04,543 --> 00:15:05,662
The ceremony is about to start.

195
00:15:07,503 --> 00:15:09,662
I didn't want to see a depressing image

196
00:15:10,223 --> 00:15:11,822
but I still have to.

197
00:15:12,023 --> 00:15:13,222
Even til the last day,

198
00:15:13,783 --> 00:15:15,502
you still made Tian cry.

199
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:19,862
really respect you for that.

200
00:15:27,463 --> 00:15:29,982
You always manage to get society's attention.

201
00:15:29,983 --> 00:15:34,102
Is there a reason why you pushed up the wedding date to today?

202
00:15:34,743 --> 00:15:35,502
No.

203
00:15:35,703 --> 00:15:39,062
It's a normal thing. Just two young people in love and want to get married

204
00:15:39,903 --> 00:15:42,462
So nothing urgent?

205
00:15:42,743 --> 00:15:43,422
Is there?

206
00:15:44,303 --> 00:15:46,142
Please don't misunderstand

207
00:15:46,263 --> 00:15:50,302
The kids have saved themselves for marriage.

208
00:15:55,343 --> 00:15:56,942
Where did Rome go?

209
00:16:14,343 --> 00:16:17,142
Next is the engagement ceremony.

210
00:16:17,183 --> 00:16:19,942
Please exchange rings

211
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:56,782
Bow down to him.

212
00:17:11,903 --> 00:17:14,662
Let's have the couple give each other a peck on the cheeks

213
00:17:15,183 --> 00:17:16,182
Go ahead!

214
00:17:17,343 --> 00:17:19,062
So cute!

215
00:17:28,103 --> 00:17:31,422
Let's have the guests go eat for now.

216
00:17:34,423 --> 00:17:35,422
Thank you

217
00:17:36,103 --> 00:17:36,422
Yes.

218
00:17:36,543 --> 00:17:37,302
Thank you.

219
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:38,542
Congratulations.

220
00:17:46,103 --> 00:17:46,782
Well Rome,

221
00:17:47,503 --> 00:17:49,462
did you receive the gift from Tian yet?

222
00:17:50,623 --> 00:17:51,622
Do you like it?

223
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:55,862
Thanks Ka molt at.

224
00:17:57,063 --> 00:17:57,982
I'll be honest.

225
00:17:59,103 --> 00:18:00,022
I really like it.

226
00:18:01,263 --> 00:18:04,102
It's a gift that I love the most.

227
00:18:06,143 --> 00:18:08,142
You have to give Tian the credit.

228
00:18:09,783 --> 00:18:14,262
The morel get to know her, the more impress lam with her.

229
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:17,142
Excuse me sir.

230
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,942
The district officer we contacted

231
00:18:20,343 --> 00:18:21,502
can't make it.

232
00:18:21,863 --> 00:18:24,982
He can't come to officiate the marriage certificate today

233
00:18:26,743 --> 00:18:27,062
Gosh

234
00:18:27,703 --> 00:18:28,822
That's awful.

235
00:18:29,303 --> 00:18:30,582
But it's okay.

236
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:33,582
We can send them off to their bridal room today

237
00:18:34,143 --> 00:18:35,262
and have them sign another day.

238
00:18:35,303 --> 00:18:35,902
Am I right?

239
00:18:36,503 --> 00:18:37,102
Disgusting!

240
00:18:37,863 --> 00:18:40,182
Even a five year old understands that shallow of a plan.

241
00:18:41,063 --> 00:18:44,342
You want to get Tian for free without losing something?

242
00:18:45,543 --> 00:18:46,142
Rome.

243
00:18:46,983 --> 00:18:48,502
We need to get Tian back

244
00:18:50,143 --> 00:18:50,622
Tian.

245
00:18:50,783 --> 00:18:51,422
Let'sgo home

246
00:18:52,183 --> 00:18:53,702
-What are you doing?
-Let her go!

247
00:18:54,183 --> 00:18:54,902
Enough

248
00:18:58,103 --> 00:18:59,062
You can't do that Lak.

249
00:19:00,063 --> 00:19:01,422
There's guests here. Can't you see?

250
00:19:02,743 --> 00:19:03,622
But...

251
00:19:03,983 --> 00:19:04,742
Have them get married

252
00:19:06,063 --> 00:19:07,542
They can sign the paper later

253
00:19:08,943 --> 00:19:09,542
I don't mind.

254
00:19:14,023 --> 00:19:16,182
Director-General,go ahead and place the garland on them.

255
00:19:22,463 --> 00:19:23,342
Stop!

256
00:19:24,503 --> 00:19:26,222
No ceremony shall begin

257
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:30,582
Napa.

258
00:19:31,423 --> 00:19:32,302
How did she get here?

259
00:19:35,663 --> 00:19:37,742
Kula chart can't marry anyone

260
00:19:38,383 --> 00:19:40,622
because I'm his wife.

261
00:19:42,103 --> 00:19:42,822
That's not true.

262
00:19:43,463 --> 00:19:44,262
Pat.

263
00:19:44,623 --> 00:19:45,302
Take her out of here.

264
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,022
But I want to hear what she has to say first

265
00:19:53,383 --> 00:19:55,462
I was Mr. Kamol tat'ssecretary.

266
00:19:56,063 --> 00:19:58,702
But I had a relationship with Kula chart and ended up pregnant.

267
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:04,862
Mr K a molt at then sent people to kill me and l ended up losing the baby.

268
00:20:05,143 --> 00:20:06,182
But luckily

269
00:20:06,543 --> 00:20:07,822
lam still alive

270
00:20:09,183 --> 00:20:10,502
This man here

271
00:20:10,823 --> 00:20:12,142
is a murderer!

272
00:20:15,183 --> 00:20:16,422
Do you have proof?

273
00:20:18,463 --> 00:20:20,462
Could you show the images?
Sure

274
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:32,302
I've been molested by Ka molt at.

275
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:34,422
He passed that on tohis son.

276
00:20:34,823 --> 00:20:35,542
Liar!

277
00:20:35,703 --> 00:20:36,822
Don't listen to her!

278
00:20:37,223 --> 00:20:38,422
Those images have been photoshopped!

279
00:20:39,343 --> 00:20:41,142
She's blackmailing me and my son!

280
00:20:41,903 --> 00:20:44,782
Help Officer! He's going to kill me!

281
00:20:44,783 --> 00:20:45,502
I'm a cop.

282
00:20:46,623 --> 00:20:49,902
Your evil deed has been exposed now, Ka molt at

283
00:20:50,823 --> 00:20:51,222
Let's go.

284
00:20:51,703 --> 00:20:52,662
Come on Tian

285
00:20:53,303 --> 00:20:53,782
Hey!

286
00:20:54,063 --> 00:20:55,102
Where are you taking my wife?!

287
00:20:55,863 --> 00:20:57,622
Tian, don't listen to her.

288
00:20:57,663 --> 00:20:58,782
Napa is lying!

289
00:20:59,143 --> 00:20:59,582
Tian.

290
00:21:03,223 --> 00:21:04,182
Officer.

291
00:21:05,983 --> 00:21:07,742
Please take Napa back to her room.

292
00:21:08,503 --> 00:21:10,062
As for the murder,

293
00:21:11,343 --> 00:21:12,942
I will be her witness.

294
00:21:16,223 --> 00:21:16,782
Rome.

295
00:21:17,703 --> 00:21:19,222
You planned all of this, didn't you?

296
00:21:22,063 --> 00:21:23,502
Boss, don't!

297
00:21:23,543 --> 00:21:24,062
Boss!

298
00:21:26,103 --> 00:21:27,022
Calm down

299
00:21:27,263 --> 00:21:28,262
You're falling for his trap.

300
00:21:30,823 --> 00:21:31,222
Yeah.

301
00:21:33,063 --> 00:21:34,262
You cheated me.

302
00:21:34,743 --> 00:21:36,542
You took the title deed and my money

303
00:21:36,543 --> 00:21:38,342
You brought Napa to ruin the wedding!

304
00:21:39,183 --> 00:21:39,742
For this,

305
00:21:40,143 --> 00:21:41,382
you will pay!

306
00:21:42,143 --> 00:21:43,742
I'm not the one that needs to pay.

307
00:21:45,303 --> 00:21:46,262
To day's incident

308
00:21:47,543 --> 00:21:48,382
our side

309
00:21:49,143 --> 00:21:50,782
are the ones humiliated!

310
00:21:53,263 --> 00:21:54,902
Let me go home and think

311
00:21:56,143 --> 00:21:58,622
of how much compensation we want for this.

312
00:22:04,023 --> 00:22:04,902
Let's go guys

313
00:22:10,383 --> 00:22:10,782
Hey!

314
00:22:10,823 --> 00:22:11,462
Tian!

315
00:22:11,503 --> 00:22:12,342
Tian where are you going?!

316
00:22:12,383 --> 00:22:12,862
Tian!

317
00:22:13,103 --> 00:22:13,822
Come back!

318
00:22:13,863 --> 00:22:14,622
Tian!

319
00:22:14,743 --> 00:22:15,422
Kula chart.

320
00:22:15,423 --> 00:22:17,462
-Candle! Where are you going?! Come back!
-Kula chart!

321
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:18,782
Kula chart!
Candle!

322
00:22:19,383 --> 00:22:20,622
-Candle!
-Kula chart!

323
00:22:26,463 --> 00:22:27,302
Mr. Rome!

324
00:22:27,823 --> 00:22:28,342
Ms. Thip.

325
00:22:28,543 --> 00:22:29,422
Is the food ready?

326
00:22:30,423 --> 00:22:31,942
The chef has prepared everything already.

327
00:22:33,663 --> 00:22:36,022
Why so fast? The wedding is over?

328
00:22:36,623 --> 00:22:37,902
There was a small accident

329
00:22:38,263 --> 00:22:39,382
Wedding is called off.

330
00:22:40,623 --> 00:22:42,382
Why don't you join us Ms, Thip?

331
00:22:43,783 --> 00:22:44,702
Thank you.

332
00:22:48,783 --> 00:22:49,462
Oh.

333
00:22:50,143 --> 00:22:50,822
Everyone too

334
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:53,102
Let's go eat.

335
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,222
You must all be starving.

336
00:22:56,743 --> 00:22:58,622
No one ate at the wedding

337
00:23:04,743 --> 00:23:05,142
Hey.

338
00:23:06,743 --> 00:23:08,062
Why are you just standing there?

339
00:23:08,503 --> 00:23:12,462
I'm taking everyone out to eat for defeating Ka molt at.

340
00:23:13,423 --> 00:23:14,142
You mean

341
00:23:14,543 --> 00:23:16,862
this charade, everything that has happened.

342
00:23:17,543 --> 00:23:19,982
was all planned by you?

343
00:23:21,103 --> 00:23:22,022
How could you?

344
00:23:23,543 --> 00:23:24,182
No.

345
00:23:24,263 --> 00:23:24,982
What did jl do?

346
00:23:26,103 --> 00:23:28,662
Karma caught up to Ka molt at.

347
00:23:29,423 --> 00:23:32,062
You brought Napa to the wedding, didn't you?

348
00:23:32,423 --> 00:23:33,222
You already know

349
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:35,542
Napa was beaten by those people

350
00:23:35,783 --> 00:23:37,462
She almost died if it weren't for me.

351
00:23:37,823 --> 00:23:38,822
So how is it strange

352
00:23:39,743 --> 00:23:41,422
for Napa to come seek justice?

353
00:23:42,063 --> 00:23:43,782
But Rome..

354
00:23:44,103 --> 00:23:45,822
why didn't you tell us anything?

355
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,902
Especially Tian, why didn't you tell her?

356
00:23:49,623 --> 00:23:51,902
You knew how much she suffered

357
00:23:52,383 --> 00:23:53,782
Why are you so cruel?

358
00:23:57,543 --> 00:23:59,022
But Tian doesn't have to get married now.

359
00:23:59,943 --> 00:24:02,462
Plus we got revenge on Ka molt at.
What's bad about that?

360
00:24:03,303 --> 00:24:04,502
I never thought

361
00:24:05,103 --> 00:24:06,782
you would be this kind of person.

362
00:24:16,943 --> 00:24:18,382
Qur special guests are here

363
00:24:19,223 --> 00:24:23,582
Sorry we're late. Mike was busy choosing the right drink for the celebration.

364
00:24:25,543 --> 00:24:28,422
Why didn't you tell us you were having problems Rome?

365
00:24:28,783 --> 00:24:29,742
You have a problem,

366
00:24:29,863 --> 00:24:31,142
why didn't you tell us partner?

367
00:24:32,183 --> 00:24:33,102
I'm so sorry Mike.

368
00:24:34,103 --> 00:24:35,782
I'm finding a way to solve the problem

369
00:24:37,463 --> 00:24:38,862
But stay calm Rome.

370
00:24:38,903 --> 00:24:40,662
After we signed the contract with you

371
00:24:40,663 --> 00:24:43,302
we immediately went back to England to sign the insurance contract.

372
00:24:43,703 --> 00:24:47,342
The insurance company is claiming every damage case.

373
00:24:48,103 --> 00:24:48,862
Gosh Rome.

374
00:24:50,343 --> 00:24:51,902
That's unbelievable

375
00:24:54,383 --> 00:24:56,342
Regardless,congratulations Rome

376
00:24:56,783 --> 00:24:58,622
that you don't have to be bankrupt anymore.

377
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,222
Thank you to you two as well.

378
00:25:02,383 --> 00:25:03,222
I'm not hungry.

379
00:25:03,743 --> 00:25:04,582
I'll pass.

380
00:25:10,663 --> 00:25:11,702
My wife isn't hungry.

381
00:25:12,463 --> 00:25:14,062
If Iea t, Ill have problems with her.

382
00:25:14,343 --> 00:25:17,982
Well,see you everyone and thank you on behalf of my friend here.

383
00:25:19,183 --> 00:25:20,942
My friend is lucky

384
00:25:21,823 --> 00:25:23,062
to have clients like you guys.

385
00:25:28,663 --> 00:25:30,782
lim going to go change.

386
00:25:31,063 --> 00:25:32,062
I feel uncomfortable.

387
00:25:40,783 --> 00:25:41,382
Oh.

388
00:25:42,863 --> 00:25:45,302
They're probably just surprised by our victory.

389
00:25:45,983 --> 00:25:47,702
Let'sgo up.

390
00:25:56,543 --> 00:25:57,222
Tian.

391
00:26:02,463 --> 00:26:03,702
Don't over think it.

392
00:26:04,303 --> 00:26:04,902
At least,

393
00:26:05,143 --> 00:26:07,062
you don't have to marry that douche

394
00:26:08,343 --> 00:26:09,902
I'm fine.

395
00:26:10,503 --> 00:26:13,902
Iim happy that I got to help Boss get revenge.

396
00:26:14,503 --> 00:26:15,422
Besides,

397
00:26:16,263 --> 00:26:19,382
Boss won't have to go bankrupt like last time.

398
00:26:21,383 --> 00:26:22,942
You love Rome that much?

399
00:26:24,343 --> 00:26:25,142
While.

400
00:26:25,703 --> 00:26:29,062
he used your naivety as a tool to get revenge.

401
00:26:30,503 --> 00:26:32,422
My life belongs to Boss.

402
00:26:33,703 --> 00:26:35,662
If he told me to go die,

403
00:26:36,583 --> 00:26:37,422
I will go.

404
00:26:39,423 --> 00:26:40,102
In that case

405
00:26:41,023 --> 00:26:42,822
I have nothing to say to you.

406
00:27:14,343 --> 00:27:16,182
It's all your fault Chart!

407
00:27:16,783 --> 00:27:17,462
Chart.

408
00:27:21,143 --> 00:27:22,022
What did I do?!

409
00:27:22,863 --> 00:27:24,662
Napa showed up on her own.

410
00:27:25,663 --> 00:27:26,982
I thought you said you handled it.

411
00:27:27,863 --> 00:27:29,062
It's because of your evil deed

412
00:27:29,543 --> 00:27:30,782
Why did you get involved with her?!

413
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:33,982
Rome was able to get the chance to expose my plan!

414
00:27:35,463 --> 00:27:36,102
Go.

415
00:27:36,303 --> 00:27:37,542
Get out of my face!

416
00:27:37,583 --> 00:27:38,262
Go!

417
00:27:45,703 --> 00:27:46,502
Well?

418
00:27:47,223 --> 00:27:48,422
Are you satisfied?

419
00:27:48,983 --> 00:27:50,622
You let Rome humiliate me!

420
00:27:52,263 --> 00:27:53,382
You were on his side,

421
00:27:53,423 --> 00:27:54,582
helping him!

422
00:27:55,623 --> 00:27:58,502
You weren't troubled by it nor comforted me or asked anything!

423
00:28:01,223 --> 00:28:02,182
Fine'l'll ask.

424
00:28:02,743 --> 00:28:05,902
Did you really do what Napa said?

425
00:28:06,503 --> 00:28:07,222
If yes,

426
00:28:08,343 --> 00:28:10,462
what happened was appropriate

427
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:14,742
Cause and effect.

428
00:28:21,263 --> 00:28:22,022
Damnit!

429
00:28:25,463 --> 00:28:26,302
Mr. Ka molt at

430
00:28:31,263 --> 00:28:32,942
Rome's maid sent this to me.

431
00:28:33,303 --> 00:28:34,862
I hired her to send me news

432
00:28:36,143 --> 00:28:38,102
Regardless, congratulations Rome

433
00:28:38,503 --> 00:28:40,382
that you don't have to be bankrupt anymore.

434
00:28:42,143 --> 00:28:42,862
Rome.

435
00:28:43,663 --> 00:28:45,302
Either you or me that has to die!

436
00:28:49,383 --> 00:28:50,982
Why didn't you tell me

437
00:28:51,623 --> 00:28:53,942
that your secretary was pregnant with Kula chart?

438
00:28:55,023 --> 00:28:56,662
I didn't think that bitch would survive

439
00:28:56,783 --> 00:28:58,142
and come to expose Chart.

440
00:28:59,503 --> 00:29:02,262
You really sent people to kill Napa?

441
00:29:04,023 --> 00:29:04,822
So?

442
00:29:05,263 --> 00:29:07,262
If my son gets to marry Tian

443
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:08,862
you would have no more thorn.

444
00:29:09,223 --> 00:29:10,222
Isn't that a good thing?

445
00:29:12,303 --> 00:29:14,782
What happens if it doesn't turn out that way?

446
00:29:15,183 --> 00:29:15,662
Look.

447
00:29:16,023 --> 00:29:18,902
I don't want to get involved in illegal things.

448
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:21,502
What you're doing

449
00:29:21,663 --> 00:29:23,542
isn't any better.

450
00:29:25,543 --> 00:29:27,582
The winner is always right

451
00:29:28,383 --> 00:29:30,022
Weak ones loses.

452
00:29:30,383 --> 00:29:31,502
But I won't give in!

453
00:29:32,143 --> 00:29:34,462
If you're willing to let Rome slip away,

454
00:29:34,743 --> 00:29:35,462
that's your problem.

455
00:29:43,983 --> 00:29:46,062
The wedding of Taks as ut's heir is canceled.

456
00:29:46,143 --> 00:29:47,942
Ka mol tat's former secretary came to expose

457
00:29:47,983 --> 00:29:49,982
of having a relationship with the groom and impregnated her.

458
00:29:57,463 --> 00:29:59,302
Why did you wake up early?

459
00:30:00,983 --> 00:30:02,582
Where are you going with your bag packed?

460
00:30:03,463 --> 00:30:05,742
I came to say goodbye.

461
00:30:06,903 --> 00:30:07,582
Goodbye?

462
00:30:08,983 --> 00:30:09,662
Where are you going?

463
00:30:09,903 --> 00:30:10,582
And why?

464
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:11,942
Well.

465
00:30:12,783 --> 00:30:14,822
My job here is done.

466
00:30:15,863 --> 00:30:17,902
What you wanted me to do

467
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:20,942
has been done

468
00:30:21,743 --> 00:30:22,582
What do you mean?

469
00:30:23,943 --> 00:30:27,462
You wanted me to help you get revenge on the Taks as uts no?

470
00:30:29,663 --> 00:30:33,462
Yesterday'sevent was probably what you wanted.

471
00:30:34,023 --> 00:30:35,422
But before I go,

472
00:30:35,863 --> 00:30:38,502
can I have my mother's necklace ring?

473
00:30:40,383 --> 00:30:41,062
You want the necklace?

474
00:30:42,983 --> 00:30:43,982
You're leaving me?

475
00:30:47,103 --> 00:30:48,942
How do you know it's ended?

476
00:30:49,863 --> 00:30:51,982
What else do you want me to do?

477
00:30:53,343 --> 00:30:54,782
You think me helping you

478
00:30:55,503 --> 00:30:57,582
from that sonof'abitchbrother and that pervert man

479
00:30:57,623 --> 00:30:58,742
and brought you to live here

480
00:30:59,943 --> 00:31:01,102
was worth

481
00:31:02,023 --> 00:31:02,862
for what you just did?

482
00:31:04,463 --> 00:31:05,982
That's why you're asking for a debt of gratitude?

483
00:31:07,183 --> 00:31:08,782
It's not that.

484
00:31:09,143 --> 00:31:10,902
-I'm not --
-You're smart so answer me!

485
00:31:12,423 --> 00:31:13,742
Has everything you've done,

486
00:31:15,663 --> 00:31:17,742
enough to compensate for me?

487
00:31:22,663 --> 00:31:23,782
If you think it has

488
00:31:27,863 --> 00:31:28,702
then you can leave.

489
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,022
Come with me Tian

490
00:32:07,863 --> 00:32:09,342
I love you so much.

491
00:32:09,943 --> 00:32:12,222
We have nothing to do with the adults'problems.

492
00:32:12,743 --> 00:32:14,062
Our love

493
00:32:14,303 --> 00:32:15,782
is true love Tian

494
00:32:16,383 --> 00:32:16,822
Chart!

495
00:32:16,863 --> 00:32:17,302
Tian.

496
00:32:17,343 --> 00:32:18,542
Chart let me go!

497
00:32:23,783 --> 00:32:24,422
Fine.

498
00:32:24,903 --> 00:32:25,662
In that case,

499
00:32:26,103 --> 00:32:27,342
let's die together

500
00:32:32,823 --> 00:32:33,502
Tian.
Boss.

501
00:32:33,783 --> 00:32:35,102
-Boss - Don't leave.

502
00:32:35,303 --> 00:32:35,942
I'm sorry.

503
00:32:36,383 --> 00:32:36,822
It's...

504
00:32:38,343 --> 00:32:39,142
You!

505
00:32:39,983 --> 00:32:40,662
Rome.

506
00:32:41,303 --> 00:32:42,422
Mara of my heart!

507
00:32:42,743 --> 00:32:43,742
Let Tian go right now!

508
00:32:44,143 --> 00:32:44,782
Kula chart.

509
00:32:45,703 --> 00:32:46,582
Calm down.

510
00:32:47,143 --> 00:32:48,622
Put the gun down and then we can talk

511
00:32:49,343 --> 00:32:50,302
I won't talk to you.

512
00:32:50,903 --> 00:32:51,462
Let go.

513
00:32:51,983 --> 00:32:52,662
Let Tian Go!

514
00:32:52,743 --> 00:32:53,542
Okay, okay.

515
00:32:54,503 --> 00:32:56,102
I will let you talk to Tian

516
00:32:57,423 --> 00:32:58,382
but you have to calm down.

517
00:33:06,663 --> 00:33:07,582
Put the gun down first

518
00:33:11,303 --> 00:33:12,102
Boss.

519
00:33:21,703 --> 00:33:22,422
I didn't do it!

520
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:24,502
The gun went off itself!

521
00:33:24,623 --> 00:33:25,342
Boss!

522
00:33:26,783 --> 00:33:27,742
Are you in pain?!

523
00:33:36,023 --> 00:33:37,342
Boss

524
00:33:37,983 --> 00:33:39,262
Can you manage?

525
00:33:40,263 --> 00:33:41,982
Somebody, help!

526
00:33:43,023 --> 00:33:43,782
Boss!

527
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:57,422
How is Boss doing?

528
00:33:58,383 --> 00:34:00,222
Will he be okay?

529
00:34:01,063 --> 00:34:02,462
Rome will be okay

530
00:34:03,663 --> 00:34:05,462
If Rome didn't do that crazy plan,

531
00:34:05,623 --> 00:34:06,902
this wouldn't happen.

532
00:34:07,783 --> 00:34:09,822
Don't criticize him.

533
00:34:10,623 --> 00:34:13,022
He got shot because of me.

534
00:34:13,543 --> 00:34:15,822
I should be the one to die!

535
00:34:16,023 --> 00:34:17,782
This has nothing to do with you.

536
00:34:18,343 --> 00:34:19,542
Don't over think it.

537
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:26,782
How is he?

538
00:34:27,543 --> 00:34:28,742
The patient is safe

539
00:34:30,543 --> 00:34:31,902
That's a relief.

540
00:34:32,743 --> 00:34:33,502
Excuse me now.

541
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:52,782
Boss.

542
00:34:58,903 --> 00:35:00,502
Mr. Rome just came out of the OR.

543
00:35:00,903 --> 00:35:03,702
He's not healthy enough and might catch infection.

544
00:35:04,303 --> 00:35:06,022
J will look after him

545
00:35:06,103 --> 00:35:07,662
You two don't have to worry.

546
00:35:12,223 --> 00:35:13,942
Ms. Thip is a nurse.

547
00:35:14,183 --> 00:35:15,142
Trust her.

548
00:35:27,063 --> 00:35:27,902
Where have you been?!

549
00:35:28,943 --> 00:35:30,342
I went to give the police my statement.

550
00:35:31,303 --> 00:35:32,862
Napa filed a report

551
00:35:34,023 --> 00:35:36,502
She said Rome was a witness to the incident.

552
00:35:37,303 --> 00:35:38,262
I was trying to kill her

553
00:35:38,583 --> 00:35:39,622
and he saved her life.

554
00:35:40,063 --> 00:35:40,982
What?

555
00:35:41,423 --> 00:35:42,742
How could you mess up?

556
00:35:45,623 --> 00:35:47,062
I don't know if he's claiming that

557
00:35:47,623 --> 00:35:49,102
May be Napa did get away

558
00:35:49,503 --> 00:35:51,262
and called Rome to help her

559
00:35:53,143 --> 00:35:54,222
So how does Napa

560
00:35:54,583 --> 00:35:55,782
know Rome?

561
00:35:57,183 --> 00:35:59,302
How does she know that Rome and I have problems?

562
00:36:00,583 --> 00:36:01,862
In conclusion, you messed up!

563
00:36:02,383 --> 00:36:03,462
This time we're all screwed.

564
00:36:03,783 --> 00:36:04,862
Lose knowledge, lose money

565
00:36:05,023 --> 00:36:06,142
We might even go to prison

566
00:36:09,343 --> 00:36:10,342
Stay calm sir.

567
00:36:10,983 --> 00:36:12,422
This might just be false claims.

568
00:36:13,023 --> 00:36:16,502
Rome has no proof that he witnessed the incident

569
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:18,302
Most importantly

570
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:20,862
he's your business rival.

571
00:36:21,583 --> 00:36:22,102
For this matter

572
00:36:22,823 --> 00:36:24,742
his claims don't weigh much.

573
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:27,622
This would be over if we silenced Napa

574
00:36:28,383 --> 00:36:29,102
Right now,

575
00:36:29,543 --> 00:36:32,342
the police has taken Napa to a safe house

576
00:36:32,623 --> 00:36:34,102
What will you do next?

577
00:36:34,543 --> 00:36:35,302
Tell me.

578
00:36:40,503 --> 00:36:41,382
What is it Pit?

579
00:36:45,143 --> 00:36:48,822
Kula chart has gone missing since ast night and hasn't come home yet

580
00:36:49,263 --> 00:36:50,742
He won't pick up my calls.

581
00:36:51,343 --> 00:36:53,222
I don't know if he went and caused trouble anywhere or not.

582
00:36:53,223 --> 00:36:54,462
I'm worried.

583
00:36:54,623 --> 00:36:56,822
Will he die? He was bleeding a lot.

584
00:36:57,143 --> 00:36:58,382
If you're scared,
SAMSUN

585
00:36:58,543 --> 00:37:00,022
then why shoot him?
SAMSUN O

586
00:37:00,143 --> 00:37:00,982
I didn't!

587
00:37:01,023 --> 00:37:01,822
Gun just went off

588
00:37:02,183 --> 00:37:03,942
Who knew he was trying to take the gun from me?

589
00:37:04,303 --> 00:37:05,262
Forget it.

590
00:37:06,263 --> 00:37:07,382
If he dies.

591
00:37:07,783 --> 00:37:09,102
it'll be in the news.

592
00:37:09,543 --> 00:37:11,582
Will I go to prison?

593
00:37:12,543 --> 00:37:14,342
What prison?

594
00:37:14,503 --> 00:37:16,902
Your father has connections

595
00:37:17,223 --> 00:37:18,222
Why are you scared?

596
00:37:18,623 --> 00:37:20,662
Dad is scarier than prison!

597
00:37:21,303 --> 00:37:21,782
Gosh!

598
00:37:22,143 --> 00:37:23,222
What should I do?

599
00:37:24,343 --> 00:37:26,142
Stay here until you feel better

600
00:37:41,503 --> 00:37:42,102
Here.

601
00:37:43,583 --> 00:37:44,742
I have a lot more.

602
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:46,422
Make yourself comfortable.

603
00:38:03,423 --> 00:38:06,302
Mr, Rome just fell asleep around dawn.

604
00:38:07,463 --> 00:38:08,782
He's quite stressed out.

605
00:38:09,543 --> 00:38:11,062
He refused to sleep.

606
00:38:11,103 --> 00:38:13,342
The doctor had to come give him sleeping medication

607
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:18,342
I have to go teach.

608
00:38:18,543 --> 00:38:20,102
Wait here. I'll come pick you up

609
00:38:20,743 --> 00:38:21,182
Okay,

610
00:38:28,103 --> 00:38:30,222
Do you not feel any remorse?

611
00:38:32,303 --> 00:38:33,222
Pardon?

612
00:38:34,543 --> 00:38:37,542
Mr, Rome got injured because of you.

613
00:38:38,303 --> 00:38:40,182
You have the nerves to show up here?

614
00:38:43,183 --> 00:38:45,182
It's because I do feel guilty

615
00:38:45,463 --> 00:38:47,062
that's why l want to look after him.

616
00:38:48,063 --> 00:38:49,622
That's my job.

617
00:38:51,023 --> 00:38:54,662
From now on, Iwill not let him take any fault for you again

618
00:38:58,063 --> 00:39:00,822
If you have good intentions for him like you said,

619
00:39:01,703 --> 00:39:03,382
keep your distance.

620
00:39:25,903 --> 00:39:26,662
Ms. Napa.

621
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:27,982
Someone wants to see you.

622
00:39:29,743 --> 00:39:30,222
Go ahead.

623
00:39:31,383 --> 00:39:32,022
Thank you.

624
00:39:36,223 --> 00:39:37,782
It's really satisfying.

625
00:39:38,263 --> 00:39:39,662
Wedding has been called off.

626
00:39:41,463 --> 00:39:43,182
The trending news right now.

627
00:39:43,623 --> 00:39:45,702
Going viral everyday.

628
00:39:46,303 --> 00:39:47,782
At every TV station.

629
00:39:50,383 --> 00:39:53,142
What's Mr, Rome's next plan?

630
00:39:56,983 --> 00:39:59,422
Kula chart shot Rome yesterday.

631
00:40:00,983 --> 00:40:01,902
What?

632
00:40:02,503 --> 00:40:04,702
But Rome is okay.

633
00:40:05,583 --> 00:40:06,462
Just...

634
00:40:07,023 --> 00:40:08,462
got shot under the collarbone.

635
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:14,142
Why are these people so evil like this?

636
00:40:15,543 --> 00:40:16,742
I want no more of this.

637
00:40:17,143 --> 00:40:18,382
I'm backing out.

638
00:40:18,943 --> 00:40:20,542
Even Mr, Rome got shot.

639
00:40:20,823 --> 00:40:22,342
So what about me?

640
00:40:23,023 --> 00:40:24,342
Wait Napa.

641
00:40:24,543 --> 00:40:25,502
Calm down.

642
00:40:25,663 --> 00:40:27,982
You have two police officers guarding you.

643
00:40:28,023 --> 00:40:29,142
Why are you still scared?

644
00:40:29,823 --> 00:40:30,422
Whatever.

645
00:40:31,423 --> 00:40:33,142
Please let Mr, Rome know.

646
00:40:33,263 --> 00:40:36,222
I rather take his money and move abroad

647
00:40:37,063 --> 00:40:39,462
I don't want to risk my life a second time.

648
00:40:40,863 --> 00:40:41,462
Look,

649
00:40:42,103 --> 00:40:42,862
Napa.

650
00:40:43,503 --> 00:40:45,382
You can't back out right now.

651
00:40:46,063 --> 00:40:47,782
They still haven't been caught

652
00:40:48,623 --> 00:40:50,422
You need to put them in prison first.

653
00:40:51,943 --> 00:40:53,102
No more.

654
00:40:54,383 --> 00:40:55,982
Whatever revenge Mr Rome wants to do,

655
00:40:56,383 --> 00:40:57,662
let him do it.

656
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:00,142
I've had enough

657
00:41:00,903 --> 00:41:02,342
I can't manage anymore.

658
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:17,302
I need money

659
00:41:17,823 --> 00:41:19,502
I just remembered

660
00:41:19,543 --> 00:41:22,342
your boss paid for you a tad bit low.

661
00:41:22,503 --> 00:41:23,782
Definitely lied to me.

662
00:41:24,263 --> 00:41:26,342
Keep an eye on her Don't lose sight.

663
00:41:29,783 --> 00:41:31,222
She confessed already

664
00:41:31,263 --> 00:41:32,422
that it was Rome's doing.

665
00:41:32,663 --> 00:41:35,942
couldn't stand the guilt anymore.

666
00:41:37,063 --> 00:41:40,022
If you want to subpoena me,

667
00:41:40,503 --> 00:41:42,182
or have proof to convict me,

668
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:46,702
