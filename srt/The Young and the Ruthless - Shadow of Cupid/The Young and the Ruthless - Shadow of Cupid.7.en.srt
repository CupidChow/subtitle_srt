17
00:01:42,943 --> 00:01:44,782
I'm sorry everyone

18
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,182
about today.

19
00:01:46,423 --> 00:01:49,382
I'm heading to England for work next week

20
00:01:49,503 --> 00:01:50,742
I also want to check out his school!

21
00:01:50,783 --> 00:01:51,582
Shit!

22
00:01:51,983 --> 00:01:53,182
What are we gonna do?

23
00:01:53,463 --> 00:01:55,422
Just do asl say.

24
00:01:56,063 --> 00:01:57,982
I'll teach you a little bit of acting

25
00:01:58,343 --> 00:02:00,302
T assure you there will be no problem.

26
00:02:00,823 --> 00:02:02,262
I have urgent news for you.

27
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:04,302
Mr, Kula chart is very sick.

28
00:02:04,303 --> 00:02:05,622
He's homesick.

29
00:02:06,343 --> 00:02:08,102
He's so stressed that he almost killed himself

30
00:02:08,343 --> 00:02:10,222
Ms. Napa is bringing him home at the moment

31
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:37,702
Kula chart, son.

32
00:02:38,943 --> 00:02:39,582
Son.

33
00:02:39,823 --> 00:02:40,942
It's okay.

34
00:02:42,143 --> 00:02:43,822
You're home now.

35
00:02:43,903 --> 00:02:45,142
Let's go home

36
00:02:48,863 --> 00:02:49,942
What the hell is wrong with him?

37
00:02:51,063 --> 00:02:51,942
The doctor said

38
00:02:52,183 --> 00:02:53,302
he's stressed about school

39
00:02:53,463 --> 00:02:54,782
and he misses home

40
00:02:55,223 --> 00:02:57,582
He couldn't adjust to his new environment.

41
00:02:58,063 --> 00:02:59,182
That's it?!

42
00:02:59,343 --> 00:03:00,822
He just became retarded like that?!

43
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:03,302
He's actually better than before

44
00:03:03,503 --> 00:03:04,902
In the beginning

45
00:03:04,943 --> 00:03:07,182
he would slit his wrist and try to kill himself

46
00:03:07,903 --> 00:03:10,342
I had to keep comforting him

47
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:11,462
Recently,

48
00:03:11,783 --> 00:03:13,022
he wanted to jump off a building.

49
00:03:13,263 --> 00:03:15,222
The security guard had to come and hold him back.

50
00:03:16,103 --> 00:03:17,222
So the doctor said

51
00:03:17,903 --> 00:03:20,302
it's best that I bring him back to Thailand

52
00:03:25,503 --> 00:03:26,982
He's big as a buffalo

53
00:03:27,223 --> 00:03:28,502
but has a heart of a goldfish

54
00:03:29,463 --> 00:03:30,262
It's okay.

55
00:03:30,863 --> 00:03:32,062
When he's cured,

56
00:03:32,143 --> 00:03:33,422
we can send him back

57
00:03:34,863 --> 00:03:35,902
Hey.

58
00:03:36,503 --> 00:03:37,542
This happened to our son

59
00:03:37,863 --> 00:03:39,342
and you still want to send him back?

60
00:03:39,983 --> 00:03:42,222
It's probably due to the drug s he used

61
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:43,662
You know that already

62
00:03:43,903 --> 00:03:46,222
I'll ask him myself when he's able to talk.

63
00:03:47,623 --> 00:03:50,102
I better not find out he was doing some random drugs over there too.

64
00:03:50,823 --> 00:03:52,342
I will kick his ass if he does!

65
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:57,382
From now on,

66
00:03:57,623 --> 00:03:59,662
I won't let you hit him again.

67
00:04:01,063 --> 00:04:01,822
Otherwise,

68
00:04:01,863 --> 00:04:03,342
I will take him to go live someplace else.

69
00:04:03,903 --> 00:04:05,662
This time I'm being serious.

70
00:04:17,623 --> 00:04:19,102
Don't be scared

71
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:48,182
How was my acting? Does it deserve an Oscar?

72
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:50,902
Don't be so jolly.

73
00:04:51,183 --> 00:04:52,862
Stay still, Trust me.

74
00:04:53,023 --> 00:04:54,782
If it's not necessary, don't call me.

75
00:04:55,143 --> 00:04:57,222
You know how your father is so canny.

76
00:05:01,783 --> 00:05:04,182
Don't forget about your father's kindness too.

77
00:05:04,463 --> 00:05:06,462
You should go make merit with your mother sometimes.

78
00:05:06,783 --> 00:05:11,302
Making merits will help you become more peaceful and a better person.

79
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:12,622
I have to go.

80
00:05:12,823 --> 00:05:13,982
Sweet dreams Kula chart.

81
00:05:16,623 --> 00:05:18,982
I'm just finding out you're a religious person

82
00:05:21,543 --> 00:05:22,542
Let me

83
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:26,582
examine your body a little so that I can be in peace all night.

84
00:05:27,463 --> 00:05:28,782
I'm sorry.

85
00:05:29,023 --> 00:05:30,742
I can't.

86
00:05:31,063 --> 00:05:34,062
I was busy handling Kula chart's situation.

87
00:05:34,343 --> 00:05:35,982
I'm so tired sir

88
00:05:37,543 --> 00:05:37,942
Hey.

89
00:05:38,343 --> 00:05:39,182
Don't worry.

90
00:05:39,783 --> 00:05:42,342
I will make it worth your effort.

91
00:05:43,303 --> 00:05:44,262
As for Chart,

92
00:05:45,623 --> 00:05:47,542
I need to find someone to tame him.

93
00:05:49,943 --> 00:05:51,102
Do you mean

94
00:05:51,223 --> 00:05:53,062
find a girl for him?

95
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:53,902
Yes.

96
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:55,142
You're very smart.

97
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:57,022
I should find him a wife.

98
00:05:57,543 --> 00:05:59,582
A rich millionaire's daughter.

99
00:06:00,383 --> 00:06:02,102
So he's no longer my burden

100
00:06:02,503 --> 00:06:03,702
You can't sir.

101
00:06:04,143 --> 00:06:06,182
You already know how Kula chart is.

102
00:06:06,703 --> 00:06:08,222
If he causes more problems

103
00:06:08,303 --> 00:06:09,862
we won't be able to pick up his mess

104
00:06:13,903 --> 00:06:14,742
I shouldn't have.

105
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,062
I shouldn't have chosen this bastard!

106
00:06:18,023 --> 00:06:19,382
What do you mean?

107
00:06:21,343 --> 00:06:22,182
Nothing.

108
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:24,662
Let's stop talking about stressful things

109
00:06:25,383 --> 00:06:25,822
Hey.

110
00:06:26,223 --> 00:06:28,622
I hope you're not so tired that

111
00:06:28,743 --> 00:06:30,262
you have no energy to massage me

112
00:06:30,863 --> 00:06:31,782
For you,

113
00:06:31,863 --> 00:06:33,102
I can do anything.

114
00:06:43,943 --> 00:06:44,862
May I serve you?

115
00:06:48,623 --> 00:06:49,822
I didn't order this.

116
00:06:49,983 --> 00:06:52,102
That gentleman over there ordered it for you.

117
00:07:11,423 --> 00:07:13,742
Thank you for the drinks.

118
00:07:14,383 --> 00:07:18,182
What if l want to take care of you as well, is that possible?

119
00:07:19,223 --> 00:07:21,422
Would it not be salty like the ocean?

120
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,782
I don't know, I never tried it Tian.

121
00:07:26,183 --> 00:07:28,462
Are you interested in using our service today?

122
00:07:28,503 --> 00:07:30,902
We have rentals for our bathing suits too.

123
00:07:32,383 --> 00:07:33,782
I rather not.

124
00:07:33,903 --> 00:07:35,302
It's too revealing

125
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,622
You can pick a sporty one.

126
00:07:40,263 --> 00:07:41,422
But I think you're right.

127
00:07:42,903 --> 00:07:44,142
Whether it be

128
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:45,942
one piece or two piece,

129
00:07:46,223 --> 00:07:47,222
or sports,

130
00:07:47,223 --> 00:07:50,422
perverts will still stare.

131
00:07:53,103 --> 00:07:53,782
Rome!

132
00:07:54,063 --> 00:07:55,342
Mr, Ka molt at.

133
00:07:57,063 --> 00:07:59,102
I didn't expect to see you here.

134
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,822
Who are these two?

135
00:08:02,143 --> 00:08:03,222
Nieces?

136
00:08:03,743 --> 00:08:05,022
Or daughters?

137
00:08:05,463 --> 00:08:06,422
We're not.

138
00:08:07,143 --> 00:08:09,462
We just barely met him

139
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,022
Sir

140
00:08:12,183 --> 00:08:13,742
I'm really sorry.

141
00:08:13,863 --> 00:08:15,742
I didn't know you were coming in today.

142
00:08:16,143 --> 00:08:19,902
Mr. Rome here just signed up to be a member here today.

143
00:08:20,063 --> 00:08:21,502
I'm so happy

144
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:23,662
that you two know each other

145
00:08:26,383 --> 00:08:28,102
It must be this guy

146
00:08:28,623 --> 00:08:30,462
that is the new VIP member here.

147
00:08:32,623 --> 00:08:34,822
Is the Sports Club here so desperate for money

148
00:08:34,863 --> 00:08:37,462
to accept a homeless person like this?

149
00:08:37,703 --> 00:08:39,982
And how is a perverted pedophile millionaire

150
00:08:40,543 --> 00:08:41,822
any better?

151
00:08:42,263 --> 00:08:42,862
Who are you talking about?!

152
00:08:42,863 --> 00:08:44,582
Hey calm down.

153
00:08:45,383 --> 00:08:46,822
We're no strangers to each other

154
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,702
But I'm actually happy to see you here.

155
00:08:51,023 --> 00:08:52,942
If you have any recommendations,

156
00:08:53,303 --> 00:08:56,022
country bumpkins like us

157
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:57,702
aro happy to hear.

158
00:09:00,143 --> 00:09:00,622
Hey,

159
00:09:00,823 --> 00:09:02,342
How's the investigation going?

160
00:09:02,503 --> 00:09:03,702
I got updates

161
00:09:04,783 --> 00:09:06,582
I'm in front of the factory in Ranong.

162
00:09:07,143 --> 00:09:07,582
Huh?

163
00:09:09,223 --> 00:09:10,542
Factory in Ranong?

164
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:12,542
What do you mean?

165
00:09:13,463 --> 00:09:14,222
I'll reverse the camera.

166
00:09:16,383 --> 00:09:16,862
Here.

167
00:09:17,903 --> 00:09:19,582
Rome's frozen food factory.

168
00:09:21,703 --> 00:09:23,422
He also has about ten fishing boats too

169
00:09:25,543 --> 00:09:26,742
He has a coconut orchard

170
00:09:27,063 --> 00:09:28,102
and palm orchard.

171
00:09:29,063 --> 00:09:30,102
Unbelievable.

172
00:09:30,783 --> 00:09:32,742
He went completely bankrupt

173
00:09:33,463 --> 00:09:35,742
How did he get the money to start a big factory like this?

174
00:09:36,663 --> 00:09:37,422
I heard that

175
00:09:38,063 --> 00:09:38,862
his friend is quite big here.

176
00:09:40,543 --> 00:09:42,182
Probably an investor of his.

177
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:43,942
What about the girl with him?

178
00:09:45,063 --> 00:09:46,302
No info yet.

179
00:09:46,743 --> 00:09:47,502
But for sure,

180
00:09:48,343 --> 00:09:49,622
Rome isn't married yet

181
00:09:57,423 --> 00:09:58,062
Rome!

182
00:10:15,903 --> 00:10:16,382
Sir!

183
00:10:16,423 --> 00:10:17,182
Mr, Lak!

184
00:10:17,303 --> 00:10:18,222
-Boss!
-Sir!

185
00:10:18,503 --> 00:10:18,822
Stop!

186
00:10:18,863 --> 00:10:19,342
Rome!

187
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,142
Mr, Lak, go stop them

188
00:10:23,183 --> 00:10:23,822
Boss :

189
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:36,742
Are you okay?

190
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:37,622
I'm fine.

191
00:10:39,343 --> 00:10:40,022
Boss.

192
00:10:40,303 --> 00:10:41,342
Why is he not moving?

193
00:10:42,383 --> 00:10:43,022
Tian.

194
00:10:43,183 --> 00:10:43,702
Don't go.

195
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:44,622
He's fine.

196
00:10:44,823 --> 00:10:45,622
No!

197
00:10:45,743 --> 00:10:46,142
Tian!

198
00:10:50,663 --> 00:10:51,542
Sir!

199
00:10:53,103 --> 00:10:53,622
Hey!

200
00:10:53,663 --> 00:10:54,782
Guard, help!

201
00:10:54,903 --> 00:10:55,582
Guard!

202
00:11:04,743 --> 00:11:05,222
Sir.

203
00:11:07,983 --> 00:11:09,142
Why did you save him?

204
00:11:10,943 --> 00:11:12,422
Because he really passed out.

205
00:11:13,303 --> 00:11:15,782
I didn't want Boss to be a murderer either

206
00:11:28,823 --> 00:11:30,382
I'm sorry Boss.

207
00:11:32,143 --> 00:11:33,102
Why are you sorry?

208
00:11:33,983 --> 00:11:34,822
You did the right thing

209
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:37,822
Why is it like that now?

210
00:11:38,663 --> 00:11:39,462
People like him

211
00:11:40,263 --> 00:11:41,502
don't deserve to die right now.

212
00:11:42,503 --> 00:11:45,302
He has to live to pay for his karma first

213
00:11:47,703 --> 00:11:49,182
That'll be all with Ka molt at for now.

214
00:11:49,783 --> 00:11:50,262
Tian.

215
00:11:51,023 --> 00:11:51,782
Go get changed.

216
00:11:53,223 --> 00:11:53,662
Okay

217
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:57,822
As for you

218
00:11:59,223 --> 00:12:00,062
wait here.

219
00:12:00,783 --> 00:12:01,342
Okay.

220
00:12:01,623 --> 00:12:02,982
As you wish...

221
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:04,702
Boss.

222
00:12:13,223 --> 00:12:14,462
What happened?

223
00:12:14,783 --> 00:12:16,102
Why is your face bruised?

224
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:18,742
Rome did this : He punched me

225
00:12:19,503 --> 00:12:20,982
He was trying to drown me too.

226
00:12:22,623 --> 00:12:23,342
That's not true.

227
00:12:24,423 --> 00:12:26,502
Rome isn't barbaric like that.

228
00:12:28,903 --> 00:12:29,702
You're siding with him again.

229
00:12:30,703 --> 00:12:32,062
You really want me to die, don't you?

230
00:12:34,703 --> 00:12:35,902
Don't worry.

231
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:37,182
Sinful people like us

232
00:12:39,303 --> 00:12:40,742
won't die that easily.

233
00:12:43,383 --> 00:12:46,582
Luckily l was saved by the girl Rome was with

234
00:12:47,863 --> 00:12:50,262
This kid is around Chart'sage.

235
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:51,742
But she looks good and noble

236
00:12:53,103 --> 00:12:53,742
Unlike that bastard son.

237
00:12:54,663 --> 00:12:55,662
What a waste raising him

238
00:13:00,383 --> 00:13:00,982
Wait.

239
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:04,062
How is Chart doing?

240
00:13:06,783 --> 00:13:08,502
It's going to take time.

241
00:13:08,943 --> 00:13:10,662
He'll gradually get better.

242
00:13:11,663 --> 00:13:12,342
This won't do.

243
00:13:12,903 --> 00:13:13,902
Why even have doctors then?

244
00:13:14,423 --> 00:13:15,702
We need to get him treated.

245
00:13:17,023 --> 00:13:19,382
You won't take him to a mental hospital right?

246
00:13:20,863 --> 00:13:22,702
I'm not stupid to put my last name

247
00:13:23,063 --> 00:13:24,822
in a mental hospital registrar

248
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:27,382
l contacted a private hospital already

249
00:13:28,103 --> 00:13:31,382
They said they will keep this a secret until chart gets better

250
00:13:39,343 --> 00:13:39,942
Napa.

251
00:13:45,543 --> 00:13:48,422
Yeah. It'll beabout15minutes

252
00:13:48,783 --> 00:13:49,982
I won't be late.

253
00:13:55,223 --> 00:13:56,262
What's wrong?

254
00:13:57,543 --> 00:13:58,302
Nothing.

255
00:14:16,503 --> 00:14:18,022
Pick up Rome!

256
00:14:28,623 --> 00:14:29,382
Hello Mon

257
00:14:31,703 --> 00:14:32,262
What?

258
00:14:33,663 --> 00:14:34,622
Sam is waiting for you?

259
00:14:35,423 --> 00:14:36,462
Don't do anything yet.

260
00:14:36,503 --> 00:14:37,262
I'm on my way.

261
00:14:41,023 --> 00:14:42,102
I'm at the hotel.

262
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,422
Where's your husband?

263
00:14:48,143 --> 00:14:48,862
Rome!

264
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:06,422
I'm the person Mr. Rome hired to look after you

265
00:15:14,343 --> 00:15:15,182
He's a bodyguard.

266
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:17,702
I sent him to look after you

267
00:15:17,903 --> 00:15:19,262
because your husband hasn't been arrested yet

268
00:15:20,183 --> 00:15:21,582
He might be back to hurt you again

269
00:15:22,983 --> 00:15:24,302
I never thought

270
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:27,142
you would be this concern for me.

271
00:15:27,703 --> 00:15:28,742
He's dangerous.

272
00:15:29,943 --> 00:15:31,182
I have to help the officials

273
00:15:31,543 --> 00:15:32,582
bring him in for justice.

274
00:15:32,823 --> 00:15:35,302
I still have to thank you.

275
00:15:36,463 --> 00:15:39,382
You've always been generous to me.

276
00:15:39,743 --> 00:15:40,942
You never changed.

277
00:15:41,183 --> 00:15:42,622
I'm the one that...

278
00:15:47,623 --> 00:15:48,102
Sorry.

279
00:15:53,143 --> 00:15:57,182
Rome did send a bodyguard to look after me.

280
00:15:57,543 --> 00:16:00,542
That means he still.cares and still has feelings for you

281
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:06,662
But that girl Tian must be his new giri friend.

282
00:16:07,503 --> 00:16:10,662
Didn't Rome tell you that she's not?

283
00:16:10,663 --> 00:16:12,382
What should l do?

284
00:16:12,743 --> 00:16:13,742
Prove it.

285
00:16:13,903 --> 00:16:15,982
You got nothing to lose sis.

286
00:16:16,023 --> 00:16:16,782
Go for it!

287
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:20,622
Hello.

288
00:16:23,343 --> 00:16:24,382
Is the fever high?

289
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,262
That's high.

290
00:16:27,783 --> 00:16:29,222
No matter how many lines, I don't trust it

291
00:16:29,543 --> 00:16:30,982
We don't know what kind of virus it is.

292
00:16:34,143 --> 00:16:35,542
Take her to the hospital!

293
00:16:35,823 --> 00:16:36,742
I'm on my way.

294
00:16:37,383 --> 00:16:37,862
Hey!

295
00:16:38,543 --> 00:16:40,302
I just arrived in Bangkok

296
00:16:40,343 --> 00:16:42,182
You don't want me to rest at all?

297
00:16:42,303 --> 00:16:44,422
Most importantly, did you forget I'm a doctor?

298
00:16:45,543 --> 00:16:46,102
Rome.

299
00:16:47,023 --> 00:16:47,942
Are you'still there?

300
00:16:48,823 --> 00:16:49,502
Hello?

301
00:16:53,143 --> 00:16:53,902
Gosh!

302
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:55,382
Look at him.

303
00:16:55,863 --> 00:16:57,062
Such a dictator!

304
00:16:57,703 --> 00:16:58,982
I'm fine.

305
00:17:05,703 --> 00:17:07,822
It's probably because you were in the water saving Ka molt at.

306
00:17:08,383 --> 00:17:10,222
Does she need to go to the hospital?

307
00:17:10,823 --> 00:17:13,702
Lak isn't home either. He went to see his friend since morning

308
00:17:14,383 --> 00:17:15,142
Do you know

309
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:17,422
he's so protective of Tian

310
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:19,422
more than a cobra is protective of its eggs?

311
00:17:19,503 --> 00:17:21,182
If we disobey his orders,

312
00:17:21,343 --> 00:17:22,702
and worse things happens to her,

313
00:17:23,063 --> 00:17:24,102
he will keep complaining.

314
00:17:30,143 --> 00:17:31,062
I have to go.

315
00:17:31,103 --> 00:17:31,742
It's urgent.

316
00:17:32,623 --> 00:17:34,582
What happened? Is everyone okay?

317
00:17:35,303 --> 00:17:36,222
Tian is sick.

318
00:17:36,543 --> 00:17:37,782
I need to send her to the hospital.

319
00:17:42,623 --> 00:17:43,382
Bill please

320
00:17:44,743 --> 00:17:46,342
That's okay, I'll pay

321
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:48,102
Mon.

322
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:50,862
Are you hurt?

323
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:54,462
I think I sprained my ankle. It hurts really bad.

324
00:17:56,663 --> 00:17:58,462
Is it broken?

325
00:18:09,623 --> 00:18:10,502
I think it's fine.

326
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,742
Put ice on it and medicine and it'll get better.

327
00:18:16,623 --> 00:18:17,822
If you need anything

328
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:19,502
just let the bodyguard know.

329
00:18:20,463 --> 00:18:21,102
I have to go.

330
00:18:24,183 --> 00:18:24,942
Rome.

331
00:18:26,703 --> 00:18:28,182
Can you stay first?

332
00:18:28,623 --> 00:18:30,542
I don't want to be alone.

333
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:31,502
I'm scared.

334
00:18:34,023 --> 00:18:35,622
I'm sorry

335
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,422
for hurting you.

336
00:18:39,903 --> 00:18:41,142
I want to redeem myself.

337
00:18:51,743 --> 00:18:52,782
It's in the past now

338
00:18:54,223 --> 00:18:55,542
I don't hold a grudge

339
00:18:56,543 --> 00:18:58,022
I have the right to start over.

340
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,822
So do you.

341
00:19:06,303 --> 00:19:08,582
But I want to start over with you

342
00:19:16,703 --> 00:19:17,302
She's here.

343
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:20,862
How did it go Tian?

344
00:19:21,063 --> 00:19:23,782
The doctor said I have the flu and he prescribed me medicine.

345
00:19:24,703 --> 00:19:25,342
Can I see?

346
00:19:27,983 --> 00:19:28,702
Oh.

347
00:19:29,063 --> 00:19:31,102
Just your normal flu. Nothing serious

348
00:19:31,783 --> 00:19:33,582
Rome can rest assured now.

349
00:19:35,023 --> 00:19:36,182
Let'sgo home now

350
00:19:36,223 --> 00:19:36,862
Wait.

351
00:19:37,423 --> 00:19:39,822
Dr.Jom'wants us to go see him.

352
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,822
He's examining his last patient right now.

353
00:19:42,543 --> 00:19:43,582
Jom is here?

354
00:19:43,623 --> 00:19:44,302
Yeah.

355
00:19:44,303 --> 00:19:46,462
Good. I haven't seen him in so long. I miss him.

356
00:19:47,383 --> 00:19:49,862
Sit down and wait for us here.

357
00:19:49,903 --> 00:19:50,862
We're gonna go see our friend.

358
00:19:51,343 --> 00:19:51,982
Okay.

359
00:19:52,143 --> 00:19:52,622
Let's go.

360
00:20:08,463 --> 00:20:09,022
Hurry.

361
00:20:10,463 --> 00:20:10,982
What?!

362
00:20:11,023 --> 00:20:11,862
Now what?

363
00:20:12,063 --> 00:20:13,382
What do l do when l see the doctor?

364
00:20:15,063 --> 00:20:16,622
Just stay still.

365
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:19,262
Or act confused

366
00:20:19,663 --> 00:20:20,102
You want that?

367
00:20:20,143 --> 00:20:21,142
Why are you worried?

368
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:25,342
We just need a record of you being here and the medicine to confirm with your dad.

369
00:20:26,063 --> 00:20:27,062
Stop worrying

370
00:20:27,783 --> 00:20:29,422
Go sit and wait.

371
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:31,342
I'll contact the doctor

372
00:20:59,863 --> 00:21:00,662
Yeah?

373
00:21:01,703 --> 00:21:02,302
Of course

374
00:21:02,783 --> 00:21:04,342
I'll wire you 40,000.

375
00:21:04,543 --> 00:21:05,662
I'm betting on Juve

376
00:21:07,103 --> 00:21:09,022
Gosh I'm not scared

377
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,302
I'm close to my dad'ssecretary

378
00:21:13,223 --> 00:21:14,702
I'll be there.

379
00:21:14,703 --> 00:21:15,902
Dad won't notice.

00:22:14,463 --> 00:22:16,662
Do you know what you're doing is illegal?

385
00:22:16,983 --> 00:22:19,462
You're also lying to your parents.

386
00:22:19,783 --> 00:22:20,382
Gosh.

387
00:22:20,743 --> 00:22:21,502

The patient is just scared of heights.

437
00:24:56,863 --> 00:24:59,262
Those with acrophobia should seek therapy.

438
00:24:59,743 --> 00:25:02,022
You can go pick up some anti anxiety
medicine along with vitamins first.

439
00:25:02,383 --> 00:25:02,982

00:25:03,263 --> 00:25:04,102

450
00:25:47,303 --> 00:25:49,622

Look at you.

452
00:25:53,383 --> 00:25:54,822

454
00:25:57,783 --> 00:26:00,302

459
00:26:09,463 --> 00:26:10,702
The patient I was talking about.

460
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:12,622
His father is a businessman

461
00:26:12,823 --> 00:26:13,902
and donated to the hospital

462
00:26:14,183 --> 00:26:14,982
You know him?

463
00:26:17,343 --> 00:26:18,582
I do.

464
00:26:20,343 --> 00:26:21,102
Funny.

465
00:26:21,783 --> 00:26:23,622
He doesn't like being a normal i person.

466
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:29,102
Black coffee.

467
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:30,142

468
00:26:34,063 --> 00:26:35,662
Oh.

469
00:26:35,663 --> 00:26:36,782
Why did you come home late?

470
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:38,622
thought you were meeting us at the hospital?

471
00:26:40,503 --> 00:26:41,942
I had a little errand to do.

472
00:26:43,903 --> 00:26:45,142
How's Tian doing?

473
00:26:47,823 --> 00:26:48,782
Her fever is down

474
00:26:49,623 --> 00:26:50,902
If she takes her medicine

475
00:26:51,423 --> 00:26:53,382
and get lots of rest,she'll feel better

476
00:26:55,583 --> 00:26:56,302
But...

477
00:26:59,383 --> 00:27:01,982
something more exciting happened

478
00:27:05,943 --> 00:27:08,142
He got his evil blood from his father.

479
00:27:09,143 --> 00:27:11,422
He was in my class at one point.

480
00:27:12,543 --> 00:27:14,542
He's lazy and naughty

481
00:27:15,103 --> 00:27:16,542
I'm starting to wonder

482
00:27:16,783 --> 00:27:19,102
it was probably him that ordered the hit on me.

483
00:27:19,903 --> 00:27:20,622
Wow.

484
00:27:20,863 --> 00:27:22,822
He's bold to do that?

485
00:27:23,983 --> 00:27:24,862
So evil.

486
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:26,982
I don't have other enemies.

487
00:27:27,583 --> 00:27:28,862
If there was a disagreement,

488
00:27:28,903 --> 00:27:30,262
it was with him.

489
00:27:30,583 --> 00:27:31,782
Makes me angry.

490
00:27:32,103 --> 00:27:33,982
I have no proof of his doing.

491
00:27:34,543 --> 00:27:35,062
So,

492
00:27:35,663 --> 00:27:36,582
have a rest

493
00:27:37,063 --> 00:27:38,222
and let'scatch up later.

494
00:27:40,343 --> 00:27:41,142
It means

495
00:27:41,263 --> 00:27:45,422
get some rest and we can talk later.

496
00:27:46,783 --> 00:27:47,182
Okay.

497
00:27:47,903 --> 00:27:49,782

and give it to Pao so he can run a DNA test.

503
00:28:47,263 --> 00:28:48,942
If they're father and daughter

504
00:28:49,343 --> 00:28:50,622
will you tell Tian?

505
00:28:51,783 --> 00:28:53,382
We will discuss after the results are in

506
00:28:54,823 --> 00:28:55,542
I think you

507
00:28:56,623 --> 00:28:58,142

509
00:29:01,543 --> 00:29:03,062
If she finds out the truth,

510
00:29:03,223 --> 00:29:05,542
have you thought about how sad she's going to feel?

511
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:09,182
If they're father and daughter,

512
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:13,262
Tian has the rights as a Taks as ut

513
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:15,902

Tian wants us to help?

517
00:29:22,543 --> 00:29:23,862
I'll take responsibility for it.

518
00:29:40,103 --> 00:29:40,462

00:29:44,623 --> 00:29:45,262
It's okay.

523
00:29:45,303 --> 00:29:46,062
Mom isn't home.

524
00:30:00,823 --> 00:30:01,182
Hey.

525
00:30:01,783 --> 00:30:03,862
What are you doing in this room late at night?

526
00:30:04,863 --> 00:30:07,102
We got new medications for him.

527
00:30:09,263 --> 00:30:11,102
I had to monitor his symptoms

528
00:30:12,023 --> 00:30:14,782
I didn't want to bother Mrs. Pit either sol volunteered to do it.

529
00:30:16,383 --> 00:30:17,662
What did the doctor say?

530
00:30:20,303 --> 00:30:21,822
The doctor said

531
00:30:23,143 --> 00:30:24,902
he also has acrophobia

532
00:30:25,583 --> 00:30:27,062
Frequent therapy is needed!

533
00:30:31,303 --> 00:30:32,662
Why so many conditions?!

534
00:30:33,423 --> 00:30:35,022
A lot of restrictions too

535
00:30:35,223 --> 00:30:36,502
You can't criticize or scold him

536
00:30:36,623 --> 00:30:37,662
You can't raise your voice.

537
00:30:37,743 --> 00:30:39,102
You can't offend him either.

538
00:30:39,903 --> 00:30:41,342

00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:46,502
Don't let him get wild.

572
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:49,462
Don't forget that this place isn't our territory.

573
00:33:50,103 --> 00:33:51,262
O will try.

574
00:33:51,703 --> 00:33:52,502
Anyway,

575
00:33:52,703 --> 00:33:53,622
safe travel.

576
00:33:55,183 --> 00:33:55,582
Let's go.

577
00:34:06,463 --> 00:34:07,542
Coast is clear Tian.

578
00:34:09,263 --> 00:34:11,902
Are you sure Boss will be back at night?

579
00:34:12,063 --> 00:34:12,862
Yes.

580
00:34:12,983 --> 00:34:14,582
Rome is at a meeting with an agency

581
00:34:14,623 --> 00:34:17,062
He will not be home before 5:00pm for sure.

582
00:34:17,663 --> 00:34:18,502
Excellent.

583
00:34:18,543 --> 00:34:19,142
In that case,

584
00:34:19,823 --> 00:34:21,382
I will begin our plan, Teacher.

585
00:34:21,983 --> 00:34:23,542
Let's go!

586
00:34:31,463 --> 00:34:32,462
Hello.

587
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:35,822
Is this the number of the handsome Kula chart?

588
00:34:47,423 --> 00:34:48,262
Chart!

589
00:34:51,743 --> 00:34:52,902
Kula chart.

590
00:34:53,463 --> 00:34:54,582
Where are you going?

591
00:34:54,703 --> 00:34:56,062
You're better now?

592
00:34:57,583 --> 00:34:58,302
I'm stressed

593
00:34:58,663 --> 00:34:59,582
I don't want to stay in my room

594
00:35:00,263 --> 00:35:01,422
Can I go wherever you're going?

595
00:35:03,183 --> 00:35:04,342
I'm going to the temple.

596
00:35:04,703 --> 00:35:05,782
You don't like it.

597
00:35:06,983 --> 00:35:07,582
Good.

598
00:35:07,663 --> 00:35:08,342
Pray.

599
00:35:08,743 --> 00:35:09,822
Our mind will be at peace

600
00:35:10,423 --> 00:35:11,342
Let me come with you.

601
00:36:18,663 --> 00:36:19,822
Are you waiting for someone?

602
00:36:23,823 --> 00:36:25,262
You really came Chart.

603
00:36:26,383 --> 00:36:27,342
I'm touched.

604
00:36:27,623 --> 00:36:29,062
You remember my name

605
00:36:30,343 --> 00:36:31,502
Candle, right?

606
00:36:31,823 --> 00:36:33,662
I thought you were an angel

607
00:36:34,543 --> 00:36:35,542
What angel?

608
00:36:35,663 --> 00:36:37,702
You like to talk nonsense.

609
00:36:38,463 --> 00:36:39,702
Although I talk nonsense

610
00:36:40,023 --> 00:36:42,102
but I'm sincere.

611
00:36:42,823 --> 00:36:43,702
If you don't believe me,

612
00:36:44,143 --> 00:36:45,422
you wanna go eat chim chum?

613
00:36:45,943 --> 00:36:46,782
las sure you

614
00:36:47,183 --> 00:36:48,382
eating chim chum with me

615
00:36:48,903 --> 00:36:50,022
is much funner than playing here

616
00:36:51,983 --> 00:36:53,542
Before we go eat chim chum,

617
00:36:53,903 --> 00:36:56,582
I have to make sure that you are the one for me.

618
00:36:57,423 --> 00:37:00,942
I like playing extreme sports.

619
00:37:01,303 --> 00:37:02,462
A man's sports.

620
00:37:03,583 --> 00:37:04,302
No problem.

621
00:37:05,143 --> 00:37:07,862
Jam the man of your dream.

622
00:37:09,783 --> 00:37:10,422
Then...

623
00:37:11,023 --> 00:37:13,782
let'sstart with a carousel

624
00:37:14,583 --> 00:37:15,102
Sounds good?

625
00:37:15,583 --> 00:37:16,222
No.

626
00:37:16,263 --> 00:37:17,382
That's for babies.

627
00:37:18,343 --> 00:37:20,542
I think we should start with something else.

628
00:37:25,103 --> 00:37:26,022
Wow,

629
00:37:28,983 --> 00:37:30,502
No Candle!

630
00:37:31,823 --> 00:37:34,422
Chart, I booked you a few rides just for you.

631
00:37:39,703 --> 00:37:41,222
If I'm putting this much effort for you,

632
00:37:42,103 --> 00:37:43,822
you better not leave me Candle

633
00:37:47,183 --> 00:37:48,262
This war is for you.

634
00:37:48,743 --> 00:37:49,702
For you,

635
00:37:50,103 --> 00:37:51,662
I will fight with my life!

636
00:37:54,383 --> 00:37:55,782
Bring it on!

637
00:37:58,943 --> 00:37:59,822
You got this Chart!

638
00:37:59,863 --> 00:38:00,662
So cool!

639
00:38:36,663 --> 00:38:38,022
Hey! Hey!

640
00:38:41,743 --> 00:38:42,462
I can't!

641
00:38:43,143 --> 00:38:43,982
I'm gonna die!

642
00:38:44,023 --> 00:38:44,702
I'm dead!

643
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:46,622
Im gonna be dead

644
00:38:48,863 --> 00:38:49,742

645
00:38:51,863 --> 00:38:53,342
I'm gonna be dead!

646
00:39:24,503 --> 00:39:25,422
Are you okay Chart?

647
00:39:25,743 --> 00:39:27,222
Sit down and rest first.

648
00:39:29,023 --> 00:39:29,902
How are you?

649
00:39:31,143 --> 00:39:33,902
I'm not dead yet, right?

650
00:39:34,463 --> 00:39:35,262
Good job!

651
00:39:35,303 --> 00:39:36,102
You looked cool!

652
00:39:36,143 --> 00:39:37,102
Good job!

653
00:39:37,503 --> 00:39:38,582
For you,

654
00:39:39,223 --> 00:39:41,302
I will fight to the fullest.

655
00:39:43,023 --> 00:39:43,942
This...

656
00:39:44,503 --> 00:39:45,422

657
00:39:46,103 --> 00:39:46,742

What now?

660
00:40:06,743 --> 00:40:07,462
Excuse me!

661
00:40:09,343 --> 00:40:10,342
Can you help us?

662
00:40:11,943 --> 00:40:13,582
He fainted.

663
00:40:13,823 --> 00:40:14,622
He was on the ride earlier

664
00:40:15,383 --> 00:40:16,142
Excuse me.

665
00:40:16,263 --> 00:40:16,862
Hey.

668
00:40:28,183 --> 00:40:30,462
I must get revenge on her no matter what.

669
00:40:30,583 --> 00:40:31,702
What's the girl's name?

670
00:40:33,143 --> 00:40:34,862
I don't want you

671
00:40:35,063 --> 00:40:37,462
to lose anything like in the past.

672
00:40:37,543 --> 00:40:39,742
