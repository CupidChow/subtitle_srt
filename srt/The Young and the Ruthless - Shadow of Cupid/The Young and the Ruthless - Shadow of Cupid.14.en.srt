Why are you scared?

27
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,119
Dad is much scarier than prison!

I want to back out.

32
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,199
Even Mr Rome got shot.

36
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,719
Boss.

37
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,399
Why are you sitting here?

38
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,519
What about you?

39
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,919
Why are you sitting here drooling all over?

40
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,039
Well...

41
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,599
It's just...

42
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,879
Ms. Thip told me you fell asleep sol..

43
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,919
came to wait out here

44
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,159
How disgusting.

45
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,879
You're sitting here nodding off.

46
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,879
If you're that sleepy,go home and sleep.

47
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,239
If you don't want to see my face

48
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,079
the nl can leave.

49
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,399
Boss.

50
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,919
Does your wound hurt?

51
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,719
Of course it hurts.

52
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,119
You nodded off and your head hit my wound real hard.

53
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,959
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,679
I made you get hurt again.

55
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,799
I'm sorry.

56
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,759
Be gentle.

57
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,239
Is this okay?

58
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,239
A little more.

59
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,959
Where's Ms. T hip?

60
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:47,959
Oh.

61
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,399
Je ab called

62
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,999
and said she has a fever

63
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,559
Sol had Ms. Thip go check to see if she has co vidor not.

64
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,479
I told her to just stay home and not come back

65
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,719
since l feel much better.now.

66
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,599
Who will look after you?

67
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,239
There's nurses here.

68
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,239
I get nauseous when Ms. Thip is around.

69
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,639
She's always doing things for me

70
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,759
Where did you get the jasmine flowers from?

71
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:14,719
Smells nice.

72
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,599
Oh.

73
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,079
I picked it from your house.

74
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,159
I didn't know what to bring as a gift sol chose jasmine flowers instead.

75
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,919
l am sorry

76
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,839
for making you get injured because of me again

77
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,359
I almost died.

78
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,119
Just apologizing

79
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,119
is enough?

80
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:44,759
So...

81
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,599
what do you..

82
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,439
want me to do?

83
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,799
Or you can criticize me or hit me if you want.

84
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,759
I will allow it

85
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,719
I'm sorry.

86
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,879
Do you see me as...

87
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,879
a psychopath,

88
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:00,839
sadist,

89
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,999
who likes violence?

90
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,799
It's not like that

91
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,199
My boss is the kindest person in the world.

92
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,239
So why did you want to leave me then?

93
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,879
If you believe

94
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,919
that I really have good intentions with you,

95
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,479
why leave?

96
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,239
just feel disheartened.

97
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,119
You didn't tell me the truth.

98
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,679
I'm sorry

99
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,359
for keeping it from you.

100
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,079
Then...

101
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,279
can you promise me one thing?

102
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,759
From now on,you won't keep anything from me.

103
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,119
Your food is here.

104
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,159
Right on time.

105
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,119
I'm starving.

106
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,479
Here you go.

107
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,799

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,439
Here.

109
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,279
There.

110
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,559
So,

111
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,879
how do you want me to eat?

112
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,239
My arm still hurts.

113
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,239
Oh...

114
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,719
I'll feed you then.

115
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,679
Careful.

116
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,679
Is it delicious?

117
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,719
Another bite?

118
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,879
-That's a big bite.
-It is.

119
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,599
Here.

120
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,439
I thought you were a nurse.

121
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,519
It's Tian.

122
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,759
Rome.

123
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,439
I brought you your favorites.

124
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,479
Thank you, Can you...

125
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,439
put it down over there?

126
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,239
It's just...

127
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,799
the hospital food is okay. I can manage.

128
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,559
Tian.

129
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,999
That's okay. I'll feed him

130
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,879
You should go wash the fruits.

131
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,879
Please.

132
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,799
I'll feed you.

133
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:21,959
Here.

134
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:28,719
Oh.

135
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,599
Tian!

136
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,639
Why are you sitting here?

137
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,079
I was waiting for you

138
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,439
Let's go home.

139
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,079
Not yet.

140
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,119
I haven't visited Rome yet.

141
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,399
Boss is with Ms. Mon.

142
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,439
You shouldn't interrupt them

143
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,479
Tian.

144
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,519
Eat properly

145
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,759
Eating while being absent-minded

146
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,399
will give you indigestion

147
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,319
You'll get constipated and die.

148
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,599
It looks like Rome will be getting back together with Mont ira.

149
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,839
But I'm not surprised.

150
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,919
They dated since college.

151
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,519
After their break up,

152
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,279
Rome never dated anyone else.

153
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,319
That means those two still l have feelings for each other

154
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,799
That's good.

155
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,679
" I think they suit each other.

156
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,599
Really?

157
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,479
You mean

158
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,159
you won't feel anything

159
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,919
if Rome were to give all his attention to Mont ira and not you?

160
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,959
If eeb

161
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,679
I will feel very happy

162
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,879
because if Boss is happy

163
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,559
the nl am happy for him.

164
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,319
Sergeant.

165
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,879
Someone is lurking around at the parking lot again.

166
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,839
But we have searched the parking lot five times already

167
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,119
I'm not gonna wait for them to come kill me.

168
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,519
Mr s, P itplern.

169
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,159
It's Napa.

170
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,959
Whatever you need, let me take care of it for you.

171
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,999
What do you people know?

172
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,319
I'm going to go buy women things.

173
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,999
Feminine cleanser or pads with wings,

174
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,599
you know those?

175
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,599
Watch this. I'm going to go use the restroom.

176
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,199
Are you coming with me?

177
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,079
Go ahead

178
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,839
Napa.

179
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,199
When you...

180
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,799
said Ka mol tat'smen were trying to kill you,

181
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,519
was that true?

182
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,679
I think

183
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,839
you should know your husband well.

184
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:16,959
It's not just that.

185
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,079
Kula chart went to shoot Rome at his house.

186
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,559
But he didn't die.

187
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,479
I don't want to risk my life again

188
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,199
I don't want to get involved in this anymore.

189
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,159
So where is Kula chart right now?

190
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,319
I don't know.

191
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,279
But what I know is

192
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,479
you're not involved with your husband's activities.

193
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,719
For your family's reputation,

194
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,479
I'm asking for five million.

195
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,479
Iim moving abroad.

196
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,039
las sure you no one will ever see me again.

197
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,919
I will arrange it.

198
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,719
When do you need the money?

199
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,919
I will contact you.

200
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,439
Where have you been?

201
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,759
Nowhere.

202
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,239
What do you mean'nowhere?

203
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,239
I just saw you came home.

204
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,039
You went to see your son?

205
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,759
No, I didn't.

206
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,199
I'm still waiting for him to contact me.

207
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,279
If he calls

208
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,279
do not give him money.

209
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,319
Let him starve and come home on his own.

210
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,039
Understood?

211
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,599
With that kind of behavior

212
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,519
she's definitely lying to me.

213
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,159
Keep an eye on her. Don't lose sight.

214
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,599
What will you do about Napa?

215
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,679
Once lm discharged,

216
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,719
I will talk to her

217
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,919
It looks like she only wants money.

218
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,719
Give it to her.

219
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,359
But she has to help us handle Ka molt at to her fullest.

220
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,879
Hello.

221
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,679
I bought you some fresh hot soy milk.
Let'shave some together

222
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:25,959
No.

223
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,519
I'm scared it might be contaminated

224
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,879
People can't be trusted these days.

225
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,039
+
Right.

226
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,719
Pao left back to Ranong because he has patients

227
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,239
I'll have Lak come pick you up tomorrow.

228
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,679
That's okay.

229
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,239
I can take the taxi

230
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,519
You can't.

231
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,799
Your charioteer is right here.

232
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,399
How are you Je ab?

233
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,839
Ms. Thip checked my temp and it's only one line.

234
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,279
It's probably the flu Perhaps keeping your distance will be safer.

235
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:27,959
Yes.

236
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,959
Mr. Rome.

237
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,759
Do you want to go upstairs and rest?

238
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:37,999
No.

239
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:38,919
I feel much better

240
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,759
Thank you Ms. Thip.

241
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,679
where is everyone?

242
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,599
I'm right here

243
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,799
I was waiting to see you before work

244
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,759
As for Tian.

245
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,879
I saw her waiting for you since morning

246
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,479
But I don't know where she went

247
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,439
Rome.

248
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:04,159
Do you want to have breakfast first so you can take your medicine afterwards?

249
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,199
So your wound can heal faster or...

250
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,039
you want to get washed up first?

251
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,439
I can do that.

252
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,199
Wait.

253
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,719
Everyone in the house is at risk of catching the flu from Je ab.

254
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,479
You shouldn't go near Rome.

255
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,639
He's not healthy yet.

256
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,839
I'm fine.

257
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,999
I'm also a nurse.

258
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,999
J don't need anyone to teach me

259
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,879
on how to look after patients

260
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,719
Alright, that's enough

261
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,599
Let's just say...

262
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,599
I can take care of myself.

263
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,919
J just have to be careful not to get my wound wet

264
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,399
And I can use my other arm when lim eating

265
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,159
I won't bother you and Ms, Thip.

266
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,479
Right.

267
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,319
In case S am,your ex husband

268
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,639
escapes prison to offer his hands to help,

269
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,679
Rome wouldn't be able to accept it.

270
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,199
-Yes Sergeant?
- Ms. Napa is sick.

271
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,639
She's very stressed and wants to go to the hospital.

272
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,919
Please look after her

273
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,159
Yes.

274
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,679
She just left the bank

275
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,239
Probably withdrew money for Chart.

276
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,199
Good.

277
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,359
Follow her.

278
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,319
Yes sir.

279
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,079
Go.

280
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,999
Ms. Napa.

281
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,039
Please

282
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,759
Wait.

283
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,199
Patient only.

284
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,599
Please.

285
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,799
I'm sorry.

286
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,279
Can I use the restroom first?

287
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,039
Sure

288
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,719
The restroom is that way.

289
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,519
Go ahead.

290
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,559
Thank you so much

291
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,919
I will never forget your gratitude

292
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,559
Just do what you said you will do.

293
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,159
Let it end here.

294
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,359
Mrs. Pit's five million baht.

295
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,239
As for the purse,

296
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,079
I destroyed it.

297
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,879
Karma for betraying me

298
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,879
It's good she got away the first time

299
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,679
This time, she asked for death herself.

300
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,719
She wants to do evil.

301
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,559
Trying to hurt me again?

302
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,199
This time clean it up real good

303
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,399
I don't want to talk to the cops again.

304
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,439
Don't worry Boss

305
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,079
I didn't mean to expose Mr. Ka molt at.

306
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,479
Mr K amol tat is my benefactor.

307
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,239
I was ambitious.

308
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,479
I wanted to be rich the short cut way.

309
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,279
With Kula chart

310
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,679
I drugged him

311
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,879
H in hopes...

312
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,439
of getting Taks as ut's inheritance :

313
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,079
I wanted to get pregnant

314
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,559
but miscarried due to stress.

315
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,879
I coincidentally met Mr Rome

316
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,439
who hates me

317
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,999
and Mr. Ka molt at.

318
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,079
But he hired me

319
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,079
to expose Kula chart and Mr. Ka molt at.

320
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,119
didn't.want to do it

321
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,959
I was wrong.

322
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,439
Please forgive me.

323
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,359
Delete it from your device

324
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,639
Don't leave any evidence

325
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,799
I can't stand it anymore

326
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,239
I was wrong!

327
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,719
Please forgive me.

328
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,279
This clip was in Ms. Napa's phone at the scene of the incident

329
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,399
Can you give us any information Mr. Rome?

330
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,439
There's nothing to be suspicious of.

331
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,999
Boss didn't do anything wrong.

332
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,079
If you want to know the truth,

333
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,719
go and ask Ka molt at

334
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,399
Tian

335
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,279
If I remember anything,

336
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,999
I will go and give you my statement.

337
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,279
Or if you

338
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,319
want to subpoena me

339
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,439
or have evidence to convict me

340
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,639
please talk to my lawyer.

341
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,639
Thankyou for your cooperation.

342
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,519
What happened to your arm though?

343
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:15,759
Accident.

344
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:18,519
Right.

345
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,279
Excuse me.

346
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,319
Why didn't you tell him Kula chart shot you?

347
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,319
It's pointless.

348
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,559
We were the only witnesses.

349
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,039
As for Ka molt at,

350
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,999
he will help Kula chart be free from going to prison.

351
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,639
Look at Napa.

352
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,919
No matter how careful we were,

353
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,319
he still managed to kill her.

354
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,639
Someone like Napa

355
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,519
would never kill herself.

356
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,319
Ill go tell the police the truth

357
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,719
Tell them everything.

358
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,279
Calm down Tian

359
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,239
We still don't know the truth

360
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,839
on who really did it

361
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,479
Kula chart did.

362
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,119
- Why are you talking like that?

363
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,519
You think...

364
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,359
You suspect that l did what Napa'said?

365
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,559
Who knows?

366
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,799
Youve tricked us to play charades I don't know how many times already.

367
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,719
What's true,

368
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,559
what's false, I don't know.

369
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,039
Mr. Lak.

370
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,839
What about you?

371
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,879
Are you suspicious of me?

372
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:40,319
I believe you wouldn't do anything despicable like that.

373
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,919
What is this?!

374
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:02,959
Songkran festival?

375
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,879
I'm all wet.

376
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,399
Here.

377
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,479
What is it?

378
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,519
You want me to make a bet this early?

379
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,279
Look.

380
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,559
I want you to watch Napa's news.

381
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,719
Napa is dead?!

382
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,319
Yes!

383
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,399
The devil to my relationship is dead

384
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,519
Serves her right.

385
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,559
She meddled too much

386
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,279
Now you can finally go home

387
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,039
Don't forget to wire me the money.

388
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,279
I won't forget.

389
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,079
But regarding Rome

390
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,319
I don't know what he will say.

391
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,559
But regardless,

392
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,279
try watching the news :

393
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,959
Right now,

394
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,599
he's become the mastermind

395
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,279
He's the villain now

396
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,559
He would n't dare mess with you anymore.

397
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,439
Why are you so evil like this?

398
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,999
What is your heart made of?

399
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,239
You think I'm that evil?

400
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:25,799
I told you Napa confessed everything that this is Rome's doing

401
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,239
Rome was the mastermind that Napa couldn't bear the guilt

402
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,519
so she killed herself

403
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,319
J don't believe that Rome did it.

404
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,199
Rome isn't that kind of person

405
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,319
You're really blind, you know that?

406
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,159
You think Rome is some kind of god.

407
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,279
Just wait and see

408
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,959
I will show you

409
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,439
he's the evil Satan.

410
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,039
Here.

411
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,719
The person you called Satan.

412
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,639
He asked me to give you back your money.

413
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,959
You bowed down to his feet

414
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,519
and asked him to return the money?

415
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,519
I don't need to do that.

416
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,359
Rome doesn't want your dirty money.

417
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,079
Pit!

418
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,559
Give me five Dad!

419
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,599
You see?

420
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,199
Napa confessed

421
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,599
that she drugged me and raped me.

422
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,119
Karma sure works fast.

423
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,879
Go away!

424
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,839
Both you and your mother!

425
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,759
'Go!

426
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,559
What the hell?

427
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,879
Mom.

428
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,519
What's wrong with Dad?

429
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,639
Is he sad that his mistress is dead?

430
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,639
But you finally see right

431
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,639
that I didn't do what l was accused of?

432
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:55,879
Kula chart.

433
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,079
When will you repent?

434
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,879
Don't think l don't know

435
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,879
that you went to shoot him at his house.

436
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,879
Good thing Rome didn't press charges

437
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,439
Why are you afraid of bad people like them?

438
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,999
That's what happens when you have a guilty conscience.

439
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,559
You slapped me.

440
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,559
You'residing with Rome?!

441
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,679
Kula chart.

442
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,279
From now on,

443
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,599
I won't let you cause any more trouble for anyone.

444
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:29,559
Mom.

445
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,359
Who's he running from?

446
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,239
You can't escape from me!

447
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:55,959
This way.

448
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,119
Your dog!

449
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,399
Stop!

450
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,079
Gosh Jane!

451
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,119
I thought you were those men!

452
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,479
Why are you hitting me?

453
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,919
It's your fault

454
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,599
You sold Tian to Rome

455
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,159
It changed Tian.

456
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,999
You son of a bitch!

457
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,039
Enough!

458
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,599
Where did you see Tian?

459
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,519
I followed Tian to Bangkok.

460
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,279
saw with my own eyes

461
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,199
that Tian is living in a big house with Rome.

462
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,559
Tian isn't the same anymore!

463
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,919
Tian changed because of'you!

464
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,599
Enough!

465
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:46,679
Jane.

466
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,199
What?!

467
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,399
You said Bangkok?

468
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,079
What did you hear?

469
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,879
Bangkok?

470
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,959
Ka molt at is getting more evil everyday.

471
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,599
Hell really sent him to earth

472
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,639
Napa was his wife

473
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,079
and his son's wife.

474
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:09,959
And yet still kills her

475
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,439
It's Napa's misfortune.

476
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,959
She gave up and sided with them

477
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,479
Just talking about her makes me pity her.

478
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,159
Hey Rome.

479
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,439
I think you should stop for now.

480
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,439
I think

481
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,999
things are getting out of hand.

482
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,519
I still have my last card

483
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,319
I won't surrender to him that easily

484
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,359
The i owner knows me.

485
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,199
What do you want?

486
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,399
Ring or necklace?

487
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,359

Hello.

504
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,719
What are you interested in?

505
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,559
Is there a necklace

506
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,799
that suits this ring?

507
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:50,799
Necklace? We have many designs. You can take a look at them if you want.

508
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,119
Please choose for me.

509
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,519
I want one that suits

510
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,919
a young girl...

511
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:55,759
teenager.

512
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,519
Sure.

513
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,599
I would recommend this one.

514
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,759
A diamond necklace. There are some diamonds interspersed but not many.

515
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,879
This really suits teenage girls.

516
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,759
It's not a big one, It's a perfect size.

517
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,999
She would look cute wearing it.

518
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,239
Tian!

519
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,639
Chan!

520
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,519
Yeah!

521
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,159
How did you know I'm here?

522
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,319
You act like you just saw a ghost

523
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,079
I came here to see you

524
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,039
You just forget about me after you have a good life.

525
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,799
So your boss

526
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,679
actually bought you to get a makeover.

527
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,039
You look like a millionaire's daughter now.

528
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,959
He's a con artist himself

529
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,559
Where is your boss?

530
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,639
Who is Tian talking to?

531
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:50,999
Where are you?!

532
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,799
Go open the door

533
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,719
Whatever you need,talk to me

534
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,079
Why bother him?

535
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,599
I need money

536
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,999
I just remembered

537
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,999
your boss paid for you a tad bit low.

538
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,879
How much do you want?

539
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:05,799
One hundred thousand.

540
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:06,519
Huh?!

541
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,239
One hundered thousand?

542
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:07,799
Yeah!

543
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,239
Where do I get that from?

544
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:10,879
Huh?

545
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,239
A hundred thousand?!

546
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,199
Chan.

547
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,079
Go back.

548
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,599
I will get you the money

549
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:19,799
Yeah.

550
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,559
I will give you a day

551
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,559
Call me where you want me to pick up the money tomorrow.

552
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:25,919
I'm leaving now

553
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:43,879
No.

554
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,399
Boss bought this for me.

555
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:17,719
Tian.

556
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,679
Where are you going with your bag?

557
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,279
Don't tell me you're running away again.

558
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:23,279
Oh.

559
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,439
I'm not.

560
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,239
It's just...

561
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:30,559
my stomach hurts and I wanted to ask you to take me to the hospital

562
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,599
Stomachache?

563
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,399
And..

564
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:33,919
does it hurt a lot?

565
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,719
I'll take you.

566
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,359
Okay.

567
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,519
Where are you guys going?

568
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,919
Tian is sick.

569
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,079
So lim taking her to see a doctor.

570
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:44,799
Come.

571
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,919
Let'si go Tian.

572
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,519
Next day, she seduces the younger brother.

573
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,119
You slutty child.

574
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,119
Who left the vacuum in the middle of the house?

575
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,359
Je ab.

576
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,119
Sure.

577
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,919
I will quickly send you the clip.

578
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,799
I don't know who it was.

579
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,039
I've never seen him before.

580
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,559
But he looked like those "greener s "

581
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,599
I heard

582
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,919
he asked her for one hundred thousand baht.

583
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,119
Sure.

584
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,359
But...

585
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,759
don't forget to wire the money first.

586
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,759
Ms. Mon sure wired the money fast

587
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,239
Ms. Thip.

588
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,279
Who were you talking to?

589
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,439
Give it to me.

590
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,439
- No I wasn't talking - Give it to me!

591
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,519
I wasn't-talking to anyone!

592
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,039
-No -
-Give it to me!

593
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,479
Why did Mont ira give you money?

594
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,119
Answer me!

595
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,359
I will hand you over to the police

596
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,119
Ms. Mon wired me the money

597
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:14,919
to spy on on Ms. Tian. How is that illegal?

598
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,119
If Mr. Rome finds out about this,

599
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,519
you will get fired!

600
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,599
If l want to put you in jail.

601
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,879
I just have to go tell the cops

602
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,639
that you stole something of mine

603
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,759
Ms. Thip I'm sorry!

604
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,839
I'won't do it again!

605
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,959
Please don't call the cops.

606
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,199
Please Ms, Thip.

607
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,039
Fine.

608
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,519
Then tell me

609
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,679

610
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,439
What did you record today?

611
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,399
What clip?

612
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,159
Turn it on!

613
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,719
This is the mall and not the hospital.

614
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,479
May be your stomachache is causing the confusion.

615
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,159

Jeez.

618
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,599
Just tell me you wanted to come to them all

619
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,719
I wouldn't mind

620
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,919

would you bring me here?

621
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,839
Gosh you!

622

Okay.

625
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,999
How much do you want?

626
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,319
Can all of this be equal to one hundred thousand?

627
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,599
Only boxes, no receipts nor bag

628
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,839

629
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,079
But I can only give you 70 thousand

630
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,159
But all of this is more than a hundred thousand.

631
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,599
Then would you like us to sell it on your behalf?

632
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,079
I need the money today

633
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,639
I can only give you 70 thousand.

634
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,679

635
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,359
Sure.

636
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,399
One hundred thousand is fine. Let's go with that.

637
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,639

am meeting a friend at a cafe but it's not time yet

642
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,759
Right.

643
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,799
You're not working at the sports club anymore?

644
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,199
can't no more

645
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,759
There's a lot of VIPs that are ignorant.

646
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:29,159
If there were more handsome and polite member like you,

647
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,439

648
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,399
Yes Gigi?

649
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,839
I have something funny to tell you.

650
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:52,919
Hey.

651
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,319
If I don't laugh, Im gonna cuss you out.

652
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,319
I'm already in a bad mood

653
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,279
Hmm?

654
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,599
What?

655
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,919
Tian sold her necklace and watch?

656
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,399
She looked desperate

657
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,079
She said she needed the money today

658
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,319
Thank you so much.

659
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:14,239
You made me feel a little better

660
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,719
Don't Boss!

661
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:21,159
Taking Tian in under your care like this,

662
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,079
I hope you won't fall in love with her

663
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,559
It's probably impossible

664
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,639
In a few months,

665
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,519
Kula chart will be of legal age

666
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,159
It will affect the will.

667
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,239
