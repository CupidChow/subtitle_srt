P and love that seems sincere

3
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:35,439
But today your embrace feels empty

4
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,839
P The word love that doesn't seem sincere

5
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,399
P The closer you get,the further you are away

00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,439

P Love me like you did yesterdays

16
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,639
I won't force you.

17
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,359
Just practice meditating is good enough.

18
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,839
won't stay and practice dhamma with Father here,

19
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,719
then don't call me mom ever again.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,199
This looks like Tian's ring.

21
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,519
Mom gave it to her

22
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,399
She's very protective of this.

23
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,079
If you want it, take it.

24
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,039
Thank you.

25
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,279
You have to tell me everything about you and your sister.

26
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,559
That ring

27
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,679
is an l important piece of evidence

28
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,439
that will change your life.

29
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,199
Important piece of evidence?

30
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,279
The truth is

31
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,159
she'sa beggar just like them.

32
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,519
But it's strange.

33
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,199
I wonder what spell Mr Rome is on

34
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,199
to have taken her under his care like this.

35
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,999
But we can't let Tian deceive'Rome like this

36
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,279
There's no way.

37
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,759
l'vetaken good care of this family for years

38
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,719
I will make Mr, Rome open his eyes

39
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,879
You're a beautiful person

40
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,559
You're educated.

41
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,479
You come from a good family

42
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,039
A low-class person like Tian

43
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,479
can't be compared to you

44
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,599
But the truth is

45
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,959
I never want to.discriminate Tian because of her background.

46
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,879
I don't want Rome to get hurt a second time

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,559
But l don't know what to do.

48
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,519
I don't want Rome to misunderstand

49
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,879
that lim trying to get rid of Tian

50
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,639
because I want him back.

51
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,079
But aren't you trying to do that though?

52
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,039
I told you already

53
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,159
I am on your side.

54
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,479
I will help you.

55
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,799
How?

56
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,879
Quickly set Tian up with a man

57
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,279
With'who?

58
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,159
Tian.

59
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,519
What are you thinking about?

60
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,679
I'm just thinking about Kula chart.

61
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,359
I'm just...

62
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,439
curious

63
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,239
how someone who was born with everything like Kula chart

64
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,039
become this way

65
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,679
Someone who has everything

66
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,079
doesn't mean they don't lack anything.

67
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,239
So what is he lacking?

68
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,359
Discipline from his parents.

69
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,679
No matter how much they force him now,

70
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,039
it's too late.

71
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,919
I pity his mother.

72
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,039
That's heronly child too.

73
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,039
Don't try to flatter me.

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,279
You just disappeared on me.

75
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,959
I'm sorry.l was scared to come

76
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,559
Mon.

77
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,999
I thought you were still mad at me.

78
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,959
Sol was scared to face you.

79
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,759
You're no longer mad right?

80
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,319
Don't over think it.

81
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,039
You're hurt too

82
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,839
Why would I bemad at you?

83
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,479
Are you calling Tian?

84
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:11,959
Yes.

85
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,159
She caused this much problem

86
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,839
She still wants to go play outside?

87
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,919
Don't worry.

88
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,359
This time,

89
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,199
Lak won't let anything happen to'Tian'

90
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,919
He's the troublemaker

91
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,159
He can never protect Tian.

92
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,999
I disagree.

93
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,039
Unless...

94
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,959
you miss your ex fiance?

95
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,599
Mr, Lak.

96
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,119
How can you say something disgusting like that?

97
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,399
What fiance?

98
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,399
Boss.

99
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,679
Did you guys go to the temple

100
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,679
or some place else

101
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,599
to come home late like this?

102
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,119
I had Mr. Lak take me to...

103
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,279
I took her to many places.

104
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,719
Wherever Tian wants to go,

105
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,279
I take her.

106
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,719
What can I do?

107
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,679
Tian was home alone

108
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,079
No one cared about her

109
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,279
She was so lonely

110
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,959
I had free time so...

111
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,079
I took her.

112
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,719
I was waiting to eat dinner with you.

113
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,759
Next time,call me in advance

114
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,319
So l don't have to wait.

115
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,119
Sol don't worry

116
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,519
What could we have done?

117
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,399
In the movie theater, we...

118
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,079
can't use the phone

119
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,959
It's not like that Boss.

120
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,359
Rome, can I stay and eat with you today?

121
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,199
Tian.

122
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,039
Lak.

123
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,799
I'm tired of the food here

124
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,439
Let's go out to eat.

125
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,999
Here Tian.

126
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,039
Your butter shrimp is very delicious Ms, Thip.

127
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,879
Thank you Mr Lak

128
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,359
Seeing you young adults like this,

129
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,159
it makes me jealous

130
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,159
What do you mean?

131
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,839
Adolescence is an age where you can live your life to the fullest.

132
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,879
You have freedom.

133
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,479
How can I not be jealous?

134
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,719
Especially if you two have no obligations

135
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,679
both are single,

136
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,519
are close and can talk to each other,

137
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,799
I think you guys are really compatible with each other.

138
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,639
I'm full

139
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,999
Excuse me.

140
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,279
Wait Je ab.

141
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,559
What happened to your hand?

142
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,759
Oh.

143
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,239
I cut myself with the knife. It's small. It'll he al soon.

144
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,639
I'll help you clean it for you

145
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,959
You can go rest.

146
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,719
Sure. I'll take this back then.

147
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,119
If I'm not mistaken,

148
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,919
you seem to worry about Tian.

149
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,319
As a woman myself, I'll be honest

150
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,279
I really pity Tian

151
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,879
An innocent kid like Tian

152
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,319
shouldn't become anyone's tool

153
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,759
You mean...

154
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,119
If you don't want to see Tian suffer even more,

155
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,479
you need to protect her

156
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,959
You don't have to help me

157
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,639
I can handle it. No problem.

158
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,119
Let's just help each other.

159
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,639
It'll be done quicker.

160
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,559
Here.

161
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,999
I'll handle it.

162
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,559
I will suffer if you end up breaking something again

163
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,319
Teacher is being stubborn to student.

164
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,479
You haven't told me yet

165
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,439
if your heart

166
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,839
belongs to Rome or not.

167
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,039
Why do you want to know?

168
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,119
Well...

169
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,079
I love...

170
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,439
See Mr. Lak? Itold you.

171
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,559
Why are you being stubborn? Sit back before you get cut

173
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,919
It's worse than prison

174
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,399
can't stand this

175
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,439
Come see me.

176
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,919
I ran out.

177
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,639
You can't tonight?

178
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,599
Tomorrow is fine.

179
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,199
Yeah, okay.

180
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,039
Tomorrow,

181
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,279
be prepared to go help that mama's boy.

182
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,599
Do I have to bring weapons?

183
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,639
Why the hell would you ask that question?

184
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,559
He's at the temple!

185
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,119
Greetings Father.

186
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,439
Blessings

187
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,519
I came to see if I can make a Kath in offering here Father

188
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,599
I rejoice in your merit

189
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,279
Why don't you wait in the pavilion first?

190
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,719
A temple warden would be here soon

191
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,679
I'd rather take a look around the temple first Father

192
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,879
Sol can see what I should fund to renovate first.

193
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,319
Go ahead.

194
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,079
Hey.

195
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,279
Go look after the monk

196
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,999
I'll show the guest around.

197
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:56,999
Mom's here.

198
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,839
Over there.

199
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,319
Hey! Hey!

200
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,519
Enough!

201
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,199
Do you not see his blood is dirtying the place?

202
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,199
What did he do to get beaten this much?

203
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,879
He didn't do much to me

204
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,479
But he cheated at our boss's casino.

205
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,159
What do we do now?

206
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,679
Our boss said to have him be on the news

207
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,119
so no one will dare do it again

208
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,999
Sack him up and throw him down a skyscraper

209
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,199
Hey.

210
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,679
Be careful. Don't let there be any witnesses.

211
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,119
Yes sir.

212
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:46,679
Come!

213
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,759
Get up!

214
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,159
I don't wanna go!

215
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,399
Where are you taking me?!

216
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,599
Help me!

217
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,879
I don't wanna die yet!

218
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,039
What?

219
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,319
You!

220
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,359
You what?

221
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,639
I don't know you

222
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:02,999
You!

223
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,679
You married my sister Tian

224
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,199
Tian is my sister!

225
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,319
You have to help me!

226
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,799
I've looked everywhere and I couldn't find him.

227
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,799
The person who came to make a Kath in offering is also gone.

228
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,919
But I found this in Kula chart's room.

229
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,359
I didn't let him bring a cell phone.

230
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,439
That's my wife's cell phone Father.

231
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,719
It went missing when we were meditating last night.

232
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,879
But those drug stuff isn't ours.

233
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:49,959
I'm...

234
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,079
so sorry.

235
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,479
It's Kula chart's fault

236
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,439
But please don't blame him.

237
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,959
I won't press charges

238
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,239
I forgive him.

239
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,319
But inside a temple

240
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,799
he should be considerate of karmas and sins :

241
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,119
He even took the donation money.

242
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,239
What?!

243
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,239
Job.

244
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,999
Go do what you need to do.

245
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:20,879
Mr s. Pit.

246
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,999
For certain reasons and factors

247
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,359
it's not true that

248
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,879
Dharma,which is the miraculous medicine of the Lord Buddha,can solve the problem.

249
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,959
Specialized matters

250
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:36,399
should be the responsibility of a specialist physician.

251
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,319
The temple

252
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,199
doesn't resolve every problem.

253
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:43,919
So...

254
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,559
how do l...

255
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,599
help my son?

256
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,639
I'm running out of options now

257
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,919
All living beings are subject to karma.

258
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,399
Kula chart

259
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,479
must have caused a lot of karmas.

260
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,999
Delusion and anger therefore rise high.

261
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,159
He can't accept kindness,
warnings,

262
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,839
and disciplinary that easily.

263
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,999
It's like when we plant seeds.

264
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,079
If the seed is bad

265
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,359
no matter how good we fertilize and water it

266
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,559
the seeds may be eaten by insects and fungi.

267
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,879
It can not grow beautifully.

268
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,599
It's probably because...

269
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,999
me...

270
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,839
and my husband committed asin together.

271
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,239
Right now,

272
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,039
we are facing the consequences.

273
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,599
Well?

274
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,039
I thought you have something important to talk to me about?

275
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,199
You're not saying anything

276
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,119
Rome.

277
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,319
I think we should stop getting revenge on Ka molt at.

278
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,079
It's getting out of hand.

279
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,119
People have been injured and dead

280
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,479
Tian,

281
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,439
Lak,

282
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,559
and you almost got killed.

283
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:20,919
That's right.

284
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,519
I think you should tell Tian the whole truth

285
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,279
And from now on,

286
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,839
leave it to the law and karma to handle him

287
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,239
No.

288
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,239
It's not time yet.

289
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,879
Rome.

290
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,919
During this period, I'm going to be taking Tian to apply for classes to determine her entrance exam

291
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,559
But don't worry

292
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,319
I promise l will take good care of Tian

293
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,719
You don't have to take Tian anywhere

294
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,239
l will handle this

295
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,159
But it's Tian's future.

296
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,999
Why have her do nothing and lounge around the house?

297
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,079
I don't understand!

298
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,679
Pao.

299
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,119
You won't say anything?

300
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,959
Are you guys talking about Tian

301
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,839
and won't tell me?

302
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,759
So I'm an outsider now and not your brother?

303
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:19,839
Look Lak.

304
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:21,999
Calm down.

305
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,719
J just need a little bit more time

306
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,279
The nl will tell you everything.

307
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,599
Can you wait?

308
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,439
I guess I'm not part of this family anymore.

309
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,159
Lak.

310
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,679
It hurts everywhere

311
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,799
I told you already

312
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,199
Tian is my sister.

313
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,999
Whatever I tell her to do, she listens.

314
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,799
I tell her to go left,she goes left

315
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,319
I tell her to go right, she goes right.

316
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,239
In that case,

317
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,919
you must be close to Rome.

318
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,719
Boss Rome?

319
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,439
He's the one that bought Tian from me

320
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,519
I'm not money hungry.

321
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,599
But I did it for Tian's future

322
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,559
She will have a better life and get an education.

323
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,959
Have a place to eat and sleep

324
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,359
So I let her go.

325
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:24,959
Wow!

326
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,999
You're pretty evil.

327
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,319
What about your parents?

328
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,719
My parents died.

329
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,479
If you two don't believe me,

330
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,239
go drag Tian here and put a gun to her head.

331
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,799
She will say the same thing

332
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,839
In that case, my younger brother

333
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,879
who is heartbroken from Tian

334
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,239
can rely on you for help

335
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,439
You said you can boss her around!

336
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,199
Hey!

337
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,759
Yes!

338
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,159
I said he can!

339
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,639
If you two don't believe me

340
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,239
then just wait and see

341
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,919
I will prove it to you guys.

342
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,119
I won't eat this then

343
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,079
What's that for?

344
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,559
I want to chop it for Boss.

345
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,719
J picked it from the backyard.

346
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:27,919
Don't.

347
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,239
It'l I just cause a mess in his'office.

348
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,239
Ms. Mon just served him a hot cup of cappuccino.

349
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,839
I think they're having,some alone time right now.

350
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,879
Chan!

351
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,199
Why aren't you at Boss's factory yet?

352
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,159
Do you know lim worried about you?

353
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,119
Tian!

354
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,679
Stop talking so much.

355
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,719
Your ring necklace is with me right now.

356
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,999
If you want it, come and get it.

357
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,159
That's not true.

358
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,239
You're lying.

359
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,999
The ring necklace got stolen

360
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,119
Tian.

361
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,559
Why would I lie to you?

362
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,159
I found it with the robber and paid to get it back for you.

363
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,119
Doing a good deed but receive punishments

364
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,199
Look with your eyes :

365
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,199
What is this?

366
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,639
If you won't come and get it, I will throw it in the i water.

367
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,399
One.

368
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:24,799
Two!

369
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,879
Don't Chan!

370
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,199
Don't throw it away

371
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,839
I will go see you

372
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,399
The truth is

373
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:43,319
Tian and Lak seem compatible with each other

374
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,759
What do you mean compatible?

375
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:45,959
Well,

376
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,999
a man and woman

377
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,719
who like similar things.

378
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,599
They get along.

379
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,599
They're always doing cute things together, They should become a couple.

380
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,879
That's impossible

381
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,399
Why?

382
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,079
-Does Tian have a boyfriend or does L ak--
o No.

383
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,079
It's not what you think

384
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,359
Tian...

385
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,439
has a bigger mission than to think about love.

386
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,759
What mission?

387
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,639
What is it Ms. Thip?

388
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,999
Tian stepped out.

389
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,839
She said she was going to study language with Mr, Laka t hisschool

390
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,959
She's suddenly studio us now.

391
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,999
These two are always attached-to the hips

392
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,359
So,do you mean these two like each other?

393
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,519
Where are you going Rome?!

394
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,799
Rome!

395
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:46,999
Follow,him.

396
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,679
Okay.

397
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,039
Rome!

398
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,959
Hurry up Tian!

399
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,439
When will you give me back the necklace?

400
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,639
Why did you bring me here?

401
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,159
What's the hurry? Just come take a seat.

402
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:15,919
Chan.

403
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,519
I don't have a lot of money but if you want some, U can wire some to you.

404
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,279
Just give me back the necklace.

405
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,159
Tian.

406
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,039
Are you naive or stupid?

407
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,559
Do you know how I got the ring necklace?

408
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,319
That Mon girl.

409
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,359
It was Mon, Rome's woman.

410
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,119
She wanted to prank you

411
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,199
so she left the necklace with me.

412
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,519
Now are you smart?

413
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,719
Ms. Mon?

414
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:47,759
Yeah.

415
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,039
Open your eyes Tian.

416
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,479
Why do you care

417
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,519
about a man who has a wife already?

418
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,199
It's better to be with a man who loves you and wants to take care of you instead

419
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,279
Kula chart!

420
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,279
Yes.

421
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,319
It's me.

422
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,159
Him.

423
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,999
Mr. Kula chart

424
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,519
is the man who loves you and wants to take care of you.

425
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,279
Are you here to see Mr. Lak?

426
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,479
He went to run errands.

427
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:52,959
What?

428
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,799
Both turned off their phones.

429
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:59,799
Gosh they're both adults. They need some private time.

430
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,319
For Tian,

431
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,559
there's no privacy with anyone!

432
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,639
I never thought you would do this to me again

433
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,839
Gosh Tian

434
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,879
I have good intentions for you.

435
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,239
Just give in to him.

436
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,279
You as well Kula chart

437
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,399
Do you not pity your mother?

438
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,079
She took you to the temple

439
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,879
in hopes of you turning a new leaf.

440
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,759
But you're causing problems again.

441
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,239
It's your fault

442
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,199
that I can't be a good person

443
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,999
Don't blame me. I have nothing to do with it.

444
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,119
If you were willing to marry me from the beginning

445
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,879
this wouldn't have happened

446
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:53,559
Hey!

447
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,839
That's enough

448
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,119
It's a waste of time.

449
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,239
Hey.

450
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:02,679
Don't.

451
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:04,879
Stop!

452
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,479
I'm your sister Chan!

453
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,359
You're not my sister Tian

454
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,079
Mom and Dad adopted you

455
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,479
They only loved you

456
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,679
What about me?

457
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,519
J became a rotten egg.

458
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,079
Chan.

459
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,599
Let me go!

460
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,799
Chan! Help me!

461
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,119
Let me go!

462
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,039
I thought you were siblings?

463
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,119
You lied?

464
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,319
What's strange about it?

465
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,799
In the end, I was able to bring Tian to you

466
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,079
Forget about this matter

467
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,399
Where's my money?

468
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,759
Where's the money for the ring necklace?

469
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,159
We're even

470
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,039
Hey bro.

471
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,479
How can you say that?!

472
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:50,999
Look.

473
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,999
Did you forget you owe me?

474
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,639
But Mr. Kula chart said he'll pay me

475
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:01,839
Well,

476
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,079
it's up to him

477
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,199
All done.

478
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,679
No bruises.

479
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:14,719
. Good.

480
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,559
Good luck bro.

481
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:26,999
Bro!

482
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,839
It's over now. Just give me the money.

483
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,879
Fine.

484
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,439
In that case,

485
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,399
J will give you a big one.

486
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,079
Why are you doing something stupid like this?

487
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,199
Don't forget

488
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:56,959
that.

489
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,519
it will only be a temporary happiness by sleeping with me.

490
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,719
But punishment for rape is a lot of prison time.

491
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,039
Is it worth it

492
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,279
to have the only Taks asu t heir
lose his future over a woman?

493
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,679
Then just give in to me

494
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,799
It'll be over soon.

495
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,719
I won't have to use force.

496
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,239
I am willing to go to prison.

497
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,879
As long as I get to have you,

498
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,279
it'll be worth it.

499
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,519
Are you not ashamed?

500
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,039
You're a million aire's son.

501
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,399
You're good looking

502
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,159
but you got yourself a wife because you raped her?

503
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,159
Chart.

504
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,559
Your mother sent you to go stay at the temple

505
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,719
so you can know right from wrong.

506
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,679
Why don't you realize that?

507
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,399
How disappointed will your mom be if she found out?

508
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,239
I'm her only child.

509
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,759
She will forgive me

510
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:48,879
Besides,

511
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,399
she likes you.

512
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,639
She wants us to sleep together and become husband and wife anyway!

513
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,759
I will hate you!

514
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,039
I won't look at you ever again!

515
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,319
Actually,

516
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,759
when we first met

517
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,799
I did like you.

518
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,719
I've had feelings for you for a while.

519
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,639
But your father is Boss's enemy.

520
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,439
So I was scared

521
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,239
But if you help me escape,

522
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,159
you will become the hero

523
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,599
Boss will then give us permission to be together.

524
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,239
You're tricking me, I know.

525
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,199
I'm not stupid

526
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,119
In that case..

527
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,839
I will let you..

528
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,519
kiss me as a deposit

529
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,439
My love.

530
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,919
My kiss will make you beg for your life

531
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,599
You did it again!

532
00:28:59,120 --> 00:28:59,959
What the hell?

533
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,239
Trying to escape?!

534
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:03,959
Tian!

535
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:13,999
What are they doing?

536
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,239
Why haven't they turned on the phone yet?

537
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,359
Be patient Mr. Rome

538
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,599
Mr. Lak and Tian will come back.

539
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,439
Their belongings are still here.

540
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,559
That's right.

541
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,519
Tian going with Lak is better than going with someone else

542
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:33,639
Mr. Lak!

543
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,959
You're home?

544
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,199
Tian?!

545
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,079
Lak!

546
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:41,599
Mr, Rome!

547
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,079
Why did you punch me?!

548
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,399
That hurts!

549
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,559
Where did you leave Tian at?!

550
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,079
Tian?

551
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:55,999
Where did she go?

552
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,239
Don't act confused!

553
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,519
Tian said she went to see you.

554
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,399
I went to the school.

555
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,239
I didn't see either of you.

556
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,679
You both turned off your phones.

557
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,759
Answer me.

558
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,759
Where did you leave Tian at?

559
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,559
This is just crazy!

560
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,439
I took my foreign friends to the floating market.

561
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,759
I had to explain things so I turned off my phone!

562
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,439
Look!

563
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,759
I bought some snacks for Tian as well

564
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,519
You're really disgusting

565
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,039
Where did Tian go then?

566
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,239
You just sit here.

567
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,639
As for this girl.

568
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,959
I will handle it.

569
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,759
And once your engine starts

570
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,439
you can be gentle

571
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,799
So this can finally end

572
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,119
Hey you can't!

573
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,399
You can't take her virginity first than me!

574
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,119
You idiot!

575
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,479
Until today,

576
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,999
this girl probably slept with other men already!

577
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:00,439
Look.

578
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,919
Are you'still dreaming of a pure girl?

579
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:03,879
Bullshit!

580
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,719
Hey stop! I won't let you!

581
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,639
You're stopping me?!

582
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,279
You won't let me?!

583
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,279
Take this!

584
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,079
You think you're tough?!

585
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,679
This bitch!

586
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,359
You wanna die?!

587
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,239
Sir.

588
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,479
Higher up is calling

589
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,559
So?!

590
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,319
He needs you to wire the money to him right now

591
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,879
Why are you telling me?!

592
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,919
You can do that!

593
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,479
What money do I have?!

594
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,839
You were drunk last night.

595
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,119
You used his money to gamble

596
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:16,959
Hey.

597
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,119
I need to talk to you about something.

598
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,479
Tell me then. I'm not deaf.

599
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,959
Kula chart...

600
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,479
Sir!

601
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,919
You have a guest.

602
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:31,959
Ka molt at!

603
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,759
Where did you take Tian?!

604
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,879
What's your problem?

605
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:37,999
This is my house.

606
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,079
You barged in here and is asking for Tian?

607
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,239
Are you crazy?!

608
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,759
I don't know!

609
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,839
If it's not you then it's your people.

610
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,959
Where is Kula chart?

611
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,879
Both brothers are crazy now.

612
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,319
The whole family is crazy!

613
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,079
Kula chart'is at-the temple

614
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,479
Pit,tell them.

615
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,639
Kula chart went missing from the temple.

616
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,679
Why didn't you tell me?!

617
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,759
was about to

618
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,559
I filed a report with the police already

619
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,199
Why?

620
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,479
In case he does something bad

621
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,079
our names will be ruined

622
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,759
You still care about your name?
Someone'slife is more important!

623
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,519
Tian.

624
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,199

645
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,159
Hello?!

646
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:20,679
Kula chart

647
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,839
was kidnapped for ransom too.

648
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,439
He said he will call us again. What do we do?

649
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,919
What kind of sick joke is this?

650
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:37,799
Pat,

651
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,439

00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,359

653
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,559
No matter where you are

654
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,679
A20 Thank you.

655
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,239
If I.need anything, I'll call you

656
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,079

657
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,199
Ready Lak?

658
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,439
Yes.

659
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:03,879
Okay.

660
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,039
Let's go get the money,

661
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,239
Okay.

662
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,199
Don't you think it's weird?

663
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:11,359
Tian left the house on her own so how did she get kidnapped?

664
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,679
You're saying Tian made this up?

665
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,919
I'm just curious.

666
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:24,079
Outsiders see that Rome has financial issues

667
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,079
So why would they ask money from you?

668
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,279
I think you should go home.

669
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:30,999
I'll see you later.

670
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,559
Can l go with you?

671
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,519
I might be able to help you with something.

672
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,639
It's dangerous.

673
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,719
I don't want to be concern front and back

674
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,039

00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,399

681
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,799

Hey!

684
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,999
This isn't funny.

685
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:07,839
Oh!

686
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,159
Who said I'm joking?

687
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,719
I'm being serious!

688
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,399
No sling,

689
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,559

690
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,399
Therefore

691
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,319
do your part serious too

692
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,119
When I get the money

693
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,759
we can go our own ways

694
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,439
I ill split the money and we go spend it.

695
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,239
If you get the money,

696
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,199
you will really let us go?

697
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,719
You're being an idiot again.

698
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,799
Never mind releasing you.

699
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,319
I will give you a bridal house to live in with Tian.

700
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,119
Plus money

701
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,399
and food and wifi

702
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,159
But my dad isn't ordinary

703
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,799
If you fail, you die

704
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,159
Boss isn't stupid to let you guys deceive him either

705
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:55,959
Alright.

706
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,919
Change clothes

707
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,279
Hurry up too.

708
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,439
Let's go get ready

709
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,719
By the time they realize it,

710
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,479
we will find them first.

711
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,839
Kula chart.

712
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,879
You shouldn't get involved with these people

713
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,519
Do you know how much they'll ruin your life?

714
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,799
You think they're sincere with you?

715
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,759
They're holding guns guarding us like that.

716
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,079
Even if they get the money, we won't survive.

717
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:17,799
Tian.

718
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,839
got it from Chan.

719
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,519
Your brother.

720
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,119
Thanks :

721
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,239
Where did they take Chan?

722
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:34,799
I don't know.

723
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,199
There's a lot of rooms here.

724
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,839
think there's three to four rooms on this floor.

725
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,759
Should we escape?

726
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:49,639
Hey.

727
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,399
Can we?

728
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,319
I know you're not that evil.

729
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,479
If you repent,

730
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,359
I won't tell anybody that you were involved in today's incident.

731
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,279
And...

732
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,039
will forgive you for everything in the past.

733
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,559
I will consider us friends forever

734
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,439
don't want to be friends.

735
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:09,839
Gosh!

736
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,359
Then you stay and die here!

737
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,119
Tian, don't move.

738
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,199
It'll hurt if you move a lot.

739
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,879
Live action is here

740
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,679
I should watch.

741
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,759
How did it go?!

742
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:49,519
Let's go!

743
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,079
Hurry!

744
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,199
Throw the money over here.

745
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,319
Let the girl go first.

746
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:20,919
Fine.

747
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:22,999
Hey.

748
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,119
Go

749
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,839
Wait.

750
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,439
Give me the money first.

751
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:28,559
Hurry!

752
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,719
Boss!

753
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,799
Don't give it to him!

754
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:41,839
I'm right here!

755
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,599
Tian.

756
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:45,919
