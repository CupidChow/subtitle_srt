Tian has been kidnapped for ransom.

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,399
It was probably your son.

17
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,039
Bastard!

18
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,159
Don't Laksa mon!

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,919
Please don't hurt my son.

20
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,799
Hello?

21
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:41,919
Here.

22
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,679
Get changed!

23
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,239
Make it quick too.

24
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,439
Let's go Lak.

25
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,759
Rome!

W9969

27
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,159
To the police station

28
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:55,919
Sure.

29
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,479
Tian.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,119
I got it from Chan.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,879
Your brother

32
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,479
Thanks :

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,639
Let's go!

34
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,199
Come on!

35
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,759
Let the girl go first.

36
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:16,759
Fine :

37
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:18,799
Hey.

38
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,759
Wait.

39
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,199
Give me the money first.

40
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:25,839
Hurry!

41
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,439
Boss!

42
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,679
Don't give it to him!

43
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,719
I'm right here!

44
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,479
Tian.

45
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,599
Chart!

46
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,039
You traitor!

47
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,239
Duck!

48
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,959
Be careful Tian!

49
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,679
Just go!

50
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,959
Let's go!

51
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,039
Hurry up!

52
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:15,879
PIX REAL

53
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:21,839
Tian.

54
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,319
You're not hurt, right?

55
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,959
What thehell?

56
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,959
What kind of joke is this Rome?

57
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,959
I came to return your son.

58
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,439
Kula chart and Tian were kidnapped

59
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,279
But they escaped

60
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,439
That's just too funny

61
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,799
You made this whole thing up didn't you?

62
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,959
It's true Dad.

63
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,279
J was kidnapped from the temple

64
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,719
And...

65
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,159
I saw Tian getting kidnapped too.

66
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,439
So we then escaped

67
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,599
This situation

68
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,399
Is quite strange sir

69
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,239
What Kula chart said is true

70
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,199
They own a casino and wanted money the short cut way

71
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,999
But luckily Boss and Mr. Lak came to save us in time so they got away.

72
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,439
This way Officer

73
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:32,759
Rome!

74
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,879
How are you?

75
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,119
I brought the police to help you.

76
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,559
Who told you to file a report?

77
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,479
I was worried about you

78
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,759
Where's the culprit?

79
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,719
Everything is what Tian told you.

80
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,039
Can we leave now?

81
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,759
They told you everything

82
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,119
Such a waste of time.

83
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,599
Don't play with me Mr. Rome, Mr. Kamoltat

84
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,799
Both of your families have caused enough problems already

85
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,279
Most importantly M s. Napa's murder case is still pending.

86
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,119
We caused problems?

87
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,999
My son got kidnapped and managed to escape

88
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,879
You guys didn't do anything

89
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,199
What you said isn't right!

90
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,519
Why didn't you let us know about it?

91
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,279
Alright, let's start over.

92
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,799
I was informed by Ms. Mon

93
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,839
that there has been kidnap for ransom.

94
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,999
I followed Mr. Rome's GPS signal hidden in the money bag

95
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,239
Ms. Tian.

96
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,399
Start over from the beginning.

97
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,479
Tell me every detail

98
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,799
Do not hide anything

99
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,759
The culprit called me to go get the necklace that was stolen.

100
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:54,919
Necklace?

101
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,679
What necklace?

102
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,319
I'd like the detail.

103
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,519
This necklace.

104
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,599
What's important about this necklace?

105
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,079
Why did you risk your life to go see them by yourself?

106
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,759
It's a necklace my mother gave to me.

107
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,919
Mom said it was attached to me since birth

108
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,439
Wait

109
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,759
What did you say?

110
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,559
Attached to'you since birth?

111
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,719
What's your mother's name?

112
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,959
Officer.

113
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,999
If you have any more questions

114
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,679
please contact my.lawyer

115
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,079
Tian, let'sgo.

116
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:45,799
Oh.

117
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,079
Mr. Rome, Ms. Tian, wait!

118
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,719
I have to get going as well.

119
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,879
This is my lawyer's number. Call him if-you have questions

120
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,959
Oh, wait Mr. Ka molt at!

121
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,359
Money?

122
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,879
You used counterfeit money to pay for his ransom?

123
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,119
It'is fake :

124
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,519
Joss paper bills

125
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,679
and Ga mou bills

126
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,559
Dad, how could you do this?

127
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,239
They would kill me if they knew!

128
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,039
What the hell?!

129
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,799
My life is worth these counterfeit money?!

130
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:32,839
Yeah.

131
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,839
Are you now just realizing it?

132
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,639
Who would exchange millions

133
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,839
for a scumbag like you?

134
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,839
Even eight baht is too expensive for-you!

135
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,079
Don't say that.

136
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,919
Kula chart didn't do anything wrong

137
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,559
He's been wrong since birth

138
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,279
Seriously,

139
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:53,759
since he was "born

140
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,799
has he done anything i good that would bring pride to the family?

141
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,839
Always doing evil deeds

142
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,839
Enough!

143
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,119
Our son came home safe

144
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,039
That's great already

145
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,919
Son?!

146
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,559
This peasant is our,son?!

147
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,879
Ka molt at

148
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,199
Don't talk about our son like this!

149
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:25,839
Sir.

150
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,039
It's in the past now.

151
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,719
Let's not care about it.

152
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,439
Go.

153
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,999
Both of you get out of my face!

154
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,119
Go!

155
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,999
Let's go Kula chart. Come with me

156
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:41,719
Come on.

157
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,639
Calm down sir.

158
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,159
Calm down?

159
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,239
You didn't see the ring Tian showed the police

160
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,519
What about it?

161
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,239
It's the ring my father gave to my daughter at birth.

162
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,559
It's a family's heirloom

163
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,159
How does Tian have it?

164
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,599
This will be the last time

165
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,679
that I for give you.

166
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,919
If next time you do things without telling me

167
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,759
I will lock you up

168
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,679
I won't let you go anywhere.

169
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,079
I don't understand how this is Tian's fault.

170
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,159
She lost her necklace

171
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,999
She just wants it back.

172
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,919
It's your fault.

173
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,359
You're being a dictator.

174
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,519
That's why Tian doesn't tell you anything.

175
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,639
-Mr. Lak --
-This has nothing to do with you Lak.

176
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,839
You have no right to meddle between me and Tian.

177
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,199
Why don't I have the right?

178
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,039
I'm worried about Tian too.

179
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,599
Tian isn't your slave

180
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,719
where you can force her to do things

181
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,519
Mr. Lak.

182
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,959
From now on, Iwill take care and be responsible for Tian's life

183
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,519
What do you mean?

184
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,919
I love Tian.

185
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,119
You have Ms, Mon already.

186
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,799
Why keep Tian around?

187
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,319
Let's just talk this out man to man

188
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,199
How do you really feel about Tian?

189
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,679
Enough.

190
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,119
Stop talking.

191
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,079
Stop having any ridiculous feelings for Tian as well!

192
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,079
You can forbid anyone you want.

193
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,839
But you can't forbid me.

194
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,639
At least I'm brave enough to say that I love Tian.

195
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,039
No need to hesitate

196
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,719
or make excuses like you.

197
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:50,879
Lak!

198
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,199
Mr, Rome.

199
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,479
Get away from my face!

200
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,399
I will.

201
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,039
No need to be indebted to each other

202
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,679
I won't rely on you from now on.

203
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,439
I will go out and build a life.

204
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,919
When I am strong and stable,

205
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,639
I will come back for Tian!

206
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,439
Mr, Lak.

207
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,399
Please don't go.

208
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,679
Wait until Boss calms down then talk to him.

209
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:35,999
No.

210
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,679
I don't want to talk to an unreasonable person

211
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,239
Where will you go live?

212
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,399
Please don't go. You'll only struggle

213
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,639
Everything is my fault.

214
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,919
I shouldn't have.

215
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,959
It's not your fault.

216
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,519
Don't blame yourself, okay?

217
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,839
Wait here.

218
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,839
I'll be back for you.

219
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,879
Remember my words Tian.

220
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,079
I love you.

221
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,679
Mr. Lak really drove away with the car.

222
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,519
What do we do?

223
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,639
Rome.

224
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,239
Call Lak.

225
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,399
How can he go out there alone?

226
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,039
Let him go.

227
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,279
We're all adults.

228
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,959
He won't die.

229
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,919
Ms. Thip.

230
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,039
Stop worrying about him.

231
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,759
As for you Mon,

232
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,839
you should go home.

233
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,959
Thank you so much for your concern.

234
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,239
But I want to be alone.

235
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,799
I've taken care of these siblings for a long time

236
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,559
I've never seen them get into a huge fight like this before.

237
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,399
Your e really evil Tian.

238
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,039
Ms. Thip.

239
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,919
Don't scold Tian.

240
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,759
That's what a charming person does.

241
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,879
All the men loves her.

242
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,399
I didn't mean for Boss and..

243
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,079
Mr, Lak to get into an argument.

244
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,639
I'm really sorry about what happened

245
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,839
when it's actually Ms. Mon's fault

246
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,679
My fault?

247
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,119
Why did you give Chan my ring necklace?

248
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,999
You pretend to be nice to me

249
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,639
but backstab me in the back

250
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,999
Good people don't do this to each other.

251
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,519
This is called two-faced

252
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,439
So that means

253
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,079
the culprit that kidnapped you was your brother?

254
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,719
Ms. Thip.

255
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,479
Did you hear that?

256
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,879
Rome can't not know about this.

257
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,479
Then Boss has to know

258
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,119
you gave Chan my ring necklace.

259
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,719
Then lied to us that you got robbed.

260
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,039
Ms. Thip.

261
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,519
Don't go yet.

262
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,399
You and!

263
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,639
had a reason to lie

264
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,079
Therefore,

265
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,999
let's make a deal.

266
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,319
Dok tian.

267
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,079
You're more evil than I thought.

268
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:34,559
Wait.

269
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,999
What Tian said

270
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,719
was'that true?

271
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,839
I love Rome.

272
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,119
l am willing to do anything

273
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,119
to save Rome from this cunning girl.

274
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,399
J know you hate me.

275
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,039
But I want to tell you l never thought of stealing Boss from you.

276
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:08,159
I just want to show my love and loyalty in return for taking me in and looking after me.

277
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,399
Maybe other people will believe you if you told them

278
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,039
But I don't believe you

279
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,559
Your behavior isn't as innocent as you said you are.

280
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,159
Take today for example

281
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,639
You and your brother

282
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,879
are purposely trying to get Rome's money

283
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,679
I wasn't involved in the ransom.

284
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,279
Chan only wanted money

285
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,679
So he got used by those bad people

286
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,079
Make up whatever story you want.

287
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,559
But I don't like a melodramatic show.

288
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,319
If that's the case,then we're both equally melodramatic

289
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,999
because you're in this show

290
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,879
I think if you want this to end peacefully.
we should mind our own business.

291
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,479
Not bother each other anymore.

292
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,279
I hope it becomes that way.

293
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,639
If not,

294
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,399
don't call me evil.

295
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:24,999
Boss.

296
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,399
-l was about to go see you

297
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,039
Pack up your things.

298
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,279
We'll leave in the morning.

299
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,679
What the hell?! How did it happen?!

300
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,519
Rome and the others left the house since the crack of dawn.

301
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,919
I don't know where they went

302
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,599
Why didn't you follow him?

303
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,679
I couldn't in time.

304
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,839
He purposely took Tian with him.

305
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,839
Probably trying to find a way to attack me.

306
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,519
Go tell all of your men to go out and find him.

307
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:13,919
Yes sir.

308
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,639
Gone again.

309
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,279
Can't get a holdof him.

310
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,479
I think your Rome

311
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,199
is kind of a psychopath

312
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,039
Facebook, Twitter, Insta gram

313
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,399
he has none of that.

314
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,159
I can't get a hold of Th ip either.

315
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,719
think

316
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,239
this girl wants something from Rome

317
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,679
If it's so difficult,get over him and find yourself a newman.

318
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,439
Someone richer than Rome.

319
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,359
Who?

320
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,399
Someone close to you.

321
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,039
Ka molt at.

322
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,759
He's around the same age as Rome.

323
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,799
You're close with him

324
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,799
Look at this.

325
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,679
He owns TS Group.

326
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,279
A lot of assets!

327
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,039
Even if you're not the first wife

328
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,959
but you will still get a lot as the second wife.

329
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,559
But Dok tian told me

330
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,519
she's someone that Rome took under his care

331
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,079
You believe that?

332
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,519
I don't.

333
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,199
I'll be honest.

334
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,719
I'm interested in that kid!

335
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,519
We can join hand's.

336
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,439
Mon.

337
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,879
Where are you going?!

338
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,799
We need to talk

339
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,439
What do you know about Tian's ring necklace?

340
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,479
Rome took it to get it fixed

341
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,239
and I went to go pick it up from the shop

342
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,919
But I ended up meeting Chan, Tian's brother.

343
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,839
He said he needed money.

344
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,159
He threatened me and took the necklace.

345
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,759
Chan, Tian's brother?

346
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,439
Did he tell you what his parents'names are?

347
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,319
No he didn't tell me.

348
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,639
He said he's from Ranong

349
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:38,119
He also said Tian isn't his real sister.

350
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,239
His parents just adopted her from somewhere.

351
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,199
Where is Chan right now?

352
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,559
Do you know where he lives?

353
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,159
Ms. Thip.

354
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:56,919
Tian.

355
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,119
Can I have your phones?

356
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,359
Here.

357
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,399
Me too?

358
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,559
I'm keeping it temporary

359
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,839
Do not tell anyone that we're staying here.

360
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,359
What's going on?

361
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,199
Nothing.

362
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,959
I just want to come take a break privately from everyone.

363
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,199
I want no disturbance.

364
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,599
I hope

365
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,679
no one will disobey my order.

366
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,879
What sin have I caused

367
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,479
to have am is fortunate husband like you?!

368
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,039
Seriously,

369
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,799
ever since we've been together,

370
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,439
have you done anything good for me?

371
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,279
Aor.

372
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,599
I'm hungry.

373
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,039
Thirsty too.

374
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,479
Give me my medicine too.

375
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,359
You have the nerves to order me around?

376
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,119
Bow down to my feet then I will do everything for you!

377
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,439
And who is that?! What other problems have you caused now?!

378
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,919
Who are you here to see?

379
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,599
If you're here to get money from Chan,

380
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,559
he's sick in bed right now

381
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,239
Aor!

382
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,799
Is your name Chan?

383
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,599
Are you Chai and Tho my a's son?

384
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,319
Who are you guys?

385
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,599
Who I am depends on your answer.

386
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,879
If you answer nicely, I will be God

387
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,599
But if you play around

388
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,999
talk before you think

389
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,359
I will be Satan that takes your life

390
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,199
Really?!

391
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,839
He's really Chai and Tho my a's son?!

392
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,359
Yes Boss.

393
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,119
He clearly confirmed with me.

394
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,479
But this time,

395
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,359
let me handle it my way

396
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,079
Pat! You bastard! Why turn off your phone?!

397
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,719
Sir.

398
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,919
You have an appointment in the meeting room.

399
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,599
Postpone it. I have errands to do.

400
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,679
But it's important.

401
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,679
It's about the coastal land where locals have gathered to protest.

402
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,399
It's an urgent matter sir

403
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,079
What the hell?!

404
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,359
So chaotic!

405
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,479
Be gentle!

406
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:16,959
Damn!

407
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,439
Hey

408
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,479
Where are you taking me?

409
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,919
Just doing as promised

410
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,359
Since you cooperated,

411
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,359
I will look after you.

412
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,199
Plus you'll have money to spend

413
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:30,999
Go.

414
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,359
What's next?

415
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,359
Go to Ranong.

416
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,279
Go end what's bothering Boss.

417
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:39,759
Let's go.

418
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,399
Wait

419
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:52,959
Where are you going?

420
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,759
I'm just taking a walk

421
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,879
Go back inside right now

422
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,639
Quickly!

423
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:02,879
Go!

424
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,479
It's okay.

425
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:09,839
Great job.

426
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,479
Go.

427
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,199
Yes sir.

428
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,359
Don't be scared

429
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:24,959
They're my people.

430
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,879
Next time,

431
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,519
don't leave the premises.

432
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,039
It's dangerous.

433
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,759
We moved here and there's still danger?

434
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,839
We can't be too calm

435
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,439
in the situation right now.

436
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,999
I don't want you to be in danger again.

437
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,079
Trust me, okay?

438
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,119
Okay,

439
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,759
Do you want to go over there?

440
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,039
Sure.

441
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,279
I miss Mr. Lak

442
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,599
I wonder how he's doing right now.

443
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,879
You won't reconcile with him?

444
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,639
So,you wanted to come take a walk

445
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,399
because you've done it before with Lak.

446
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,159
You're probably counting down the days

447
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,839
until he comes to get you.

448
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,559
It's not like that.

449
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,959
I'm worried about him and you.

450
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,639
I just don't want you guys to argue with each other.

451
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,719
Go back inside the house

452
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,479
I have errands to do.

453
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,519
I want to get revenge for you

454
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,119
Seek justice for Tian.

455
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,919
But it turns out

456
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,199
I'm putting Tian's life on the line

457
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,119
without knowing what the con segue nces might be.

458
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,679
Do you think I'm doing the right thing Thon?

459
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,719
I thought it was an army camp before being able to get inside

460
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,879
I had to ask you to go get Uncle Chu eam to confirm I'm Rome's sister.

461
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:53,959
Yeah.

462
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,359
By the way, what's going on Ms, Thip?

463
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,239
Why be so strict with security here?

464
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,719
You two probably don't know yet.

465
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,679
Before we came here,

466
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,959
there was a kidnapping for ransom back in Bangkok

467
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,159
Someone almost got killed

468
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,279
Who got kidnapped?

469
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,479
Tian did.

470
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,679
More importantly,

471
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,199
Mr. Rome and Mr. Lak cut ties with each other

472
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,919
because of Tian.

473
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,799
But I warned him already

474
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,519
I told him someday this was going to happen.

475
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,999
Something bad like this happened?

476
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,919
That's why l called you here

477
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,679
Chu eam-Yes?

478
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,559
Have you seen Mr Rome'sset of keys fall here?

479
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,519
No I haven't

480
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,839
Probably fell somewhere else then

481
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,559
Can I borrow your phone?

482
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,719
I want to call Mr, Rome.

483
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,199
Oh, sure.

484
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:07,799
Here

485
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:22,399
I think Tian has more secrets than what she's showing us.

486
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,519
the truth is

487
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,159
she's Miss Tian,

488
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,879
daughter of a billionaire.

489
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,159
But fell from grace

490
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:36,119
and had to go live in the countryside.

491
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,679
Her life got turned around

492
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,799
and met with --
-Hey!

493
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,759
Girl,you watch too much TV series

494
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,479
Her life can't be that lucky

495
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,759
But think about it. If it's true,

496
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:54,479
Tian will be in on the same level as you.

497
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,799
Plus she's way younger and more pure than you.

498
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,919
What's the point of bringing this up?

499
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,639
Hello?

500
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,999
Ms. Thip?

501
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,639
What?

502
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,559
Rome took Tian back to Ranong?

503
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,519
Thank you so much

504
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:27,039
I told you it's going to be difficult for you.

505
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,719
If you want to get rid of Tian,

506
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,039
go find out where Rome took Tian

507
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,719
Call me directly

508
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,079
How about this?

509
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,039
Go to Rome's house first

510
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,039
Get close to Tian.

511
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,479
Keep an eye on her

512
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,039
We'll talk about the other things later.

513
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,239
Hey.

514
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,639
If you know where Tian is at,

515
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,559
why don't you go see her?

516
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,839
I changed my plan.

517
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,039
We won't go there right now.

518
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,239
Wait and let that snake go in first.

519
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:21,399
After that, our job will be much easier.

520
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,759
If you don't need me anymore,

521
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,359
then let me go.

522
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,479
The job isn't done yet.

523
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,279
After this

524
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,479
you need to listen to my orders.

525
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,599
Your life will get much easier.

526
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,479
Rome!

527
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,319
Help me!

528
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,959
Why are you here?

529
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,599
I'm very scared.

530
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,559
Someone l don't know was waiting in front of my room.

531
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,479
He was asking for Tian's ring necklace.

532
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,319
He didn't believe me when I told him I don't know.

533
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,719
I don't know who to turn to.

534
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,079
Was it Ka molt at?

535
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,239
How did you knowl came back here?

536
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,199
I went to your house but no one was there.

537
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,239
There was a flight coming here today.

538
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,199
So I took the chance to come here.

539
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,639
Rome.

540
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,639
Can I stay here?

541
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,959
I don't know where else can be safer than here.

542
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,319
Please?

543
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,079
Without you,

544
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,599
I wouldn't be able to come in.

545
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,919
Thank you so much

546
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,799
Just hide your phone well

547
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,759
Don't forget to mute it.

548
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,039
Mr, Rome took all of ours already

549
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,679
He had me come take yours too.

550
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,199
Here.

551
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,599
I have another one.

552
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,079
You're a cautious person

553
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:32,919
So,

554
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,799
what's the next plan?

555
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,879
Whatever you want me to do.

556
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,559
tell me.

557
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,959
Before we do anything,we must know first

558
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,519
why Rome is hiding Tian here

559
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,079
and can't contact anybody.

560
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,759
What's so important about this kid?

561
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,439
What are you thinking about?

562
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,159
Missing Lak?

563
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,279
Yes.

564
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,839
If Mr, Lak was here, I would be much happier and enjoying this more

565
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,399
Don't worry

566
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,679
When this important thing is over

567
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,919
I won't get between you guys.

568
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,799
Boss.

569
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,239
I don't care what secrets you are hiding from me

570
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:42,119
And l don't care how important that secret is

571
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,959
But what I want to know

572
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,719
is why you took me under your care?

573
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:55,159
Why do you have to protect me when I'm getting attacked?

574
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,199
You gave me a place to live,clothes to wear.

575
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,959
Why are you doing these things?

576
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,159
Because...

577
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,439
Because you're important.

578
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,599
Important to who?

579
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,159
Important to me.

580
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,559
Important to many people.

581
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,679
Boss.

582
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,519
I dont care about other people

583
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,559
I just want to know if something did happen to me,

584
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,079
Will you be sad?

585
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,319
Hey, stop.

586
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,319
Don't say that.

587
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,359
-What if l die --
-I said stop.

588
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,319
I won't let you die.

589
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,439
Do you hear me?

590
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,599
I won't let you die.

591
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,199
I won't let anything happen to you

592
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,199
Because I..

593
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,479
Because I'm your guardian

594
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,799
I have to take good care of you

595
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,999
Thank you.

596
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,519
It's hot out here.

597
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,639
lim going inside

598
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,119
The key?

599
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,799
Stay quiet if you don't want to get in trouble

600
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,719
You didn't see anything

601
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,439
Understood?

602
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,559
Yes.

603
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,359
Which one is it?

604
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,519
Stall Rome.

605
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,159
Come here.

606
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,319
Mr, Rome.

607
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,519
Do you want to eat something specific for dinner?

608
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,239
I will cook it for you

609
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,959
Anything is fine.

610
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:14,399
But don't forget to cook extras for the people guarding the house.

611
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,479
Sure.

612
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:21,159
Mr. Rome,did you invite Dr.Pao and Mr s. Pa with you?

613
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,399
I forgot.

614
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,279
That's okay.

615
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,959
Maybe next time.

616
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,119
We'll be here for awhile

617
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,599
Okay

618
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,359
Ms. Thip.

619
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,239
What's wrong?

620
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,679
Suddenly,

621
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,359
my stomach hurts.

622
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,879
It's a sharp pain.

623
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,359
Let's go to the hospital then

624
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,759
I think after some rest,

625
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,959
I will feel better.

626
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,879
I think it's because I'm not eating on time.

627
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,839
You'll get gastritis if you keep this up.

628
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:06,959
Je ab.

629
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,239
Go make her some warm cocoa

630
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,519
Sure.

631
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,279
Can you manage?

632
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,719
Thank you.

633
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,319
I'm at Rome's house in Ranong right now

634
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,639
There's a lot of guards here

635
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,999
What's it gonna be with Tian?

636
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,119
Why are you calling?

637
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,519
You'll get caught

638
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,799
I will text you the details.

639
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,279
Ms. Thip!

640
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,919
You start led me!

641
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,039
I couldn't sleep.

642
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,359
Sol came to walk around!

643
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,399
So,

644
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,479
did you find anything on Tian?

645
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,479
No I didn't.

646
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,239
You didn't need to quit and take back your shares

647
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,959
We built this school together

648
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,119
I can't.

649
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,199
I don't want to take advantage of you

650
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,279
I'm dedicating everything to my new business right now

651
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,759
What business?

652
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,079
I don't know yet.

653
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,279
Idiot.

654
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,799
There's a woman.

655
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,959
She must be really important to you

656
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,359
This time,

657
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,759
are you hoping for a wedding?

658
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:36,839
Yes.

659
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,799
I really love her.

660
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,519
Who is that unlucky woman?

661
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,759
You haven't introduce her to me yet.

662
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,399
When's the wedding?

663
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,639
I don't know.

664
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,759
She has n't told me she loves me yet.

665
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,759
Sol want to prove myself

666
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,879
and build my status for her to see.

667
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,079
Do you know whose son I am?!

668
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,359
Let go!

669
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,319
I'm...

670
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,039
Kula chart Taks as ut

671
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,759
This shitty bar

672
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,439
is going down!

673
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,279
You guys think you're all tough right?

674
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,199
Fine.

675
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,279
Go home. You're drunk

676
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,999
You get a pass today

677
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,199
since you're an old customer

678
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,479
I want to drink first

679
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,919
and take a hooker home with me

680
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,279
What's it to you?!

681
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,119
You don't have cash and your cards have been frozen.

682
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,639
Come back next time little brother!

683
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,719
Money is a trivial thing.

684
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,159
Dad won't give it to me

685
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,639
but my mom will!

686
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,399
Loser!

687
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,759
Go home and let your mom feed'you milk!

688
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,519
You!

689
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,199
Handle it.

690
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,119
Revenge?

691
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,519
If Tian finds out the truth

692
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,119
how will she feel?!

693
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,199
Tian.

694
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,559
You're really stupid.

695
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,919
T was brave enough to tell you the truth

696
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,239
Unlike your angel.

697
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,599
Pretends to be a good person

698
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:19,199
to use you for revenge.

699
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,599
Pa.

700
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,519
