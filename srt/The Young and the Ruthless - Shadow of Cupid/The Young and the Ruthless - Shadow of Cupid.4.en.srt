1
00:00:11,143 --> 00:00:11,902
I won't go!

2
00:00:11,983 --> 00:00:12,902
I'm telling Mom

3
00:00:12,943 --> 00:00:14,222
that you're D ad'smistress.

4
00:00:14,303 --> 00:00:16,542
I think we should stop being enemies.

5
00:00:16,703 --> 00:00:18,742
With the person trying to be my new mom?!

6
00:00:19,063 --> 00:00:19,942
Are you insane?!

7
00:00:20,303 --> 00:00:22,742
If we agree to be allies,

8
00:00:23,143 --> 00:00:26,422
I will tell you how to live in this house comfortably.

9
00:00:26,463 --> 00:00:27,542
From now on,

10
00:00:28,703 --> 00:00:30,462
you j must always wear this pearl necklace.

11
00:00:30,623 --> 00:00:32,102
I'll keep that necklace

12
00:00:32,983 --> 00:00:34,542
safe for you.

13
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:35,982
Be careful.

14
00:00:38,463 --> 00:00:39,982
Who is Tian?

15
00:00:40,103 --> 00:00:42,542
beautiful girl like Tian into his care?

16
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:43,662
I just know that

17
00:00:43,823 --> 00:00:45,302
Tian is an orphan.

18
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:47,102
Also, she has done Rome a favor.

19
00:00:47,543 --> 00:00:50,582
That's why Rome wants the best life for Tian

20
00:01:12,343 --> 00:01:12,862
Quunsni auuuunu naiannn

21
00:01:15,023 --> 00:01:15,942
au a u naunn

22
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:16,862
au au

23
00:01:21,703 --> 00:01:23,102
My name is Laksa mon.

24
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:24,702
What is your name?

25
00:01:29,263 --> 00:01:30,062
My

26
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:32,262
name is Dok tian.

27
00:01:33,623 --> 00:01:35,022
Your English is not bad

28
00:01:35,743 --> 00:01:36,462
" Ma muang "

29
00:01:37,463 --> 00:01:38,302
Mango.

30
00:01:38,303 --> 00:01:39,262
" See lue ang "

31
00:01:39,703 --> 00:01:40,582
Yellow.

32
00:01:40,823 --> 00:01:41,462
" Kwai "

33
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:42,422
Buffalo

34
00:01:42,463 --> 00:01:43,102
" Meed "

35
00:01:43,183 --> 00:01:43,742
Eto!

36
00:01:45,223 --> 00:01:46,782
You're a quick thinker

37
00:01:47,063 --> 00:01:49,782
Welcome to Laksa mon Classroom

38
00:01:53,623 --> 00:01:56,422
Rome asked me to teach you English.

39
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:01,782
Thank you,

40
00:02:02,743 --> 00:02:04,182
Professor,

41
00:02:06,183 --> 00:02:07,462
That sounds old

42
00:02:07,463 --> 00:02:09,182
You can just call me Lak.

43
00:02:10,023 --> 00:02:10,742
Lak.

44
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:13,622
I'll call you Mr, Lak then.

45
00:02:13,863 --> 00:02:14,542
Okay.

46
00:02:21,823 --> 00:02:22,742
Are you sure

47
00:02:24,223 --> 00:02:25,342
the doctor hung himself?

48
00:02:26,703 --> 00:02:27,422
I'm sure.

49
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:29,382
He's been dead for years

50
00:02:30,143 --> 00:02:31,142
So you called me here

51
00:02:31,463 --> 00:02:33,342
having to drive from Ranong to Hua Hin

52
00:02:33,463 --> 00:02:34,542
just to look at this?

53
00:02:35,663 --> 00:02:37,982
So you can see with your own eyes

54
00:02:38,463 --> 00:02:40,222
that we've come to a dead end

55
00:02:41,263 --> 00:02:43,742
Why is Heaven siding with an evil person like Ka molt at?

56
00:02:43,823 --> 00:02:45,262
He blocked all of our roads

57
00:02:46,423 --> 00:02:48,942
This world isn't fair so why even believe in good or bad karma?

58
00:02:50,263 --> 00:02:51,662
Can you just calm down?

59
00:02:52,103 --> 00:02:52,702
Rome.

60
00:02:53,263 --> 00:02:57,782
Maybe it's not time for Kamol tat to get his karma yet.

61
00:02:57,783 --> 00:02:58,782
Then when?

62
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:00,862
In a few months,

63
00:03:01,063 --> 00:03:03,342
he's going to get everything of Taks as ut.
You know that.

64
00:03:05,503 --> 00:03:06,502
May be

65
00:03:07,543 --> 00:03:09,342
I'll be the judge of everything

66
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:11,102
Wait!

67
00:03:12,063 --> 00:03:14,662
Where are you going and what crazy shit are you gonna do now?!

68
00:03:14,703 --> 00:03:15,782
Don't meddle.

69
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:20,062
I'll be the one to drag him to confess his sins right in front of Thon's ashes!

70
00:03:33,143 --> 00:03:36,502
I can't suffer anymore.

71
00:03:38,143 --> 00:03:39,942
Please come get me

72
00:03:41,743 --> 00:03:43,742
Let me go be with you.

73
00:03:46,983 --> 00:03:47,622
Hey!

74
00:03:50,703 --> 00:03:51,782
Miss!

75
00:03:52,503 --> 00:03:53,702
What are you doing?!

76
00:03:54,503 --> 00:03:55,782
Why did you stop me?!

77
00:03:55,823 --> 00:03:57,622
I want to go be with my husband!

78
00:03:58,823 --> 00:03:59,702
Stay calm.

79
00:03:59,783 --> 00:04:00,382
Okay?

80
00:04:00,503 --> 00:04:01,822
Don't commit suicide, I'm begging you.

81
00:04:01,903 --> 00:04:04,382
You guys will never understand

82
00:04:04,423 --> 00:04:05,782
Don't bother me!

83
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:07,822
I think

84
00:04:08,703 --> 00:04:10,342
we should talk it out first

85
00:04:11,303 --> 00:04:13,142
So we can help you fix the problem

86
00:04:14,783 --> 00:04:15,902
I'm Pao.

87
00:04:16,663 --> 00:04:18,542
Dr.Wor a wong's junior.

88
00:04:25,103 --> 00:04:26,822
Dr.Wor a wong died

89
00:04:27,423 --> 00:04:29,342
because of me

90
00:04:30,463 --> 00:04:33,902
He shouldn't have to sacrifice that much for me.

91
00:04:36,783 --> 00:04:37,862
In that case.

92
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,822
can you please tell us the truth?

93
00:04:42,223 --> 00:04:43,302
Perhaps

94
00:04:44,263 --> 00:04:46,382
we might be involved in his death

95
00:04:47,183 --> 00:04:48,902
20 years ago,

96
00:04:49,223 --> 00:04:50,182
I was sick.

97
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,142
I had leukemia

98
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,742
I needed treatment

99
00:04:55,823 --> 00:04:57,742
by bone marrow transplant

100
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,542
The cost was so expensive

101
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:02,462
But he managed to get the money for the treatment.

102
00:05:02,823 --> 00:05:03,982
He said

103
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:05,742
the hospital

104
00:05:05,983 --> 00:05:07,662
was giving out loan opportunities.

105
00:05:09,343 --> 00:05:10,702
But til today.

106
00:05:11,023 --> 00:05:12,822
I found out the truth

107
00:05:13,223 --> 00:05:15,302
where that money came from

108
00:05:19,983 --> 00:05:21,662
It's because of this journal.

109
00:05:33,783 --> 00:05:34,222
Hey.

110
00:05:35,463 --> 00:05:37,062
Ka mol tat's name is on there.

111
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,022
Come on Doctor.

112
00:05:50,423 --> 00:05:51,902
It's no big deal.

113
00:05:53,543 --> 00:05:55,182
Just write down

114
00:05:57,903 --> 00:05:59,422
my wife is having a boy?

115
00:06:00,463 --> 00:06:02,022
I just want to surprise my wife.

116
00:06:05,303 --> 00:06:06,462
How about this?

117
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:09,822
Hl give you two million.

118
00:06:10,623 --> 00:06:12,542
Well discuss the details later.

119
00:06:27,023 --> 00:06:28,302
I'm sorry.

120
00:06:28,303 --> 00:06:29,862
I took a long time in the restroom.

121
00:06:30,703 --> 00:06:32,662
How's the baby? Is it healthy?

122
00:06:33,463 --> 00:06:34,182
Hey

123
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,342
Our son

124
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:37,622
is very healthy.

125
00:06:38,903 --> 00:06:40,382
But...

126
00:06:42,023 --> 00:06:43,822
you might have to doc-section.

127
00:06:46,303 --> 00:06:47,302
Doctor

128
00:06:47,623 --> 00:06:49,742
I want to have a natural birth

129
00:06:50,863 --> 00:06:52,382
I want to see my son's face

130
00:06:52,623 --> 00:06:54,902
when he opens his eyes for the first time

131
00:06:55,543 --> 00:06:57,182
In my embrace.

132
00:06:58,623 --> 00:06:59,662
It's just...

133
00:07:00,463 --> 00:07:02,222
the baby is in a breech position

134
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,422
For you and your baby's safety,

135
00:07:06,183 --> 00:07:07,502
you would need ac-section.

136
00:07:07,943 --> 00:07:08,902
Ever since that day,

137
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:12,302
King and I rented a house in Hua Hin.

138
00:07:12,943 --> 00:07:15,702
My life hasn't been happy since.

139
00:07:16,143 --> 00:07:17,582
I'm so shameful of myself.

140
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,502
I had to take antidepressants

141
00:07:19,863 --> 00:07:21,542
and sleeping pills every night

142
00:07:21,823 --> 00:07:22,982
Until now,

143
00:07:23,183 --> 00:07:24,582
I've made my decision

144
00:07:24,943 --> 00:07:29,302
that I can no longer wear the honorable white coat

145
00:07:32,103 --> 00:07:32,662
Hello.

146
00:07:33,303 --> 00:07:34,782
You moved to Hua Hin.

147
00:07:34,943 --> 00:07:36,262
You broke the promise

148
00:07:36,383 --> 00:07:38,022
You told the truth about the baby

149
00:07:38,343 --> 00:07:39,862
to Pitp lern, didn't you?

150
00:07:40,423 --> 00:07:42,222
I never told anyone about this

151
00:07:42,383 --> 00:07:43,462
I swear.

152
00:07:48,303 --> 00:07:50,342
It's not true!

153
00:07:54,103 --> 00:07:55,302
This journal

154
00:07:55,783 --> 00:07:56,862
was left unfinished

155
00:07:57,023 --> 00:07:58,662
the night before he killed himself.

156
00:07:58,983 --> 00:08:00,262
I don't believe

157
00:08:00,343 --> 00:08:02,582
that he would kill himself

158
00:08:03,663 --> 00:08:06,502
I think it was murder.

159
00:08:06,663 --> 00:08:07,622
If that's the case,

160
00:08:08,743 --> 00:08:10,302
why didn't you go file a report

161
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,782
and use this journal

162
00:08:12,983 --> 00:08:14,022
as evidence?

163
00:08:14,623 --> 00:08:16,182
I don't want Doctor

164
00:08:16,943 --> 00:08:18,382
to ruin his reputation.

165
00:08:21,103 --> 00:08:22,102
I think

166
00:08:23,623 --> 00:08:25,102
Ka molt at is behind this.

167
00:08:25,983 --> 00:08:28,862
He wanted to silent Dr.Wor about swapping the babies.

168
00:08:30,863 --> 00:08:31,582
Ms. King.

169
00:08:32,743 --> 00:08:34,062
I want you

170
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:36,422
to be a witness in charging Ka molt at

171
00:08:37,023 --> 00:08:39,022
to seek justice for Dr.Wor.

172
00:08:39,743 --> 00:08:40,982
We'll go right now.

173
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:41,702
No.

174
00:08:41,743 --> 00:08:42,742
I won't go.

175
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:44,422
If l go,

176
00:08:44,503 --> 00:08:45,582
that means

177
00:08:45,623 --> 00:08:49,422
I've ruined Doctor's reputation that he's upheld all his life

178
00:08:50,223 --> 00:08:51,262
A dead person

179
00:08:51,943 --> 00:08:53,222
only has his reputation ruined

180
00:08:54,303 --> 00:08:57,902
But the one who is still alive is deceived into being someone else's child is suffering.

181
00:08:59,423 --> 00:09:00,302
We're doing this

182
00:09:01,103 --> 00:09:04,142
to expose Ka mol tat's evil deeds.

183
00:09:04,903 --> 00:09:05,422
Okay?

184
00:09:06,063 --> 00:09:06,662
No!

185
00:09:07,063 --> 00:09:08,142
I won't go.

186
00:09:08,503 --> 00:09:10,782
You guys should leave my house now!

187
00:09:12,743 --> 00:09:13,302
Ms, King.

188
00:09:13,343 --> 00:09:13,822
Ms. King!

189
00:09:32,783 --> 00:09:34,222
las sure you

190
00:09:34,543 --> 00:09:36,542
Ii never told Mr s. P itplern about it

191
00:09:36,703 --> 00:09:37,702
I swear.

192
00:09:38,663 --> 00:09:40,582
Why did Pit p lern know

193
00:09:41,183 --> 00:09:42,742
that the babies got switched?

194
00:09:44,983 --> 00:09:47,142
Only you know about this

195
00:09:47,223 --> 00:09:47,622
Hmm?

196
00:09:48,943 --> 00:09:49,982
Doctor.

197
00:09:50,863 --> 00:09:52,782
If you're struggling and have no money to spend

198
00:09:53,463 --> 00:09:54,742
you can tell me.

199
00:09:55,743 --> 00:09:56,462
Enough.

200
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:59,862
Let me do evi I just once in this life.

201
00:10:00,743 --> 00:10:03,942
I will resign and live here and won't go back to Bangkok.

202
00:10:04,223 --> 00:10:05,942
I want everything to end.

203
00:10:06,383 --> 00:10:08,302
I won't ask anything else from you.

204
00:10:08,503 --> 00:10:09,542
Please just let me go

205
00:10:13,983 --> 00:10:15,902
I never trust anyone

206
00:10:16,743 --> 00:10:17,822
Except myself.

207
00:10:30,543 --> 00:10:31,302
Hey!

208
00:10:32,943 --> 00:10:34,342
Hey! Ka molt at!

209
00:10:34,903 --> 00:10:35,982
Hey!

210
00:10:38,663 --> 00:10:39,582
What's wrong?

211
00:10:39,623 --> 00:10:40,822
You're sweating.

212
00:10:43,183 --> 00:10:44,022
I'm fine.

213
00:10:44,783 --> 00:10:45,822
J just had a bad dream.

214
00:10:47,743 --> 00:10:48,622
It's morning already?

215
00:10:49,263 --> 00:10:50,782
Barely 5:00am.

216
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,662
I set the alarm.

217
00:10:52,863 --> 00:10:54,622
I want to go prepare offerings for the monk

218
00:10:54,783 --> 00:10:56,902
I saw you twisting and turning.

219
00:10:58,103 --> 00:10:59,462
You must want me dead?

220
00:11:04,103 --> 00:11:07,302
The donation envelope the monk gave you

221
00:11:07,463 --> 00:11:09,182
did you put the money in yet?

222
00:11:09,343 --> 00:11:10,902
I can give it to him later.

223
00:11:11,943 --> 00:11:12,662
Why?

224
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:15,302
You think I'm that sinful?

225
00:11:16,783 --> 00:11:18,142
Whatever you did,

226
00:11:19,023 --> 00:11:20,502
You know it.

227
00:11:22,303 --> 00:11:23,582
Are you mad at me

228
00:11:24,063 --> 00:11:26,062
that you had to become my wife instead of Thon?

229
00:11:26,903 --> 00:11:29,542
Whatever you wanted, I would give it to you.

230
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:30,822
Except for the moon and star

231
00:11:31,863 --> 00:11:34,102
Can you give me my child's life back?

232
00:11:35,143 --> 00:11:37,782
I told you our daughter died after birth.

233
00:11:37,823 --> 00:11:39,102
How many times have l told you?

234
00:11:39,143 --> 00:11:39,942
Wher e's her body?

235
00:11:41,423 --> 00:11:42,942
If our daughter really died,

236
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,582
can you show me her body?

237
00:11:46,183 --> 00:11:49,902
I didn't want you to be sad sol adopted Chart.

238
00:11:51,223 --> 00:11:53,142
Like how you burned Thon's body,

239
00:11:54,063 --> 00:11:55,782
made him an unidentified corpse.

240
00:11:56,063 --> 00:11:56,622
You see?

241
00:11:57,143 --> 00:11:58,822
In the end, we go back to this.

242
00:12:00,663 --> 00:12:02,582
The reason you'remaking merit everyday

243
00:12:02,783 --> 00:12:04,422
is because you're scared he won't go up to heaven right?

244
00:12:05,463 --> 00:12:08,622
I just want you to know the word "give ".

245
00:12:09,503 --> 00:12:10,982
Give with a pure heart.

246
00:12:11,343 --> 00:12:13,022
Not expect anything in return

247
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:17,142
So Kula chart

248
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,302
won't have to receive the karma

249
00:12:19,703 --> 00:12:21,382
that the adults have committed.

250
00:12:21,943 --> 00:12:24,062
That is all l hope for.

251
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,262
Damn it!

252
00:12:37,183 --> 00:12:38,222
I'm the one

253
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:39,582
that controls karma

254
00:12:40,503 --> 00:12:41,942
I will show you

255
00:12:59,703 --> 00:13:00,502
I'm done.

256
00:13:01,303 --> 00:13:02,342
Let's take a look

257
00:13:12,183 --> 00:13:13,702
20 questions

258
00:13:13,943 --> 00:13:15,302
and you got 16 correct.

259
00:13:16,023 --> 00:13:17,342
Not bad Tian

260
00:13:17,783 --> 00:13:19,902
When Kr u Pon was teaching me

261
00:13:19,943 --> 00:13:21,822
I liked English the most.

262
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:23,222
Kr u Pon?

263
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:29,622
Kr u Pon was my English teacher from Grade 1to Grade6

264
00:13:29,823 --> 00:13:33,982
Then I took the exam and got my NFE non-formal education )

265
00:13:35,903 --> 00:13:37,262
Okay Tian.

266
00:13:37,423 --> 00:13:40,022
Let's try conversation now.

267
00:13:40,383 --> 00:13:42,702
Try speaking English. Say...

268
00:13:43,143 --> 00:13:43,862
one sentence.

269
00:13:52,263 --> 00:13:55,702
Would you like some candle therapy?

270
00:13:56,103 --> 00:13:58,342
Candle many many smell

271
00:13:58,423 --> 00:14:01,142
Lavender, lemon grass, mint.

272
00:14:01,263 --> 00:14:03,982
This one for 30baht but

273
00:14:04,063 --> 00:14:06,902
four for one hundred. Please?

274
00:14:11,703 --> 00:14:14,022
What's so funny Mr Lak?

275
00:14:14,063 --> 00:14:16,302
That's what I say when I sell the candles.

276
00:14:16,303 --> 00:14:17,662
The foreigners understand i me.

277
00:14:18,263 --> 00:14:20,222
It's not wrong.

278
00:14:20,263 --> 00:14:22,382
But grammar isn't actually correct

279
00:14:24,703 --> 00:14:25,902
I have an idea.

280
00:14:25,943 --> 00:14:28,062
Studying here doesn't give you the vibe

281
00:14:28,423 --> 00:14:29,902
Let's go outside.

282
00:14:31,543 --> 00:14:32,382
Can you

283
00:14:32,903 --> 00:14:33,502
drive?

284
00:14:36,503 --> 00:14:36,942
Dr...

285
00:14:37,303 --> 00:14:38,422
Can you drive?

286
00:15:13,263 --> 00:15:15,862
Motorbike is broken

287
00:15:16,423 --> 00:15:17,302
Broken bike.

288
00:15:19,263 --> 00:15:22,422
You understand how to create a learning situation.

289
00:15:22,743 --> 00:15:24,902
No Mr, Lak.

290
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:26,502
It really is broken.

291
00:15:26,703 --> 00:15:27,862
I can't start it.

292
00:15:30,983 --> 00:15:32,102
What do we do?

293
00:15:32,623 --> 00:15:33,822
We drove so far?

294
00:15:37,943 --> 00:15:39,222
Did you bring your phone?

295
00:15:40,063 --> 00:15:41,502
don't have a phone.

296
00:15:41,663 --> 00:15:43,742
But let me try fixing it.

297
00:15:44,463 --> 00:15:45,702
Are you joking?

298
00:15:46,223 --> 00:15:47,462
I'm serious.

299
00:15:47,543 --> 00:15:49,102
I used to help Dad a lot.

300
00:15:57,023 --> 00:15:57,582
Let'stry.

301
00:16:09,623 --> 00:16:10,662
Excellent job Tian!

302
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:11,662
I did it!

303
00:16:11,663 --> 00:16:11,982
e

304
00:16:14,503 --> 00:16:15,622
Tian be careful!

305
00:16:18,663 --> 00:16:19,142
Hey!

306
00:16:19,263 --> 00:16:20,382
Tian! Are you okay?

307
00:16:24,823 --> 00:16:25,342
Pao.

308
00:16:25,903 --> 00:16:28,342
Come inside and have coffee or food then go home.

309
00:16:29,503 --> 00:16:30,142
No.

310
00:16:31,383 --> 00:16:32,742
I have to go back and open my clinic.

311
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,822
Because I was so busy with your business,

312
00:16:34,823 --> 00:16:36,822
my patients probably went to another clinic by now.

313
00:16:37,743 --> 00:16:38,342
Okay.

314
00:16:39,063 --> 00:16:41,182
Can you tell Pa about what happened then?

315
00:16:41,863 --> 00:16:43,022
We need to be ready.

316
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:45,022
I'm gonna start attacking Ka molt at.

317
00:16:45,143 --> 00:16:46,222
Catch him off guard.

318
00:16:48,263 --> 00:16:48,702
Hey.

319
00:16:49,703 --> 00:16:50,382
Rome.

320
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:53,382
I'll be honest with you.

321
00:16:53,823 --> 00:16:56,342
I fee I just as bad as Dr W or

322
00:16:56,943 --> 00:16:58,942
who have to cooperate with you to do the same old things.

323
00:16:59,103 --> 00:17:00,302
Then you have to do it even more.

324
00:17:01,023 --> 00:17:03,542
Once Ka mol tat'sevil deeds get exposed

325
00:17:03,863 --> 00:17:06,102
Dr, Wor's spirit will get to rest in peace.

326
00:17:06,223 --> 00:17:07,742
And you won't have to feel any shame

327
00:17:12,743 --> 00:17:13,542
Don't look at me like that.

328
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:15,542
Fine.

329
00:17:15,943 --> 00:17:17,542
We've come this far already.

330
00:17:18,263 --> 00:17:19,302
What can I do?

331
00:17:22,983 --> 00:17:24,102
I'll take off now.

332
00:17:24,863 --> 00:17:25,342
Yeah.

333
00:17:33,703 --> 00:17:35,822
Are you tired from traveling?

334
00:17:36,703 --> 00:17:37,262
Je ab

335
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:38,902
Go bring a cold glass of water.

336
00:17:38,943 --> 00:17:39,582
Sure

337
00:17:42,383 --> 00:17:43,102
Are you hungry?

338
00:17:43,343 --> 00:17:45,222
I can go prepare your food

339
00:17:45,383 --> 00:17:46,622
It's okay, I'm not hungry.

340
00:17:48,303 --> 00:17:49,182
How's Tian?

341
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:50,822
Was she mischievous?

342
00:17:52,183 --> 00:17:54,502
Did she focus on learning etiquette with you?

343
00:17:56,463 --> 00:17:57,822
I rather not tell you

344
00:17:57,903 --> 00:17:59,462
You might think I'm a snitch.

345
00:18:00,383 --> 00:18:01,142
What did Tian do?

346
00:18:03,623 --> 00:18:05,302
Ever since Mr, Lak came here,

347
00:18:05,423 --> 00:18:07,662
they ve been hanging out alone together.

348
00:18:08,343 --> 00:18:10,302
When l want to teach her or train her,

349
00:18:10,543 --> 00:18:11,582
she always avoid me

350
00:18:11,983 --> 00:18:14,542
Those two actually left somewhere together since morning

351
00:18:19,303 --> 00:18:20,582
Oh, there they are

352
00:18:20,983 --> 00:18:22,622
Speaking of the devil.

353
00:18:32,423 --> 00:18:33,462
What happened?

354
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:35,622
What happened to you guys?

355
00:18:38,343 --> 00:18:39,502
Motorcycle crashed.

356
00:18:40,263 --> 00:18:41,182
It's my fault.

357
00:18:41,423 --> 00:18:42,942
I had Tian drive me around

358
00:18:43,543 --> 00:18:44,582
My goodness Mr Lak.

359
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:46,662
Your leg hasn't healed yet.

360
00:18:47,383 --> 00:18:49,062
I was driving.

361
00:18:49,543 --> 00:18:51,302
Mr. Lak did nothing wrong

362
00:18:51,423 --> 00:18:53,102
It's my fault.

363
00:18:53,263 --> 00:18:54,422
It's both your faults!

364
00:18:56,863 --> 00:18:57,462
Lak.

365
00:18:58,063 --> 00:18:59,462
I brought you here to recover.

366
00:18:59,703 --> 00:19:00,942
I had Ms. Thip look after you

367
00:19:01,623 --> 00:19:02,822
But instead you go outside to play.

368
00:19:06,023 --> 00:19:06,822
You too.

369
00:19:07,623 --> 00:19:09,902
I had Ms, Thip teach you manners and etiquette

370
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:11,022
on how to be a lady

371
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,182
But you went out to ride a motorbike until it crashed.

372
00:19:14,383 --> 00:19:15,702
Good thing it's just this injury.

373
00:19:16,063 --> 00:19:18,222
What happens if you hit your head and become handicapped or even die?

374
00:19:21,023 --> 00:19:23,462
It's a small injury Boss.

375
00:19:24,223 --> 00:19:27,502
I used to ride a motorbike down a hill and it hurt a lot more than this.

376
00:19:27,543 --> 00:19:28,262
Don't argue!

377
00:19:35,183 --> 00:19:36,462
I'm sorry.

378
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:41,062
I'll go clean my wound now.

379
00:19:44,943 --> 00:19:45,942
Don't help her Ms. Thip

380
00:19:48,383 --> 00:19:49,902
Let her walk on her own so she learns

381
00:20:00,343 --> 00:20:01,902
Why are you so upset Rome?!

382
00:20:02,063 --> 00:20:03,742
Why are you scolding Tian so much?

383
00:20:04,263 --> 00:20:06,222
It was just a small accident

384
00:20:07,103 --> 00:20:07,822
You don't know

385
00:20:09,943 --> 00:20:11,342
how important Tian's life is.

386
00:20:28,783 --> 00:20:30,822
I don't understand when you said

387
00:20:31,023 --> 00:20:32,462
that Tian's life is important.

388
00:20:32,943 --> 00:20:34,142
What do you mean?

389
00:20:35,303 --> 00:20:36,462
Someday you'll know.

390
00:20:38,223 --> 00:20:39,462
You speak in secrecy.

391
00:20:39,663 --> 00:20:40,862
I want to know even more now

392
00:20:41,703 --> 00:20:42,382
Unless...

393
00:20:43,143 --> 00:20:44,582
you have some kind of feelings for her?

394
00:20:45,983 --> 00:20:46,822
What the hell?!

395
00:20:48,023 --> 00:20:49,782
When it comes to women, it never crossed my mind.

396
00:20:50,183 --> 00:20:51,822
If you speak of this again,

397
00:20:52,063 --> 00:20:53,542
I will kick your other leg.

398
00:20:54,263 --> 00:20:54,742
You want that?

399
00:20:54,783 --> 00:20:55,742
No!

400
00:20:55,823 --> 00:20:56,702
I give up!

401
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,622
I won't say anything.

402
00:20:59,623 --> 00:21:00,382
Some an.

403
00:21:04,903 --> 00:21:06,662
Lak and Tian won't join me?

404
00:21:08,303 --> 00:21:10,462
I brought Mr Lak his food already

405
00:21:10,943 --> 00:21:11,982
As for Tian,

406
00:21:12,303 --> 00:21:13,902
I knocked many times but she won't answer

407
00:21:14,383 --> 00:21:16,462
I guess she's going on a strike because you scold her.

408
00:21:17,423 --> 00:21:19,342
This kind of personality is

409
00:21:19,743 --> 00:21:21,142
quite difficult to train.

410
00:21:22,223 --> 00:21:24,742
But I think Miss Tian

411
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:26,542
is unable to come down

412
00:21:26,623 --> 00:21:28,782
She was limping earlier.

413
00:21:48,303 --> 00:21:49,582
Going on a hunger strike?

414
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:52,262
No.

415
00:21:53,503 --> 00:21:54,102
Did you know

416
00:21:55,343 --> 00:21:57,022
besides not liking stubborn kids,

417
00:21:57,463 --> 00:21:58,062
lying,

418
00:21:59,143 --> 00:22:02,062
I also hate people who are sarcastic,without reason,

419
00:22:02,543 --> 00:22:03,702
and goes on protest.

420
00:22:05,703 --> 00:22:07,662
I'm not protesting you.

421
00:22:09,103 --> 00:22:09,582
But...

422
00:22:10,383 --> 00:22:13,782
I just want to punish myself for getting you upset.

423
00:22:14,383 --> 00:22:15,822
What if you get gastritis?

424
00:22:16,943 --> 00:22:18,102
Will that not cause me trouble?

425
00:22:18,703 --> 00:22:20,262
I'll be fine.

426
00:22:21,103 --> 00:22:23,302
I've faced worse hardships before.

427
00:22:23,703 --> 00:22:26,222
I've starved for days and I was fine.

428
00:22:29,183 --> 00:22:30,382
You struggled that much?

429
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:35,542
Yes.

430
00:22:37,063 --> 00:22:39,662
Mom and Dad would move around often.

431
00:22:40,663 --> 00:22:42,902
Sometimes we had to live on a farm

432
00:22:44,183 --> 00:22:46,222
When there's a lot of flood,

433
00:22:46,343 --> 00:22:48,942
we couldn't go out to buy food.

434
00:22:51,423 --> 00:22:52,222
If you live with me,

435
00:22:53,743 --> 00:22:55,342
you will never struggle like that again.

436
00:22:56,503 --> 00:22:57,302
I promise.

437
00:22:59,543 --> 00:23:00,262
Boss.

438
00:23:02,703 --> 00:23:03,942
But you have to listen to me

439
00:23:06,503 --> 00:23:08,222
You won't do anything risky again

440
00:23:10,303 --> 00:23:10,982
Okay?

441
00:23:12,503 --> 00:23:13,222
Sure.

442
00:23:16,343 --> 00:23:18,302
will not do that again.

443
00:23:21,183 --> 00:23:22,422
Boss.

444
00:23:23,503 --> 00:23:25,382
You're no longer mad at me?

445
00:23:41,303 --> 00:23:42,102
What's it gonna be?

446
00:23:44,983 --> 00:23:46,342
Feed yourself or l feed you?

447
00:23:48,383 --> 00:23:49,462
I'll feed myself.

448
00:23:49,943 --> 00:23:51,022
Thank you Boss.

449
00:23:58,663 --> 00:24:02,902
Thank you all for honoring TS Group.

450
00:24:03,663 --> 00:24:05,502
Our company now is moving forward

451
00:24:06,143 --> 00:24:09,262
Commercial building and housing development business

452
00:24:09,703 --> 00:24:11,822
with a focus on the northern region

453
00:24:12,143 --> 00:24:14,102
like Chiang Rai

454
00:24:14,383 --> 00:24:15,142
Nan,

455
00:24:15,223 --> 00:24:16,302
and Mae Sot.

456
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:18,262
Everything is done according to policy

457
00:24:18,703 --> 00:24:19,862
and state special!

458
00:24:20,183 --> 00:24:21,102
Also,

459
00:24:21,343 --> 00:24:23,062
our second goal

460
00:24:23,303 --> 00:24:24,982
will focus on five star luxury hotel

461
00:24:26,823 --> 00:24:29,822
focusing on coastal areas in the southern region

462
00:24:30,103 --> 00:24:35,302
Whether it will be on the Andaman side or the Gulf of Thailand, we will inform you later.

463
00:24:35,823 --> 00:24:39,182
The company is at the top of the stock market.

464
00:24:39,303 --> 00:24:42,302
What inspired your success, Mr Ka molt at?

465
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:46,062
Gratitude

466
00:24:47,503 --> 00:24:50,302
I did everything to continue my father's dream

467
00:24:50,863 --> 00:24:55,302
He wanted his grandson to be the successor to his business.

468
00:24:55,983 --> 00:24:57,262
That he iris

469
00:24:57,343 --> 00:24:59,062
Kula chart Taks as ut

470
00:25:05,023 --> 00:25:07,942
Will Mr, Kula chart be the youngest executive?

471
00:25:08,343 --> 00:25:10,222
Well, maybe.

472
00:25:10,223 --> 00:25:14,622
But now Kula chart has to fly to England to study business administration.

473
00:25:15,183 --> 00:25:19,702
When he returns, I hope he will come back to develop the company and not disappoint everyone.

474
00:25:19,983 --> 00:25:21,422
Can l please interview Mr. Kula chart...

475
00:25:28,023 --> 00:25:29,022
He was just here.

476
00:25:41,783 --> 00:25:42,382
Hurry.

477
00:25:43,743 --> 00:25:44,902
Did anyone follow you?

478
00:25:45,583 --> 00:25:47,462
My boss is still shook from the last raid

479
00:25:47,983 --> 00:25:48,982
Why are you so scared?

480
00:25:49,103 --> 00:25:50,422
Trade. Quickly!

481
00:26:22,063 --> 00:26:22,862
Kula chart.

482
00:26:32,783 --> 00:26:33,582
Gosh!

483
00:26:34,103 --> 00:26:35,222
It's my dad's side chick.

484
00:26:35,623 --> 00:26:36,542
I thought it was someone else.

485
00:26:37,743 --> 00:26:38,502
Hold on.

486
00:26:39,343 --> 00:26:39,782
Hey.

487
00:26:40,143 --> 00:26:41,222
Are you crazy?!

488
00:26:41,543 --> 00:26:43,182
Why are you getting high right now?

489
00:26:43,303 --> 00:26:44,782
Everyone is looking for you out there.

490
00:26:45,343 --> 00:26:46,022
Get going.

491
00:26:46,143 --> 00:26:47,342
-Go!
-What the hell?

492
00:27:07,183 --> 00:27:09,262
I will make the karma you created

493
00:27:10,263 --> 00:27:12,662
come to fruition faster, Ka molt at

494
00:27:19,303 --> 00:27:20,742
Your people did a good job.

495
00:27:21,943 --> 00:27:23,102
Keep following the target.

496
00:27:32,423 --> 00:27:33,742
That bastard son screwed me!

497
00:27:34,423 --> 00:27:36,582
I managed to make him look good in public

498
00:27:36,903 --> 00:27:37,982
and look what he did!

499
00:27:39,543 --> 00:27:41,262
It's probably all over the internet.

500
00:27:41,263 --> 00:27:42,862
People must be having fun gossiping

501
00:27:44,503 --> 00:27:46,062
I really don't understand

502
00:27:46,463 --> 00:27:48,422
who would do this?

503
00:27:48,823 --> 00:27:50,542
Must be people with bad intentions

504
00:27:50,903 --> 00:27:53,062
to the point of hurting Kula chart to this extent.

505
00:27:53,663 --> 00:27:54,582
Yeah!

506
00:27:55,063 --> 00:27:56,822
People with good intentions wouldn't do this.

507
00:27:57,343 --> 00:27:58,502
You too.

508
00:27:58,783 --> 00:28:00,742
I trusted you to take care of him!

509
00:28:01,383 --> 00:28:02,462
So careless!

510
00:28:03,983 --> 00:28:05,342
I'm really sorry.

511
00:28:06,183 --> 00:28:08,102
J assure you this won't happen again.

512
00:28:08,663 --> 00:28:10,582
Go make this news go away as quietly as possible

513
00:28:11,343 --> 00:28:13,102
Leak some other celebrity news

514
00:28:14,343 --> 00:28:15,862
You know how to do it.

515
00:28:17,343 --> 00:28:17,782
Sure.

516
00:28:26,383 --> 00:28:27,942
Are you meeting the chairman?

517
00:28:30,503 --> 00:28:31,782
Pat is my people.

518
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:33,102
You can leave now

519
00:28:47,023 --> 00:28:50,262
I'm dealing with the villagers who are refusing to sell their lands

520
00:28:50,863 --> 00:28:52,142
Only a few plots of land left

521
00:28:52,743 --> 00:28:54,782
If subtle doesn't work, strong measures will have to be used!

522
00:28:57,823 --> 00:28:59,902
I didn't call you here for that.

523
00:29:01,743 --> 00:29:04,182
I have a bad feeling about something.

524
00:29:05,983 --> 00:29:09,142
Are you sure you cleaned up all the evidence from that rental house?

525
00:29:09,943 --> 00:29:10,742
Rental house?

526
00:29:11,863 --> 00:29:14,062
When we took care of Dr.Wor.

527
00:29:15,303 --> 00:29:16,622
Gosh, Boss.

528
00:29:17,223 --> 00:29:18,942
That was years ago

529
00:29:19,103 --> 00:29:20,302
It's probably nothing left

530
00:29:21,663 --> 00:29:23,302
But the statute of limitations has not expired

531
00:29:24,183 --> 00:29:25,102
If his family gets crazy

532
00:29:25,823 --> 00:29:27,542
and reopens the case, then what?

533
00:29:29,543 --> 00:29:30,302
Then...

534
00:29:30,623 --> 00:29:31,902
you can rest assure.

535
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:35,782
Dr.Wor left behind a wife and has no other extended family

536
00:29:36,183 --> 00:29:38,742
His wife just had a heart attack and died

537
00:29:39,663 --> 00:29:42,022
Someone informed me yesterday

538
00:29:45,063 --> 00:29:45,982
Oh really?

539
00:29:46,943 --> 00:29:48,022
That's a relief.

540
00:29:49,583 --> 00:29:50,822
There are only a few months left

541
00:29:50,943 --> 00:29:52,782
before the will is due.

542
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:54,382
I think

543
00:29:54,863 --> 00:29:56,502
you should prepare to celebrate.

544
00:30:02,423 --> 00:30:03,302
Let'sstart with the towel

545
00:30:05,143 --> 00:30:05,982
Spread it.

546
00:30:09,143 --> 00:30:09,822
Hold here.

547
00:30:10,023 --> 00:30:10,502
Yeah.

548
00:30:10,663 --> 00:30:11,742
Then place it here.

549
00:30:12,983 --> 00:30:14,022
Nicely.

550
00:30:15,863 --> 00:30:16,462
Good.

551
00:30:43,103 --> 00:30:45,142
Let's find animals now. There's eight.

552
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:46,062
They're...

553
00:30:46,823 --> 00:30:48,182
vertical and horizontal

554
00:30:48,663 --> 00:30:49,262
Okay?

555
00:30:49,983 --> 00:30:51,062
Eight?

556
00:30:51,823 --> 00:30:53,542
It's easy, You're smart.

557
00:30:54,743 --> 00:30:56,022
I'll help you.

558
00:30:59,783 --> 00:31:00,302
There!

559
00:31:00,543 --> 00:31:01,742
I got the first word

560
00:31:02,983 --> 00:31:04,302
Rab...bit.

561
00:31:04,903 --> 00:31:06,022
Wow!

562
00:31:06,143 --> 00:31:07,302
Faster than me.

563
00:31:10,143 --> 00:31:10,502
You were too slow.

564
00:31:13,343 --> 00:31:14,102
There.

565
00:31:14,503 --> 00:31:16,782
H-O-R-S-E

566
00:31:18,103 --> 00:31:19,142
Ho...

567
00:31:20,663 --> 00:31:21,342
Horse!

568
00:31:21,583 --> 00:31:23,022
Yeah, you're right.

569
00:31:23,023 --> 00:31:24,102
