1
00:00:09,303 --> 00:00:11,662
You took your brother to do porn.

2
00:00:12,703 --> 00:00:14,542
Let's see who will be in jail longer.

3
00:00:14,783 --> 00:00:16,182
I'll give you guys 50,000.

4
00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:18,782
But from now on,

5
00:00:19,943 --> 00:00:22,142
don't mess with Tia n everagain.

6
00:00:22,343 --> 00:00:24,062
Taks as ut'sheir

7
00:00:26,543 --> 00:00:28,342
isn't Kula chart.

8
00:00:32,023 --> 00:00:33,702
But it's that kid.

9
00:00:33,863 --> 00:00:35,262
What the hell are you talking about?

10
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:36,902
The funeral will be a private one.

11
00:00:37,743 --> 00:00:39,102
One day vigil then cremation.

12
00:00:39,983 --> 00:00:40,502
Okay,

13
00:00:40,863 --> 00:00:42,742
If I want to get revenge for Th on,

14
00:00:44,103 --> 00:00:45,022
will you help me?

15
00:00:45,703 --> 00:00:47,382
Tam indebted to you.

16
00:00:47,903 --> 00:00:49,782
Whatever you tell me to do,

17
00:00:50,063 --> 00:00:51,102
I will do it.

18
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:57,942
What do you need Dad?

19
00:00:58,183 --> 00:00:59,582
You had me come see you so early.

20
00:01:01,023 --> 00:01:03,262
Knock before you come `in next'time

21
00:01:05,463 --> 00:01:06,622
Gosh Dad.

22
00:01:06,783 --> 00:01:08,262
Why be so formal?

23
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:11,902
It's fortunate that I'm able to wake up so early to come see you

24
00:01:13,703 --> 00:01:15,062
I have something for you to do.

25
00:01:15,543 --> 00:01:17,222
But you need to do it well!

26
00:01:17,543 --> 00:01:18,862
It's for your future.

27
00:01:19,743 --> 00:01:20,382
Wow!

28
00:01:20,903 --> 00:01:22,622
You want me to take over the company for you?

29
00:01:23,263 --> 00:01:24,062
You're going to resign?

30
00:01:24,143 --> 00:01:25,222
Early r retirement?

31
00:01:25,623 --> 00:01:26,622
That's great!

32
00:01:26,703 --> 00:01:27,982
Since this is happening

33
00:01:28,183 --> 00:01:31,902
I'd like at least three hot secretaries

34
00:01:32,983 --> 00:01:35,982
I'd like their bodies to be like this...

35
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:37,382
Chart!

36
00:01:37,783 --> 00:01:39,382
You really want a kick, don't you?!

37
00:01:39,383 --> 00:01:40,022
Dad!

38
00:01:44,023 --> 00:01:46,142
I've contacted the school already,(sir!

39
00:01:46,183 --> 00:01:46,782
Good.

40
00:01:46,943 --> 00:01:48,102
Drag him away.

41
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:49,662
Wait!

42
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:51,102
Where do you want me to go?

43
00:01:51,263 --> 00:01:52,462
Language school

44
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:54,622
You need to know how to speak English, got it?

45
00:01:54,703 --> 00:01:56,942
oh Dad,just English?

46
00:01:57,383 --> 00:01:58,662
t's'cliche.

47
00:01:58,783 --> 00:01:59,742
Take him out!

48
00:02:00,183 --> 00:02:00,822
Wait!

49
00:02:01,023 --> 00:02:01,902
I don't want to learn!

50
00:02:02,063 --> 00:02:03,302
I'm smart already!

51
00:02:03,783 --> 00:02:04,622
" Nu eng " is one.

52
00:02:04,903 --> 00:02:05,422
" Song " is two!

53
00:02:05,423 --> 00:02:06,142
Napa.

54
00:02:06,223 --> 00:02:07,782
You have my permission to be in charge of him

55
00:02:08,183 --> 00:02:09,022
Noted.

56
00:02:11,823 --> 00:02:12,862
What thehell?!

57
00:02:13,863 --> 00:02:14,582
Go!

58
00:02:15,463 --> 00:02:16,062
What the hell?

59
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:22,702
Your documents and ID is all in here.

60
00:02:23,103 --> 00:02:25,142
Stay focus in school.

61
00:02:25,703 --> 00:02:26,782
Gosh sis.

62
00:02:27,223 --> 00:02:28,742
Can I learn art instead?

63
00:02:28,823 --> 00:02:29,942
I like drawing.

64
00:02:30,623 --> 00:02:32,102
Did you not hear what your father said?

65
00:02:32,823 --> 00:02:34,582
I am in charge of you

66
00:02:35,103 --> 00:02:36,342
You want to give me orders?!

67
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:37,782
I'm Kula chart!

68
00:02:37,863 --> 00:02:39,582
The future executive!

69
00:02:39,943 --> 00:02:40,862
Either you walk inside willingly

70
00:02:41,023 --> 00:02:42,502
or walk inside handicapped.

71
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:44,182
Hmm?

72
00:02:57,743 --> 00:02:58,862
How are you?

73
00:03:01,823 --> 00:03:03,102
Are you...

74
00:03:04,503 --> 00:03:05,382
Oh!

75
00:03:05,783 --> 00:03:07,222
Are you...

76
00:03:08,303 --> 00:03:10,662
Are you Sathorn.

77
00:03:14,303 --> 00:03:14,982
What's so funny?

78
00:03:15,023 --> 00:03:16,702
You got a problem?!

79
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:26,262
Good afternoon, teacher.

80
00:03:27,303 --> 00:03:28,382
Hello everyone

81
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,702
Today we will be having a new student joining our class.

82
00:03:32,383 --> 00:03:33,022
Kula chart

83
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:34,902
Please introduce yourself

84
00:03:35,103 --> 00:03:37,102
so everyone can know more about you

85
00:03:39,463 --> 00:03:40,342
Yes.

86
00:03:46,023 --> 00:03:46,782
Well.

87
00:03:47,063 --> 00:03:48,462
Speak English please

88
00:03:51,503 --> 00:03:52,942
What the...

89
00:03:59,223 --> 00:04:01,102
You ire no longer in pain Thon.

90
00:04:03,103 --> 00:04:04,182
After this is over,

91
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:06,622
my job here is done

92
00:04:07,343 --> 00:04:08,942
Throughout the past.

93
00:04:10,303 --> 00:04:12,142
I'm so grateful to you Mr. Rome.

94
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:13,062
nin

95
00:04:15,063 --> 00:04:15,862
It's me

96
00:04:16,983 --> 00:04:18,062
that has to thank you.

97
00:04:20,023 --> 00:04:21,022
Without you,

98
00:04:21,943 --> 00:04:24,382
Thon wouldn't have lived this long

99
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,462
With Mr. Thon,

100
00:04:28,943 --> 00:04:31,022
I felt like he was a close relative.

101
00:04:31,903 --> 00:04:34,422
I never felt like I came to work

102
00:04:35,663 --> 00:04:37,422
I always felt I was spending time with my family.

103
00:04:40,623 --> 00:04:41,942
Thank you Mr. Rome.

104
00:04:43,023 --> 00:04:44,822
I'll be leaving tomorrow

105
00:04:52,703 --> 00:04:54,782
I regret having Ms. Thip leave

106
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:57,382
In addition to taking care of Thon

107
00:04:58,063 --> 00:05:00,022
she also looked after the house.

108
00:05:00,503 --> 00:05:01,982
Tai already quit

109
00:05:02,063 --> 00:05:03,382
Who will do it now?

110
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,102
It's a big house.

111
00:05:09,303 --> 00:05:10,982
I can do house chores.

112
00:05:11,743 --> 00:05:14,102
I can wash clothes, mop the floor,

113
00:05:14,343 --> 00:05:16,782
or whatever you want me to do.

114
00:05:17,543 --> 00:05:18,742
I will have you work.

115
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:21,062
But not the things you said!

116
00:05:23,103 --> 00:05:24,942
I need a strong team for this job.

117
00:05:26,023 --> 00:05:27,022
Including you and Pao.

118
00:05:35,023 --> 00:05:36,502
What job?

119
00:05:40,063 --> 00:05:40,902
I don't know.

120
00:05:42,223 --> 00:05:43,982
Are they not going to beg me to stay?

121
00:05:45,383 --> 00:05:46,102
Ms. Thip.

122
00:05:49,823 --> 00:05:50,942
Yes Mr Rome?

123
00:05:51,903 --> 00:05:53,622
If you don't have a new job anywhere else

124
00:05:54,743 --> 00:05:56,822
can you stay and work for me for a while?

125
00:05:58,903 --> 00:06:00,542
There's no patient at the house anymore.

126
00:06:01,943 --> 00:06:03,462
Or is someone sick?

127
00:06:03,903 --> 00:06:05,302
Are you okay?

128
00:06:05,623 --> 00:06:06,702
Everyone is fine.

129
00:06:08,103 --> 00:06:09,622
The person l want you to look after

130
00:06:10,063 --> 00:06:10,982
is fine too.

131
00:06:11,903 --> 00:06:12,822
Who is it?

132
00:06:14,143 --> 00:06:15,022
Dok tian.

133
00:06:20,503 --> 00:06:23,142
Why are you getting involved with this Tian kid?

134
00:06:23,223 --> 00:06:24,382
What's going on?

135
00:06:26,823 --> 00:06:28,662
I want to find out the truth

136
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:30,662
What truth?

137
00:06:33,623 --> 00:06:35,022
Before Thon died

138
00:06:35,783 --> 00:06:36,942
he told me

139
00:06:38,063 --> 00:06:40,342
Tian is probably Ka mol tat's child!

140
00:06:41,103 --> 00:06:42,102
What?

141
00:06:43,263 --> 00:06:45,302
Ka mol tat's child is a boy, no?

142
00:06:45,703 --> 00:06:47,222
If what Thon said is true

143
00:06:47,983 --> 00:06:49,222
that kid is a poser.

144
00:06:51,823 --> 00:06:52,422
Oh.

145
00:06:53,303 --> 00:06:54,982
Don't look at me.

146
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:59,222
I'm now just finding out the truth with you

147
00:07:00,743 --> 00:07:02,302
I didn't believe it at first

148
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:06,902
But that kid has the ring necklace of the Taks as ut family

149
00:07:08,783 --> 00:07:10,782
Does the kid have a birthmark?

150
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:12,982
This isn't a joke Pa

151
00:07:14,823 --> 00:07:17,302
If what I think is true,

152
00:07:17,743 --> 00:07:19,102
then it's my job

153
00:07:19,503 --> 00:07:22,302
to seek justice for the real heir of Taks as ut.

154
00:07:24,063 --> 00:07:25,902
It was Thon's last wish before he died

155
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:53,142
Give it back to me!

156
00:07:53,863 --> 00:07:54,862
Gosh!

157
00:07:55,023 --> 00:07:55,782
Kula chart.

158
00:07:56,263 --> 00:07:57,742
Why did you slap James's head?

159
00:07:58,623 --> 00:07:59,982
I not do!

160
00:08:00,983 --> 00:08:02,462
I did not do it.

161
00:08:02,943 --> 00:08:04,102
He told me

162
00:08:04,143 --> 00:08:06,782
he was going to do business with me like adults.

163
00:08:07,343 --> 00:08:10,342
I take the money while he takes my work.

164
00:08:11,463 --> 00:08:12,582
Teacher.

165
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:14,382
He's lying. Don't listen to him.

166
00:08:14,983 --> 00:08:15,782
That's not true.

167
00:08:15,823 --> 00:08:17,702
He did the same to me earlier.

168
00:08:17,703 --> 00:08:19,622
Trying to cheat off a kid. How shameless.

169
00:08:22,383 --> 00:08:23,582
You brat!

170
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:24,582
Stop!

171
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,462
What are you doing?

172
00:08:31,623 --> 00:08:34,382
To punish you for cheating off your classmate's homework

173
00:08:34,503 --> 00:08:36,822
you must recite the ABCs a hundred times.

174
00:08:38,063 --> 00:08:38,822
Sure.

175
00:08:39,303 --> 00:08:40,582
Hey! Are you insane?!

176
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:41,582
I'm not a child!

177
00:08:42,943 --> 00:08:43,582
In that case,

178
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:44,982
two hundred times :

179
00:08:45,103 --> 00:08:45,902
I won't do it!

180
00:08:49,183 --> 00:08:51,022
Are there no cabs around here?!

181
00:08:51,223 --> 00:08:51,862
There is.

182
00:08:51,863 --> 00:08:54,462
But you won't be taking the cab home, Mr, Kula chart.

183
00:08:54,503 --> 00:08:55,302
Woman!

184
00:08:56,383 --> 00:08:58,702
Will you walk back inside or you wanna be carried?

185
00:09:01,783 --> 00:09:02,862
A...

186
00:09:03,263 --> 00:09:04,382
B

187
00:09:07,143 --> 00:09:08,542
D..

188
00:09:09,743 --> 00:09:10,502
B...

189
00:09:26,383 --> 00:09:27,302
K

190
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:35,382
N...

191
00:09:41,023 --> 00:09:42,662
I'll pick you up same time tomorrow.

192
00:09:44,063 --> 00:09:44,942
I won't go!

193
00:09:45,943 --> 00:09:47,022
Are you sure?

194
00:09:47,463 --> 00:09:48,422
I'm telling Mom

195
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:49,742
that you're Dad's mistress.

196
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,782
Thank you so much.

197
00:09:51,423 --> 00:09:53,542
I've wanted Mr s, P itplern to know for a long time now.

198
00:09:54,183 --> 00:09:54,742
Go!

199
00:09:55,183 --> 00:09:56,142
Go tell her right now.

200
00:09:56,783 --> 00:09:58,542
I'll finally become the madam of this house.

201
00:09:59,143 --> 00:09:59,702
Crazy bitch!

202
00:10:00,223 --> 00:10:01,662
Is your face made out of concrete?!

203
00:10:01,703 --> 00:10:02,462
So thick!

204
00:10:02,863 --> 00:10:05,062
I think we should stop being enemies

205
00:10:05,223 --> 00:10:07,262
With the person trying to be my new mom?!

206
00:10:07,663 --> 00:10:08,462
Are you insane?!

207
00:10:08,863 --> 00:10:11,302
If we agree to be allies,

208
00:10:11,623 --> 00:10:15,062
I will tell you how to live in this house comfortably.

209
00:10:15,503 --> 00:10:17,342
Your father won't bother you either.

210
00:10:17,863 --> 00:10:18,502
What do you say?

211
00:10:20,943 --> 00:10:21,822
What's your method?

212
00:10:50,743 --> 00:10:51,062
TIONARY

213
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:57,022
Hello Father.

214
00:11:11,343 --> 00:11:13,422
Do you see anything unusual?

215
00:11:15,503 --> 00:11:16,382
What?

216
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:18,782
Chart.

217
00:11:19,063 --> 00:11:20,902
He's suddenly being diligent.

218
00:11:20,943 --> 00:11:22,862
I just saw him reading a book

219
00:11:23,503 --> 00:11:24,662
That's good

220
00:11:25,023 --> 00:11:26,182
He's doing good

221
00:11:26,423 --> 00:11:27,822
and that's good for him

222
00:11:28,663 --> 00:11:29,262
Hey!

223
00:11:29,503 --> 00:11:32,502
You're not curious as to why he's changed?

224
00:11:33,143 --> 00:11:35,142
What motivated him or

225
00:11:35,423 --> 00:11:37,622
what evil spirit possessed him?

226
00:11:39,143 --> 00:11:40,662
I really don't know.

227
00:11:41,103 --> 00:11:42,942
He probably has his reason

228
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:45,622
That's just great.

229
00:11:45,743 --> 00:11:48,542
Seriously, what do you know around here?

230
00:11:48,703 --> 00:11:50,142
Are you blind and deaf?

231
00:11:52,103 --> 00:11:52,942
It's great

232
00:11:53,543 --> 00:11:55,782
that people know how to mind their own business

233
00:11:58,063 --> 00:11:58,982
As for me,

234
00:12:00,103 --> 00:12:01,902
if l don't pretend to be blind or deaf,

235
00:12:02,623 --> 00:12:04,582
I wouldn't have survived til this day.

236
00:12:05,943 --> 00:12:07,182
Listen carefully to me

237
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,582
I'm strict on him

238
00:12:09,903 --> 00:12:11,022
because l want what's best for him

239
00:12:11,423 --> 00:12:13,702
I want him to be the Kula chart, worthy of being our son.

240
00:12:14,783 --> 00:12:17,502
Instead of praising him,you're acting like you didn't see anything

241
00:12:25,063 --> 00:12:26,222
Man Uversus Juve?

242
00:12:27,023 --> 00:12:28,022
Half already?

243
00:12:29,463 --> 00:12:30,942
Let's bet20,000.

244
00:12:39,063 --> 00:12:40,502
I'll help you Ms. Thip.

245
00:12:41,983 --> 00:12:42,862
Don't bother!

246
00:12:43,543 --> 00:12:46,142
I'm making breakfast for Mr, Rome right now.

247
00:12:46,823 --> 00:12:47,822
Do you know it?

248
00:12:47,983 --> 00:12:48,862
Breakfast.

249
00:12:51,023 --> 00:12:54,822
I used to be a waiter at a restaurant and l would be the cook'sassistant too

250
00:12:55,143 --> 00:12:58,782
I can make those sunnyside up and omelets too

251
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,022
But it's my job

252
00:13:01,303 --> 00:13:02,662
to take care of him.

253
00:13:03,343 --> 00:13:04,102
Do you know

254
00:13:04,223 --> 00:13:05,582
what Mr Rome likes

255
00:13:05,823 --> 00:13:07,142
and what he doesn't like?

256
00:13:08,343 --> 00:13:09,582
I don't know.

257
00:13:09,783 --> 00:13:10,942
Then don't meddle

258
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:12,142
Go wait outside.

259
00:13:12,543 --> 00:13:13,822
If I need you for something,

260
00:13:13,983 --> 00:13:15,342
I'll call you.

261
00:13:17,423 --> 00:13:17,902
Okay.

262
00:13:33,503 --> 00:13:35,582
You have to eat something Mr Rome.

263
00:13:36,183 --> 00:13:38,182
Don't let Mr. Thon be worried

264
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,022
For the past years

265
00:13:45,023 --> 00:13:47,142
I have to go watch Thon eat breakfast everyday

266
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:48,862
Before I head to work

267
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,062
Now that he's gone,

268
00:13:51,423 --> 00:13:52,942
I feel lost

269
00:13:54,383 --> 00:13:55,742
I understand

270
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:59,262
Im sad about it too

271
00:14:01,303 --> 00:14:02,742
Why don't you join me?

272
00:14:07,063 --> 00:14:08,502
That's okay.

273
00:14:08,543 --> 00:14:09,582
Thank you.

274
00:14:15,343 --> 00:14:16,462
Where's Tian?

275
00:14:19,063 --> 00:14:21,382
I prepared her food in the kitchen already.

276
00:14:21,663 --> 00:14:22,702
But right now,

277
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:24,662
I had her go water the plants.

278
00:14:36,143 --> 00:14:37,022
Tian, come here.

279
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:38,062
Wait Boss

280
00:14:38,103 --> 00:14:39,702
I'm not done watering the plant.

281
00:14:40,503 --> 00:14:42,662
Don't do things l didn't tell you to do

282
00:14:43,663 --> 00:14:44,582
But...

283
00:14:47,943 --> 00:14:48,662
Ms. Thip.

284
00:14:49,463 --> 00:14:50,942
These jobs aren't Tian's duty

285
00:14:52,143 --> 00:14:54,302
But you told me to train her.

286
00:14:54,743 --> 00:14:56,182
If not house chores

287
00:14:56,303 --> 00:14:57,782
then what do you want her to do?

288
00:14:58,103 --> 00:15:00,382
I'm having you be her nanny

289
00:15:02,343 --> 00:15:03,702
As for the maids'duty

290
00:15:04,223 --> 00:15:05,102
or gardener,

291
00:15:05,903 --> 00:15:06,862
I hired them already

292
00:15:08,823 --> 00:15:09,662
Boss.

293
00:15:11,223 --> 00:15:12,982
This is Je ab,my niece

294
00:15:13,023 --> 00:15:14,502
You wanted her to be the maid

295
00:15:16,543 --> 00:15:17,142
Je ab.

296
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:19,262
Greet Boss and Ms. Thip.

297
00:15:20,143 --> 00:15:22,822
Hello Boss.

298
00:15:26,663 --> 00:15:28,102
Thank s, Cherm

299
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:31,462
Work hard and don't humiliate me.

300
00:15:31,863 --> 00:15:32,702
Yes, Uncle.

301
00:15:35,863 --> 00:15:38,942
Is this young boy you two's son?

302
00:15:40,303 --> 00:15:41,142
This is Dok tian.

303
00:15:42,063 --> 00:15:42,902
She's a girl.

304
00:15:43,783 --> 00:15:45,302
Your other boss

305
00:15:46,263 --> 00:15:47,062
As for Ms, T hip

306
00:15:48,663 --> 00:15:49,902
she's not my wife

307
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,702
But a housekeeper

308
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:53,702
She's in charge of housekeeping.

309
00:15:55,303 --> 00:15:55,982
Ms. Thip.

310
00:15:56,063 --> 00:15:56,542
Yes?

311
00:15:57,023 --> 00:15:58,302
Can you train Je ab?

312
00:16:00,703 --> 00:16:01,542
You.

313
00:16:02,783 --> 00:16:03,862
Go shower and get dressed

314
00:16:04,383 --> 00:16:05,622
Someone will come and pick you up

315
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:08,862
Who will pick me up?

316
00:16:10,463 --> 00:16:11,262
You'll know soon.

317
00:16:18,783 --> 00:16:21,462
Miss Dok tian is Boss's wife?

318
00:16:21,783 --> 00:16:22,702
No!

319
00:16:22,863 --> 00:16:24,462
Watch what you're saying

320
00:16:25,703 --> 00:16:26,302
Come in!

321
00:16:32,223 --> 00:16:33,542
must be a tomboy type.

322
00:16:34,903 --> 00:16:36,142
Anything is fine.

323
00:16:36,183 --> 00:16:38,342
Just make her look more like a celebrity.

324
00:16:38,383 --> 00:16:39,622
Rome will pay you.

325
00:16:39,983 --> 00:16:40,542
Okay.

326
00:16:40,543 --> 00:16:41,182
In that case,

327
00:16:41,463 --> 00:16:43,622
I will go all out!

328
00:16:43,823 --> 00:16:45,982
I'll make her look fabulous and perfect!

329
00:16:46,503 --> 00:16:46,942
Come.

330
00:16:46,943 --> 00:16:48,302
Let's check out the designs together.

331
00:16:54,343 --> 00:16:55,062
This look..

332
00:16:55,103 --> 00:16:57,302
it's good but.

333
00:16:57,423 --> 00:16:58,342
it's too sophisticated

334
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:01,622
How about this style?

335
00:17:03,983 --> 00:17:05,022
That's good.

336
00:17:05,543 --> 00:17:06,702
Okay, you got it.

337
00:17:06,903 --> 00:17:07,622
Tian.

338
00:17:19,703 --> 00:17:21,782
I can't wear a dress Mom will scold me

339
00:17:21,823 --> 00:17:23,902
But we're playing mother and daughter right now

340
00:17:24,023 --> 00:17:26,502
You're my daughter so you must listen to me.

341
00:17:27,743 --> 00:17:28,422
Tian.

342
00:17:30,863 --> 00:17:31,422
Take that!

343
00:17:31,543 --> 00:17:33,342
You won't listen to me?!

344
00:17:33,703 --> 00:17:34,222
Huh?!

345
00:17:35,303 --> 00:17:36,622
I told you already

346
00:17:36,783 --> 00:17:38,822
not to dress like a girl!!

347
00:17:39,103 --> 00:17:40,502
Do you wanna die?!

348
00:17:40,543 --> 00:17:42,342
You won't listen to me?!

349
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:44,102
Thom ya!

350
00:17:44,143 --> 00:17:45,382
That's enough!

351
00:17:45,543 --> 00:17:46,302
Give me that!

352
00:17:47,343 --> 00:17:48,822
Are you gonna hit him until he bleeds?

353
00:17:49,223 --> 00:17:50,262
Talk nicely to him.

354
00:17:50,543 --> 00:17:51,622
He's still a child!

355
00:17:51,903 --> 00:17:52,702
I can't!

356
00:17:53,063 --> 00:17:55,022
This is a life death situation!

357
00:17:55,383 --> 00:17:57,862
You already know why we had to move here!

358
00:17:58,143 --> 00:17:58,862
Yeah!

359
00:17:59,783 --> 00:18:00,862
It's my fault!

360
00:18:01,063 --> 00:18:02,422
I shouldn't have been greedy with the money.

361
00:18:03,263 --> 00:18:05,902
Or else we won't have to move out here

362
00:18:07,383 --> 00:18:08,062
Tian

363
00:18:08,863 --> 00:18:10,462
Remember my words

364
00:18:10,743 --> 00:18:12,342
From now on,

365
00:18:12,983 --> 00:18:14,422
do not dress like a girl!

366
00:18:14,463 --> 00:18:15,502
Understood?!

367
00:18:16,383 --> 00:18:17,062
Tian.

368
00:18:20,983 --> 00:18:21,662
11

369
00:18:21,743 --> 00:18:22,422
Tian.

370
00:18:26,663 --> 00:18:27,902
You want to wear that dress?

371
00:18:29,063 --> 00:18:29,782
No.

372
00:18:30,063 --> 00:18:31,302
I don't like it.

373
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:34,382
But eyes don't lie.

374
00:18:34,943 --> 00:18:36,382
You want to wear this dress.

375
00:18:36,823 --> 00:18:37,262
know

376
00:18:38,823 --> 00:18:40,102
I can't wear it.

377
00:18:40,663 --> 00:18:42,822
Mom told me not to wear something like this.

378
00:18:43,543 --> 00:18:45,662
Gosh,you poor thing.

379
00:18:46,263 --> 00:18:49,062
Seeing you reminds me when I had short hair.

380
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,982
At that time

381
00:18:51,303 --> 00:18:53,022
I secretly wore my mother'sdress.

382
00:18:53,703 --> 00:18:55,502
Dad whipped me with the stick.

383
00:18:56,263 --> 00:18:58,382
I was scared to dress like a girl after that

384
00:18:59,623 --> 00:19:01,822
So why are you now...

385
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:04,422
I im just being true to myself.

386
00:19:05,423 --> 00:19:08,022
If I can't do this small little thing,

387
00:19:08,703 --> 00:19:11,062
how can I be happy in life?

388
00:19:11,903 --> 00:19:12,742
Therefore,

389
00:19:13,223 --> 00:19:15,702
I don't care.

390
00:19:16,303 --> 00:19:18,942
Whatever you wanna do, just go for it

391
00:19:25,903 --> 00:19:26,662
Pa.

392
00:19:28,463 --> 00:19:29,542
I thought you weren't coming?

393
00:19:30,183 --> 00:19:31,422
I finished early

394
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:32,422
Sol stopped by

395
00:19:32,623 --> 00:19:33,462
What about you?

396
00:19:33,623 --> 00:19:34,822
How's it going here?

397
00:19:35,903 --> 00:19:37,022
It's going alright.

398
00:19:38,663 --> 00:19:44,102
Please meet with Miss Dok tian from Ranong!

399
00:20:05,463 --> 00:20:07,502
Come over here so Rome can take a closer look at you.

400
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:11,822
200
250

401
00:20:28,103 --> 00:20:29,102
I'm sorry.

402
00:20:54,103 --> 00:20:54,822
Hey.

403
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:56,782
What did you do to Tian?

404
00:20:58,463 --> 00:21:00,742
I was just following your orders.

405
00:21:01,023 --> 00:21:02,462
Change her look and style

406
00:21:02,743 --> 00:21:03,422
Well?

407
00:21:03,663 --> 00:21:04,382
Is she pretty?

408
00:21:05,983 --> 00:21:06,862
Rome

409
00:21:07,343 --> 00:21:09,582
Tian may look like a boy on the outside

410
00:21:09,703 --> 00:21:11,262
but she'sa girl inside.

411
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:14,342
The caterpillar is now a butterfly.

412
00:21:17,623 --> 00:21:20,102
When Tian is dressed like a girl.

413
00:21:20,303 --> 00:21:21,782
she looks cute and pretty.

414
00:21:22,023 --> 00:21:23,942
Worthy of being a millionaire'sdaughter

415
00:21:24,623 --> 00:21:25,302
Pa.

416
00:21:26,263 --> 00:21:28,342
Don't go saying that to anyone.

417
00:21:29,543 --> 00:21:30,902
t has to be a secret

418
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:32,142
Especially with Tian.

419
00:21:32,943 --> 00:21:34,422
She can't know about this.

420
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:36,782
As long as the truth

421
00:21:37,223 --> 00:21:38,342
hasn't been proven.

422
00:21:41,103 --> 00:21:41,582
Okay.

423
00:21:45,903 --> 00:21:46,662
Mom.

424
00:21:51,663 --> 00:21:52,662
What is it son?

425
00:21:53,063 --> 00:21:54,782
I finished reading the dictionary.

426
00:21:55,103 --> 00:21:56,662
I want to take online classes.

427
00:21:57,503 --> 00:21:58,222
But...

428
00:21:58,903 --> 00:22:02,102
the cost for online classes and a private tutor is..

429
00:22:02,623 --> 00:22:03,382
very expensive.

430
00:22:04,903 --> 00:22:06,142
How much?

431
00:22:07,143 --> 00:22:09,302
I'll wire them the money.

432
00:22:09,903 --> 00:22:11,502
You can wire it to my account.

433
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:13,382
I'll take it from there.

434
00:22:15,103 --> 00:22:15,982
Chart.

435
00:22:16,863 --> 00:22:18,502
You're not lying to me, are you?

436
00:22:26,343 --> 00:22:27,702
I'm sitting before Buddha,

437
00:22:27,703 --> 00:22:28,662
I wouldn't dare.

438
00:22:29,303 --> 00:22:31,622
I swear I will study hard

439
00:22:31,743 --> 00:22:33,302
and won't disappoint you and Dad.

440
00:22:37,543 --> 00:22:39,702
I got money to bet now!

441
00:22:40,663 --> 00:22:44,982
This money is for the benefit of education and sports Mom

442
00:22:54,983 --> 00:22:55,782
Hey.

443
00:22:55,983 --> 00:22:56,822
What's up?

444
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,702
You're not gonna bet for tonight?

445
00:22:59,903 --> 00:23:03,382
I'm waiting for you to wire the money to my website right now.

446
00:23:03,743 --> 00:23:05,182
I won't bet on your site anymore.

447
00:23:05,423 --> 00:23:06,542
I always lose.

448
00:23:07,223 --> 00:23:09,102
Hey wait hold on!

449
00:23:09,263 --> 00:23:11,262
Jeez!

450
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:13,782
What does losing

451
00:23:14,023 --> 00:23:15,742
have anything to do with my website?

452
00:23:16,223 --> 00:23:16,742
Huh?

453
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:18,742
How about this?

454
00:23:18,743 --> 00:23:21,222
If'you wire the money right now,

455
00:23:21,503 --> 00:23:23,542
I will add more money for you.

456
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:25,062
40 percent increase!

457
00:23:25,383 --> 00:23:26,342
Really?

458
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:28,142
If ladd)10,000, I get another 4,000?

459
00:23:28,383 --> 00:23:29,582
Yeah!

460
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:31,542
Wire it.

461
00:23:32,263 --> 00:23:32,982
Bro.

462
00:23:33,823 --> 00:23:35,102
If I don't take the money

463
00:23:35,503 --> 00:23:36,582
but instead...

464
00:23:37,143 --> 00:23:38,462
you help me with something.

465
00:23:52,663 --> 00:23:53,462
It's him.

466
00:23:54,063 --> 00:23:54,662
Hey.

467
00:23:54,703 --> 00:23:55,822
Don't hurt me.

468
00:23:55,983 --> 00:23:57,342
Just take whatever you want.

470
00:24:22,623 --> 00:24:23,262
Let's go.

471
00:24:26,623 --> 00:24:29,422
This here is the prettiest one in our shop.

472
00:24:32,383 --> 00:24:33,102
Do you like it Tian?

473
00:24:33,863 --> 00:24:34,702
I do.

474
00:24:35,663 --> 00:24:36,662
I'll take it.

475
00:24:38,023 --> 00:24:39,262
Do you want me to put it on her?

476
00:24:39,463 --> 00:24:40,382
I'll do it.

477
00:24:43,663 --> 00:24:44,862
From now on,

478
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:47,982
you must always wear this pearl necklace.

479
00:24:48,903 --> 00:24:49,582
Oh gosh.

480
00:24:49,943 --> 00:24:52,662
No, it's too expensive.

481
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:55,262
Besides, I have the ring necklace already

482
00:24:56,503 --> 00:24:57,782
I'll keep that necklace

483
00:24:58,783 --> 00:25:00,342
safe for you.

484
00:25:02,663 --> 00:25:03,782
You can't.

485
00:25:04,423 --> 00:25:05,942
It's Mom's asset.

486
00:25:06,023 --> 00:25:07,742
I can't give it to you.

487
00:25:08,103 --> 00:25:09,942
So when you said you will listen to me,

488
00:25:11,183 --> 00:25:12,182
that was a lie then?

489
00:25:12,983 --> 00:25:14,462
I didn't lie.

490
00:25:14,663 --> 00:25:17,862
Besides my parents,you're the other person u respect the most.

491
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:19,942
Then can't you just do this favor

492
00:25:21,343 --> 00:25:22,182
for me?

493
00:25:55,383 --> 00:25:56,142
Pretty.

494
00:25:57,703 --> 00:25:58,582
It's suits you a lot.

495
00:26:01,623 --> 00:26:02,782
Thank you.

496
00:26:03,503 --> 00:26:03,982
Female.

497
00:26:06,863 --> 00:26:07,982
Say it with a female tone.

498
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:10,942
must not hear you speak using male tone again

499
00:26:11,983 --> 00:26:13,022
Understood?

500
00:26:18,583 --> 00:26:19,422
Yes.

501
00:26:21,303 --> 00:26:22,022
Good job

502
00:26:23,063 --> 00:26:23,742
Good kid

503
00:26:37,343 --> 00:26:37,862
Hey!

504
00:26:38,703 --> 00:26:39,582
That hurts!

505
00:26:39,703 --> 00:26:40,582
I'm sorry.

506
00:26:40,943 --> 00:26:42,342
My arm might be broken.

507
00:26:42,903 --> 00:26:44,622
You need to compensate.

508
00:26:45,383 --> 00:26:46,462
Compensate what?

509
00:26:46,743 --> 00:26:48,302
You bumped into me.

510
00:26:48,463 --> 00:26:49,422
Hey!

511
00:26:49,543 --> 00:26:50,742
What is that supposed to mean?!

512
00:26:51,583 --> 00:26:53,542
Let's go find a quiet place to talk

513
00:26:53,583 --> 00:26:54,022
Hey!

514
00:26:54,103 --> 00:26:55,022
Let go!

515
00:26:55,303 --> 00:26:56,822
Let go what?!

516
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:57,302
Let go!

517
00:26:57,383 --> 00:26:58,542
Come here.

518
00:26:58,983 --> 00:27:00,502
Let me go!

519
00:27:02,743 --> 00:27:04,702
Don't you bastards dare touch Pa!

520
00:27:04,903 --> 00:27:06,302
What did you do to my friend?!

521
00:27:08,943 --> 00:27:09,622
You!

522
00:27:12,183 --> 00:27:12,902
Don't!

523
00:27:16,063 --> 00:27:16,582
Tian!

524
00:27:16,903 --> 00:27:17,422
You!

525
00:27:24,023 --> 00:27:24,862
You two.

526
00:27:25,663 --> 00:27:26,782
If you don't want to go to jail ;

527
00:27:26,863 --> 00:27:27,902
don't harass women ever again.

528
00:27:27,943 --> 00:27:28,662
I'm sorry.

529
00:27:28,703 --> 00:27:30,182
- I'm sorry.
- I won't do it again.

530
00:27:30,223 --> 00:27:31,502
Let's go!

531
00:27:34,983 --> 00:27:35,662
Tian,

532
00:27:35,663 --> 00:27:37,102
It's okay Pa

533
00:27:55,543 --> 00:27:56,462
Boss.

534
00:27:56,943 --> 00:27:58,702
Are you mad at me?

535
00:27:58,783 --> 00:28:00,382
Why won't you talk to me?

536
00:28:06,463 --> 00:28:07,102
Next time,

537
00:28:08,423 --> 00:28:09,982
don't go fighting like that again.

538
00:28:12,943 --> 00:28:14,742
But Pa was getting attacked

539
00:28:15,023 --> 00:28:17,222
I don't like seeing women getting attacked either.

540
00:28:17,263 --> 00:28:18,342
You're also a woman.

541
00:28:18,783 --> 00:28:20,542
If this happens again, don't run towards it.

542
00:28:21,223 --> 00:28:22,782
Let the men handle it.

543
00:28:23,343 --> 00:28:24,262
But if l -

544
00:28:24,263 --> 00:28:25,302
This is an order!

545
00:28:29,423 --> 00:28:31,102
What's going on Mr. Rome?

546
00:28:36,583 --> 00:28:37,142
Ms. Thip

547
00:28:38,023 --> 00:28:39,142
Take Tian to get her wound cleaned up.

548
00:28:46,503 --> 00:28:47,622
Dok tian.

549
00:28:48,063 --> 00:28:49,582
Why are you dressed like a girl?

550
00:28:49,663 --> 00:28:51,622
Oh my god Tian!

551
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:53,422
Your debut is so grand!

552
00:28:53,463 --> 00:28:54,822
I love it!

553
00:29:00,623 --> 00:29:02,182
Don't over think it Tian.

554
00:29:02,663 --> 00:29:05,222
Rome is like this. He likes giving orders

555
00:29:05,743 --> 00:29:08,102
But he has good intentions and cares about you.

556
00:29:09,583 --> 00:29:10,702
Pa.

557
00:29:10,863 --> 00:29:12,862
He must be really mad at me

558
00:29:13,103 --> 00:29:15,942
Whatever l do, he doesn't seem to like it.

559
00:29:15,983 --> 00:29:17,462
That's not true.

560
00:29:17,663 --> 00:29:20,622
He wouldn't pay this much for your makeover.

561
00:29:20,703 --> 00:29:21,302
Right?

562
00:29:21,703 --> 00:29:23,302
The dress the necklace.

563
00:29:23,583 --> 00:29:26,822
Even he doesn't spoil me this much

564
00:29:34,503 --> 00:29:35,422
Yes Pao?

565
00:29:36,663 --> 00:29:37,342
Huh?!

566
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:39,582
Lak is at the hospital?

567
00:29:45,303 --> 00:29:45,982
Rome.

568
00:29:46,303 --> 00:29:46,902
Pa.

569
00:29:47,543 --> 00:29:48,542
How did you guys get here?

570
00:29:49,103 --> 00:29:50,342
We took a plane.

571
00:29:50,423 --> 00:29:52,302
It's one hour from Ranong to Bangkok

572
00:29:52,543 --> 00:29:55,062
Why didn't you tell us what happened to you?

573
00:29:55,103 --> 00:29:56,342
Good thing Pao told us.

574
00:29:58,343 --> 00:29:59,262
So,

575
00:30:00,823 --> 00:30:02,302
what dog bit you?

576
00:30:02,983 --> 00:30:04,622
I'm confused too.

577
00:30:05,063 --> 00:30:06,702
I don't have any enemies.

578
00:30:07,383 --> 00:30:09,302
They didn't even take my wallet.

579
00:30:09,543 --> 00:30:10,502
Did you file a report?

580
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:11,862
My friend did.

581
00:30:13,343 --> 00:30:14,102
Also,

582
00:30:14,543 --> 00:30:15,902
they finished questioning me too.

583
00:30:16,223 --> 00:30:19,102
The police think they got the wrong person

584
00:30:20,743 --> 00:30:22,982
Society is just getting worse everyday.

585
00:30:25,183 --> 00:30:26,222
What did the doctor say?

586
00:30:27,063 --> 00:30:28,742
I have to leave the cast on for a month

587
00:30:29,023 --> 00:30:30,582
I'll have to teach online for now.

588
00:30:31,223 --> 00:30:32,022
Don't teach anymore.

589
00:30:33,303 --> 00:30:34,422
Come back to Ranong with me

590
00:30:36,223 --> 00:30:37,862
I didn't even give my notice yet.

591
00:30:38,183 --> 00:30:39,342
I'm considerate of my friend

592
00:30:39,823 --> 00:30:40,942
Just let them fire you then

593
00:30:42,103 --> 00:30:43,742
have a new job for you

594
00:31:00,583 --> 00:31:01,302
Pretty.

595
00:31:02,743 --> 00:31:03,662
It suits you a lot.

596
00:31:07,863 --> 00:31:08,942
Thank you.

597
00:31:15,943 --> 00:31:17,942
Worthy of being a con artist.

598
00:31:20,183 --> 00:31:22,702
You must have tricked Mr, Rome into buying you expensive things.

599
00:31:26,703 --> 00:31:28,382
I'm not a con artist.

600
00:31:28,623 --> 00:31:30,662
I never tricked Boss either.

601
00:31:31,983 --> 00:31:33,702
The other day you were a boy.

602
00:31:33,903 --> 00:31:35,102
Now you're a girl.

603
00:31:35,663 --> 00:31:37,622
What normal person does that?

604
00:31:38,303 --> 00:31:40,382
I didn't want to be a boy.

605
00:31:42,303 --> 00:31:44,902
But no matter what I say, you won't understand.

606
00:31:45,583 --> 00:31:46,622
Then what do you wanna be?

607
00:31:47,863 --> 00:31:49,222
The boss lady

608
00:31:49,463 --> 00:31:50,622
of the house,

609
00:31:51,223 --> 00:31:52,382
Dok tian?

610
00:31:54,583 --> 00:31:57,022
I never thought of anything low like that, Ms, Thip.

611
00:32:01,303 --> 00:32:02,102
Boss.

612
00:32:04,543 --> 00:32:06,302
Go snitch if you want.

613
00:32:07,663 --> 00:32:08,742
But remember this,

614
00:32:09,823 --> 00:32:12,662
I will stay here until I can expose you.

615
00:32:33,463 --> 00:32:34,382
K996

616
00:32:40,703 --> 00:32:41,982
Oh my god Mr. Lak!

617
00:32:45,703 --> 00:32:46,302
Whoa.

618
00:32:46,543 --> 00:32:48,262
What happened to your leg?

619
00:32:49,143 --> 00:32:50,262
Of ell

620
00:32:50,703 --> 00:32:51,542
Fractured bone

621
00:32:51,943 --> 00:32:53,022
It's not completely broken.

622
00:32:54,223 --> 00:32:56,142
I had to bring him here to recover.

623
00:32:56,783 --> 00:32:57,942
I'll have to bother you

624
00:32:59,183 --> 00:33:00,462
No bother at all!

625
00:33:00,503 --> 00:33:02,022
It's my job anyway

626
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:03,942
In that case,

627
00:33:04,383 --> 00:33:06,582
we can have him get settled in Mr, Thon's room.

628
00:33:07,223 --> 00:33:07,742
Sure.

629
00:33:09,863 --> 00:33:10,462
Je ab.

630
00:33:10,743 --> 00:33:11,662
Go put the luggage away

631
00:33:13,223 --> 00:33:14,542
I pity Thon.

632
00:33:15,303 --> 00:33:16,582
He shouldn't have passed away so soon.

633
00:33:17,343 --> 00:33:19,102
He was okay when I last saw him.

634
00:33:19,943 --> 00:33:21,702
If no one bothered him,

635
00:33:22,183 --> 00:33:24,182
he would have lived longer.

636
00:33:25,223 --> 00:33:26,062
Ms. Thip.

637
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:28,582
Tian has nothing to do with it

638
00:33:30,583 --> 00:33:31,942
Thon's body

639
00:33:33,063 --> 00:33:33,862
couldn't manage anymore.

640
00:33:35,343 --> 00:33:35,982
Tian?

641
00:33:36,943 --> 00:33:38,262
Who's Tian?

642
00:33:38,903 --> 00:33:40,622
Let Mr. Rome introduce you.

643
00:33:41,223 --> 00:33:42,462
I might address Tian wrong again.

644
00:33:45,703 --> 00:33:46,582
Tian

645
00:33:47,143 --> 00:33:48,742
is a child I took into my care.

646
00:33:49,463 --> 00:33:50,662
You'll see her soon.

647
00:33:51,703 --> 00:33:52,062
Come.

648
00:33:52,103 --> 00:33:53,462
Let's have you go rest.

649
00:33:53,703 --> 00:33:54,342
Let's go.

650
00:33:57,223 --> 00:33:57,822
Pa.

651
00:34:01,783 --> 00:34:02,582
About Tian,

652
00:34:03,503 --> 00:34:04,542
don't tell anyone yet.

653
00:34:05,463 --> 00:34:07,102
It stays between us and Pao.

654
00:34:10,583 --> 00:34:11,262
Rome!

655
00:34:14,183 --> 00:34:17,422
I found the doctor that delivered Kulachart, Kamoltat'sson.

656
00:34:18,863 --> 00:34:19,822
Here.

657
00:34:20,223 --> 00:34:21,422
The payment we agreed on

658
00:34:33,223 --> 00:34:36,062
I guess your father released you from prison?

659
00:34:37,143 --> 00:34:37,902
Who said?

660
00:34:38,103 --> 00:34:39,702
I'm still grounded to go to school

661
00:34:40,423 --> 00:34:42,582
That's why I had to hire you to go beat up that teacher

662
00:34:46,503 --> 00:34:48,342
With a limp y leg like that,

663
00:34:49,663 --> 00:34:50,702
he'll be off for months

664
00:34:50,943 --> 00:34:51,902
Don't worry.

665
00:34:52,263 --> 00:34:53,102
Serves him right.

666
00:34:53,263 --> 00:34:54,462
He messed with the wrong man

667
00:34:57,943 --> 00:34:58,982
What they got in there?

668
00:34:59,183 --> 00:35:00,302
Everything.

669
00:35:00,423 --> 00:35:01,902
Ecstasy and ice.

670
00:35:02,383 --> 00:35:03,342
Interested?

671
00:35:18,943 --> 00:35:20,342
Everyone stop!

672
00:35:26,063 --> 00:35:26,902
Get him up.

673
00:35:27,783 --> 00:35:28,422
Brother.

674
00:35:30,903 --> 00:35:31,902
We're the police.

675
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:32,942
Get up!

676
00:35:34,463 --> 00:35:36,062
Where did the girls go?

677
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:39,262
Let go!

678
00:35:39,383 --> 00:35:40,542
won't go!

679
00:35:40,743 --> 00:35:41,622
Let's go to the station

680
00:35:41,663 --> 00:35:42,662
Let me go!

681
00:35:58,143 --> 00:36:02,022
You did a great job at changing Chart.

682
00:36:03,423 --> 00:36:04,382
What do you want as a reward?

683
00:36:06,903 --> 00:36:07,662
Well,

684
00:36:10,263 --> 00:36:11,702
up to you, sir

685
00:36:21,343 --> 00:36:21,902
How about.

686
00:36:23,303 --> 00:36:24,662
three karats?

687
00:36:30,743 --> 00:36:32,582
You're always sweet.

688
00:36:49,343 --> 00:36:50,062
Hello?

689
00:36:51,103 --> 00:36:52,022
What?

690
00:36:56,863 --> 00:36:59,022
Okay, fine. I'm on my way.

691
00:37:05,263 --> 00:37:06,102
Sir,

692
00:37:06,823 --> 00:37:09,502
There'san issue at the bank.

693
00:37:09,503 --> 00:37:10,622
I have to go

694
00:37:12,463 --> 00:37:13,062
Sure

695
00:37:14,903 --> 00:37:18,382
Don't forget to take Chart to go buy his suit for the event as well.

696
00:37:19,263 --> 00:37:19,982
Sure.

697
00:37:37,823 --> 00:37:39,142
You're just the full package huh?

698
00:37:39,863 --> 00:37:41,502
Gambling online and doing drugs

699
00:37:42,303 --> 00:37:44,222
What do you want me to tell your father?

700
00:37:46,983 --> 00:37:47,862
Take the money

701
00:37:48,663 --> 00:37:50,662
And keep your mouth shut.

702
00:37:54,983 --> 00:37:55,782
Crazy woman!

703
00:37:56,303 --> 00:37:57,342
You dare slap me?!

704
00:37:57,463 --> 00:37:58,982
With a loser like you,

705
00:37:59,423 --> 00:38:00,662
a slap is trivial.

706
00:38:01,663 --> 00:38:03,342
You better know that someone like me

707
00:38:03,663 --> 00:38:06,382
considers this amount of money as debris.

708
00:38:07,063 --> 00:38:09,102
You want to hire me, it has to be six figures and jup.

709
00:38:10,463 --> 00:38:12,782
I'm going to tell Dad to fire you

710
00:38:13,423 --> 00:38:14,222
Go ahead

711
00:38:14,503 --> 00:38:15,382
Tell him.

712
00:38:15,903 --> 00:38:17,422
If you think by telling him

713
00:38:17,463 --> 00:38:18,902
and he won't hit you,

714
00:38:19,103 --> 00:38:19,742
go ahead.

715
00:38:34,263 --> 00:38:36,542
You just have to be have to deceive your father.

716
00:38:36,983 --> 00:38:38,742
Whatever you want, he'll give it to you.

717
00:38:40,823 --> 00:38:42,702
I'll also get the credit for it.

718
00:38:43,263 --> 00:38:44,782
It'saw in win.

719
00:38:45,463 --> 00:38:46,582
You don't know how to do that?

720
00:38:47,623 --> 00:38:48,982
Why didn't you tell me from the beginning?

721
00:39:00,503 --> 00:39:02,222
That's more like the heir of Taks as ut

722
00:39:04,343 --> 00:39:05,142
From now on,

723
00:39:05,783 --> 00:39:07,062
if you listen to me,

724
00:39:07,463 --> 00:39:08,862
I guarantee you won't be disappointed

725
00:39:23,743 --> 00:39:25,062
Be careful.

726
00:39:26,903 --> 00:39:27,622
You...

727
00:39:28,303 --> 00:39:29,982
-You are --
-Dok tian!

728
00:39:31,183 --> 00:39:32,662
What are you doing to Mr, Lak?

729
00:39:34,103 --> 00:39:35,022
You can't help yourself.

730
00:39:35,303 --> 00:39:36,822
Always causing problems.

731
00:39:37,983 --> 00:39:41,262
Was Mr, Thon's death not enough for you?

732
00:39:43,183 --> 00:39:43,902
Ms. Thip.

733
00:39:44,383 --> 00:39:45,342
-It's -
Mr. Lak.

734
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,622
Go sit down.

735
00:39:47,463 --> 00:39:49,342
Your bones haven't healed yet.

736
00:39:49,503 --> 00:39:51,062
You shouldn't move too much

737
00:39:51,583 --> 00:39:53,422
I almost fell down earlier.

738
00:39:53,863 --> 00:39:55,502
She has nothing to do with it.

739
00:39:57,943 --> 00:39:59,382
What happened?

740
00:40:02,543 --> 00:40:03,542
She's not a servant

741
00:40:03,703 --> 00:40:05,062
She's not a family friend then

742
00:40:05,223 --> 00:40:06,662
who is Tian?

743
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:09,382
Why does Rome have to take a beautiful girl like Tian into his care?

744
00:40:10,223 --> 00:40:11,142
I don't know.

745
00:40:11,423 --> 00:40:12,382
I just know that

746
00:40:12,583 --> 00:40:14,022
Tian is an orphan.

747
00:40:14,263 --> 00:40:15,862
Also, she has done Rome a favor.

748
00:40:16,303 --> 00:40:19,502
That's why Rome wants the best life for Tian

749
00:40:19,623 --> 00:40:20,702
Best how?

750
00:40:21,143 --> 00:40:23,222
Like socialite status

751
00:40:24,063 --> 00:40:24,662
Wow!

752
00:40:24,903 --> 00:40:25,902
To that extent?

753
00:40:26,103 --> 00:40:26,982
So...

754
00:40:27,183 --> 00:40:27,942
Enough.

755
00:40:27,983 --> 00:40:29,302
No more questions.

756
00:40:29,463 --> 00:40:30,782
That's all l can tell you

757
00:40:31,103 --> 00:40:32,662
While Rome is gone,

758
00:40:32,703 --> 00:40:34,582
he gave you a job.

759
00:40:37,823 --> 00:40:39,742
He wanted

760
00:40:39,863 --> 00:40:42,822
