Massage only!

17
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,239
I'm only doing massages. Not other services!

00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,879
Get the rope!

49
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,559
Go tie it.

50
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,079
How did it rip?

51
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,959
Let me see

52
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,639
Go check it.

53
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,519
Babe!

54
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,999
Are you okay?

Yea h, I'm good, I'm good.

56
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,719
It's okay now.

57
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,239
Mike.

58
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,199
Thank you, man.

59
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,279
You really saved my life.

60
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,759
Not at all.!

61
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,999
It's all my fault.

62
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,119
I shouldn't have given the boat in the first place

63
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,919
Don't blame yourself man

64
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,999
Accidents happens all the time. It's okay

65
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,519
Yeah. It was an accident. Nobody wanted it to happen Rome

66
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:13,959
Let's go.

67
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,039

68
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,639
Wait.

69
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,799
Don't go yet.

70
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:22,519
OLA IAN

71
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,479
It's not worth it.

72
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,599
We haven't sold anything today

73
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,079
It's worth it.

74
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,719
I saved a life.

75
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,919
We can sell these another time

76
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,119
Can you stop pouting?

77
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,319
It's okay.

78
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,239
Tian b

79
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,279
Did you know that

80
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,359
you were so cool today?

81
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,639
You were like Tony Jaa

82
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,599
Tony Jaa?

83
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,599
Yeah.

84
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,759
He's such an old movie actor!

85
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,359
So I'm old?

86
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,999
Well,you were cool!

87
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,799
Tian!

88
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,879
Look over there!

89
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,679
They're really going to fight over there!

90
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,919
Aren't you taking advantage of us, Boss?

91
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,919
Once he's safe,you just kick us to the curb just like that?

92
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,559
That's right!

93
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,359
What now?

94
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,919
The rental fees for the boat and paragliding

95
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,599
were all paid.

96
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,839
What moredo you want?

97
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,439
Damages.

98
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,799
You broke the rope.

99
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,479
It's a grade A foreign climbing rope too!

100
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,319
Boat repair costs

101
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,599
using the beach too!

102
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,039
Pay up, ten thousand!

103
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:29,999
Quickly!

104
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,559
This doesn't include the towing fee for the boat either!

105
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,959
That's free of charge!

106
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,959
Here, I'll pay you.

107
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,799
Don't.

108
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,759
You're my customers and my guests.

109
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:40,799
I'll handle this.

110
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,319
Don't give it to them Boss.

111
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,119
Chit.

112
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,999
You're sabotaging your income right now

113
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,399
Who would want to come here again?

114
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,479
We'll be in trouble too.

115
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,319
That's right.

116
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,559
Tian.

117
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,879
Why are you meddling?!

118
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,599
Hey!

119
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,119
Look.

120
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,799
Where's the tore on the rope?

121
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,879
It snapped because you were drunk and didn't tie it correctly

122
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,199
It's fortunate that they're not pressing charges

123
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,639
The other day.

124
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,159
you drove a boat and almost killed a jet ski rider

125
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,319
You're hurting both parties by --

126
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,439
You have a shitty mouth,you know that?

127
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,719
You deserve a slap!

128
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,199
Bro!

129
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,519
Hey! If you won't stop,

130
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,999
we can settle it at the police station

131
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,599
You wanna go?

132
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,599
Huh?

133
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,519

Thank you!

141
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,599
We didn't do anything

142
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,319
My parents taught me if someone is in trouble, we just have to help them

143
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,559
Tian!

144
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,319

00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,439
I will get beaten to death

197
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,879
Just get out of my way!

198
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,599
Chan!

199
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,399
Damn it!

200
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,319
ou're doing chicken fights again?

201
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,519
thought you said you will quit if I get the money for you?

202
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,519
You need a lot more.

203
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,959
You're'the one that killed Mom and Dad.

204
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,999
You need to pay off my debt for the rest of your life!

205
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,879
Give them this money.

206
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,839
If it's not enough, I will sell more things tomorrow.

207
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,799
It has to be that way anyway

208
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,839
When will you stop betting?

209
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,799
Whatever!

210
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,359
What the hell?!

211
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,999
That is my money! Give it back to me!

212
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,719
This is my money.

213
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,119
That dumb customer was supposed to give it to me

214
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,479
But Tian got in the way

215
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,519
Your brother has to take responsibility!

216
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,199
Let's go.

217
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,119
Wait!

218
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,519
What?!

219
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,399
Damn it!

220
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,719
Tian!

221
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,759
This is your fault!

222
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,359
Chan!

223
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,479
Where do I get the money now?!

224
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,239
Chan!

225
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,959
What are you doing to Tian?!

226
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,559
She managed to go sell stuff

227
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,519
so she can pay off expenses for the house!

228
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,519
Try being a gentleman!

229
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,599
Just let her be.

230
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,359
Tian.

231
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,559
I'm sorry.

232
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,479
I won't gamble from now on

233
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:24,959
T'swear

234
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,759
You don't have to swear to me.

235
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,479
As long as you know that gambling is bad

236
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,479
and it will ruin your future is good enough

237
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,439
I'll be the witness

238
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,199
If you earn more money from the new job

239
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,479
and he is still gambling,

240
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,039
I'll get a new husband.

241
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,159
What job Aor?

242
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,359
Smells nice.

243
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,399
Lovely weather

244
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,879
We should have a bottle of fine wine

245
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,119
before we turn in.

246
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,999
We can i go to my place

247
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,639
No thank you.

248
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,599
We encountered a lot of exciting things today

249
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,119
We just want to rest.

250
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,279
Sure.

251
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,719
The kids on the beach were sweet.
Especially their leader named Tian.

252
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,999
Good looking too.

253
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,399
That boy Tian?

254
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,879
I think everything is good but he's...

255
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,639
too girly.

256
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,119
What Rome?

257
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,359
You really think

258
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,119
Tian is a boy?

259
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,479
He's dating...

260
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,839
the girl named Jane

261
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,319
who did henna on you

262
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,359
I think the way they look at each other,

263
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,559
that boy Tian seems like a player

264
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,919
You're so old-fashioned!

265
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,399
I'm not bullying you

266
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,519
but you need to go study about LGBTQ I.

267
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:55,959
In that case,

268
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,079
you should go rest. I'll go take a walk

269
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,679
Okay Let's go.

270
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,159
Tian is a tomboy?

271
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,319
Chan.

272
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,479
What job are you having me do?

273
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,839
Im not good at massages.

274
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,399
It's'not massages.

275
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,039
It's an easier job than that.

276
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,479
You'll know once you go in.

277
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,639
Come.

278
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,519
Mr, Ba isn't here yet?

279
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,839
He's warming up in the room

280
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,079
Come on.

281
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,599
Why is there a camera?

282
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,719
Is it a photo shoot?

283
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,639
Mm.

284
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,039
Something like that.

285
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,759
He wants to hire you to be a model for some clothing brand

286
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,759
You don't have a cell phone nor have a computer.

287
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,279
I don't think you know it.

288
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,639
Yes sir?

289
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,479
My brother is ready

290
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,479
Chan.

291
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:31,959
Hmm?

292
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,599
Where are you going?

293
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,039
I'll be back.

294
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:34,759
Wait here.

295
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:41,919
Hello

296
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:45,599
Hi.

297
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,079
Get on the bed, brother

298
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,439
Wearing this outfit?

299
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,919
But I.

300
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,679
don't know how to pose. I never done this before.

301
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,119
Don't worry about the pose.

302
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,119
Take off your clothes.

303
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,279
Yes, you don't need to change.

304
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,199
Take it off.

305
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,679
One sec.

306
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,199
Yes?

307
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,279
Don't rush.

308
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,999
My clip will be good.

309
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,679
A lonely boy.

310
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,919
It's a trend in the market right now.

311
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:28,799
Yes.

312
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,159

Where are you going?

316
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,199
Your brother took the money already.

317
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:39,879
Okay?!

318
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,679

Rome.

349
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,839
Your customer from this morning

350
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,479
Don't be scared.

351
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,119
You're safe.

352
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,519
Don't be shy.

353
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,839
OLA IAN I saw everything.

354
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,719
OLA IAN You looksmart.

355
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,279
OLA IAN How did you get tricked into getting sold?

356
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,759
My brother took me.

357
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,039
Brother?

358
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,719
What kind of brother

359
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,759
does this to his own sibling?

360
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,759
I's he not scared of human trafficking laws?

361
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,479
Where are your parents?

362
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,039
I'm living with my brother and his wife.

363
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,159
My parents...

364
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,839
died.

365
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,039
OLA IAN

OLA IAN Don't cry.

367
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:03,479
OLA IAN

368
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,439
OLA IAN We can file a report.

369
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,999
OLA IAN Put them all in jail.

370

OLA IAN They couldn't have gone far

371
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,839
Please don't report them.

372
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,559
I don't want the police to know.

373
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,919
I don't want my brother to go to jail.

374
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,399
OLA IAN
No.

375
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,919
OLA IAN What will you do if he tries to sell you again?

376
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,839
OLA IAN You won't get lucky all the time.

377
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,279
Think about it.
OLA IAN

378
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,639
Poor Tian

379
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,039
How pitiful of her

380
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,159
You should call the authorities.

381
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,879
I totally agree.

382
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,039
What are you going to do with Tian?

383
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,519
I don't know yet.

384
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,759
Ill drop you guys at the airport first.

385
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,039
Then I'll figure something out.

386
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,519
Get down.

387
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,039
This is my house

388
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,679
You can stay here for now

389
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,399

390
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:39,759

Okay.

394
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,999

395
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,839

Pit p lern.

401
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,999
Oh mygod!

402
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,919
Who are you?!

403
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,799
What did you do to him?

404
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,039
What happened?!

405
00:22:59,160 --> 00:22:59,759
Thon!

406
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,479
Pit p lern.

407
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,159
Tai.

408
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,759
Your job was to look after Thon

409
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,159
How did you let him

410
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,479
go by the pool?

411
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,239
People need to pee and take a shit.

412
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,599
I can't watch him 24/7

413
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,599
Vulgar!

414
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,799
Look at her

415
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,999
No remorse

416
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,679
Hiring her wil I just be a waste of money.

417
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,719
You're a servant too.

418
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,159
I'm Mr. Thon's caretaker.

419
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,319
Not his servant.

420
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,599
Alright that's enough.

421
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,639
Get back to work.

422
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,519
Next time,

423
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,359
don't let this happen again

424
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,759
Apologize to Ms. Thip.

425
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,119
There's no next time.

426
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,399
I quit.

427
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,959
I i'll leave on my own.

428
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:50,919
I'm tough enough

429
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,839
It's okay Mr. Rome

430
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,799
There's a lot of unemployed people nowadays.

431
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,759
We can find someone else

432
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,679
Me!

433
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,799
J can do anything, Wash clothes, iron clothes,or cook.

434
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,399
Oh.

435
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,639
I can even watch a patient.

436
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,399
Sounds good.

437
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,639
There won't be much workload for Ms. Thip.

438
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,399
She can have an assistant.

439
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,839
Wait Mr. Rome

440
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,679
Who is...

441
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,239
this boy?

442
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,279
Dirty and filthy like this

443
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,719
we don't know what diseases he might give Mr Thon

444
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,039
Did you get all of your vaccines yet?

445
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,959
In that case, lill need to bother a former nurse like you to help out.

446
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:36,839
Tian

447
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,519

448
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,799

451
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,759
She's a girl?!

452
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,879
Mr. Rome asked me to bring you clothes

453
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,679
I'll buy new ones later for you boy.

454
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:57,639

Wait.

457
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,119
For my peace of mind,

458
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,479
in case you didn't take any valuable things,

459
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,919
I'd like to'search your bag

460
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,199
You're in deep trouble

461
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,119
Nothing but sick people in this house

462
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,799
Physically and mentally ill.

463
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,359
Especially that old lady

464
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,159
Scolds me every day

465
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,519

466
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,239
Good luck.

Thank you.

468
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,599
Tian.

469
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,439
You must wrap yourself like this everyday.

470
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,839
Don't let anyone know you're a girl.

471
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,159
When you speak,

472
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,359
use a male tone.

473
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,039
You must listen to l your parents orders

474
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,559
Don't be naughty

475
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,759
It's dangerous for us girls.

476
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,519
Boys can bully you.

477
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,359
You must act like a boy, got it?

478
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,399
Gay kid! Gay kid!

479
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,919
-Gay kid!
-Chan!

480
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:49,719
Come here!

481
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,679
Don't call your brother that anymore!

482
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,239
Tian is your brother!

483
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,479
Do you hear me?!

484
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,519
Your father is bailing you out. He'll be done so on.

485
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,639
Don't get involved with narcotics again.

486
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,679
It's not good.

487
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,639
Mom!

488
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,679
Who would be a good boy like your son Tian?

489
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,599
I'm just the black sheep of the house.
Why do you care?!

490
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,719
Chan.

491
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,879
Why do you say that?

492
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,079
Mom and Dad mortgaged the house to bail lyou out.

493
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:29,719
Chan.

494
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,199
Where are you going?!
-See ya!

495
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:33,919
Chan!

496
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,759
Hurry honey! Tian can't manage anymore!

497
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,759
She's burning up like fire!

498
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,159
Mom.

499
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,279
Ring necklace...

500
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,079
What did you say?

501
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,079
Your ring necklace

502
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,559
are kept in my pillowcase.

503
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,719
Keep it safe.

504
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,279
Don't take it off.

505
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,399
Mom!

506
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,799
Mom! Don't leave me!

507
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,239
Mom!

508
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:57,999
Necklace

509
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,319
He's tired now.

510
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,239
I'm done.

511
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,759
Let'sgo play some games

512
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,759
Come.

513
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,799
Let's play some games.

514
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,999
Whoever has the fewest points

515
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,039
has to be kissed!

516
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,119
Come on now.

517
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,439
Pass it out.

518
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,199
Flip it over.

519
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:00,919
What the hell?

520
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:04,999
Beauty! Beauty! Beauty!

521
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,599
Okay, okay.

522
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,719
Close your eyes.

523
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,199
Whoever I kiss must open their eyes.

524
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:32,759
Hey!

525
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:34,839
Where did everyone go?!

526
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,239
So freaking good.

527
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,439
You guys know how to play.

528
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,679
I better not find you Beauty!

529
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,519
Where did you go?

530
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,599
If I find you,

531
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,679
you will get kissed on the cheek!

532
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,919
Butt cheek though!

533
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,479
Aha!

534
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,199
I don't care about you anymore Beauty

535
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,119
lill kiss Ae instead

536
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,919
Bastard!

537
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,399
If you're gonna play rough like this,

538
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,959
all my friends left Dad.

539
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,079
Get up.

540
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,679
I left on a business trip for a few days

541
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,079
You brought your friends here to get high on drugs?!

542
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,559
You scumbag!

543
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,199
You need to get hit!

544
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,439
That's enough!

545
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,039
Stop.

546
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,719
Don't be violent with Kula chart

547
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,839
The university kicked you out

548
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,879
You t didn't repent

549
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,559
So what's there to celebrate?

550
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,159
Gosh Dad!

551
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,039
It's a farewell party

552
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,079
I won't be seeing them anymore.

553
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,919
You make such a big de all out of it.

554
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,959
And earlier, you could have talked nicely to me

555
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,599
No need to get violent.

556
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,999
It's embarrassing to my friends

557
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:11,719
Did you know

558
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,839
how good I raised you?

559
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,599
I give you a high education but you refused!

560
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:19,759
Your counselor told me that you go'to class twice a week.

561
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,359
I don't like studying law.

562
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,559
Lots of studying

563
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,519
It gives me headaches

564
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:26,839
Good.

565
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,319
Whatever you want to study next year,

566
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,319
you take the exam for it.

567
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,799
No school for you this year!

568
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,679
Stay home, no allowance, and you can't use your car!

569
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,439
I'm gonna freeze all of your credit cards!

570
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,759
Gosh Dad!

571
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,759
You're mean!

572
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,719
Mom don't even scold me about it!

573
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,239
Why don't you just kill me instead?!

574
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:44,919
Fine.

575
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,639
Don't challenge me!

576
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,479
Stop!

577
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,279
-- Calm down!
- Move!

578
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,079
Calm down.

579
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,399
He's not a kid anymore.

580
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,159
You should be patient

581
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,599
and be reasonable with him.

582
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,559
He's like this because you keep spoiling him

583
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,999
I don't know how much I can tolerate with his behavior

584
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,639
Kula chart

585
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:18,079
is the result of our actions.

586
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,559
It's both of our responsibilities.

587
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:24,359
But you should take better care of him.

588
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,678
Not pray everyday

589
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,759
Why the hell do you do it so much?!

590
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,039
The reason I pray

591
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,479
and offer my merit to this person,

592
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,678
You know why.

593
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,119
His overall health looks okay.

594
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,599
Nothing to worry about.

595
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,039
Pit p lern.

596
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,279
Rome.

597
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,239
Is a w Pitp lern.

598
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,039
Where is she?

599
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,159
I haven't heard him mentioned Pit p lern in so long

600
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,319
Yeah.

601
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,119
Ever since Thon saw Tian,

602
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,719
my new employee,

603
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,199
he would call out for her

604
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,839
He think s he's P itplern.

605
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,519
Hey Rome

606
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,399
You called me over because of this?

607
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,399
This is.

608
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,039
a brain symptom

609
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,839
It involves the nervous system

610
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,119
Pit p lern.

611
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,279
Where are you?

612
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,839
Bring Pit p lern to me

613
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,679
Okay Thon.

614
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,959
I will bring Pit p lern to you

615
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,039
Okay?

616
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,679
But you need to rest.

617
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,439
When you wake up,

618
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,679
you will see Pit p lern.

619
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,599
Our brain is complex.

620
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,479
The way it thinks

621
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,039
the memories

622
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,439
For Kama it hon,

623
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,159
the Pit p lern situation is haunting him

624
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,999
This makes me want to see this Tian boy.

625
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,439
Mr. Rome.

626
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,959
Il don't know where Tian went.

627
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:35,959
What?

628
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,119
How can one person go missing?

629
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,319
I searched everywhere

630
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,359
But he doesn't seem trustworthy

631
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,279
I don't know if he stole something and left

632
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,479
What's his deal?

633
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,319
Hello.

634
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,879
Rome Pak an ant is speaking.

635
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,159
Damnit!

636
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,959
Damn you Tian!

637
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,919
You're gonna get it if I see you!

638
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,759
Be careful.

639
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,839
We don't know if Mr. Ba will come back to hurt us or not.

640
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,519
A or, Chan.

641
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,519
Where did Tian go?

642
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,999
I didn't see him sell things this morning

643
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,679
I have to ask you that.

644
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,039
I usually see you attached to each other like a married couple

645
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,999
Being with a tomboy

646
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,319
is such a waste

647
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,919
Come work with us instead

648
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,799
Good money and good energy

649
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,839
It's exciting too

650
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,079
Oh!

651
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,639
Like your former job?

652
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,319
If it's the guy, we call them gigolo.

653
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,559
If it's the customer, we call them.

654
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:53,759
pro...

655
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,959
Pro...what was it called Chan?

656
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,559
-Pro what again?
- Jane!

657
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,959
Are you calling me a prostitute?!

658
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,719
What huh?!

659
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:08,639
Jane!

660
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,479
What?!

661
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,799
Enough!

662
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,679
Barking like dogs!

663
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,119
I'm leaving!

664
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,399
Chan!

665
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,039
Jane!

666
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,599
I'll get you later!

667
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,559
Hey!

668
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,759
Come pay for your food first Chan!

669
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,079
Hey come back!

670
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,519
Chan!

671
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,439
Come pay for your food!

672
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,839
Come back here!

673
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,159
It has nothing to do with me.

674
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,079
I'm leaving.

675
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,279
Chan!

676
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,799
Come back here and pay!

677
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,239
Come back!

678
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,159
Hey!

679
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:46,839
Wait.

680
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,159
Tian, you troublemaker!

681
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,559
Look what happened when you bailed on Mr. Ba and hit his head!

682
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,839
He put it out on me!

683
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:08,199
He even took his40 THBdeposit back too

684
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,599
You're cruel.

685
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,279
I'm your sister but you dare sold me!

686
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,879
Give me back the ring necklace

687
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,319
Then we don't have to see each other anymore

688
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,319
We'll give it back

689
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:27,719
But you

690
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,199
have to clear it with Mr. Ba

691
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,079
I won't go.

692
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,119
Give me back my necklace!

693
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,399
It's my necklace!

694
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,599
-Mom gave it to me! Give it back!
- Damn Tian!

695
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,759
Will'you come with me willingly

696
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,919
or do you want Mr. Ba to come pick you up?

697
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,199
Call him.

698
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,759
Chan.

699
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,359
Tian!

700
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,639
Are you okay?

701
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,079
Who are you?!
