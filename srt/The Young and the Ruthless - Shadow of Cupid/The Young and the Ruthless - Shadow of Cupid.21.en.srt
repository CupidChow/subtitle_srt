PI trust you with everything?

00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:35,439
But today your embrace feels empty

5
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,839
P The word love that doesn't seem sincere

6
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,399

P Love me like you did yesterdays

14
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,159
My dad

15
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,279
was very sick.

16
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,599
He told me every day that he wanted a grandson

17
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,719
Sol had to swap you with Kula chart.

18
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,999
Tam in need of a housekeeper

19
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,199
Good benefits :

20
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,519
She'll liu st be a burden there. Doesn't look like she can do anything

21
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,639
I changed my mind.

22
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,559
I'll go.

23
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,999
I want to be a burden.

24
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,599
Where did you take Tian?

25
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,599
" Where is Tian?"

26
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,359
Aro you crazy asking me that?!

27
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,559
Ka molt at.

28
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,799
Stop.

29
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,038
What's going on here?

30
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,319
That means...

31
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,959
you don't know yet?

32
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,759
Tian

33
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,799
is your biological daughter

34
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,119
with Ka molt at.

35
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,199
But Ka molt at was afraid he wouldn't get the inheritance stated in the will

36
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,999
so he tried to kill Tian.

37
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:29,959
Rome!

38
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,039
You liar! Don't listen to him!

39
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,399
That's not true.

40
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,239
My daughter

41
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,079
died since birth.

42
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,479
That's because Ka molt at lied to you!

43
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,719
This is the DNA result confirming that Tian

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,839
is your daughter with Ka molt at.

45
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,799
Hey.

46
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,039
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

47
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,439
Because he tried to get rid of Tian

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,159
You don't know how many bodies he has killed

49
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,239
You guys are slandering me!

50
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,999
Don't believe them!

51
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,439
I'm your husband. You have to believe me!

52
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,679
I don't slander anyone without evidence!

53
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,319
If you hurt Tian

54
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,319
or touched her even the tip of her fingernail

55
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,599
I will expose everything..

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,799
about you.

57
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:43,999
Pit.

58
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,559
Rome!

59
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,199
Wait Rome!

60
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,359
Where...

61
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,079
Where did you find Tian?

62
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,079
And..

63
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,039
who raised Tian?

64
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,959
Where are they?

65
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,559
It was probably fate

66
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,159
that led me to Tian.

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,479
That's all l can tell you, Pit p lern.

68
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,959
Does Tian know yet?

69
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,359
Did you tell her the truth?

70
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,279
At first I wanted to...

71
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,479
tell her the truth

72
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,999
after l get revenge on Ka molt at to my fullest.

73
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,119
But don't you know

74
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,199
what he has done to me,

75
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,319
to Thon,

76
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,239
and you?

77
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,279
I've changed my mind now.

78
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,559
When I find Tian,

79
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,759
I will take her far away from all this chaos

80
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,239
Because lim sure

81
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,479
Tian doesn't want to be the daughter

82
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,759
of someone like Ka molt at.

83
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,319
Tian.

84
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,079
My daughter.

85
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,439
Are you crazy?!

86
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,799
Why are you walking around here?!

87
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,599
I'm sorry.

88
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,159
-I'm sorry-Just go!

89
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,559
You'll get other people in trouble.

90
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,879
Why didn't the car just hit me so I can die?

91
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,879
I want to go be with Mom and Dad.

92
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,839
Right.

93
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,199
I'm not Chai and Tho my a's daughter.

94
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,679
That's why they won't take me to go be with them

95
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,719
They don't love me anymore.

96
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,719
Who do llive with now?

97
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,599
Dad.

98
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,079
Mom.

99
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:42,959
A ey.

100
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,759
Take him inside

101
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,399
Also, cook something for him to eat.

102
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,599
No coffee or alcohol

103
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,799
Organize his medicines according to what the doctor prescribed

104
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,119
I'm stepping out.

105
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,119
Where are you going?

106
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,559
Go find my child

107
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:01,999
Tian.

108
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,639
I told you already I told Pat to go look for her.

109
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,039
Find her?

110
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,159
To kill her?

111
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,559
Hey!

112
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,399
I'm not a monster.

113
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,359
If I was, Tian would be dead by now.

114
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,559
You have the audacity to say that.

115
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,079
All you've done in your life

116
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,519
is let her live a life of misery.

117
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:22,999
Including me

118
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,319
and Kula chart.

119
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,359
You're thoughtless.

120
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,799
So?

121
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,199
Things have gotten this far already.

122
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:35,839
Go for it.

123
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,879
If you want to announce for everyone to know, go ahead.

124
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,439
Let Chart know about it too

125
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,159
how he came to be.

126
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,079
It will l be in Rome'sfavor and he can bury me alive even more!

127
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,079
Who's the thoughtless person now?

128
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,759
What you have to do

129
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,799
is make Tian side with us

130
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,719
Go beg Rome not to expose what we've done.

131
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,599
l'llhandle the rest!

132
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,879
So what do we have to do Pat?

133
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,879
We have to get rid of Tian regardless

134
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,919
Right now,

135
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,719
if Rome ever expose the truth about Tian,

136
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,879
it'll be over for us.

137
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,479
Find Tian.

138
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:35,999
But remember,

139
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,799
do not hurt her!

140
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,399
Yes Boss.

141
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,519
Tian!

142
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,239
Let me go!

143
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,399
Tian!

144
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,719
Ms. King.

145
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,879
Is the classroom full yet?

146
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,159
Only a few more and it'll be full.

147
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,559
Can I add her to the list?

148
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,039
Also, give me the application

149
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,839
Sure.

150
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,159
Thank you.

151
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,079
I'll find a quick course so you can gain an advantage in language skills

152
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,759
Then you can go get your NFE

153
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,879
then take your entrance college exam.

154
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,439
Why does it sound so complicated?

155
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,919
Can you make it simple?

156
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,319
Look.

157
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,879
There's nothing in this world that comes easy

158
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,479
how do you want me to identify you as? Male or female?

159
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,119
Can you not put a label on me?

160
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,479
What era are we in?

161
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,359
Have you heard of LGBTQ?

162
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,759
I have but...

163
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,839
look.

164
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,719
They only ask male or female

165
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,079
Female,

166
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,279
And...

167
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,399
do you like men or women?

168
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,799
Any is fine with me!

169
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,759
If I like them,it doesn't matter what gender they are.

170
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,719
Hey

171
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,959
They ask these questions on the application?

172
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,799
Smiling like that means no.

173
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,639
You tricked me into answering?!

174
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,079
Stop!

175
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,439
I'm sorry!

176
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,679
Stop!

177
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,959
I won't prank you anymore.

178
00:11:59,320 --> 00:11:59,759
Look.

179
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,119
If you get on my nerves again,

180
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,479
I'm leaving.

181
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,479
I won't study.

182
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,879
Yeah.l said no more pranks.

183
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,279
Go fill this out.

184
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,159
Go sit over there

185
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,359
Rome.

186
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,359
You guys are back?

187
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,759
Where is she studying?

188
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,279
NFE and language school with me

189
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,079
Any news on Tian yet?

190
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,119
I think

191
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,039
she ran away from me.

192
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,999
Tian has been a fighter since she was little

193
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,559
25
0886

194
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,559
Regardless, she will manage

195
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,319
She'll come back once she's thought everything through

196
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,159
Seeing you

197
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,239
reminds me when l first met Tian

198
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,759
Tian pretended to be a boy

199
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,639
She was a crybaby

200
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,559
and sensitive.

201
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,879
She's aprim person.

202
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,159
She's not violent like you.

203
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,639
when Tian was :here

204
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,039
did she know anyone or-who was she close to?

205
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,479
Maybe she went-to ask them for help.

206
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,399
There's one person.

207
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,079
Rome.

208
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,119
How dare you ask me about Tian?!

209
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,559
Even if I know,

210
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,399
I won't tell you.

211
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,279
Dream on it!

212
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,399
Enough Mon.

213
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,839
Stop thinking bad about Tian!

214
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,399
She's just a small girl who is harmless to you.

215
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,999
That girl is a venomous snake.

216
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,559
She's stealing you from me!

217
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,759
Be reasonable!

218
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,919
You and!

219
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,159
were over before leven met Tian.

220
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,959
Just tell me

221
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,239
that you love that girl!

222
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:31,959
Yes.

223
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,799
I love Tian.

224
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,839
Then get out of here!

225
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,799
Don't even hope you will find that girl alive!

226
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,239
Mark my words!

227
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,719
I'm not going anywhere

228
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,319
until you tell me where Tian is!

229
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,519
Or do you want me to call the police?

230
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,399
Go ahead.

231
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,279
Do you have proof?

232
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,679
I just drugged her.

233
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:56,999
No biggie.

234
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,279
Rome.

235
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,679
I il tell you

236
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,639
where Tian is at.

237
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,479
But...

238
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:10,999
tonight

239
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,239
you have to stay with me.

240
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,879
I want us to go back to the way things were.

241
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:19,879
Please?

242
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,639
Rome!

243
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,519
How can you do this to me?!

244
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,439
How brave.

245
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,759
He came to ask his ex about his new girlfriend

246
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,999
Just dump his ass,girl

247
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,119
How about I.

248
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,839
take you

249
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:02,039
to a bar host to find yourself a young man to lighten your heart

250
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,199
Okay?

251
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,279
Hey.

252
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,559
We barely have money to buy food.

253
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,839
What money do we have to pay those boys?

254
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:12,759
Here.

255
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,559
09

256
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,559
Ten million?!

257
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,999
It's in my name too!

258
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,359
Where did you get this?!

259
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,199
Did you forget

260
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:36,039
you asked me to handle your divorce settlement with your ex Sam?

261
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,959
After splitting the assets and stuff, the amount on the check is what you got

262
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,159
Gigi!

263
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,199
You're my best friend!

264
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,479
Thank you so much!

265
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,479
Don't forget my share

266
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,719
Sure.

267
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:03,879
Mon b

268
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:05,999
Hey!

269
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,279
What the hell?!

270
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,079
-I'm sorry.
-Such a mess!

271
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,159
I'm sorry!

272
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,639
-I'm sorry.
-What happened?

273
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,439
Well..

274
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,559
This girl...

275
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,799
-I'm sorry!
She spilled this on me!

276
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,479
-I'm sorry!
-What a mess!

277
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,119
Oh!

278
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,079
Where are you going?!

279
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,079
I'm sorry.

280
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,279
She's new here.

281
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,399
You.

282
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,079
Hey.

283
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:33,919
You.

284
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,759
Do you not hear me calling you?!

285
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,559
What is this?!

286
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,319
I'm sorry.

287
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,759
Is your name Tian?

288
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,199
Yes.

289
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,079
My name is Tian chai.

290
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,839
What can ldo for you ma'am?

291
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,679
I'm dirty now!

292
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,519
Nothing!

293
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,119
What do you want?

294
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,959
Please sign the document approving the seaside project in Ranong

295
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,359
Sign where?

296
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,839
Right here

297
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,279
and here

298
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,399
000

299
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,359
Hey.

300
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,199
I want 200,000. Go take it out for me

301
00:18:59,320 --> 00:18:59,879
Oh!

302
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,119
I can't.

303
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,519
You must write in detail how you will be spending that money.

304
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,479
Then I will forward it to the finance manager

305
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,039
Damn!

306
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,359
What the hell?

307
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,199
So difficult.

308
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:10,919
Get out.

309
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,719
The acting chairman of the company has no money to spend!

310
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,079
What the hell?

311
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,319
It's me.

312
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,799
Save the money for later

313
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,839
It's difficult taking money out from the company

314
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,639
It's not easy like you said

315
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,319
You want that?

316
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,479
Where's Tian?

317
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,439
don't know

318
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:19,759
How would I know?

319
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,159
ou went to pick her up. How can you not know?

320
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,239
Tian must have said something to you as a clue.

321
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,919
Whatever she said to me

322
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,999
is none of your business

323
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,239
Tian

324
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,319
Tian told me to go pick her up

325
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:37,559
And...

326
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,559
she told me

327
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,239
to open the road for the villagers.

328
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,199
Then...

329
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,479
she asked me to take her to see Dad at the hospital

330
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,319
She went in to talk to Dad

331
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,439
Then just took off.

332
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,839
What did she talk to Ka molt at about?

333
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,279
I don't know.

334
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,239
I really don't.

335
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,359
I didn't...

336
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,359
I didn't hear their conversation. I swear

337
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,799
What's going on Mr. Kula chart?!

338
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,239
Nothing.

339
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,639
Just talking

340
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,399
See you later,

341
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:07,919
Kula chart.

342
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,519
All done.

343
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,439
At least Kula chart will get half of the assets as an adopted son

344
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,919
if Tian doesn't file a lawsuit against you.

345
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,599
Thank you so much Lawyer Sila.

346
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,439
We'll definitely be working together a lot more in the future

347
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,159
Did you find Tian?

348
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,719
Wonderful.

349
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,279
It's almost close to Chart and Tian's birthday.

350
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,639
Why don't we just make it legal?

351
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:50,959
Regardless,

352
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,359
we are going to accept Tian and Kula chart as our kids.

353
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,879
You talk too much.

354
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,799
The more you talk, the more annoyed I am

355
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,439
Go do what you need to do

356
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:08,639
Chart.

357
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,119
How was work?

358
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,679
It was good.

359
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,519
Good.

360
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,679
No problems.

361
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:26,879
"eg re

362
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,279
Dad!

363
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,399
Rome came to the company today

364
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,679
A He threatened me too.

365
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,199
Huh?

366
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,799
About what?

367
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:44,959
About Tian.

368
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,439
He came looking for Tian.

369
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,879
You need to handle him.

370
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,159
Have Uncle Pats a korn teach him a lesson for me

371
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,199
Where did it happen?

372
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,479
Parking lot.

373
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,479
I know how we can find the person you are looking for.

374
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,039
Get out of here

375
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:02,999
This is private

376
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,039
Yes Dad.

377
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,839
So what exactly did you mean?

378
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:34,679
Hello.

379
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,679
I'd like to see Mr Rome

380
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,519
Boss isn't home. He stepped out since morning

381
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,279

am an experienced nurse assistant.

405
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,159
Many patients have recovered and been mentally rehabilitated because of me.

406
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,519

407
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,479
Kamoltat Taksasut

410
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,199
I wouldn't have come.

sol quit.

419
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,039
Ever since Tian made Mr Kama it hon died

420
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,119
and i moved into that house,

421
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,679
Mr, Rome only cared about Tian.

422
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,959
He ignored everyone in the house.

423
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,359
Wait.

424
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,119
You.knew my brother? Kama it hon?

425
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,159
How did he die?

426
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,479
Mr Thon was your brother?

427
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,919
How about this

428
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,999
Hl will hire you to work here with me.

429
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,039
Ill pay you thrice as much than Rome did.

430
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,759
But,you must tell me everything

431
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,999
about Rome,

432
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:47,959
Tian,

433
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,399
and everything in that house

434
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,879
You seem better now.

435
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,399
Compared to the last time l saw you.

436
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,359
My symptoms goes up and down.

437
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,439
Before, I can't even hold a cup on my right hand.

438
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,359
But right now

439
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,599
it's better since l ve been doing physical therapy sequentially.

440
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,159
Did you miss Mr Kula chart

441
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,999
that you had to come see him at his house Tian?

442
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,199
Tian,

443
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,839
My daughter.

444
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,799
Tian, daughter.

445
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,279
I'm sorry.

446
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,959
Please forgive me.

447
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,719
From now on,

448
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,519
I won't let you go missing again.

449
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,279
Don't worry

450
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,359
Starting today

451
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,919
Tian will be living with us.

452
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,039
Tian.

453
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,359
Is that true?

454
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:17,959
No.

455
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,039
I didn't come back to live here.

456
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,399
I also didn't come back to reclaim my rights as your child.

457
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,799
li don't want anything

458
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,519
Kula chart is the heir that will receive your inheritance.

459
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,879
Kula chart

460
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,999
has been missing for days now.

461
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,319
You see?

462
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,399
If you trust me,

463
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,679
you will only win

464
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,919
You will have something to indulge in all the time.

465
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,759
You will have money to spend.

466
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,079
The two of us

467
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,679
are on the same team now.

468
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,239
I think we should pause for now

469
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,439
We'll get caught.

470
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,799
Once I run out of money.

471
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,759
we'll talk again.

472
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,639
So you don't want to get richer?

473
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,279
I do.

474
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,639
I know you love to indulge in only the good stuff.

475
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,919
So why don't you become an agent yourself?

476
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,959
Indulging and selling

477
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,119
is much more fun.

478
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,439
came to turn myself in per my arrest warrant.

479
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,359
Please wait for the officer in charge of the case.

480
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,079
It's okay.

481
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,239
You have assets.

482
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,599
You also turned yourself in

483
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,159
You will be get out on bail

484
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,159
The victim withdrew the complaint.

485
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,839
Everything was a misunderstanding

486
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,039
Regardless,l have to take legal action against Mr. Rome for carrying a gun.

487
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,759
And Mr. Kula chart for filing a false complaint

488
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,479
As for the case on my side

489
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,719
my lawyer will be the one to handle it.

490
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,679
As for Mr, Rome's case,

491
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,239
I will bail him out.

492
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,239
Consider it a generosity from me

493
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,439
of taking good care of my daughter.

494
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,359
You also allowed me to reunite with my long lost daughter.

495
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,559
For this gratitude

496
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,039
I will repay you.

497
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,439
Ka molt at!

498
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,439
Don't Boss!

499
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,479
It's okay dear.

500
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,079
know you hate me.

501
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,479
If you want to kick me, punch me,

502
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,679
go ahead.

503
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,279
I give in, little brother.

504
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,319
Who's your brother?

505
00:30:59,040 --> 00:30:59,919
Rome!

506
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,599
Boss don't!

507
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:01,999
Calm down!

508
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:04,679
Tian.

509
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,559
You're willing to take the hit for him?!

510
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,679
I think you should you go calm yourself down in a cell linstead

511
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,999
Unless you want to be charged with dispute in a government office?

512
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:15,999
Lieutenant, Sergeant.

513
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:16,519
Yes?

514
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,559
Take him.

515
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,319
Wait.

516
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:20,559
Tian.

517
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,079
This kind of person

518
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,759
can't be anyone's father.

519
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,759
His fatherhood

520
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:30,479
can't compare to what Chai and Thom ya had for you!

521
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,359
You're being lied to.

522
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,959
Enough Boss.

523
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,159
From now on,

524
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,039
the beef between Taks as ut and Pak an ant

525
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,439
should end right here.

526
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,359
Let's not create any more karma for each other.

527
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:49,759
Take him away.

528
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,999
Don't believe him Tian. He's lying

529
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,679
He's lying to you Tian

530
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,599
Tian.

531
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,959
This room is the servant'sroom

532
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,879
We have plenty of guest rooms in the house.

533
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,119
You can sleep in those.

534
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,239
As for your personal room, I will get right to it

535
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,799
If you want me to live here

536
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,559
I'll do chores in return and stay in this room.

537
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,439
I want to rest.

538
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,679
I'm tired.

539
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,519
Okay

540
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:49,839
Ow.

541
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,239
Is that you Tian?

542
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,559
It's me.

543
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:01,999
Go lock the door.

544
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,319
Okay.

545
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,839
So it turns out Tian is your daughter.

546
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,719
No wonder,

547
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,879
Mr. Rome took her in

548
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,159
to get revenge on you.

549
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,639
In the end,he ends up getting stabbed in the back

550
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,519
A bad person.will always be defeated by his own actions

551
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,399
If Rome didn't slander me

552
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,799
Tian would've...

553
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,959
accepted me as her father by now

554
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,639
You don't think I'm that evil, do you?

555
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,759
Who can even think that?

556
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,999
You're actually quite kind and generous

557
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,719
Same for Tian.

558
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,879
She's kind!

559
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,639
So to make Tian accept you,

560
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,599
it won't be difficult.

561
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,479
I'm not..

562
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,159
just kind.

563
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,999
I'm also gentle and pay fast.

564
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,199
What are you doing?!

565
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:22,999
Hey.

566
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,359
If you can make Tian accept me as her father,

567
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,799
I will reward you.

568
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,439
I wonder how Rome is doing right now.

569
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,359
He deserves it

570
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,399
He's just sitting in the cell saying nothing

571
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,919
So how can the police help him?

572
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,519
They're going to get kicked just like he did with Ka molt at.

573
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,359
Probably just spit ing life.

574
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,399
But it's okay. We can go bail him out tomorrow.

575
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,879
If it were me,

576
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,719
I would punch Ka mol tat too.

577
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,239
He was pretending to seek attention from Tian

578
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,959
Why didn't you bring Tian back after you found her?

579
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,719
Where is she?

580
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,519
Tian went to go live with Ka molt at.

581
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,719
How did she end up with him?!

582
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,279
He's an evil capitalist!

583
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,839
You know how evil he is!

584
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,079
Listen to me first Jane.

585
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,719
Tian approached Ka molt at herself

586
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,119
We couldn't do anything about it.

587
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,679
If no one goes,

588
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,159
then l'll go solo

589
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,279
He's a famous guy.

590
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,079
It won't be hard to find his house.

591
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,759
Jane.

592
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,279
Stop being crazy.

593
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,999
Do you want to go to jail as well?

594
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,679
Don't bother me!

595
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,479
Calm down Jane

596
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,839
We will go bail Rome out tomorrow.

597
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,519
Then we'll figure out what to do.

598
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,319
Rome.

599
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,999
Be reasonable

600
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,199
What's the point of being in there?

601
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,439
There are people who love you

602
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,519
and are waiting for you out here.

603
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,959
I'm sorry everyone

604
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,399
You must be tired.

605
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,039
Go rest.

606
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,399
Thankyou for dropping me off.

607
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,599
Anything else you need help with?

608
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,399
I already feel too considerate

609
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,279
Tian.

610
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,119
Mr. Kamol tat is in bad shape.

611
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,839
He's calling for you.

612
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,639
Wake up.

613
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,919
Tian is here.

614
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:21,959
Hey.

615
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,479
What's wrong with him?

616
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,279
Since you've been discharged

617
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,159
your myasthenia has improved

618
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,119
Why do you have to pretend to be sicker?

619
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,879
You want me to lie to our daughter

620
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,359
that you...

621
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,359
have terminal brain tumor?

622
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,199
Tian won't believe it

623
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:49,959
That's why

624
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,719
your job is to convince Tian that I am really sick

625
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,039
If you want me to lie to Tian,

626
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,039
I won't do it.

627
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:06,479
Are you going to let Chart just spend all of our money?

628
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,759
This is the only way that Tian will accept us as her parents

629
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,279
If you won't help me,

630
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,519
there's a possibility that Taks as ut

631
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,999
will have nothing left.

632
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,479
What about Kula chart?

633
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,399
What will happen to him?

634
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,879
I pity him.

635
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,279
Gosh!

636
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,439
Don't worry

637
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,159
I won't let him starve like a dog ac on the streets.li promise

638
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,999

639
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:48,719
Yes :

640
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,879
To make things easier

641
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,439
Terminal brain tumor?

642
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,879
Ever since

643
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,319
your father was attacked

644
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,439
at the police station

645
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,279
his condition has worsen.

646
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,599
He won't be with us for long.

647
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:22,719
Tian.

648
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,199
It's good you're here.

649
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,119
I have one last favor to ask from you

650
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,439
Can Pit and I

651
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,919
do our jobs as'parents for you?

652
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,119
I want to certify you as our child.

653
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,079
Our daughter

654
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,159
I don't want that.

655
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,599
I don't want to hurt Kula chart.

656
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,599
Don't worry about him

657
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,639
He loves you

658
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,799
He will understand

659
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,159
I want to make'this legal

660
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:06,879

663
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,279

howe vil Kamolt at is?

676

He will kill Tian

and definitely claim the inheritance as the father,

678
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,279
