P But today your embrace feels empty

00:00:35,543 --> 00:00:38,862
P The word love that doesn't seem sincere

6
00:00:39,143 --> 00:00:42,422
P The closer you get, the further you are away

Tian

17
00:01:41,903 --> 00:01:43,142
Why did you do this Mon?

18
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:45,542
What do you want me to explain

19
00:01:45,703 --> 00:01:48,102
when you believe Je ab?

20
00:01:48,223 --> 00:01:49,942
The police will be here to question us and you...

21
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:52,022
must stay and give them your statement.

22
00:01:52,103 --> 00:01:53,022
Fine.

23
00:01:54,103 --> 00:01:56,102
But for my fairness,

24
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:58,502
I'd like to speak to my lawyer first.

25
00:01:59,783 --> 00:02:00,942
As for Ms. T hip,

26
00:02:02,023 --> 00:02:04,822
she has to go give her statement to the police with me.

27
00:02:04,943 --> 00:02:06,902
So they will know Tian's background.

28
00:02:07,063 --> 00:02:09,102
What did ldo to Ka molt at?

29
00:02:09,823 --> 00:02:13,222
Why did he make Chan come kill me?

30
00:02:13,423 --> 00:02:16,062
Because you're Ka mol tat'sdaughter

31
00:02:16,343 --> 00:02:17,462
Mr Lak.

32
00:02:19,063 --> 00:02:20,782
What are you talking about?

33
00:02:22,143 --> 00:02:23,822
How could you let Mon go?

34
00:02:23,983 --> 00:02:25,662
She almost killed all of us

35
00:02:28,063 --> 00:02:30,022
I don't know what Mon knows about Tian.

36
00:02:30,663 --> 00:02:31,782
If the police knows.

37
00:02:32,503 --> 00:02:33,942
everyone will know the truth about Tian.

38
00:02:34,943 --> 00:02:35,902
So?

39
00:02:36,783 --> 00:02:38,702
Someday everyone will know

40
00:02:38,983 --> 00:02:41,102
Go see Tian and tell her the truth.

41
00:02:41,263 --> 00:02:42,662
So all of this can end

42
00:02:42,863 --> 00:02:44,782
So the evil can be punished

43
00:02:47,463 --> 00:02:48,262
Rome.

44
00:02:48,703 --> 00:02:49,742
Women

45
00:02:49,823 --> 00:02:52,502
rather hear the truth from the person they love.

46
00:03:04,983 --> 00:03:07,022
Because you were born a girl,

47
00:03:07,383 --> 00:03:09,742
he switched you with Kula chart

48
00:03:10,063 --> 00:03:12,022
Chai and Tho my a'sson

49
00:03:12,783 --> 00:03:14,782
So he can get the inheritance from the will.

50
00:03:15,903 --> 00:03:17,862
Is this a joke?

51
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:19,782
If you don't believe me,

52
00:03:20,703 --> 00:03:22,182
call Rome.

53
00:03:40,983 --> 00:03:42,582
You're that shocked?

54
00:03:45,263 --> 00:03:47,502
Why are you so cruel like this?

55
00:03:48,863 --> 00:03:51,782
Why did you join hands with Ka molt at to hurt me, hurt everyone?

56
00:03:52,223 --> 00:03:54,462
I thought you said you love Boss?

57
00:03:54,703 --> 00:03:56,742
He almost died!

58
00:03:58,423 --> 00:03:59,342
Oh Tian...

59
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,662
you are so stupid.

60
00:04:03,063 --> 00:04:04,542
If I wasn't there,

61
00:04:04,943 --> 00:04:08,502
your boss would probably have died by now.

62
00:04:09,223 --> 00:04:10,702
I'll tell you something

63
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:14,582
Everything that has happened was because of you.

64
00:04:15,143 --> 00:04:18,222
Ka molt at wanted your life.

65
00:04:18,343 --> 00:04:20,942
Because you're his biological daughter

66
00:04:22,103 --> 00:04:22,742
That's not true

67
00:04:23,303 --> 00:04:24,142
You're lying.

68
00:04:24,663 --> 00:04:27,462
No matter how cruel I am,

69
00:04:28,103 --> 00:04:30,342
I was willing to tell you the truth.

70
00:04:31,223 --> 00:04:33,302
Unlike your angel.

71
00:04:33,623 --> 00:04:35,782
Pretends to be a good person

72
00:04:35,903 --> 00:04:37,862
but lies to you and keeps secrets

73
00:04:38,303 --> 00:04:40,502
to use you for revenge.

74
00:04:43,263 --> 00:04:44,342
There's no way.

75
00:04:45,623 --> 00:04:47,702
Boss would never lie to me.

76
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:52,182
You poor thing.

77
00:04:53,063 --> 00:04:55,182
How pitiful of you.

78
00:04:56,143 --> 00:04:57,782
Look Tian.

79
00:04:58,863 --> 00:05:00,662
I will make you

80
00:05:01,063 --> 00:05:02,862
a little smarter

81
00:05:25,503 --> 00:05:25,982
Tian.

82
00:05:29,303 --> 00:05:30,382
Where did you go?

83
00:05:33,143 --> 00:05:33,622
Tian.

84
00:05:42,423 --> 00:05:43,862
Chan is resting in peace now.

85
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,222
Chan.

86
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:17,302
Tian.

87
00:06:29,463 --> 00:06:30,742
It's okay.

88
00:06:31,623 --> 00:06:33,382
Chan is resting in peace now.

89
00:06:51,783 --> 00:06:52,862
Are you hungry?

90
00:06:53,063 --> 00:06:54,542
I'll go make something for you to eat.

91
00:06:57,263 --> 00:06:57,742
Yeah.

92
00:07:17,183 --> 00:07:18,102
Boss.

93
00:07:32,263 --> 00:07:33,822
At Rome's desk,

94
00:07:34,183 --> 00:07:36,622
there's all the evidence that you want.

95
00:07:37,063 --> 00:07:38,822
Go see for yourself.

96
00:07:39,503 --> 00:07:40,902
Then you will know

97
00:07:41,183 --> 00:07:43,542
who is the one lying to you

98
00:08:33,343 --> 00:08:34,422
TS.

99
00:08:36,463 --> 00:08:37,502
Taks as ut.

100
00:09:44,143 --> 00:09:45,422
What did the police say?

101
00:09:45,823 --> 00:09:47,182
Will we be charged with anything?

102
00:09:47,343 --> 00:09:49,662
The workers and I told them what really happened

103
00:09:50,343 --> 00:09:51,782
It was self defense

104
00:09:52,863 --> 00:09:54,542
There will be more questioning later

105
00:09:57,703 --> 00:09:58,142
Pa

106
00:09:58,143 --> 00:09:58,822
Where's Tian?

107
00:09:59,063 --> 00:09:59,902
She's awake.

108
00:10:00,023 --> 00:10:01,462
I'm bringing her porridge

109
00:10:01,863 --> 00:10:03,982
But from the looks of it, she's still shocked

110
00:10:04,423 --> 00:10:05,782
How pitiful of Tian.

111
00:10:06,303 --> 00:10:07,702
She lost her brother

112
00:10:08,223 --> 00:10:09,542
No matter how bad he was,

113
00:10:09,783 --> 00:10:10,982
she still loved him.

114
00:10:12,823 --> 00:10:13,942
I'll bring this to her.

115
00:10:14,863 --> 00:10:15,422
Rome

116
00:10:16,063 --> 00:10:17,822
Tian almost died!

117
00:10:18,943 --> 00:10:22,262
If you can't put those people who harassed her in prison,

118
00:10:22,423 --> 00:10:23,862
then I will.

119
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:26,702
And I will take her out of here.

120
00:10:34,303 --> 00:10:34,982
Lak.

121
00:10:35,463 --> 00:10:37,542
You haven't told Tian, right?

122
00:10:39,543 --> 00:10:40,422
Lak!

123
00:10:40,503 --> 00:10:41,702
Wait Lak!

124
00:10:42,543 --> 00:10:42,982
Hey!

125
00:10:43,503 --> 00:10:45,302
What's wrong with the men in this house?

126
00:11:03,823 --> 00:11:04,662
Boss.

127
00:11:05,183 --> 00:11:06,502
Pa made you porridge

128
00:11:07,223 --> 00:11:08,342
Eat it so you can take your medicine.

129
00:11:09,663 --> 00:11:10,582
Thank you.

130
00:11:30,703 --> 00:11:32,622
I'm sorry for everything Tian

131
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:39,342
It's not your fault.

132
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,582
It is.

133
00:11:43,983 --> 00:11:45,022
It's my fault.

134
00:11:46,783 --> 00:11:48,742
That's why things have escalated this far.

135
00:11:54,863 --> 00:11:56,542
J need to tell you something important.

136
00:12:01,983 --> 00:12:03,182
The truth is...

137
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,262
I know.

138
00:12:07,663 --> 00:12:08,822
You know?

139
00:12:11,863 --> 00:12:12,502
Yes.

140
00:12:14,103 --> 00:12:15,182
I know that

141
00:12:15,303 --> 00:12:17,702
you did it because you had good intentions.

142
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:21,262
As for..

143
00:12:21,863 --> 00:12:22,782
other things,

144
00:12:23,183 --> 00:12:24,502
I don't want to know.

145
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:27,822
Tian, it's...

146
00:12:28,383 --> 00:12:29,542
Can

147
00:12:30,063 --> 00:12:31,982
ask for a favor?

148
00:12:37,143 --> 00:12:37,902
Sure.

149
00:12:39,743 --> 00:12:40,782
What do you want?

150
00:13:08,463 --> 00:13:09,582
I'm right here Boss

151
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,382
Why did you come by yourself?

152
00:13:14,063 --> 00:13:14,982
Where's your men?

153
00:13:19,343 --> 00:13:20,342
I'm sorry.

154
00:13:20,703 --> 00:13:21,902
I messed up.

155
00:13:22,223 --> 00:13:22,942
I know.

156
00:13:24,623 --> 00:13:25,902
Rome survived

157
00:13:28,143 --> 00:13:28,742
What about Tian?

158
00:13:30,263 --> 00:13:31,462
Tian survived

159
00:13:32,143 --> 00:13:32,862
Wait.

160
00:13:34,383 --> 00:13:35,702
What did you say?

161
00:13:35,863 --> 00:13:37,222
Tian survived?

162
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,742
What do you mean?

163
00:13:41,623 --> 00:13:43,342
did try to kill her like you told me to.

164
00:13:43,903 --> 00:13:44,702
Bastard!

165
00:13:47,863 --> 00:13:48,662
Boss!

166
00:13:48,943 --> 00:13:50,502
I didn't tell you to kill Tian!

167
00:13:54,823 --> 00:13:55,942
I'm sorry.

168
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:57,582
I did it

169
00:13:57,983 --> 00:13:59,102
for you.

170
00:14:01,063 --> 00:14:02,302
Get out of my face.

171
00:14:02,863 --> 00:14:04,022
If I don't need you,

172
00:14:04,263 --> 00:14:05,462
don't show your face!

173
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:11,142
Boss.

174
00:14:12,783 --> 00:14:15,462
The police are hunting me right now.

175
00:14:16,663 --> 00:14:17,622
I have to go into hiding

176
00:14:20,063 --> 00:14:22,262
Can I have the rest of my payment?

177
00:14:23,103 --> 00:14:24,302
You failed at your job

178
00:14:24,623 --> 00:14:25,982
You went beyond orders.

179
00:14:26,863 --> 00:14:28,342
And you have the nerves to ask me for money?

180
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:29,342
Here!

181
00:14:30,183 --> 00:14:31,302
I only have bullets!

182
00:14:31,783 --> 00:14:32,502
You want it?

183
00:14:33,383 --> 00:14:34,422
If not, get going!

184
00:14:35,543 --> 00:14:36,262
Go!

185
00:14:37,623 --> 00:14:38,182
Boss.

186
00:14:40,223 --> 00:14:41,022
I'm sorry.

187
00:14:58,383 --> 00:14:59,982
Your time is up Ka molt at.

188
00:15:01,183 --> 00:15:03,782
It's time to pay for the karma you have caused!

189
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,622
What are you talking about?

190
00:15:05,743 --> 00:15:06,822
I don't know anything.

191
00:15:07,463 --> 00:15:09,622
Pats a korn confessed to all the evil deeds

192
00:15:10,023 --> 00:15:11,302
that you did.

193
00:15:12,183 --> 00:15:13,742
I don't know anything.

194
00:15:14,103 --> 00:15:16,862
-Whatever Pat did, have him admit to that!
Don't be'stubborn!

195
00:15:20,103 --> 00:15:21,382
I know the truth now.

196
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:24,422
Tian is your daughter,

197
00:15:25,143 --> 00:15:25,902
Ka molt at.

198
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:29,302
You loser. You can fake a document!

199
00:15:32,143 --> 00:15:33,302
I told Kula chart the truth already.

200
00:15:36,023 --> 00:15:37,182
I always thought

201
00:15:37,543 --> 00:15:39,222
that my daughter

202
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:41,022
died from this world.

203
00:15:41,103 --> 00:15:41,982
But finally,

204
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,422
heaven have mercy

205
00:15:45,983 --> 00:15:48,062
It allowed me to meet my daughter.

206
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,022
Tian,

207
00:15:51,663 --> 00:15:52,982
My daughter.

208
00:15:53,623 --> 00:15:54,822
Tian.

209
00:16:08,863 --> 00:16:10,182
How can you'do this to me?

210
00:16:15,023 --> 00:16:16,422
You're cruel.

211
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:25,782
Mr. Ka molt at, please come down to the station for questioning.

212
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:28,942
We have evidence that you and Pats a korn

213
00:16:29,503 --> 00:16:32,102
jointly committed multiple cases of intentional murder.

214
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:37,582
I'm sorry Boss.

215
00:16:40,463 --> 00:16:41,142
Pat!

216
00:16:41,623 --> 00:16:42,622
Ungrateful bastard!

217
00:16:47,463 --> 00:16:48,822
Come and catch me then!

218
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:51,982
Put the gun down Mr. Ka molt at!

219
00:16:52,023 --> 00:16:52,982
Don't come near me!

220
00:16:53,143 --> 00:16:53,742
Put the gun down!

221
00:17:03,303 --> 00:17:04,062
Slowly.

222
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:11,622
How are you?

223
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:12,702
Are you hurt anywhere?

224
00:17:15,103 --> 00:17:16,502
I'm fine.

225
00:17:17,423 --> 00:17:19,902
Where are Rome and the police?

226
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:21,622
Pat too.

227
00:17:22,703 --> 00:17:24,782
Where's Tian? Is she with you?

228
00:17:25,463 --> 00:17:26,902
There's no one.

229
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,982
You fell asleep and probably had a bad dream

230
00:17:31,023 --> 00:17:36,262
Yesterday you came home and said you were stressed about the land by the sea.

231
00:17:36,703 --> 00:17:38,022
And about Pats a korn

232
00:17:38,383 --> 00:17:41,582
You also said no one is to disturb you

233
00:17:44,143 --> 00:17:45,422
What about Kula chart?

234
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,022
Where is he?

235
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:53,862
Awesome!

236
00:17:54,063 --> 00:17:56,022
Heaven exist!

237
00:18:04,463 --> 00:18:05,542
There.

238
00:18:05,903 --> 00:18:07,702
I didn't finish my sentence.

239
00:18:08,103 --> 00:18:12,462
God and angel has appeared before me!

240
00:18:16,343 --> 00:18:17,502
Bastard!

241
00:18:17,503 --> 00:18:18,542
Stop!

242
00:18:18,623 --> 00:18:21,622
Don't stop him Mom.

243
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:28,582
Father has great kindness.

244
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,582
He let me be born..

245
00:18:32,703 --> 00:18:34,662
as a Taks as ut

246
00:18:35,783 --> 00:18:37,902
I'm so happy!

247
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,262
I get to taste the flavor of his hand

248
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,462
and foot

249
00:18:42,703 --> 00:18:44,582
since l was a kid!

250
00:18:46,663 --> 00:18:47,582
Slap me.

251
00:18:48,463 --> 00:18:50,222
Or else I ill suffocate

252
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:51,622
Slap me.

253
00:18:52,103 --> 00:18:52,902
Go ahead.

254
00:18:53,103 --> 00:18:53,982
Slap me!

255
00:18:54,103 --> 00:18:54,822
Hey!

256
00:18:58,783 --> 00:18:59,862
How did you raise him

257
00:19:00,063 --> 00:19:01,622
to let him smoke marijuana in the house?!

258
00:19:02,983 --> 00:19:04,702
At least.

259
00:19:05,303 --> 00:19:08,702
he won't be wandering outside

260
00:19:09,463 --> 00:19:12,022
He's safer inside the house.

261
00:19:12,823 --> 00:19:13,662
That's not true!

262
00:19:14,783 --> 00:19:17,182
I'm safest with Tian.

263
00:19:18,063 --> 00:19:20,302
She's brave and I can rely on her

264
00:19:20,383 --> 00:19:22,102
No accusations.

265
00:19:23,183 --> 00:19:24,782
Tian.

266
00:19:27,903 --> 00:19:29,742
There's only Tian

267
00:19:29,983 --> 00:19:31,782
that can help Kula chart.

268
00:19:32,103 --> 00:19:34,022
Both mother and'son are so insisting!

269
00:19:34,823 --> 00:19:35,942
Don't worry

270
00:19:36,463 --> 00:19:37,742
Tian will.come back

271
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:39,622
When.she does,

272
00:19:40,663 --> 00:19:42,022
hell will break loose.

273
00:19:42,423 --> 00:19:43,822
Hell for all'of us!

274
00:19:52,623 --> 00:19:53,542
Tian!

275
00:19:55,663 --> 00:19:56,742
Hey Pa!

276
00:19:57,143 --> 00:19:58,462
I don't know where Tian went.

277
00:19:58,463 --> 00:19:59,622
Rome as well

278
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:04,062
Rome took her somewhere for a few days.

279
00:20:04,103 --> 00:20:05,182
Don't worry.

280
00:20:07,183 --> 00:20:08,702
Why did he take her?

281
00:20:08,903 --> 00:20:10,702
Why didn't he just tell us the truth?

282
00:20:11,183 --> 00:20:12,022
Why make things so secrecy?

283
00:20:15,143 --> 00:20:16,782
You don't trust Rome?

284
00:20:17,543 --> 00:20:18,662
I don't know.

285
00:20:18,743 --> 00:20:20,862
Rome knows that l love Tian

286
00:20:20,903 --> 00:20:23,222
He might have gotten jealous and hid her somewhere.

287
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:24,702
So that Tian and I can't see each other.

288
00:20:26,063 --> 00:20:27,422
That's ridiculous.

289
00:20:28,343 --> 00:20:31,462
It's ridiculous because of Rome,not me

290
00:20:31,623 --> 00:20:32,982
He needs to say what he wants

291
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,942
He can't act like a possessive dog.

292
00:20:35,143 --> 00:20:37,342
This time, lm not going to give in to him

293
00:20:37,463 --> 00:20:39,102
and one of us is going down.

294
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:48,702
We're going to stay here today

295
00:20:49,783 --> 00:20:50,902
How?

296
00:20:51,743 --> 00:20:54,582
Isn't it better l go rent a room at a resort for us?

297
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,582
Don't you remember

298
00:20:56,783 --> 00:20:58,942
that it just has to be us?

299
00:20:59,983 --> 00:21:02,182
Besides,you have a tent in your trunk

300
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:09,662
Connect the string...

301
00:21:10,463 --> 00:21:11,942
to the base.

302
00:21:13,383 --> 00:21:14,622
I have to connect the poles first.

303
00:21:18,103 --> 00:21:25,542
Subtitles by oh sweet haven.com Timing by Angel Lakorns

304
00:22:52,543 --> 00:22:53,262
Tian!

305
00:22:53,743 --> 00:22:55,342
Don't go any deeper! It's dangerous!

306
00:22:59,903 --> 00:23:00,422
Tian!

307
00:23:52,023 --> 00:23:53,102
Are you sleepy?

308
00:23:55,423 --> 00:23:56,142
No.

309
00:23:57,063 --> 00:23:58,582
I'm just thinking about.

310
00:23:59,223 --> 00:24:00,502
the first day we met.

311
00:24:03,703 --> 00:24:06,022
The first day I met you

312
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:10,262
I thought you were a strict and stressed person.

313
00:24:13,183 --> 00:24:14,702
When I first met you

314
00:24:16,423 --> 00:24:17,742
I thought you were a boy.

315
00:24:22,143 --> 00:24:25,062
But I think I was wrong

316
00:24:25,303 --> 00:24:26,542
The truth is you're a kind father figure

317
00:24:30,223 --> 00:24:31,662
You love your siblings.

318
00:24:32,063 --> 00:24:32,982
your friends,

319
00:24:35,063 --> 00:24:36,342
and a good care taker.

320
00:24:45,663 --> 00:24:46,982
I'm not a good person.

321
00:24:50,063 --> 00:24:52,302
I'm just a bad person who is selfish.

322
00:24:54,943 --> 00:24:55,462
I'm...

323
00:24:55,623 --> 00:24:56,822
What star is that?

324
00:25:01,063 --> 00:25:01,982
Where?

325
00:25:02,943 --> 00:25:04,022
Over there.

326
00:25:04,183 --> 00:25:07,262
That bright sparkling pink one.

327
00:25:08,583 --> 00:25:09,142
Oh.

328
00:25:10,143 --> 00:25:11,942
If it's that bright, then it's a satellite.

329
00:25:12,743 --> 00:25:14,582
Oh, is that so?

330
00:25:35,303 --> 00:25:36,982
You once asked me

331
00:25:39,143 --> 00:25:40,822
why am I looking after you

332
00:25:42,863 --> 00:25:44,342
and took you in.

333
00:25:47,623 --> 00:25:48,582
The truth is...

334
00:25:50,863 --> 00:25:53,582
I'm getting sleepy, I'm going to bed now.

335
00:25:56,623 --> 00:25:57,342
Tian.

336
00:26:17,143 --> 00:26:18,422
You're asleep?

337
00:27:32,303 --> 00:27:34,262
I don't want to know anything.

338
00:27:36,583 --> 00:27:37,862
I just know that

339
00:27:38,543 --> 00:27:41,422
I am Chai and Tho my a's daughter.

340
00:27:43,503 --> 00:27:45,702
Your little Tian

341
00:27:48,263 --> 00:27:50,342
I don't need anything else.

342
00:27:58,583 --> 00:28:00,222
If I can go back in time,

343
00:28:03,823 --> 00:28:05,542
I wouldn't have done this Tian.

344
00:28:08,463 --> 00:28:09,382
I'm sorry.

345
00:28:17,903 --> 00:28:20,942
If Rome have said he loves Tian

346
00:28:20,943 --> 00:28:22,422
things wouldn't have been this way

347
00:28:23,943 --> 00:28:25,302
Lak is also strange.

348
00:28:25,503 --> 00:28:27,622
He can't tell that Tian also loves Rome?

349
00:28:27,903 --> 00:28:32,222
What can he do since Rome hasn't been transparent from the beginning?

350
00:28:33,063 --> 00:28:33,862
Lak...

351
00:28:34,183 --> 00:28:36,782
doesn't want to steal his brother'sgirl.

352
00:28:37,183 --> 00:28:38,982
But he's already in love with her.

353
00:28:39,223 --> 00:28:40,742
That's why he's willing to take the risk.

354
00:28:41,823 --> 00:28:44,342
Being heartbroken is better than not trying.

355
00:28:45,343 --> 00:28:48,102
But regardless, how is Lak going to find them?

356
00:28:48,103 --> 00:28:50,222
Those two have turned off their phones.

357
00:28:51,503 --> 00:28:52,742
I think

358
00:28:53,703 --> 00:28:55,542
this is beyond our control.

359
00:28:56,583 --> 00:28:59,222
Leave it to fate.

360
00:29:02,463 --> 00:29:04,382
won't get involved anymore.

361
00:29:05,183 --> 00:29:06,862
What's wrong with you today?

362
00:29:06,903 --> 00:29:09,542
Why do you sound fearless?

363
00:29:31,143 --> 00:29:32,262
Do you want to go anywhere today?

364
00:29:33,423 --> 00:29:35,782
Do you want to go into town to eat with Pao and Pa?

365
00:29:36,223 --> 00:29:37,182
Or you want to go home?

366
00:29:38,103 --> 00:29:38,742
No.

367
00:29:39,183 --> 00:29:40,582
I don't want to go anywhere.

368
00:29:41,223 --> 00:29:43,142
I just want to be alone with you

369
00:29:45,863 --> 00:29:46,742
Up to you.

370
00:29:48,583 --> 00:29:50,022
From now on l won't force you

371
00:29:50,543 --> 00:29:51,902
to do anything anymore.

372
00:30:49,343 --> 00:30:50,662
Both turned off their phones

373
00:30:54,823 --> 00:30:56,102
What the hell?

374
00:31:00,383 --> 00:31:01,062
Tian.

375
00:31:01,183 --> 00:31:02,702
L'et me help you

376
00:31:02,863 --> 00:31:04,342
So you can walk more comfortably

377
00:31:04,583 --> 00:31:05,542
That's okay.

378
00:31:05,583 --> 00:31:08,862
You can wait until I find a lot of wood

379
00:31:10,823 --> 00:31:11,982
What kind of girl are you?

380
00:31:12,983 --> 00:31:14,902
Where did you get this strength from?

381
00:31:15,063 --> 00:31:15,862
I'm tough.

382
00:31:18,463 --> 00:31:19,302
Tian!

383
00:31:28,183 --> 00:31:29,302
Stop showing off

384
00:31:39,863 --> 00:31:41,342
It'll fall on your feet.

385
00:31:43,543 --> 00:31:44,342
I'm sorry.

386
00:31:44,663 --> 00:31:45,022
Are you hurt?

387
00:31:45,063 --> 00:31:45,862
No.

388
00:31:53,943 --> 00:31:54,302
In that case,

389
00:31:54,943 --> 00:31:56,542
just take this much wood

390
00:31:56,743 --> 00:31:57,782
and go back to our spot.

391
00:31:57,943 --> 00:31:59,182
You can start the fire.

392
00:31:59,263 --> 00:32:00,462
I'll find more wood.

393
00:32:01,183 --> 00:32:01,982
Okay.

394
00:32:05,663 --> 00:32:06,702
Be careful

395
00:32:06,743 --> 00:32:07,822
Okay.

396
00:32:33,983 --> 00:32:34,902
Sir.

397
00:32:37,503 --> 00:32:38,182
Pardon me.

398
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:41,262
I have something urgent to speak to you about.

399
00:32:41,863 --> 00:32:43,662
I couldn't get a hold of your lawyer

400
00:32:43,983 --> 00:32:45,862
so I took the liberty to come over here

401
00:32:46,743 --> 00:32:47,582
Okay.

402
00:32:47,623 --> 00:32:49,502
Please have a seat

403
00:32:54,903 --> 00:32:59,062
Whatever it is, you can tell me. I'm willing to cooperate

404
00:33:12,863 --> 00:33:15,102
The police in Ranong has an arrest warrant for Pats a korn

405
00:33:15,463 --> 00:33:16,782
for attempted murder,

406
00:33:16,903 --> 00:33:17,542
trespassing,

407
00:33:17,623 --> 00:33:18,822
and assault

408
00:33:20,543 --> 00:33:21,422
What?

409
00:33:22,023 --> 00:33:22,862
Pat?

410
00:33:23,663 --> 00:33:26,822
Pat is my advisor.

411
00:33:26,823 --> 00:33:29,662
He's not that-kind of person. He's not a criminal

412
00:33:30,623 --> 00:33:32,902
Pats a korn is an acquaintance of yours

413
00:33:33,503 --> 00:33:35,502
You have issues with Mr. Rome.

414
00:33:35,903 --> 00:33:37,142
So I'm just curious.

415
00:33:37,943 --> 00:33:41,622
I'm curious if you have anything to do with this case or not.

416
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,142
It's very strange.

417
00:33:43,983 --> 00:33:46,142
Two of Pats a korn's men have died.

418
00:33:46,263 --> 00:33:48,662
One of them is a local named Chan

419
00:33:50,143 --> 00:33:51,302
Officer

420
00:33:51,583 --> 00:33:52,902
It's not right of you to say that.

421
00:33:53,023 --> 00:33:56,422
You're saying that I was in on it with Pat.

422
00:33:56,903 --> 00:33:59,222
I'm a businessman.

423
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:00,182
Not a thug.

424
00:34:00,223 --> 00:34:02,262
J don't even know this person named Chan.

425
00:34:05,303 --> 00:34:06,382
Mr. Ka molt at.

426
00:34:07,103 --> 00:34:09,862
Do you know where Pats a korn is at right now?

427
00:34:10,183 --> 00:34:11,182
I don't.

428
00:34:11,303 --> 00:34:14,142
If you guys know, tell me because I want to know too.

429
00:34:14,503 --> 00:34:15,462
Mr. Ka molt at.

430
00:34:15,823 --> 00:34:17,782
If you can get a hold of your lawyer,

431
00:34:18,343 --> 00:34:20,942
please come down to the station for more questioning.

432
00:34:21,743 --> 00:34:23,742
If there's anything, I can talk to you

433
00:34:23,943 --> 00:34:25,782
while your lawyer is present.

434
00:34:26,703 --> 00:34:27,622
Excuse me now.

435
00:34:29,143 --> 00:34:29,862
Let's go.

436
00:34:36,263 --> 00:34:39,022
Did you really sent Uncle Pats a korn and his men to attack Rome?

437
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:40,782
Did Chan really die?

438
00:34:41,623 --> 00:34:43,142
Chan once told me

439
00:34:43,743 --> 00:34:45,422
that Tian isn't really his sister.

440
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:46,902
His parents adopted her

441
00:34:47,223 --> 00:34:48,502
How is Tian doing right now?!

442
00:34:49,463 --> 00:34:50,582
Stop talking!

443
00:34:50,783 --> 00:34:51,862
I said l didn't do it!

444
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:53,862
- I didn't order it!
-Dad!

445
00:34:54,903 --> 00:34:55,582
Ka molt at!

446
00:34:55,623 --> 00:34:55,982
Dad.

447
00:34:56,023 --> 00:34:56,782
Ka molt at!

448
00:34:56,823 --> 00:34:57,742
Hey!
Dad!

449
00:34:57,903 --> 00:34:58,582
Hey!

450
00:35:01,503 --> 00:35:01,902
Dad!

451
00:35:01,943 --> 00:35:02,942
Hey!

452
00:35:15,023 --> 00:35:16,902
You fainted at the house.

453
00:35:17,463 --> 00:35:19,142
So I brought you to the hospital.

454
00:35:20,983 --> 00:35:22,182
What did the doctor say?

455
00:35:23,303 --> 00:35:24,782
Old symptoms recur.

456
00:35:24,983 --> 00:35:26,022
Diabetes

457
00:35:26,143 --> 00:35:27,302
and high blood pressure.

458
00:35:27,743 --> 00:35:30,422
You need to be careful of what you eat now.

459
00:35:31,223 --> 00:35:32,302
You can't stress.

460
00:35:32,823 --> 00:35:34,222
Must regularly take your medicine.

461
00:35:35,103 --> 00:35:38,462
The doctor also said to lessen your work at the company.

462
00:35:38,943 --> 00:35:39,862
Stupid doctor

463
00:35:40,383 --> 00:35:41,542
Telling me not to work

464
00:35:44,583 --> 00:35:45,902
I'm going to the company.

465
00:35:46,423 --> 00:35:48,862
I'll have them find someone to take your place.

466
00:35:49,863 --> 00:35:51,662
You have to get some rest per doctor'sorder.

467
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:53,822
Wait.

468
00:35:54,823 --> 00:35:57,582
Don't tell anyone lm being hospitalized

469
00:35:58,543 --> 00:36:00,582
The new project is about to launch.

470
00:36:01,503 --> 00:36:03,502
It'l I just affect everything.

471
00:36:19,423 --> 00:36:20,222
Hey.

472
00:36:20,783 --> 00:36:21,782
Who are you guys?!

473
00:36:21,983 --> 00:36:22,902
Why did you capture me?!

474
00:36:23,263 --> 00:36:24,222
Who are we?

475
00:36:25,423 --> 00:36:26,142
You ugly.

476
00:36:29,423 --> 00:36:30,542
Why did you scream?!

477
00:36:30,823 --> 00:36:32,382
I pity him!

478
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:35,062
Gosh! He's guilty so he deserves it!

479
00:36:35,583 --> 00:36:37,702
Confess to the public

480
00:36:38,063 --> 00:36:42,342
that you seduced Tian to go with you to satisfy you and your brother's lust.

481
00:36:42,623 --> 00:36:47,502
Then you will sell Tian off to other men that has the same taste as you.

482
00:36:48,063 --> 00:36:48,862
What the hell are you saying?

483
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:51,502
I never took advantage of Tian.

484
00:36:51,703 --> 00:36:52,982
Go ask Tian if you don't believe me.

485
00:36:54,623 --> 00:36:55,782
What did you say?

486
00:36:56,263 --> 00:36:58,062
You took good care of Tian

487
00:36:58,263 --> 00:37:00,462
and never touched her?

488
00:37:01,903 --> 00:37:05,142
I thought the only hero that existed was Uncle Add Somb at

489
00:37:05,183 --> 00:37:09,182
He's a saint and so handsome!

490
00:37:09,543 --> 00:37:12,102
So handsome? Eat my foot!

491
00:37:13,103 --> 00:37:15,542
You're supposed to interrogate him, not praise him!

492
00:37:16,503 --> 00:37:17,902
Take this!

493
00:37:20,743 --> 00:37:22,542
Next time if you don't tell the truth

494
00:37:22,743 --> 00:37:24,382
it'll be worse for you,

495
00:37:24,663 --> 00:37:25,502
Boss :

496
00:37:28,423 --> 00:37:29,142
Let's go!

497
00:37:30,783 --> 00:37:31,542
Hey.

498
00:37:32,343 --> 00:37:34,742
If Uncle Add'sspirit acknowledges this

499
00:37:34,863 --> 00:37:38,022
may he protect you handsome boy.

500
00:37:38,703 --> 00:37:39,222
Hey!

501
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:53,782
He's lying.

502
00:37:54,503 --> 00:37:58,022
Who would suddenly take in a country girl like this under their care

503
00:37:58,303 --> 00:37:59,862
without wanting anything in return?

504
00:38:01,223 --> 00:38:01,862
es.

505
00:38:02,223 --> 00:38:03,142
Besides

506
00:38:03,263 --> 00:38:06,062
Tian has a good physique and has a beautiful face.

507
00:38:08,183 --> 00:38:09,062
Hey!

508
00:38:09,383 --> 00:38:11,662
We assaulted him

509
00:38:11,743 --> 00:38:13,742
chained and locked him up.

510
00:38:13,903 --> 00:38:16,422
If we get caught, we'll go to jail

511
00:38:16,623 --> 00:38:19,542
I will have no future!

512
00:38:19,583 --> 00:38:20,502
Who cares?

513
00:38:21,463 --> 00:38:22,462
In this world,

514
00:38:22,823 --> 00:38:25,342
nothing is more important to me than Tian

515
00:38:30,743 --> 00:38:33,902
Gosh, why did you guys lock me up?

516
00:38:33,943 --> 00:38:35,342
We're on the same side.

517
00:38:35,463 --> 00:38:36,542
We can't let you go.

518
00:38:37,063 --> 00:38:38,342
Jane's order.

519
00:38:38,383 --> 00:38:39,702
If you escape,

520
00:38:39,743 --> 00:38:41,022
we will be in trouble.

521
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:44,022
I swear

522
00:38:44,223 --> 00:38:45,502
I won't escape.

523
00:38:46,143 --> 00:38:48,582
We don't believe you. You've changed

524
00:38:48,663 --> 00:38:49,462
That's right.

525
00:38:49,543 --> 00:38:50,902
We know you got tricked.

526
00:38:51,143 --> 00:38:52,462
Might be under a spell too.

527
00:38:52,703 --> 00:38:55,302
That's why you only listen to Boss

528
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:56,742
But don't worry.

529
00:38:56,903 --> 00:38:58,622
we will help you.

530
00:38:58,623 --> 00:38:59,702
You'll be cured.

531
00:39:00,103 --> 00:39:00,702
It's just...

532
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:03,502
I'm hungry.

533
00:39:04,143 --> 00:39:06,062
I'll bring you food

534
00:39:06,863 --> 00:39:07,822
No.

535
00:39:08,103 --> 00:39:12,102
I want to make a big plate of pad krap ao.

536
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,062
Also,

537
00:39:13,183 --> 00:39:17,182
add five to six sunny side up eggs.

538
00:39:17,343 --> 00:39:19,062
Just like how we ate on the beach

539
00:39:19,463 --> 00:39:20,702
You want to eat it?

540
00:39:21,463 --> 00:39:22,382
Please?

541
00:39:22,463 --> 00:39:26,422
You can release me to cook for you then you can lock me back up afterwards.

542
00:39:35,223 --> 00:39:36,142
Where are you going Tian?

543
00:39:37,823 --> 00:39:38,702
Jane.

544
00:39:39,183 --> 00:39:40,942
Why do you have to do this to me?

545
00:39:42,863 --> 00:39:44,462
Because I love you.

546
00:39:45,063 --> 00:39:47,862
I'm trying to save you from those bad people

547
00:39:48,023 --> 00:39:48,782
Jane

548
00:39:49,143 --> 00:39:51,462
Boss isn't a bad person like you think.

549
00:39:51,983 --> 00:39:53,822
He's never hurt me nor

550
00:39:53,863 --> 00:39:56,422
harassed me in any way.

551
00:39:57,423 --> 00:39:58,742
Boss is a good -

552
00:39:58,743 --> 00:39:59,662
Tian :

553
00:40:00,263 --> 00:40:02,582
I know you were forced to go and is being threatened

554
00:40:03,423 --> 00:40:04,582
But from now on,

555
00:40:05,343 --> 00:40:06,822
you don't have to be afraid

556
00:40:07,303 --> 00:40:08,622
Stay here

557
00:40:08,783 --> 00:40:10,022
with me.

558
00:40:10,223 --> 00:40:11,582
You will be safe.

559
00:40:13,343 --> 00:40:14,382
Boss

560
00:40:14,783 --> 00:40:17,382
can't come out to hurt you anymore.

561
00:40:20,063 --> 00:40:21,422
What did you do to him?

562
00:40:23,063 --> 00:40:24,582
Where is he right now?

563
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:27,702
Take me to go see him right now!

564
00:40:28,303 --> 00:40:29,782
What did you do to him?!

565
00:40:30,263 --> 00:40:31,022
Jane!

566
00:40:31,103 --> 00:40:31,982
No!

567
00:40:34,583 --> 00:40:35,902
You have to stay here with me!

568
00:40:36,943 --> 00:40:39,222
I will not let you go anywhere

569
00:40:39,903 --> 00:40:40,822
