1
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,079
I won't do it, I'm going home.

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,399
Wait!

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,279
Your brother took the money already.

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,879
Go, Take off your clothes.

5
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,679
You can stay here for now

6
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,119
until we figure something out.

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,999
Tian

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,439
is my new employee.

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,679
But las sure you

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,559
that this young girl

11
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,199
can be trustworthy

12
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,039
bailed on Mr Ba and hit his head!

13
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,039
He put it out on me!

14
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,079
He even took back the 40 thousand baht he gave me.

15
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,599
I'm your sister

16
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,119
but you dare sold me!

17
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,439
Give me back the ring necklace.

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,719
Then we don't have to see each other anymore.

19
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,639
Give me back my necklace!

20
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,959
It's my necklace!

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,079
-Mom gave it to me! Give it back!
- Damn Tian!

22
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,999
or do you want Mr. Ba to come pick you up?

23
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,279
Chan.

24
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,079
Tian!

25
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,279
Are you okay?

26
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,239
Who are you?!

27
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:21,799
Chan!

28
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,599
Don't, Boss!

29
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,119
Don't hurt my brother.

30
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,239
I'm begging you.

31
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,279
Your brother

32
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,719
is more humane than you.

33
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:38,839
Let's go Tian.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,479
Stop!

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,839
Where are you guys going?

36
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,679
You came in here and assaulted me

37
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,759
I will file a report-for trespassing

38
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,439
I guarantee you will ibe nationally famous

39
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,279
I will also tell the police

40
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,639
you took your brother to do porn

41
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,559
Let's see who will be in jail longer

42
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,519
If you want to take Tian,go ahead

43
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,919
But the two of us raised Tian for a long time

44
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,879
You should have some kind of compensation for us

45
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,839
Don't Boss.

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,039
Don't pay them.

47
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,639
I'll give you guys 50,000

48
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,439
But from now on,

49
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,879
don't mess with Tia n everagain.

50
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,599
If it's a deal,

51
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,719
then give me'your account number.

52
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,799
Boss

53
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,919
I'm sorry I got you in trouble

54
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,719
I promise you when I have money.
I will pay you back

55
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,319
Please'don't be mad at me.

56
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,319
I'm mad

57
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,959
that you came here

58
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,359
and didn't tell me.

59
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,079
It's just..

60
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,839
the ring necklace that my mom gave me

61
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,719
is missing.

62
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,719
But I probably won't get it back anymore

63
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,639
Here.

64
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,759
It fell in the room you were staying in.

65
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,159
Thank you Boss!

66
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,079
I will forever be grateful.

67
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:26,879
I feel

68
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,199
very familiar with the initial on the ring.

69
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,719
How did your mom get this ring?

70
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,039
I don't know.

71
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,279
But Mom told me to keep it on me at all times.

72
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,799
WU 9969

73
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,639
WU 9969
What's up Pao?

74
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,759
WU 9969

75
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,759
You and him seem very close.

76
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:50,879
So,

77
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,999
why...

78
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,719
did he willingly pay50 K?

79
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,879
That's a lot of money.

80
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,519
Thon is acting up again

81
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,039
You need to go back with me right now.

82
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,799
Thank you so much Jane

83
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,559
for bringing me to save Tian in time.

84
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,439
This is.

85
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,119
a small token from me.

86
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,799
Let's go Tian.

87
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,199
Tian!

88
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,519
Boss!

89
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,159
Ms. Thip.

90
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,639
Dr.Pao and Mr s. Pajust left a minute ago

91
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,399
There was an urgent case at the clinic

92
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,599
How is Thon doing?

93
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,519
He was trying to get off the bed.

94
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,639
He kept calling for Pit p lern

95
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,159
Dr.Pao sedated him

96
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,679
to get him to calm down

97
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,599
So,

98
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,679
how did you find her?

99
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,399
Tian went to get something back home.

100
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,439
I'm sorry I didn't tell you first.

101
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,799
So lwasn't here to help you look after Mr, Kama it hon.

102
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,799
I wasn't depending on you anyway.

103
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,679
-Let me help you.
-No need.

104
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,759
Did you wash your hands?

105
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,399
It's dirty.

106
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,279
Let Ms, Thip handle it.

107
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,279
Who is Pit p lern?

108
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,399
It doesn't concern you.

109
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,039
I'm sorry

110
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,319
I made you upset.

111
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,919
It's fine.

112
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,599
It's not your fault.

113
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,519
If it's not my fault,

114
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,719
then why are you mad at me?

115
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,959
If you punch me

116
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,959
and it makes you feel better,

117
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,119
you can go right ahead

118
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,719
If I have permission

119
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,919
then why are you scared?

120
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,919
I don't like

121
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,839
people who talk nonsense.

122
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,119
I'm...

123
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,839
I'm sorry.

124
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,759
If you want to be a man,

125
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,999
don't be a wuss.

126
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,799
I don't want to be a man

127
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,079
but...

128
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,039
There's been enough problems for today.

129
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,039
Go get some rest.

130
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,799
What made you call for Pit pler n, Thon?

131
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,719
She probably forgot about you

132
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,079
Pit p lern.

133
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,639
I miss you.

134
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,519
Pit p lern.

135
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,519
Thon.

136
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,319
Thon! Don't go!

137
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,199
Don't go!

138
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,559
Thon!

139
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,319
Hey

140
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,559
Dreaming about Thon again?

141
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,439
By now his spirit

142
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,439
is probably in some hell hole

143
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,999
Thon probably didn't go to hell

144
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,879
By now,

145
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,759
he's peacefully in heaven.

146
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:13,999
Heaven?

147
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,759
I llmake you go to heaven

148
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,999
I'm going to go pray.

149
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,879
Mr, Thon.

150
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,279
You want to go outside?

151
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,479
I'll help you.

152
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,479
Come.

153
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,519
Pit p lern.

154
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,119
You came to see me.

155
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,759
You really came.

156
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,239
No.

157
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,679
My name is Tian.

158
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,239
Wait here while I go get Ms. Thip.

159
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,199
Wait one moment.

160
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,319
Slowly.

161
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,359
Ring.

162
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,239
Mr, Thon.

163
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,399
Where did you get this ring?

164
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,079
This is my ring.

165
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,839
Give it to me.

166
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,199
Mr, Thon!

167
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,279
Taks as ut.

168
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,639
It's Dad's ring

169
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,839
Dok tian!

170
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,719
Where did you get that ring?

171
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,319
It's my ring.

172
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,159
If you don't believe me,

173
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,079
ask Boss,

174
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,119
He's the one that gave it back to me.

175
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,719
Don't lie.

176
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,719
You were going through Mr.. Thon's things'we ren't you?

177
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,039
Thief!

178
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,479
I didn't.

179
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,719
My mom gave me this ring.

180
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,999
I swear to you.

181
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,319
What's your parents names?

182
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,319
My dad's name was Chai.

183
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,239
My mom's name was Thom ya.

184
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,879
Mr, Thon!

185
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:32,839
Thon.

186
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,599
Thon wake up.

187
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,719
You can't die right now.

188
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,519
Take it easy.

189
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,199
Please don't move right now

190
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:44,959
Rome

191
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,719
You'll be okay.

Stay calm.

195
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,799
Don't say anything.

196
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,999

Your husband is a troublemaker!

He accused me of gambling and snitch ed on me to my father!

217
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,759
Calm down!

218
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,919

How can you believe Chai?

230
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,159
He's just the driver.

231
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,639
But I'm your son.

232
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,719
I told him to follow you around.

233
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,199
To see what you've been up to!

234
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,079
You're a scumbag!

235
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,639
How can you miss an important meeting with a client?!

236
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,999
From here on out, do not step foot in my company again!

237
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,279
You're fired!

238

Don't you know?

269

283
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,559

I'm sorry l couldn't protect you. I'm sorry on Tat's behalf.

287
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,679
He was probably drunk.

288
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,999
He was n't in his right mind.

289
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,999
How can I move on?

290
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,319
How can I?

291
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,199
How can I keep on living?!

292
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,879
There has to be a solution.

293
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,839
There has to.

294
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,999
Don't worry Mom and Dad!

I would never step foot at this wedding

298
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,839

307
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,279

381
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,759
when he reaches the age of 20

382
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,399
Mr Kama it hon will be in charge of the assets.

383
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,319
Liar!

384
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,079
This is a fake will!

385
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,159
Thon.

386
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,599
You and him worked together to write this fake will up, didn't you?!

387
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,439
Tat.

388
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,119
Why would l do that?

389
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,279
I'm sterile and l can't have children.

390
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,839
As for your position and shares you have in the company,

391
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,919
it will remain the same and nothing will change

392
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,119
But if you bear a son

393
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,799
the inheritance will go to your son.

394
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,119
Which is equally yours

395
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,239
What happens if I don't have a son?

396
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,759
You will receive dividends from the company every year

397
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,759
until the company shuts down

398
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,159
As for Mr. Koson's personal assets

399
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,719
it will be used to build the Taks as ut Foundation.

400
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,479
Mr, Kama it hon will manage it.

401
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,199
I don't believe you!

402
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,279
My dad would never write this crazy will!

403
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,359
Show me.

404
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,279
Let me see it!

405
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,599
Calm down Mr K a molt at!

406
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,679
I said let go!

407
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:07,999
Calm down!

408
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,039
Let go!

409
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,559
Tat!

410
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,479
That's enough!

411
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,719
Don't meddle Thon!

412
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:14,919
Bro.

413
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,519
Let go!

414
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,399
That's enough

415
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,759
Mr s. P itplern!

416
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:25,839
Pit p lern.

417
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:26,879
Are you okay?

418
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,639
Thon move!

419
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:30,839
Pit.

420
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,559
Why did you come down?

421
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,639
The doctor.said you're not healthy.enough

422
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,359
If you have a'miscarriage, we'll all be screwed!

423
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,199
My stomach hurts.

424
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:41,999
Tat.

425
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,959
Take her to the hospital

426
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:46,879
Hello.

427
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,239
I came to visit my nephew.

428
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,839
Mr Kamoltat Taksasut'sson

429
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,039
How is he doing?

430
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,599
One moment please

431
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,639
The patient was very weak so she had to have a cesarean section.

432
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,079
But the baby is healthy now.

433
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,799
Yes Mr, Wit.

434
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,359
I'lgoin and clear it for you tomorrow.

435
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,519
Chai

436
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,079
Why are you here?

437
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:37,999
Mr, Thon.

438
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,799
Don't tell me that Tho my a's baby?

439
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,959
It's unbelievable.

440
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,279
Your wife gave birth at the same hospital like my brother

441
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:49,799
Actually,

442
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,279
Mr K a molt at

443
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,479
had Thom ya come look after Mr s Pit p lern.

444
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,159
Leading her to give birth here

445
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,559
Please excuse me.

446
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,439
Wait.

447
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,199
Can I take a look?

448
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,839
You're really lucky.

449
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,319
You have another son.

450
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:13,479
Yes.

451
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:14,959
How about this?

452
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,599
To welcome the baby.

453
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,239
That's okay.

454
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,759
Just take it.

455
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,079
Mom always taught me

456
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,079
no matter how poor we are,

457
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,839
I must not go steal or rob from other people

458
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,359
We might be poor but we have dignity

459
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,839
Mom would never steal this ring necklace

460
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:16,879
Rome

461
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,399
Right now

462
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,319
Thon is with the doctors now

463
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,359
He will be fine.

464
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,719
If Cha i'schild is a boy

465
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,919
then why is Tian a girl?

466
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,759
Hold on.

467
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,599
You're taking this quite serious

468
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,119
May be Thon

469
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,959
was just talking nonsense

470
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,839
What about that ring necklace?

471
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,519
You already know

472
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,959
Ka molt at would never let that necklace be in someone else's hands.

473
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,799
Unless...

474
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,559
he didn't know that that day

475
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,999
Thon gave his niece the necklace

476
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,359
So?

477
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,439
So T at switched his child with Chai's child

478
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,479
Are you crazy?

479
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,879
That's his child we're talking about.

480
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,039
He wouldn't just give his child up to'someone else!

481
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,599
He's done worse.

482
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,039
Don't you remember?

483
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,879
What he did to me,

484
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,519
what he did to Thon.

485
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,039
Aha.

486
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,799
I knew it.

487
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,279
Your brother would never turn a new leaf.

488
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,239
How much this time?

489
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,039
I won't tolerate this

490
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,839
I'm bringing this into the meeting

491
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,079
You still have the evidence from last time, right?

492
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,239
Yeah.

493
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,679
I saved it on a hard disk.

494
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,039
It's good that you came around

495
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,599
So,

496
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,359
does Ka molt at know about this?

497
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,319
He does.

498
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,559
He threatened i me but lim not scared

499
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,679
Im on my way to get the evidence from you

500
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,919
Hm, okay.

501
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:00,719
Hey!

502
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,559
My car can't brake.

503
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,639
Hello?

504
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,559
Thon?

505
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,279
Hello Thon?!

506
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,559
Rome.

507
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,159
I contacted my supervisor.

508
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,319
Right now,

509
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:42,719
we need to move Thon for his surgery over there becau so it'll be safer

510
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,399
Not enough equipment here.

511
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,919
Earlier,

512
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,599
the police called and said the brakes were cut.

513
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,479
It must have been Ka mol tat's doing.

514
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,079
Cold-bloodedmurderer.

515
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,839
He probably got scared that Thon was gonna expose him.

516
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,119
So he tried to kill his own brother

517
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,519
Sonofabitch!

518
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:02,919
Hey wait!

519
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,839
Where are you going?

520
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,999
Calm down!

521
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,599
We don't have evidence that he actually did it!

522
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,359
Over there!

523
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,879
Thon!

524
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,279
He's what's important right now.

525
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:27,999
But Pao,

526
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,319
we can't let Ka molt at know

527
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,719
that Thon is alive still!

528
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,639
Doctor

529
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,479
There was an immigrant who died in a fire accident.

530
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,079
No documents, no family.

531
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,239
What do we do?

532
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,559
Gosh Thon.

533
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,159
You shouldn't have.

534
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,039
You were still young.

535
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,839
May you rest in peace.

536
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,599
I will continue the work you were doing

537
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,079
My condolences :

538
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,639
will you be taking him with you today?

539
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:17,759
Sure,

540
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,719
U was thinking of-finding a temple nearby to cremate him.

541
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,279
So he will be able to reach a good place sooner

542
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:25,999
Okay.

543
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,359
Excuse me.

544
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,279
brought you your food, Boss

545
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,679
You have to eat.

546
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,679
Just put it down. I'm not hungry yet.

547
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:28,759
Fire!

548
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,239
Help! There's a fire!

549
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,479
Go put out the fire first!

550
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,159
Boss!

551
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,239
You have to leave!

552
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,399
Let me go!

553
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,879
This is the factory my dad left for me before he died!

554
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,679
Help put out the fire!

555
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,599
Don't Boss!

556
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,719
You will die!

557
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,759
You have to get out of here!

558
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:50,799
Let me go!

559
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,479
Don't!

560
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,839
I said let me go!

561
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,399
Boss!

562
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,319
Mai!

563
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,039
They destroyed the CCTVs

564
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,759
I didn't have evidence that it was arson and l was left broke

565
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,639
If your relative didn't help me

566
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,639
I wouldn't be able to reestablish myself.

567
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,399
Hey!

568
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,399
You still remember?!

569
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,799
I thought you forgot about it

570
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:44,879
Confused?

571
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,679
It's because of you

572
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,159
that l broke my doctor'soath

573
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,759
I had to wander around and open a clinic herein Ranong

574
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,799
It's good that you ire here.

575
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,079
I wanted to ask for my money back

576
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,039
Confused?

577
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,239
Well,

578
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,919
the fee to look after Thon

579
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,799
and loss of opportunity fee.

580
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,519
Hold on.

581
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,079
I think l will charge you

582
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,719
three million!

583
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,479
That will make me rich!

584
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,679
Greedy!

585
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,919
You're worse than those unofficial loan sharks

586
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,519
You're just realizing that?

587
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,439
Asking money from your brother in law?

588
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,439
I'm giving you a chance to take that back

589
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,119
My mother is here

590
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,319
I'm not.

591
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,719
I was just kidding

592
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,559
wanted

593
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,119
my brother in law to be in a good mood!

594
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,039
Good mood!

595
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,319
See? He's smiling. He's in a good mood.

596
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,279
So, how's Thon doing?

597
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,599
Doctor!

598
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,879
Mr. Kama it hon has passed away!

599
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,359
What?!

600
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,599
It's not true is it?

601
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,239
I took care of him for years.

602
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,759
Mr Thon's condition was never that bad.

603
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,759
It's all Tian's fault.

604
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,039
He made Mr. Thon...

605
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,079
T hip.

606
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,839
Be reasonable.

607
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,599
It had nothing to do with Tian.

608
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,199
It does.

609
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,479
Tian went and stole something from Mr Thon's room

610
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,719
Mr, Thon woke up to see it.

611
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,159
Tian didn't steal that ring necklace.

612
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,799
I assure you.

613
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,639
Even if he didn't steal the necklace,

614
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,039
he might have stole something else

615
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,079
You can't trust

616
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,159
a kid on the streets like that.

617
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,079
By the way,

618
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,479
who is this Tian person?

619
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,639
What necklace?

620
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,879
I'll tell you later.

621
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,919
Pao is at the hospital right now.

622
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,679
He's taking care of the body.

623
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,159
I came here to change

624
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,919
and will go contact the temple.

625
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,679
The funeral will be a private one

626
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,039
One day vigil then cremation.

627
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,359
Okay.

628
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,239
Then,

629
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,159
I will go get ready

630
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:09,719
Wait.

631
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:13,959
Where's Tian?

632
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,919
Since the incident.

633
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,999
I haven't seen him.

634
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,479
Where did she go?

635
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,279
Did she run away again?

636
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:03,759
Where are you going?

637
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,079
Boss.

638
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,879
I'm...

639
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,079
I'm heading to the bus station.

640
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:14,999
Running away?

641
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,399
Thief.

642
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,279
I didn't steal.

643
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,239
My mom gave it to me when I was little.

644
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,199
Prove it.

645
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,359
I don't have proof to prove anything.

646
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,919
But if you don't believe me,

647
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,319
you can send me to the police.

648
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,359
You're bold.

649
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,679
I will believe you this time.

650
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,319
Thon is already dead anyway

651
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,319
Mr. Kama it hon!

652
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,279
I'm the jinx.

653
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,959
I've only been there for a few days.

654
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,119
I caused him to die!

655
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,079
My parents died because of me too.

656
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,439
Just let me go.

657
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,679
If l stay,

658
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,879
you might get unlucky

659
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,279
Did you forget

660
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,679
you still owe me?

661
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,079
Hi Boss.

662
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,359
N hong!

663
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,479
Boss is here!

664
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,319
Okay!

665
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,199
Hi Boss.

666
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,079
Hi Nhong.

667
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,279
You're here late

668
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,679
What did you get today?

669
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,599
A lot of squids.

670
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,079
They're huge and all grade A

671
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,999
New worker?

672
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,719
He looks like a puppy.

673
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,559
Will he be able to work?

674
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,879
Not here.

675
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:16,799
N hong.

676
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,119
You can get back to work

677
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,519
Sure. Good evening

678
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,159
Bye!

679
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,279
I brought you here

680
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,279
in case you can see

681
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,359
that it wasn't easy for me

682
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,559
to get to this point.

683
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,759
Good evening Boss

684
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,279
Hi.

685
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,559
This is a frozen seafood factory

686
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,199
I built it with my own brain and two hands

687
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,839
It's a big factory

688
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,559
You're very skilled.

689
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,319
I didn't have a choice.

690
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,919
Before,l took over the furniture factory from my father

691
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,439
But it went bankrupt and I went broke

692
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,159
So I had to reestablish myself here

693
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,719
If l had given up that day

694
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,959
I wouldn't have today

695
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:23,879
Oh!

696
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:24,959
I know.

697
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,839
You want me to work here to pay off your debt?

698
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,239
Don't worry, I can do anything you want me to do.

699
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,519
To...

700
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:37,359
make up for Mr. Kama it hon'sdeath

701
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,039
Before Thon

702
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,279
had the condition that you saw,

703
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,599
he was a handsome,kind man

704
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,479
Everyone loved him.

705
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,439
I'm sorry.

706
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,039
Thon's death

707
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,839
was not your fault

708
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,079
But there is an evil person

709
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,279
who's done me and Thon wrong

710
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,199
He made Thon disabled

711
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,119
He burned down my factory.

712
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,839
Someone like that exist?

713
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,559
Why didn't you tell the police?

714
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,759
The police can't do anything to him

715
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,279
He's rich

716
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,959
and has power

717
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,199
We have to go off the books with him

718
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,599
to satisfy what he did to us

719
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,279
If he's your enemy,

720
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,679
then he's my enemy too

721
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,279
Nice words

722
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,399
If I want to get revenge for Thon

723
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,719
will you help me?

724
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,959
Bad people must get punished

725
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,559
I am indebted to you.

726
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,959
Whatever you tell me to do

727
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,119
I will do it.

728
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,519
Then let's begin.

729
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,839
At this factory?

730
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,439
No.

731
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,159
Il tell you later.
