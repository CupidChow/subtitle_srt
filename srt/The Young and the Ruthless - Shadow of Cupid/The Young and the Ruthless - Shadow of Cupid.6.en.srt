PI trust you with everything

S But today your embrace feels empty

5
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,719
P The word love that doesn't seem sincere

6
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,399
P The closer you get,the further you are away

7
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,679

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,319
P Love me like you did yesterdays

14
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,559
I send him to study in England,

15
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,919
people will see me as a devoted father.

16
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,319
Once he's of legal age and returns home,

17
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,559
we can...

18
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,399
authority to you for all management work.

19
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,719
the marriage certificate.

20
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,799
There will be more problems for you

21
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,039
And if they end up having a kid..

22
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,999
Au lauc your position will go down and will become the second heir.

23
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,999
I need to teach you a lesson.

24
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,719
Mont ira?!

25
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,079
Are you hurt?

26
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,559
We have n't introduced each other yet.

27
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,119
What's your name?

28
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,319
My name is --

29
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:17,839
Tian!

30
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,799
Boss.

31
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,359
Mr, Ka molt at.

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,999
Long time no see.

33
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,919
Are you doing well?

34
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,919
You know him, Boss?

35
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,439
I do.

36
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,159
Of course I know him

37
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,359
We...

38
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,839
were super close back then

39
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,799
Let's go Tian.

40
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,319
Wait.

41
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,359
Bye.

42
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,399
Rome!

43
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,319
Boss!

44
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,639
Boss, you're hurting me

45
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,399
Why are you mad at me?

46
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,279
Why were you talking to him?

47
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:11,639
Well,

48
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,519
are you talking about that uncle?

49
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,279
He was the person l helped at the airport.

50
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,159
What?

51
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,799
So you met him twice?

52
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,239
What did you talk to him about?

53
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,999
Just general stuff.

54
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,759
He only asked who my parents were.

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,919
And what did you say?!

56
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,599
I didn't get to answer him yet because you showed up first.

57
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,079
Did you tell him

58
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,799
what you and l are?

59
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,319
That you'remy guardian.

60
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,079
You're hurting me.

61
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:50,959
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,519
Do you remember

63
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,839
when I told you that your generosity

64
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,399
can't be used on city people?

65
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,919
But that man was nice to me.

66
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,319
He even helped me.

67
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,199
He didn't seem like a bad person.

68
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,159
He...

69
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,159
is worse than a devil.

70
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,359
He was willing to kill his own brother

71
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,399
and it was him

72
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,359
that made me go bankrupt, So he isn't bad to you?

73
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,639
All done.

74
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,439
Thank you.

75
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,319
You can put on the medicine after you shower.

76
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,919
Also,

77
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,639
I will go get you your medical letter and you can use this letter to file a report.

78
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,799
Huh?!

79
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,199
You're siding with them?!

80
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:55,639
Oh.

81
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,839
I wasn't abused.

82
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,159
I fell and slipped in the bathroom.

83
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,999
But judging from your wounds

84
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,119
I don't think it came from an accident.

85
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,679
Forget it.

86
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,719
Pao.

87
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,519
I'm so happy

88
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,919
to seo you.

89
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,679
Rome looks good and seems happy

90
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,359
Looks more dignified.

91
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,879
I'm happy for him.

92
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,519
If it was me,

93
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,999
I would have lost moral support that you hurt me like that.

94
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,199
But you know,

95
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,839
Rome is skilled.

96
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,919
He healed his heart and persevered until he can build himself up to become a millionaire again.

97
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,239
I feel guilty til this day.

98
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,759
I want to clear things up with Rome.

99
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,919
Do you have his number?

100
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,719
I think

101
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,279
Rome doesn't want to bring this up again

102
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,599
Pao.

103
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,919
I'm begging you.

104
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,599
For the sake of our friendship. Please?

105
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,559
Let's go.

106
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,199
I paid your bill

107
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,519
Come on!

108
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:08,879
Ow!

109
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,079
Serves her right!

110
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,959
Karma is catching up to her.

111
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,759
But don't tell Rome about this.

112
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,199
He can't hear any news of anyone getting abused

113
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,719
Who got abused?

114
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,759
Nothing.

115
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,799
I have to go now babe. Kisses

116
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,759
Why did you quickly hang up?

117
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,159
I needed to talk to him.

118
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,559
It's just

119
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,439
Pao had to get back to his patients

120
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,799
Teenagers fighting

121
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,959
What's your urgent matter?

122
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,679
Tian and I

123
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,039
saw Ka molt at.

124
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,559
Huh?

125
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,599
Why such a coincidence?

126
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,279
What did he say?

127
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,479
He acted like he just seen a ghost.

128
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,839
He probably thought that I

129
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,319
went to go work as a rubber tapper somewhere.

130
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,679
What about Tian?

131
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,839
How did he reacted when he saw Tian?

132
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,279
He probably saw Tian

133
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,439
as an easy prey that he will catch.

134
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,239
His evil nature

135
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,359
can't be cured.

136
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,719
His family isn't even an exception.

137
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,319
But this time

138
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,039
he will know

139
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,159
karma exist.

140
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:22,799
Yes.

141
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,399
Ka molt at was the one that destroyed Rome's life

142
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,159
Just be careful

143
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,479
Stay clear of him.

144
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,439
Ka molt at.

145
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,759
I will remember this man's face til the day I die

146
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,799
Whoever hurts Boss,

147
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,079
that means they hurt me too

148
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,479
I will not surrender to them.

149
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,159
Hey.

150
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,879
Do you remember Rome Pak an ant?

151
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:56,959
Yes sir.

152
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,719
I don't know what he ll hole hecame up from

153
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,679
but he's been haunting me everywhere

154
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,679
Send me his profile immediately

155
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,559
There's also...

156
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,439
a girl named Tian who's with him too.

157
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:31,999
Wake up!

158
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,279
Wake up Kula chart!

159
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,879
Turn
around, bait and switch.

160
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,439
Chop chop.

161
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,799
Gosh!

162
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,679
What is this?

163
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,839
You're in England and you're still doing drugs?

164
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:50,919
Huh?

165
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,719
England?!

166
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,759
How is this England?

167
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,719
I don't see the Eiffel Tower.

168
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,919
Pure buffalo!

169
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,439
No crossbreeding whatsoever!

170
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,479
The Eiffel Tower is in France

171
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,999
Hello sir.

172
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,679
Be serious Napa

173
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,959
Your job is to make Chart graduate

174
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,039
Whatever you want

175
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,239
I will give it to you

176
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,999
But if you fail,

177
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,559
you won't get anything from me, remember that.

178
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,879
I'm afraid of one thing.

179
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,519
What?

180
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,679
Afraid he will get a wife and signs the marriage certificate.

181
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,679
There will be more problems for you.

182
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,159
And if they end up having a kid..

183
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,079
your position will go down and will become the second heir

184
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,199
Huh?

185
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,919
What is it?

186
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,119
What?

187
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,039
Hey.

188
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,599
What are you doing?

189
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:37,679
Hey.

190
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,599
Pick whatever device you like.

191
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,799
I'll buy it for'you.

192
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,839
I don't want a cell phone

193
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,199
I don't know who to call with it.

194
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,679
You don't have to buy it for me.

195
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,599
If you like to go missing often,

196
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:13,879
I will know where you're at.

197
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:15,999
I can call you.

198
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,839
That's enough Tian.

199
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,799
Stop playing.

200
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,439
Let's save your name.

201
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,959
You can use...

202
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,559
How about Candle?

203
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,799
That's what my name means.

204
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,519
As for my name on your device

205
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,279

206
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,319
" Nai Hua "in English means..

207
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,399
Boss

209
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,919
Boss is fine.

210
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:04,959
Sounds cool.

211
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:16,999
Hey

00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,919

I don't know how long we'll be here for

214
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,519
You can buy your personal essentials

215
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,999
Doesn't the hotel have them?

216
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,679
If I runout, I can ask them for more.

217
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,159
J meant

218
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,599

You're right.

220
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,519
If you'll excuse me then.

221
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,919
Are you Mr Rome?

222
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,959
Hello Mr. Rome

223
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,039
Hey.

224
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,719
The president of the SG Seafood Good Taste

225
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,919
is visiting the store himself?

226
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,599
I m Nap at, the manager here

227
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,319
Are my products selling well?

228
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,119
The sales department didn't inform you?

229
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,319
We're practically your representative now.

230
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,439
Is that so?

231
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,199
Yes.

232
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,079
All the products are'fine,right? No defects?

233
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,039
That's right.

234
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,399
Wait!

235
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,399
Give her back her wallet

236
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,319
Hey, don't accuse me. What wallet?

237
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:44,919
Oh.

238
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,119
Are you guys con artists?

239
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,959
Slandering other people so you guys can steal?

240
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,239
Stop.

241
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,639
59 Here.

242
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,759
Do you want to go to jail?

243
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,719
They have cameras everywhere

244
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,959
Forget it.

245
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,799
She's embarrassed enough.

246
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:10,639

AVE

254
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,519
It's okay.

255
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,359
I can't accept this.

256
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,679
My mom taught me

257
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,639
if I see anyone in trouble I just have to help them sincerely.

258
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,159
Your mom

259
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,119
is really lucky.

260
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,839
She has a sweet daughter like you

261
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,279
Thank you so much.

262
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,439
Yes?

263
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,319
Tian.

264
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,799
See you at the cashier

265
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,799
Sure Boss

266
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,919
If you'll excuse me.

267
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,479
Do you know who I just saw?

268
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,759
Just tell me who it is

269
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,159
I'm stressed right now.

270
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,799
I have no time to play around

271
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,679
I saw your ex Rome

272
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,799
He's still sexy and handsome like before.

273
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,639
But right now

274
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,519
he's the owner of a seafood export brand

275
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,479
A millionaire now!

276
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,839
You want to know where?

277
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,279
I'll tell you.

278
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,159
SG Seafood Good Taste

279
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,919
It's in Ranong

280
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:51,879
Tian!

281
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,399
We came to visit!

282
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:55,879
Hey!

283
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,119
Who are you guys?!

284
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,479
You suddenly invited yourself into someone's house.

285
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,359
Cher m, kick them out.

286
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:02,639
Go!

287
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,679
All of you get out!

288
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,399
Or else l will hit you!

289
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,159
Boss Rome brought my friend to live here.

290
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,639
I came to see Tian.

291
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,439
Why do you have to chase us like we're some animal?

292
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,959
Oh.

293
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,319
You're actually

294
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,559
Tian's friends.

295
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,079
No wonder,

296
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,799
the way you guys look

297
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,639
are all bad.

298
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,759
You can leave. Tian isn't home.

299
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,479
Just tell us when Tian will be back

300
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,959
No need to be little us like this

301
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,479
Do you think you're...

302
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,439
head of the servants, Auntie?

303
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,159
Hey!

304
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,719
I'm not the head of servants!

305
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,159
I'm not your aunt either.

306
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,799
Uneducated kids

307
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,799
Hey Auntie.

308
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,479
That's not nice of you to say

309
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,799
Why can't you talk nicely and there's no need to push!

310
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,359
Please leave first.

311
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,079
Tian!

312
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,719
Go away!

313
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,599
Tian!

314
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,119

315
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,199
Stop!

316
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,359
Stop right now!

317
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,119
If you guys won't leave,

318
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,439
I will call the cops :

319
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,799
You'll be charged for trespassing and assault.

320
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,679
You guys will all be sleeping in jail

321
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,239
Fine!

322
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,439
We'll leave.

323
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,239

324
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,039

Who's this now?

326
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,199
Who are you here to see?

327
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,959
I came to see Rome.

328
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,639
My name is Monti ra I'm Rome's girlfriend

329
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,559
Ive lived here with Mr, Rome for years

330
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,999
When did he get himself a girlfriend?

331
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,119
Years? Are you his wife?

332
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:44,079
Let me warn you as a fellow woman.

333
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,439
You

334
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,599
are still young and beautiful.

335
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,359
Don't make a living by scamming people like this.

336
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:51,759
Je ab.

337
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,839

Yes?

343
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,919
Can I ask you something

344
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,079
Who was that woman?

345
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,279
She's acting like she owns the place

346
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,119
Oh, I heard she's a nurse.

347
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,599
But lve never seen her go to the hospital

348
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,279
Please don't ask me.l don't want to say too much

349
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,799
I'lget in trouble for it.

350
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,839
One more question.

351
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,479
Where is Rome?

352
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,879
What's this?

353
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,039
Where are you going?

354
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,159
I can't stand you anymore.

355
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:47,999
Just let me go!

356
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,599
Let you go?

357
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,719
You wanna go to your lover?!

358
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,879
I thought you would forget about your friend now that you have a rich American husband!

359
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,599
What's been happening?

360
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,399

I have no place to go.

363
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,159
No place to go?

364
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,639
So,

365
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,479
what about your husband Sam?

366
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,439
I completely broke up with him.

367
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,199
Girl,

368
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,759
hell do exist

369
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,599
My whole body aches right now.

The people in Ranong said that Rome

378
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,759

379
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,839

382
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,319
because you want to know where the man is at?

383
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,639
It's

384
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,279
not difficult.

385
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,559
But it's not easy either.

386
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:41,599
Here.

387
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,559
I have a reward for you

388
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,799
Is this enough?

389
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,119
This will do.

390
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,559
Let'sgo.

391
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,479
This is the house we'll be staying at in Bangkok.

392
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:23,999
Hey.

393
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,519
How much is rent per month?

394
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,479
No need to rent

395
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,559
I bought it.

396
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,999
The full amount

397
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,079
Go choose your'rooms

398
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,399
Rome.

399
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,879
You bought a car and a new house.

400
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,959
You're thinking of staying here for a long period?

401
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,079
I'll.come and go.

402
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,759
But Tian

403
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,079
Pa,

404
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,599
and you,

405
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,759
will have to stay here for a long time.

406
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,119
Huh?

407
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,239
There'sapiano too!

408
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,839
I like the sound of it.l've been wanting to play one

409
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,479
It's not difficult.

410
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,199
Pa knows how to play it

411
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,559
She can teach you.

412
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,559
You serious?

413
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,879
Are you trying to separate me from my husband?

414
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,919
Just temporary.lt won't be long

415
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,999
I'll pay for your flight

416
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,639
As for you Lak,

417
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,159
your role is to teach Tian how to use Facebook and Insta gram

418
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,079
She has a cell phone now.

419
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,039
But Tian,

420
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,439
don't post anything yet.

421
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,119
Until I give you permission

422
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,199
Okay.

423
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,719
Why?

424
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,119
Don't ask me.

425
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,279
I don't know either.

426
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,199
Let's go Tian.

427
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,559
Let's go play the piano.

428
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,399
Start with.

429
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,199
This?
-Yeah.

430
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,439
All three together

431
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,799
Three...

432
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,559
Kula chart.

433
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,279
After you'redone eating,
come play the piano with me.

434
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,679
I won't eat!

435
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,639
-Take that!
-Young Master!

436
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,879
Kula chart!

437
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,999
Why are you doing this Kula chart?!

438
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,119
Why are you being naughty?!

439
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:50,799
Kula chart!

440
00:23:59,080 --> 00:23:59,599
Hey

441
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,159
Did you have to call me for this?

442
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,279
Kula chart needs AB negative blood.

443
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,799
I'm B.

444
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,679
What's yours?

445
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,639
Of course lit'sthe same as our son.

446
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,039
Why don't you head home first?

447
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,559
I'lhandle things here.

448
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,279
-0.21 Ca]
-0.20. Ca1

449
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,679
0.21 Ca]

450
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,279
-0.21 Ca]
-0.20. Cal

451
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,359
-0.21 Ca

452
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,759
I've called all the places already

453
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,519
Just ask them.

454
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,039
How much for a liter? I'll pay them.

455
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,439
Take one million for now

456
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,719
You need to help me

457
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,799
Go poking your other patients if you want

458
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,879
Give me your account number

459
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,879
I will not do anything illegal in my profession

460
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,319
Four years of lying to Mr s, P itplern

461
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,119
is more than enough

462
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,319
Our child

463
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,679
was a girl.

464
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,039
She died since birth

465
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,359
I was scared to tell you because I didn't want to hurt you.

466
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,439
Who did you buy Kula chart from?

467
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,279
Did you go get him from an orphanage?

468
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,199
It wasn't like that.

469
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,559
Kula chart is Thom ya and Chai's son

470
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,359
Our own people

471
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,359
I did everything for you.

472
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,279
I was afraid you wouldn't be able to accept losing your daughter

473
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,479
You didn't do it for me.

474
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,319
You did it for the inheritance in the will.

475
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,679
That's not true.

476
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,599
I did everything for us.

477
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,079
Since we lost our daughter

478
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,119
we have to get something i in return

479
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,559
That's what's fair.

480
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,159
I will take this matter

481
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,919
to tell Lawyer Dam rong and everyone else.

482
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,479
Hey!

483
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,799
Don't.

484
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,559
If you reveal this matter,

485
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,839
you're admitting to being an accomplice for me.

486
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,959
It's come to this point.

487
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,679
Why don't you just let it go?

488
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,439
Let's start over.

489
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,039
I promise

490
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,159
I will take care of you and our child the best that I can.

491
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,599
Trust me.

492
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,599
That was beautiful

493
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,279
I've never seen you play before

494
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,039
Ever since l had a child

495
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,559
stopped playing

496
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,959
Kula chart doesn't like the sound of the piano

497
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,719
If l had a daughter,

498
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,279
I would teach her

499
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,919
to play the piano with me.

500
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,279
I wonder how Kula chart is doing right now

501
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,879
He's gone quiet.

502
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:29,239
Ever since he left,this house has become quite peaceful and quiet.

503
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,319
Wake up, student.

504
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,919
Do you want to get punished by your teacher again?

505
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,919
I'm awake.

506
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,319
What's the next lesson, teacher?

507
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,599
Hello, sir.

508
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,319
How's Chart doing?

509
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:31,559
I went to check him his room and he just barely fell asleep

510
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,119
I guess he stayed up late studying

511
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,079
Good.

512
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,959
I'm heading to England for work next week

513
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,159
I'll stop by an dl also want to check out his school

514
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,359
Can you set an appointment with his counselor for me?

515
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,079
I miss you Napa.

516
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,559
Yes, sir.

517
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,359
What did your old lover say?

518
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,599
Don't talk smart.

519
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:56,719
Hey.

520
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,199
Your father will be coming here.

521
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,239
Huh?!

522
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:05,279
He said he wants to talk to your school counselor

523
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,399
Shit!

524
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,959
What are we gonna do?

525
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,519
Dad will kick my ass.

526
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,399
All l do here is eat and play

527
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,399
I don't even know where my university is or what my professors look like.

528
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,919
Why are you smiling?

529
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,319
Are you crazy?

530
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,079
I'm not crazy.

531
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,879
Just do as I say.

532
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,479
I'll teach you a little bit of acting.

533
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,959
I assure you there will be no problem.

534
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,679
You see?

535
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,759
You lost to me.

536
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,359
Old people are like that

537
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:54,959
What?

538
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,279
Hey.

539
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,039
You called me old?

540
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,839
I'm your boss.

541
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,719
I'm sorry.

542
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,199
Then...

543
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,559
'll call you

544
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,519

545
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,599
Smart mouth.

546
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:11,879
Come here.

547
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,719

I can't breathe

557
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,359

558
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,279

00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,919
Wake up and talk to me.

572
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,399
Somebody, help!

573
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,999
Boss!

574
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,879
I'm better now.

575
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,039
I'm good.

576
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,759
I was so scared.

577
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,439
What's wrong?

578
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,959
I'm fine.

579
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,079
But...

580
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,959
I fainted because of you.

581
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,639
Because of me?

582
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,999
Seriously,

583
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,159
did you forget to brush your teeth this morning?

584
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:10,999
Boss!

585
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,799
Was that a prank?!

586
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,359
I was so scared!

587
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,359
Gosh Tian.

588
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,439
I'm healthy.

589
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,039
I won't die that easily.

590
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,839
Whoever reaches home first,

591
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,759
wins.

592
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,319
Come here!

593
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,479
Hey, cheater!

594
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,639
Tian!
H

595
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,719
Well?

596
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,519
Can you stop belittling me now?

597
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,999
I surrender

598
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,319
Loser must get punished

599
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,919
What should ldo to you?

600
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,399
Flick your ear?

601
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,559
No! You do it hard

602
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,399
Flick your mouth?

603
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:01,919
Come here.

604
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,479
No.

605
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,159
No!

606
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,239
Come here!

607
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,599
Loser must get punished

608
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,759
Rome!

609
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,479
Mon.

610
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,639
How did you get here?

611
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,319
How did you know about this house?

612
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,639
Sam was abusing me.

613
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,639
I went to get myself treated!

614
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,719
I saw Pao there.

615
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,559
I wanted to see you.

616
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,759
I want to apologize about the past

617
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,239
for hurting you.

618
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,039
Rome.

619
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,559
The reason Pao and I didn't tell you about this

620
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,719
is because we thought you and this woman

621
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,159
aren't involved anymore

622
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,919
No point in knowing about her.

623
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,359
Besides, we didn't tell her where your house was at.

624
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,638
It's not Pa or Pa o'sfault

625
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,599
I found out myself.

626
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,999
I don't know who to turn to.

627
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,719
How pitiful of Ms, Mon.

628
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,559
She's pretending

629
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,479
But her American husband is despicable though

630
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,679
I punched him once

631
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:38,719
Sam

632
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,959
hit me

633
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,199
and locked me up.

634
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,359
But I got away

635
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,559
I searched for your house in Ranong.

636
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,199
But you weren't there.

637
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,959
Sol came to see Gigi.

638
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,079
You remember her, right?

639
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,879
Gigi knows the landlord.

640
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,199
So she knows that you bought a house here.

641
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,399
Why didn't you file a report?

642
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,959
Divorce him to end things.

643
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,559
What's the point

644
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,319
of telling me?

645
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,959
You'restill mad at me?

646
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,559
I forgot about us already.

647
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,959
Can l have a chance --

648
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,199
lll call a cab for you

649
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,839
Tell me where you want to get dropped off at.

650
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,039
That's okay.

651
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,759
I came here on my own.

652
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,319
I can leave on my own too.

653
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,639
Thank you Rome

654
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,879
for letting me say what I needed to say.

655
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,879
Finally it's over.

656
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,919
Where will Ms, Mon go if she has no one left?

657
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,439
When she left Rome

658
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:20,279
she didn't care about his well-being.

659
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,599
If you saw him then,

660
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,679
you would take pity on Rome

661
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,199
Why did you turn off your phone?!

662
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,279
We have a problem!

663
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:44,559
Sam threatened me to tell l him where you went to see Rome at!

664
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,519
Did you tell him?

665
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:47,519
5756

666
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,639
Why did you come see him?!

667
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,439
You're having an affair with him?!

668
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,279
Go.

669
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,199
Let'sgo see him together.

670
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,199
Don't bother me!

671
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,239
We already broke up,you understand?!

672
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:09,799
Let go!

673
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,759
Take me to see him

674
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,639
Now!

675
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,599
You wanna get hit?!

676
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,239
Ms. Mon!

677
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,279
You think you're all that?

678
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,479
Tian!

679
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,359
Mr. Lak!

680
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:09,679
I'll call you and the others down for a statement soon.

681
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,119
Thank you so much

682
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:27,879
Next time,

683
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,159
don't risk your life like that again.

684
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,639
You're a show off.

685
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,799
Did you get hurt anywhere?

686
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,159
I'm fine.

687
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,319
I'm better now.

688
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,679
Don't meddle in other people's business.

689
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,119
How lucky of you that Rome saved you in time?

690
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,679
I'm sorry everyone.

691
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,159
Regarding today,

692
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,319
it's all my fault.

693
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,999
You realize that?

694
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,679
Good thing you didn't die.

695
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,879
If anyone has to die

696
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,359
it's me.

697
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,639
Actually,

698
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,959
Lak and Tian

699
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,199
shouldn't have helped me

700
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,759
I'm sorry.

701
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,319
I won't come here again

702
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,159
Mon.

703
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,279
It's okay, I just feel light-headed.

704
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,039
Are you sure

705
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,519
you won't let me drop you off at the hospital?

706
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,759
I can drop you off

707
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,519
That's okay.

708
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,879
I feel considerate of you already

709
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,079
You even came to drop me off

710
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:49,959
Don't over think it.

711
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,199
We can still be friends

712
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,639
Wait Mon.

713
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,879
Your husband hasn't been arrested yet

714
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,119
You need to be very careful

715
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,199
Thank you Rome

716
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,959
Do you want to go visit Chart?

717
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,839
I'll have Pat arrange it for you

718
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,719
JI probably won't. It's too far

719
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,599
I ll probably have to ask you to give him my gift

720
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,359
Living over there,

721
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,559
it can be difficult to find the food he likes.

722
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,479
But anyway,

723
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,679
please tell me beforehand!

724
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,239
So I can prepare the stuff on time.

725
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,319
Pat.

726
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,039
Right on time. Have a seat.

727
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,879
Join us.

728
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,439
That's okay Madam

729
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,079
I have urgent news for you

730
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,199
Mr. Kula chart is very sick.

731
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,359
He's homesick.

732
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,959
He's so stressed that he almost killed himself.

733
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,039
Ms. Napa is bringing him home at the moment.
