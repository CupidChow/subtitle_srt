At Rome'sdesk,

15
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,919
there's all the evidence that you want.

16
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,079
Go see for yourself.

17
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,639
You fainted at the house.

18
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,999
So I brought you to the hospital.

19
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,639
Confess to the public

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,159
that you seduced Tian to go with you to satisfy you and your brother's lust.

21
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,479
I never took advantage of Tian.

22
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,839
Go ask Tian if you don't believe me

23
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,359
You have to let we and Boss go right now.

24
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,439
Don't make things worse.

25
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,239
Jane!

26
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,039
No.

27
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,119
You have to stay here.

28
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,479
Au au coun ua Listen to me.
-Listen.

29
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,719
Don't let her out.

30
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,479
Watch her

31
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,239
Jane!

32
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,999
Can you listen to me first?!

33
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,679
Three to four outfits are enough

34
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,599
Okay P Tian can wear my clothes for now.

35
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,359
Who are those?

36
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,599
This...

37
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,759
is for Boss.

38
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,119
Eyes of the wicked.

39
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,839
Hey Jane!

40
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,239
Why are you so serious?

41
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,799
We need to have some humanity

42
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,319
Especially to a handsome defendant, got it?

43
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,839

Excuse me

47
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,359
Have you seen this person before?

48
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,799
No I haven't.

49
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,919
May be try looking over there.

50
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,679
Thank you.

51
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,319
Sure.

52
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:03,799
Hey!

53
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:05,999
Miss!

54
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:06,639
Hey!

55
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,359
Miss!

56
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,199
Let me go!

57
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,599
Where are Rome and Tian?

58
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,199
Tell me right now!

59
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,199
I don't know what you're talking about! Let go!

60
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,159
If you don't know

61
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:18,999
then why run?

62
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,759
Go see the police with me right now

63
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,879
I won't go!

64
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,159
What are you doing to my sister?!

65
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,599
You messed with the wrong gay dude!

66
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,799
Jane!

67
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,319
Who is this handsome dude?

68
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,799
The same people as the boss we captured

69
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,199
Hey.

70
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,119
What do we do?

71
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,999
He probably knows that I did it.

72
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,559
Lak!

73
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,959
How did you get capture?

74
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,439
Who are they?

75
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,519
Tian's friend

76
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,719
But I don't know why she's doing this to us

77
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,119
Jane.

78
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,639
You're misunderstanding us.

79
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,719
I didn't do anything to Tian

80
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,199
Let me and Lak go.

81
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,319
I won't press charges.

82
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,879
People who like to harass women

83
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,399
deserve this!

84
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,239
My hand hurt.

85
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,559
Idiot!

86
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,799
Who harassed who?

87
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,999
Speak more clearly

88
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,439
Since the older brother won't confess

89
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,239
of what evil plan he has for Tian, Uy

90
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,719
then we must get the truth from the younger brother.

91
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:37,919
Sis.

92
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,519
Huh?!

93
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,039
Drag him out.

94
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,119
I'm the chosen one again?

95
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,759
Hurry!

96
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,319
Rome.

97
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,439
Come!

98
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,199
Get up!

99
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,079
Don't hurt Lak!

100
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,599
Lak!

101
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,159
Why didn't you tell me you like violence?

102
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,399
I can arrange that!

103
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,439
Lak!

104
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,759
Let him go! Lak!

105
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,359
You and your brother'splan was to drug Tian to change her taste

106
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,799
and change her into a girl right?

107
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,559
Once you've had enough

108
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,879
you guys are going to sell her to men who have the same taste.

109
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,839
Confess to me.

110
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,919
If you tell me the truth.

111
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,079
you will survive.

112
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,039
But if not,

113
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,879
prepare yourself to be fish food.

114
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,199
Because Tian

115
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,279
belongs to me.

116
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,719
Understood?!

117
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,079
Tian is mine!

118
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,479
You sound crazy.

119
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,519
You're actually a pretty girl.

120
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,159
But you're a little weird.

121
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,799
Weird?!

122
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,119
Jane!

123
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,559
Is this a good idea?!

124
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,719
Do you hear me?! Tian belongs to me!

125
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,999
Do you hear me?!

126
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,119
Jane!

127
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,039
He's not moving!

128
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,679
Is he dead?!

129
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,159
Don't die yet!

130
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,999
Please don't die! What a waste!

131
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,799
Sis!

132
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,239
Huh?

133
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,119
Do CPR.

134
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,519
CPR?!

135
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,679
Is that a good l idea?!

136
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,959
I'm shy. Heaven and earth are watching!

137
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,119
-And --
-Sis!

138
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,839
The value I deserve

139
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,999
Gosh!

140
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,319
Why can't it be me?!

141
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,679
You're not being considerate at all!

142
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,319
Hey!

143
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,159
I thought you like girls?

144
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,799
Oh my god!

145
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,719
Jane!

146
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,439
Can you let me go now?

147
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,039
I'm losing my patience.

148
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,319
What I said was the truth.

149
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,999
You're still lying?!

150
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,839
Don't make me hurt you!

151
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,599
What the hell are you doing Chiew?!

152
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,959
Who's this?

153
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,559
These rich guys have tricked girls from our town

154
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,399
to sell them to perverted i men in Bangkok

155
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,919
My friend Tian is also a victim

156
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,999
caught them red-handed.

157
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,119
You're misunderstanding us.

158
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,159
You guys are really despicable

159
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,119
You guys have bought majority of the land here.

160
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,919
The villagers here can't even enter or exit their neighborhood

161
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,559
They have to pay a fee

162
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,199
You guys are planning

163
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,839
to take the villagers land at a cheap price aren't you?

164
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,239
You bastards!

165
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,519
Let me see.

166
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,079
Let me take a good look at you before I punch you.

167
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,359
Boss Rome!

168
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,639
Serm!

169
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,039
Would you like yellow oil from me?

170
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,399
lce would do.

171
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,559
Eyes of the wicked.

172
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,919
The two of us want to apologize to you both

173
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,399
This is the first time seeing you in person.

174
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,759
The handsome hero who has been helping the villagers all this time.

175
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,079
Please forgive us

176
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,439
That's true.

177
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,679
We listened to what Jane told us

178
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,959
and believed her.

179
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:33,839
Besides,

180
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,079
Tian is like our little sister.

181
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,759
So we were worried

182
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,999
I'm sorry Boss

183
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,479
I'm sorry.

184
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,679
It's in the past now, Forget about it.

185
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,639
But next time

186
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,759
before you do anything,

187
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,239
try listening to both sides.

188
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,999
We should press charges.

189
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,159
Put them both in jail.

190
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,959
We've carried you so many times Please don't

191
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,599
I'm sorry.

192
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:09,879
Hello.

193
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,279
Sure.

194
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,479
They called me to go rack up the fish

195
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,319
I have to go.

196
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,519
Let's go.

197
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,399
How could you do this?!

198
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,839
My reputation is ruined!

199
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,439
You guys too.

200
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,479
You like trouble!

201
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,439
Do you want to go live at the orphanage?!

202
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,759
But Jane did it because she was worried about Tian.

203
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,999
Worried my ass!

204
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,479
Do you not know

205
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,119
how much Boss Rome has helped the villagers and fishermen here?

206
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,479
He never lowered the prices on the fishes.

207
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,679
If you have no gas,

208
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,199
and you go fishing, he will add credit for you

209
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,559
Plus he never charge for interest!

210
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,359
Whoever has problems,

211
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,319
he would help.

212
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,839
But Boss Rome tricked Tian into going to Bangkok

213
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,799
Does that really exist?

214
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,519
Someone who does good

215
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,959
without wanting anything in return?

216
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,519
Tian.

217
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,399
What's the truth?

218
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,279
Jane misunderstood Boss.

219
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,199
Boss took me in under his care and has taken good care of me.

220
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,759
He provided housing,

221
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,159
food,

222
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,559
and education.

223
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,479
Boss is my benefactor

224
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,479
If you know the truth now,

225
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,959
can I take my leave?

226
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,999
No Tian!

227
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,119
Stay here with me.

228
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,559
Please?
-Hey!

229
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,959
Why are you still hanging on to Tian?!

230
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,119
Tian has a good life now.

231
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,239
You should stop bothering her now.

232
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,119
Don't meddle in my business Dad!

233
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,599
Ever since Mom died

234
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,879
have you ever cared about me?

235
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,719
All you do is go out to sea to fish!

236
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,999
You always tell me to do this and that for you!

237
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,159
And have you ever done anything good?

238
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,359
I sent you to school

239
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,399
but you refused.

240
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,119
You had a guy ask for your hand in marriage,

241
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,359
but you got yourself a giri friend.

242
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,159
It's my life.

243
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,159
I choose.

244
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,159
Tian has always been by my side

245
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,719
You don't need to care about me.

246
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,399
Go out to sea

247
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,639
and be with your fishermen

248
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,999
Go be with the fishes that you like!

249
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,039
You're better now?

250
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,639
Are you sad or happy that I'm home?

251
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,959
Go get changed and I'll take you to the company.

252
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,639
There's work for you to take over.

253
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:33,879
Huh?

254
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,039
Did you take the wrong meds?

255
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,359
Me?

256
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,359
You're joking.

257
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,439
If you come with me today,

258
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,519
I will wire you ten million baht.

259
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,719
I'm gonna go change

260
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,759
Don't take long.

261
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,359
Hello all Uncles and Aunties

262
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,399
the Prime Minister.

263
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,359
Oops!

264
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,079
Chairman of the Board of Directors,

265
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,199
assure you

266
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,119
I will make the company

267
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,519
prosperous and glorious

268
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,679
First off,

269
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,919
I would like to express a little bit of my vision

270
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,519
Enough.

271
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,519
Not yet.

272
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,199
My son...

273
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,639
is a new executive.

274
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,199
I would like for your cooperation in helping to advise and look after him.

275
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,119
Consider him a relative of yours.

276
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,519
Isn't Kula chart a little too young?

277
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,399
Im not going anywhere.

278
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,519
I will manage more important things.

279
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,079
Don't worry.

280
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,199
Image is important too.

281
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,519
Then we shouldn't make a big j deal and show off Kula chart to the media so much

282
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,879
What about his case with drugs?

283
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,519
-That scandal is quite --
-Gosh!

284
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,719
You guys don't trust me?!

285
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,919
You keep asking questions!

286
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,079
Who are you guys?!

287
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,839
I molded you!

288
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,879
Whoever is unhappy,you're free to leave!

289
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,279
Huh?!

290
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,559
You're unhappy?!

291
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,479
Are you?!.

292
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,639
Or is it you?!

293
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,519
Dad!

294
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,759
Alright kids.

295
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,399
Say goodbye to Boss now.

296
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,359
There's trouble!

297
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,359
What is it Chuen?

298
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,239
Chiew was poisoned!

299
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:24,599
Huh?!

300
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,359
Let's go!

301
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,159
Go!

302
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,919
It's not our business.

303
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,119
We should go Tian.

304
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,119
Tian!

305
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,839
Chiew!

306
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:50,999
Sis!

307
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,079
What happened?

308
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,439
Hey.

309
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,479
Whose crate?

310
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,759
Who put it there?

311
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,559
Chiew.

312
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,079
Don't mess with it.

313
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,279
We don't know what it is.

314
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,479
If there's a bomb in there and it explodes,
it's not my fault.

315
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:13,639
Look.

316
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,159
Why are you scared? Open it.

317
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,159
What's so difficult?

318
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,719
May be there's money.

319
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,679
There's money in here.

320
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,319
Money.

321
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,919
We're going to be rich

322
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,359
There's money

323
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,359
Excuse me.

324
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,119
Can we pass through?

325
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,639
Someone is sick and l need to take him to the hospital

326
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:42,839
You can't pass

327
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,399
This is private road

328
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,799
If you enter, it's trespassing

329
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,839
Isn't that too cruel?

330
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,279
We've been using this road for a long time

331
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,759
Well, that's you guys fault

332
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,639
Should have sold your land

333
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,839
You could have been near a hospital.

334
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,879
I can't help you.

335
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,399
So actually,

336
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,759
you guys work for that bastard investor

337
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,559
that the villagers are talking about

338
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,279
Boss

339
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,959
We can take Chiew on the boat

340
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,599
And what port would you go to?

341
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,119
Our company rented all of it already

342
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:20,719
Rome.

343
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,439
Chiew is puking.

344
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,999
He'll be fine now.

345
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,999
He's released some of that toxin out.

346
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,439
l almost died!

347
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,919
Maybe next time you'll die faster.

348
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,759
Watch your backs

349
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,519
Go back and tell your boss

350
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,719
that lill be shutting down his company soon.

351
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,599
The villagers won't sell him their land.

352
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,999
I will help them.

353
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,159
What a joke!

354
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,319
Gosh, you're cocky

355
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,199
You guys don't know who our boss is

356
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,519
Mr. Kamoltat from TS Group!

357
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,759
You know him?

358
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,479
Ka molt at.

359
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,159
Hello?

360
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:05,879
Tian.

361
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,759
Is that you Tian?

362
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,759
Chart.

363
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,959
Is your dad home?

364
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,479
Dad...

365
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,839
Dad is sick.

366
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,079
He's at the hospital.

367
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,719
Whatever you need,you can tell me.

368
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,919
I need your help with something.

369
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,439
I'm going to go see Tian, Mom.

370
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,719
She needs me for something

371
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,079
Chiew.

372
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,679
$ Chiew.
-He can't stay like this for long

373
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,279
He needs to go to the hospital.

374
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,159
I'll take him

375
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,119
I'm coming too.

376
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,999
If they won't let us pass.

377
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,999
one of us has to go down then

378
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,919
-Chiew!
Boss!

379
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,719
Should we wait a little?

380
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,559
Send someone to go check out the area first.

381
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,559
There's no time.

382
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:08,639
Hey.

383
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,399
Does this mean

384
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,639
we can pass through?

385
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,879
Yes.

386
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,479
It's a public road!

387
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:27,999
We can-share.

388
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,519
Mr. Kamol tat's son just told us earlier.

389
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,479
Go ahead

390
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,519
Where?

391
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,079
Where is Ka mol tat'sson?

392
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,239
I think we should take Chiew to the hospital now.

393
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:38,919
Jane.

394
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,599
Take Tian home

395
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,759
Ser mandl will be back soon

396
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,279
Boss.

397
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,479
Take care of yourself

398
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,479
You talk as if I'm a kid!

399
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:53,919
See you later.

400
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,399
Let's go.

401
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,759
I never imagined

402
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,679
that that bastard investor would have a good son

403
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,199
I really want to see how he looks like

404
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,119
Jane.

405
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,359
-Hmm?
-I have to go now.

406
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,239
Thankyou for everything

407
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,319
Give this letter to Boss

408
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,359
Tian!

409
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,159
I am here!

410
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,759
Tian!

411
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,519
Where are you going?!

412
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,959
Tian stop!

413
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:27,919
Tian!

414
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,199
You see?

415
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,479
I did everything you told me.

416
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,919
You can't run from me now.

417
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,159
I came as I promised.

418
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,879
I'm so happy

419
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,599
that you called.

420
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,359
All the problems have ended now.

421
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,119
Where should we go?

422
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,399
Should we buy a condo to live in together?

423
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,919
Buy one next to the beach

424
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,079
I want to go back to Bangkok

425
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,159
Sure if you want.

426
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,559
Once we go back,we can buy a project house that cost around 20 million.

427
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,599
Mom and Dad will allow it.

428
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,279
Especially now that Dad is hospitalized

429
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,519
He let me manage the work at the company

430
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,719
Whatever you want.

431
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,839
you can tell me

432
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,799
I want to see your dad

433
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:48,959
Huh?

434
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,919
Doctor!

435
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,239
How is Chiew?

436
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,399
Rest assured

437
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,199
We got his blood result from the lab

438
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,959
and we know the toxin now

439
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,159
He's...

440
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,479
okay. We just have to treat him as it goes.

441
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,239
Luckily you brought the patient here in time.

442
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,359
If it was slower than this, who knows?

443
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,599
You can go visit him if you want.

444
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,079
He's awake?!

445
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:23,479
Yes.

446
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,639
Boss.

447
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,519
I'm going to go visit Chiew now.
-Okay

448
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,079
Chiew!

449
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,359
Must have been Ka mol tat's doing.

450
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,199
He even hurt an innocent villager

451
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,239
If this continues,

452
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,519
it's going to end badly.

453
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,559
It depends who will win in the end

454
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,799
It's this room

455
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,279
Yes, it is.

456
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,519
Chart.

457
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,919
It's better l go speak to Mr K a molt at alone

458
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,239
Better how?

459
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,319
I'm begging you.

460
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,439
Wait for me out here.

461
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:42,919
Tian.

462
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,959
How did you get here?

463
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,279
You must be surprised.

464
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,479
You sent someone to kill me

465
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,919
but I survived.

466
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,639
What are you talking about?

467
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,959
I never sent anyone to kill you.

468
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,879
There's no reason.

469
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,759
Oh.

470
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,079
Rome.

471
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,919
Must have been him

472
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,519
He slandered me.

473
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,439
You know its origin more than anyone.

474
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:42,999
Yes.

475
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,119
It's my father's ring.

476
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,919
He wanted to give it to his first grandchild

477
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,359
But under one condition.

478
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,599
It has to be a grandson.

479
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,319
But because l was born a girl

480
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,879
you gave me to Thom ya

481
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,759
in exchange for Kula chart

482
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,759
You lied to your own father that he has a grandson.

483
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,919
In hopes of him giving you his inheritance,correct?

484
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:13,919
Not true.

485
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,639
How...

486
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,279
do you know about this?

487
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,199
Rome.

488
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,759
Rome told you about this?

489
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,559
That liar!

490
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,439
Boss didn't tell me

491
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,839
The incidents in the past made me connect the pieces easily

492
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,639
Someone like you

493
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,799
is capable of doing everything for power and money.

494
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,439
You can even kill people for it

495
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,199
Tian.

496
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,319
You're...

497
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,639
misunderstanding me.

498
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,479
How so?!

499
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,479
Chan was shot and killed right in front of me!

500
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,799
Boss and other people almost died because of you!

501
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,559
But that's nothing.

502
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,199
Mr. Kama it hon

503
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,559
your own brother,

504
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,159
was murdered by you

505
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,519
Thon was in a car accident

506
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,959
I was not involved. It was an accident.

507
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,239
Even though you deny it,

508
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:16,119
but heaven saw what you did

509
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,159
I don't know what Rome

510
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,119
has said to you,

511
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,679
but I never thought of killing anyone.

512
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,359
Especially my own child.

513
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,999
Think about it.

514
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,999
If I were to kill you,

515
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,959
you would have been dead by now.

516
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,999
But you don't deny

517
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,599
that you did give me to Chai and Thom ya.

518
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,319
Yes.

519
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:45,919
I admit.

520
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,839
But there was another reason.

521
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,239
Tian.

522
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,199
Listen.

523
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:53,839
Hello?

524
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,319
It's me.

525
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,719
Iran out.

526
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,759
Get me some more

527
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,239
I have money

528
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,679
That's not true.

529
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,439
I don't believe you.

530
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,079
You're lying!

531
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,159
You don't have to believe me

532
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,839
I understand

533
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,719
Rome probably slandered me with so many things.

534
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,959
I'm a bad person in your eyes.

535
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,839
There's no reason that Boss would do that.

536
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,959
He hates me.

537
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,439
I caught him

538
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,759
swindling my dad'scompany

539
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,559
and there's also the factory.

540
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,119
He's holding a grudge and thinks that I burn down his factory.

541
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,479
When he found out about me and you

542
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,079
he took the opportunity

543
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,599
to use you as a tool to get revenge on me.

544
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,159
But the person trying to kill me

545
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,199
is Pats a korn,

546
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,439
your subordinate.

547
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,519
Are you going to say you know nothing about that?

548
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,839
With Pat,

549
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,119
I swear to you,

550
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:56,799
I never sent him to kill you

551
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,759
You see?

552
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,239
You're blaming other people

553
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,639
You are slandering Boss

554
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:12,279
If he'sa bad person, he wouldn't have taken care of Mr. Kama it hon til the end

555
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,479
What?

556
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,319
What did you say?

557
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,639
Thon...

558
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,159
Didn't hedie at the scene?

559
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,399
So...

560
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,359
how did he die?

561
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,519
When?

562
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,479
How is Rome involved?

563
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,639
I came here today

564
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:36,119
to find out how you could have done those horrible things.

565
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,559
I wanted to hear it from you

566
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,319
of how you could get rid of me when..

567
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,599
I'm your biological child.

568
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,919
Im disappointed

569
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,399
You're a very pathetic and petty person, Mr. Ka molt at.

570
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,559
You don't have to send anyone to kill me anymore.

571
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,879
J won't stay to obstruct anyone's interests anymore.

572
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,439
Don't worry.

573
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,399

00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,039

578
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,559
Don't let her go.

579
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,639

580
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,519

585
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,559
The dealer got arrested?

586
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,039
Go find someone else then

587
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,799
Tell him I got the money, No worries.

588
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,119

594
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,359

00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,399
What the hell?

596
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:38,959
Tian b

597
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,799
My dad

598
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,439
was very sick.

599
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,399
He told me every day that he wanted a grandson

600
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,359
Soll had to swap you with Kula chart.

601
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,399
But l gave some money to Thom ya and Chai

602
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,639
to raise you.

603
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,519
But it wasn't enough

604
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,519
They were greedy

605
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,919
They wanted a ransom price for you

606
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,039
When l didn't give it to them

607
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,759
they ran away with you

608
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,479
I tried looking for you but l couldn't find you anywhere.

609
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:23,799
Dad!

610
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,719
Kula chart.

611
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,239
Keep it down.

612
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,759
Your father is resting

613
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,759
I won't keep it down!

614
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,919
Tian got away!

615
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,679
What did Dad say to Tian to upset her?!

616
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,039
- I thought they came to --
-Stop!

617
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,279
Don't be loud!

618
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,319
Just get out of here

619
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,639
Go!

620
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,999
Get out.
-Dad!

621
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,799
Get out!

622
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,759
Just go away.

623
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,119
What's up?

624
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,479
Seeing my face makes you disappointed?

625
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,599
Chart.

626
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:13,279
U heard your life is good now because you get to manage your dad's business.

627
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:19,199
You should be kind and give me some of that money to spend.

628
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,719
I'm really struggling right now

629
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,719
I have to be on the run because I helped you.

630
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,119
Do you remember?

631
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,199
I don't have much.

632
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,879
Mom and Dad are managing my account.

633
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,559
I have to ask them if I need the money.

634
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,239
Bro!

635
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,519
What are you doing?!

636
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,359
This is good'stuff.

637
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:48,759
Bro.

638
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,719
Are you playing with me?

639
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,999
This isn't enough money.

640
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,839
I thought you said you are willing to pay no matter what cost.

641
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,119
What is this?

642
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,719
I'm not joking.

643
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,639
That's all I have, You saw.

644
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,359
I'll give you some more later, I won't bail.

645
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:16,039
Money and gold are materialistic things.

646
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:19,399
I think you can do more for me.

647
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,679
Because you and your giri friend has done me dirty.

648
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,719
It's time

649
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,199
that you pay back my gratitude.

650
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,679
What do you mean?

651
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,959

671
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,359
Jane!

672
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,319
You're really leaving?!

00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:41,999
Let her go

676
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,079
If she doesn't see me as her father,

677
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:53,999
Hey!

678
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,479
Why do you run from your problems?

679
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,599
Why won't you just talk to your father?

680
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,719
Why leave?

681
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,719
I know you're'sad about your father

682
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,279
because he has no time for you

683
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,599
He's strict with you but you have to understand him.

684
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,479
He did everything

685
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,839
because of you,no

686
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,199
Don't bother me

687
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,559
Don't act like you know everything.

688
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,479
You're rich.

689
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,999
You have a father

690
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,159
and a mother.

691
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,319
You will never know

692
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,039
how it feels to live without a mother

693
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,199
and have a father who doesn't care.

694
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,999
It's very painful.

695
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,479
Why wouldn't I know?

696
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,999
I know how painful it is.

697
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,719
My mom died when I was born

698
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,639
My dad died when l was younger.

699
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,919
My family business went bankrupt.

700
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,999
We only had one can of sardine and had to'share among my other two siblings.

701
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,399
That's a good life, right?

702
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,119
But I was lucky

703
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,519
because Rome is skillful.

704
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,239
He was able to make our family rich again.

705
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,119
Jane

706
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,439
Your father isn't a bad person

707
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,359
If you're going to leave him.

708
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,399
bid your farewell

709
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,079
You have the chance to talk to him still

710
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,679
If you want to go

711
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,999
don't go without saying goodbye.

712
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,559
came to say goodbye my dad to Bangkok

713
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,399
Huh?

714
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,879
What did you say?

715
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,039
J came to say goodbye, I'm going to Bangkok

716
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,839
Don't say I'm stupid

717
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,279
You can't even interpret that

718
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:40,999
You can't.

719
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,879
Only to Boss Rome's house

720
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:45,799

It will be my pleasure.

722
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,119
No Dad!

723
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,759
I don't want to go stay there.

724
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:52,759
Hey.

725
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:56,839

761
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,159

764
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,199
In the'end,

765
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,079
you still have to depend on me Kamolt at.

766
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,559
Why did you tell Pats a korn to go get Tian?

767
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:53,999
What happened?

768
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,319
Don't meddle

769
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,079
When you're done,take me to go shower

770
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,839
I want to go home already

771
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,319
If the doctor doesn't allow it,

772
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,719
sign the papers for me.

773
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,439
I can't.

774
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,559
You can't leave the hospital

775
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,479
until the doctor gives you permission.

776
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,439
Fine.

777
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,959
I will go talk to the doctor!

778
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,879
You guys are so kind.

779
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,479
You came to visit me

780
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,039
Thank you so much

781
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,479
Ka molt at.

782
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,159
Where did you take Tian?

783
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,199
You're her guardian.

784
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:42,119
" Where is Tian?" Are you crazy asking me that?!

785
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,159
Someone saw Kula chart bring Tian here.

786
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,919
Tell us where Tian is and we won't press charges

787
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,839
I just came to take her home

788
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,839
That's all.

789
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,039
Look at yourself.

790
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,679
You're about to die.

791
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,639
Stop creating karma

792
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,919
It's true Tian came here with Kula chart

793
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,359
But she took off

794
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,359
Kula chart couldn't find her either.

795
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,519
I too want to know

796
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,879
where she's at right now.

797
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,279
I'm worried about her too.

798
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,639
Tian came to talk to you

799
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,159
Talk about what?

800
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:20,959
Whatever we talked about

801
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,119
is between us!

802
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,239

00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,719
Stop.

805
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,639
What's going on here?

806
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,839
That means...

807
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,519
you don't know yet?

808
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,039
Tian

809
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,199
is your biological daughter

810
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,319
with Ka molt at.

811
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,279
But Ka molt at was afraid he wouldn't get the inheritance stated in the will

812
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,319
so he tried to kill Tian.

813
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,279
How did you get here dear?

814
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,959
I have a favor to ask you.

815
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:09,239
If you can make Tian accept me as her father,

816
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,759
I will reward you.

817
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,599

824
