kill him when you see him

23
00:01:44,023 --> 00:01:44,822
You don't know?!

I really don't know!

25
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,502
You're not lying?!

26
00:01:51,663 --> 00:01:54,222
Small like her, she even got beaten up.

27
00:01:54,263 --> 00:01:56,062
Go get all the men in the village.

28
00:01:56,223 --> 00:01:57,902
We're going to fight them!

29
00:01:58,343 --> 00:02:00,062

Tian.

It hurts!

33
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:11,622

Don't get up yet.

You're not feeling well.

38
00:03:37,303 --> 00:03:39,382
Just let me die

39
00:03:40,383 --> 00:03:41,462
Don't say that.

40
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,742
You might just be allergic to the sea nettle's venom.

41
00:03:46,303 --> 00:03:47,862
Your wound is healing.

42
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:58,142

Shooting has begun. Serm!

53

Keep shooting

57
00:04:40,303 --> 00:04:40,902
I'll be back.

58
00:04:41,023 --> 00:04:41,502
OK.

00:04:45,543 --> 00:04:47,382
Where are we going?

to a safe place when there's danger

62
00:04:52,463 --> 00:04:54,142
Stop asking and let's just go!

63
00:05:01,183 --> 00:05:02,582
Follow me if you don't wanna die.

64
00:05:03,823 --> 00:05:04,222
Go!

65
00:05:06,663 --> 00:05:07,502

00:05:52,183 --> 00:05:53,462
Stop your shenanigans!

71
00:05:54,503 --> 00:05:55,142
Put the weapons down!

72
00:05:55,703 --> 00:05:57,022
All of you step away from the house.

73
00:05:57,343 --> 00:05:57,982
Otherwise,

74
00:05:58,383 --> 00:06:00,022
this bitch and the kids will die!

75
00:06:03,983 --> 00:06:05,702
Serm!

76
00:06:17,783 --> 00:06:19,142

00:06:24,743 --> 00:06:25,942
What are you guys gonna do to us?!

79
00:06:26,423 --> 00:06:27,742
You dare have a problem with me?

80
00:06:29,463 --> 00:06:30,502
You wanna die?

81
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,822
I'm giving you one last chance.

82
00:06:34,863 --> 00:06:35,582
Tell me

83
00:06:35,703 --> 00:06:37,262
where Rome and Tian are at.

84
00:06:38,183 --> 00:06:39,822
I don't know.

85
00:06:42,743 --> 00:06:44,022
If you want to shoot me

86
00:06:44,703 --> 00:06:45,622
shoot then!

87
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:46,982
If you're going to shoot him

88
00:06:48,303 --> 00:06:49,542
Shoot us too.

89
00:06:50,263 --> 00:06:51,222
Chiew!

90
00:06:53,743 --> 00:06:54,582
Burn the house

91
00:06:55,023 --> 00:06:55,582

00:06:55,783 --> 00:06:56,982
No!

93
00:07:00,303 --> 00:07:01,622
You bastards!

94
00:07:07,303 --> 00:07:08,142
I'm cold.

95
00:07:16,463 --> 00:07:17,582
Tian, I'm sorry.

96
00:07:18,663 --> 00:07:20,262
I'll take you to see a doctor.

97
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:22,462
You have to be okay.

98
00:07:47,143 --> 00:07:47,782
My house!

99
00:07:50,263 --> 00:07:51,702

100
00:07:52,023 --> 00:07:53,462
where Rome and Tian are at?

101
00:07:54,383 --> 00:07:55,302
Dream on it!

102
00:07:59,263 --> 00:07:59,942

112
00:08:50,503 --> 00:08:51,382
Hang in there Tian.

00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:19,862
Boss said not to hurt Tian!

114
00:09:19,943 --> 00:09:20,702
Go!

115
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:34,342
Tian.

00:10:22,183 --> 00:10:22,822

Jane!

135
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:44,382
Stay still and do not move.

136
00:11:44,783 --> 00:11:45,782
I don't wanna kill people

137
00:11:50,183 --> 00:11:50,862
Thanks alot.

138
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:53,502
If you didn't save me, I would have been dead.

139
00:11:53,863 --> 00:11:54,422
Tian.

140
00:11:58,463 --> 00:11:59,822
She's burning up.

141
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,182
She's hot Boss.

142
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:04,662
Help me.

143
00:12:16,663 --> 00:12:17,302
Arrest him!

144
00:12:17,463 --> 00:12:19,942
He's the one that kidnapped my daughter from Bangkok!

145
00:12:23,023 --> 00:12:24,702
How dare you call Tian your daughter?

146
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:29,382
The girl you've been trying to kill this whole time and you have the nerves to call her your daughter?!

147
00:12:30,823 --> 00:12:31,742
Are you slandering me?

148
00:12:31,983 --> 00:12:33,142
It's defamation!

149
00:12:33,743 --> 00:12:34,702
Oh.

150
00:12:34,983 --> 00:12:37,982
Are you scared that Tian will love me more?

151
00:12:38,543 --> 00:12:39,742
I'll tell you something

152
00:12:40,183 --> 00:12:42,622
Blood is thicker than water!

153
00:12:44,903 --> 00:12:45,902
Rome!

154
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:47,502
Both of you stop

155
00:12:48,063 --> 00:12:49,662
Or else both of you will have to go to the station.

156
00:12:50,343 --> 00:12:52,542
Both of you have a lot of records

157
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:56,262
Everyone.

158
00:12:56,863 --> 00:12:57,742
Tian is awake.

159
00:12:58,743 --> 00:12:59,662
Don't worry.

160
00:13:00,023 --> 00:13:00,382
Tian.

161
00:13:01,303 --> 00:13:01,902
Wait.

162
00:13:02,303 --> 00:13:02,902
Where are you going?

163
00:13:03,863 --> 00:13:05,102
Tian wants to rest.

164
00:13:05,463 --> 00:13:07,022
My supervisor said no visitors.

165
00:13:09,783 --> 00:13:11,742
Can l go see my daughter Pao?

166
00:13:12,023 --> 00:13:13,262
I'm worried about her.

167
00:13:38,863 --> 00:13:39,902
Tian.

168
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:42,302
You're okay now.

169
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:44,742
Get lots of rest

170
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:47,182
so you can go home soon.

171
00:13:48,503 --> 00:13:49,302
Mom.

172
00:13:50,943 --> 00:13:52,142
Where's Boss?

173
00:13:53,503 --> 00:13:54,342
Rome...

174
00:13:54,623 --> 00:13:56,582
and everyone are waiting outside

175
00:13:59,143 --> 00:14:01,222
Don't let anyone hurt him.

176
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:04,382
Okay.

177
00:14:05,903 --> 00:14:07,502
Get some sleep.

178
00:14:15,543 --> 00:14:16,022
Pit.

179
00:14:16,543 --> 00:14:17,502
Are you crazy?

180
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:19,302
Rome can't escape now

181
00:14:20,183 --> 00:14:21,502
He's going to get charged

182
00:14:21,823 --> 00:14:23,902
And now you want me to let this go?

183
00:14:27,063 --> 00:14:28,462
It's not me.

184
00:14:28,903 --> 00:14:29,982
But Tian.

185
00:14:30,423 --> 00:14:32,142
She asked not to press charges against him

186
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,102
also agree with her

187
00:14:34,783 --> 00:14:36,022
Let's just let it be bygones.

188
00:14:36,263 --> 00:14:37,862
For our daughter's sake.

189
00:14:40,343 --> 00:14:41,302
Think about it.

190
00:14:42,103 --> 00:14:43,462
If he doesn't stop

191
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:45,902
and expose us,slander us

192
00:14:46,543 --> 00:14:48,102
he brainwashes Tian to hate us,

193
00:14:48,303 --> 00:14:48,782
what are we gonna do?

194
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:50,062
You're gonna allow that?

195
00:15:00,423 --> 00:15:01,662
l'dlike to see the patient

196
00:15:02,183 --> 00:15:03,182
I'm her guardian.

197
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:04,342
You can't.

198
00:15:04,823 --> 00:15:07,702
Lieutenant said there are no *m visitors according to doctor'sorder

199
00:15:08,103 --> 00:15:08,782
I'm sorry.

200
00:15:09,143 --> 00:15:09,742
Okay.

201
00:15:19,063 --> 00:15:19,942
Stop!

202
00:15:25,903 --> 00:15:26,422
Tian.

203
00:15:28,023 --> 00:15:29,462
Tian, are you okay?

204
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:32,502
I'm better.

205
00:15:38,383 --> 00:15:39,622
I'm sorry.

206
00:15:40,183 --> 00:15:41,662
I won't let this happen to you again.

207
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,782
I will take care of you and protect you.

208
00:15:48,463 --> 00:15:49,022
Stop!

209
00:15:49,303 --> 00:15:50,302
Step away from the patient!

210
00:15:50,623 --> 00:15:51,462
Let Tian go!

211
00:15:52,183 --> 00:15:53,422
Nurse,go check on the patient!

212
00:15:54,103 --> 00:15:54,862
Let me go Pao!

213
00:15:54,903 --> 00:15:55,662
You, come with me.

214
00:15:56,023 --> 00:15:56,422
Come here!

215
00:15:56,463 --> 00:15:56,862
Tian.

216
00:15:57,743 --> 00:15:58,382
Pao!

217
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,342
Come on!

218
00:16:00,943 --> 00:16:01,462
Rome!

219
00:16:01,983 --> 00:16:02,862
What did you do to Tian?!

220
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:04,822
He's dangerous!

221
00:16:05,183 --> 00:16:05,982
Let me go!

222
00:16:06,823 --> 00:16:07,702
Tian!

223
00:16:10,823 --> 00:16:11,542
Come here.

224
00:16:12,143 --> 00:16:12,662
Let go!

225
00:16:12,743 --> 00:16:13,342
Sit!

226
00:16:14,783 --> 00:16:15,782
What are you doing?

227
00:16:16,223 --> 00:16:17,102
Do you realize it?

228
00:16:18,823 --> 00:16:20,262
You almost killed Tian.

229
00:16:20,263 --> 00:16:22,822
If Tian had come to the hospital any ater,she would ve been dead by now

230
00:16:26,543 --> 00:16:27,022
Rome.

231
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:28,622
You need to stop.

232
00:16:29,143 --> 00:16:30,342
If you still love Tian.

233
00:16:33,863 --> 00:16:35,462
But I won't let it end like this.

234
00:16:38,503 --> 00:16:39,662
I can't lose Tian.

235
00:16:40,463 --> 00:16:41,062
Rome.

236
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:43,622
Listen carefully to me.

237
00:16:45,263 --> 00:16:46,582
It's fate.

238
00:16:47,063 --> 00:16:49,502
It's fate that you set for yourself.

239
00:16:50,063 --> 00:16:51,342
You need to let it play out.

240
00:16:51,943 --> 00:16:55,902
You can't control Tian's life anymore because you've done a lot already!

241
00:16:56,663 --> 00:16:57,862
From now on,

242
00:16:58,543 --> 00:17:00,502
you need to let whatever happens happen.

243
00:17:00,503 --> 00:17:02,702
Even if it's not what you wanted.

244
00:17:04,863 --> 00:17:06,102
You need to accept the truth.

245
00:17:20,303 --> 00:17:22,102
In what capacity have-you been with Mr, Rome?

246
00:17:25,223 --> 00:17:26,382
Mr. Rome

247
00:17:26,663 --> 00:17:29,222
was my caretaker,a guardian

248
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:31,662
He gave me a place to live

249
00:17:32,503 --> 00:17:36,582
provided food,and good education.

250
00:17:37,103 --> 00:17:39,742
Then later in what capacity did you come to live with Mr. Ka molt at?

251
00:17:39,743 --> 00:17:41,262
What is the relationship there?

252
00:17:42,663 --> 00:17:44,142
Tian is my daughter.

253
00:17:44,503 --> 00:17:47,222
We are going to hold a press conference soon.

254
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,502
Ms. Tian.

255
00:17:52,543 --> 00:17:56,262
Did you come stay with Mr K amol tat with your own consent?

256
00:17:58,583 --> 00:17:59,062
Yes.

257
00:17:59,303 --> 00:18:00,582
came willingly.

258
00:18:03,863 --> 00:18:06,342
What about Mr K a molt at filing a police report

259
00:18:06,943 --> 00:18:08,462
that you got abducted by Mr, Rome,

260
00:18:08,903 --> 00:18:12,102
by using'force, threats, and confinement?

261
00:18:12,743 --> 00:18:13,862
Boss and

262
00:18:15,663 --> 00:18:17,982
I willingly left with Mr Rome.

263
00:18:18,663 --> 00:18:20,382
We just went on a trip.

264
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,422
So what?

265
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:25,022
That means Mr. Ka molt at filed a wrong report?

266
00:18:26,623 --> 00:18:28,982
I'm sorry Officer.

267
00:18:29,263 --> 00:18:32,982
I probably was startled that my daughter was missing

268
00:18:33,503 --> 00:18:35,062
sol said some wrong things

269
00:18:35,983 --> 00:18:38,782
Besides, I think Tian is a little confused still.

270
00:18:39,063 --> 00:18:41,382
I think she can't give you a statement yet.

271
00:18:42,423 --> 00:18:45,102
We will contact you when she's ready

272
00:18:46,303 --> 00:18:46,902
Here.

273
00:18:48,943 --> 00:18:50,742
The number to my legal team

274
00:18:51,343 --> 00:18:52,902
You can call them at any time.

275
00:18:53,263 --> 00:18:53,782
Sure.

276
00:18:55,503 --> 00:18:56,782
Excuse us then.

277
00:19:01,063 --> 00:19:01,542
Tian.

278
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:05,102
Why didn't you tell the police that Rome abducted you?

279
00:19:06,303 --> 00:19:07,222
Look what he did.

280
00:19:07,743 --> 00:19:10,222
You almost died because of a sea nettle venom.

281
00:19:11,623 --> 00:19:12,942
That retarded...

282
00:19:13,783 --> 00:19:15,662
Boss would never hurt me.

283
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:19,782
And when will you stop going after him?

284
00:19:20,183 --> 00:19:21,422
Listen to me Tian.

285
00:19:21,903 --> 00:19:23,542
I sent people after you

286
00:19:24,223 --> 00:19:25,222
because l was worried.

287
00:19:25,423 --> 00:19:26,662
I wasn't trying to hurt anyone.

288
00:19:28,943 --> 00:19:30,102
It was Rome

289
00:19:30,383 --> 00:19:32,462
that used you as a tool to get revenge on me.

290
00:19:33,183 --> 00:19:34,142
Once that failed,

291
00:19:34,623 --> 00:19:36,302
he became belligerent and refuses to stop.

292
00:19:38,263 --> 00:19:39,542
He doesn't love you

293
00:19:40,663 --> 00:19:41,582
He deceived you.

294
00:19:41,623 --> 00:19:42,862
He was only using you.

295
00:19:42,903 --> 00:19:43,662
Right Pit?

296
00:19:45,903 --> 00:19:46,662
Look.

297
00:19:47,343 --> 00:19:50,182
Let'snot talk about anything stressful right now.

298
00:19:52,823 --> 00:19:55,382
But regardless, Boss is my benefactor.

299
00:19:56,783 --> 00:19:59,382
If you won't promise me you will stop bothering him

300
00:20:01,143 --> 00:20:02,542
then lill walk away from you.

301
00:20:08,383 --> 00:20:09,142
Hey.

302
00:20:10,063 --> 00:20:11,102
What's wrong?

303
00:20:13,063 --> 00:20:13,942
Nothing much.

304
00:20:14,423 --> 00:20:16,782
I feel a little dizzy and my head hurts.

305
00:20:19,303 --> 00:20:20,502
The doctor told me

306
00:20:21,343 --> 00:20:23,142
my final phase will be like this

307
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:26,662
I don't have much time left.

308
00:20:29,223 --> 00:20:31,302
And Kula chart just disappeared

309
00:20:32,143 --> 00:20:33,422
If Tian also walk away,

310
00:20:34,783 --> 00:20:35,582
I probably...

311
00:20:36,503 --> 00:20:37,862
won't be dying in peace.

312
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:42,582
Mom.

313
00:20:43,543 --> 00:20:44,742
Where did Kula chart go?

314
00:21:00,423 --> 00:21:01,462
Turn off your car.

315
00:21:02,663 --> 00:21:03,382
Hello.

316
00:21:04,303 --> 00:21:05,022
Hi Officer.

317
00:21:05,943 --> 00:21:07,142
Checking my alcohol level?

318
00:21:07,703 --> 00:21:08,222
Go ahead

319
00:21:08,903 --> 00:21:10,062
Not that.

320
00:21:10,463 --> 00:21:11,502
I'd like to see your driver's license.

321
00:21:12,383 --> 00:21:12,902
Sure.

322
00:21:13,663 --> 00:21:14,262
Search thoroughly.

323
00:21:14,503 --> 00:21:15,062
Yes sir.

324
00:21:15,423 --> 00:21:15,902

00:21:15,943 --> 00:21:16,902
My driver's license.

326
00:21:19,703 --> 00:21:20,262
What is this?

327
00:21:20,623 --> 00:21:21,342
Get down from the car!

328
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:22,142
Now.

329
00:21:27,543 --> 00:21:28,182
Against the car.

330
00:21:29,223 --> 00:21:29,822
Sergeant Major.
4855

331
00:21:41,223 --> 00:21:41,822

332
00:21:41,823 --> 00:21:42,222
Sergeant Major.
4855

333
00:21:42,223 --> 00:21:42,622

334
00:21:42,623 --> 00:21:43,222

U4855

338
00:21:47,343 --> 00:21:48,102
What is this?
4855

339
00:21:48,663 --> 00:21:49,422
Control..
485

340
00:21:58,903 --> 00:22:00,022
Are you okay Tian?

341
00:22:00,303 --> 00:22:01,222
I heard the news.

342
00:22:01,663 --> 00:22:02,582
I'm fine.

343
00:22:04,383 --> 00:22:05,742
I just feel tired.

344
00:22:05,943 --> 00:22:07,382
I'm going to go rest.

345
00:22:07,543 --> 00:22:08,502
Wait dear

346
00:22:09,343 --> 00:22:11,982
A ey cooked you some food Why don't you eat first?

347
00:22:17,343 --> 00:22:18,702
Don't trust Ka molt at.

348
00:22:18,783 --> 00:22:21,982
He sent people to come shoot Boss.
Usa w with my eyes.

349
00:22:28,303 --> 00:22:28,902
Tian.

350
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:31,262
Stay and eat with us first.

351
00:22:36,943 --> 00:22:38,942
Why are you this cruel?

352
00:22:40,383 --> 00:22:41,822
Why did you send people to kill Boss?!

353
00:22:44,503 --> 00:22:45,142
Tian.

354
00:22:45,183 --> 00:22:46,542
You're misunderstanding me

355
00:22:47,463 --> 00:22:49,062
I never sent anyone to kill people

356
00:22:52,543 --> 00:22:53,222
Pat...

357
00:22:54,223 --> 00:22:55,382
did more than was told.

358
00:22:56,063 --> 00:22:57,342
If you don't like him,

359
00:22:57,583 --> 00:22:58,502
I will handle him.

360
00:23:00,263 --> 00:23:01,022
Handle?

361
00:23:02,543 --> 00:23:04,862
By handle, you mean kill?

362
00:23:05,623 --> 00:23:06,382
No!

363
00:23:06,623 --> 00:23:07,622
It's not like that.

364
00:23:09,303 --> 00:23:10,702
I never thought like that.

365
00:23:11,303 --> 00:23:12,462
I never killed anyone.

366
00:23:16,303 --> 00:23:17,862
Calm down Tian.

367
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:21,102
Your father did it is because he was upset

368
00:23:21,823 --> 00:23:22,982
that you went missing.

369
00:23:25,943 --> 00:23:26,502
Sure.

370
00:23:27,463 --> 00:23:28,542
I understand now,

371
00:23:30,143 --> 00:23:32,302
From now on, I won't go anywhere.

372
00:23:32,903 --> 00:23:34,062
I won't go missing again.

373
00:23:35,663 --> 00:23:37,022
I will stay here

374
00:23:38,303 --> 00:23:40,182
until your last day.

375
00:23:41,783 --> 00:23:42,142
Tian.

376
00:23:53,903 --> 00:23:54,662
Damn it!

377
00:24:03,783 --> 00:24:04,702
What is it Lawyer?

378
00:24:05,103 --> 00:24:06,142
Why are you calling so late?

379
00:24:06,703 --> 00:24:08,022
I'm sorry to bother you sir

380
00:24:08,063 --> 00:24:10,062
But your son caused a big problem

381
00:24:10,343 --> 00:24:12,262
He used the company'scar to transport drugs.

382
00:24:12,663 --> 00:24:13,982
He'sat the checkpoint right now.

383
00:24:14,343 --> 00:24:15,182
What do we do?

384
00:24:16,023 --> 00:24:16,742
In that case,

385
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:19,142
can you handle it for me?

386
00:24:19,903 --> 00:24:20,822
Make it as quiet as possible

387
00:24:21,623 --> 00:24:23,022
Then take him to the safe house.

388
00:24:23,423 --> 00:24:24,742
Don't bring him back here

389
00:24:25,663 --> 00:24:26,542
Copy sir.

390
00:24:43,143 --> 00:24:44,262
Dad knows about this now?

391
00:24:45,543 --> 00:24:46,542
What did he say?

392
00:24:46,903 --> 00:24:47,582
Is he mad?

393
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:49,222
No.

394
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:52,182
But you must stay here until things die down.

395
00:24:54,263 --> 00:24:54,662
Okay.

396
00:24:55,623 --> 00:24:56,182
Oh.

397
00:24:56,863 --> 00:24:58,622
Do you have 20,000 on you?

398
00:24:59,343 --> 00:25:00,302
I wanna play baccarat

399
00:25:01,303 --> 00:25:02,262
Where?

400
00:25:02,423 --> 00:25:02,782
Well,

401
00:25:03,223 --> 00:25:04,942
on my phone.

402
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:06,982
Give me some more capital. I'll pay you back

403
00:25:11,023 --> 00:25:12,062
My phone!

404
00:25:12,703 --> 00:25:14,942
Your father told me to take your phone

405
00:25:14,983 --> 00:25:16,422
He told you to stay put

406
00:25:16,463 --> 00:25:17,462
Don't cause any more problems

407
00:25:17,703 --> 00:25:18,182
Huh?!

408
00:25:18,623 --> 00:25:19,302
Hey!

409
00:25:20,703 --> 00:25:21,382
Lawyer!

410
00:25:21,503 --> 00:25:22,022
What the hell?

411
00:25:22,903 --> 00:25:23,422
Hey!

412
00:25:23,583 --> 00:25:25,102
Ok, I won't play baccarat

413
00:25:25,143 --> 00:25:26,862
Just let me play games on it then!

414
00:25:27,303 --> 00:25:28,022
Hey!

415
00:25:30,983 --> 00:25:31,822
Damn it!

416
00:25:36,383 --> 00:25:37,342
Give it a try.

417
00:25:37,383 --> 00:25:39,582
Once we clear everything up...

418
00:25:40,343 --> 00:25:41,782
Where's Boss?

419
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:44,062
Thanks.

420
00:25:49,343 --> 00:25:50,182
Rome.

421
00:25:51,063 --> 00:25:53,262
What are you doing here? Everyone is looking for you.

422
00:25:56,583 --> 00:25:57,902
Sorry I got you worried.

423
00:25:59,943 --> 00:26:03,822
Boss came to help out with the things that got destroyed

424
00:26:05,223 --> 00:26:06,782
I'm going to go check on the things

425
00:26:07,383 --> 00:26:07,982
I'll leave you to it.

426
00:26:14,103 --> 00:26:16,102
Thank you so much Boss

427
00:26:17,343 --> 00:26:18,022
No problem.

428
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:19,902
This is considered nothing

429
00:26:21,583 --> 00:26:22,982
I'll go check on the items.

430
00:26:25,743 --> 00:26:28,822
Have you gotten any rest since the incident?

431
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:30,982
No.

432
00:26:32,263 --> 00:26:34,342
I think you should go rest.

433
00:26:34,623 --> 00:26:35,622
It's safe now.

434
00:26:35,823 --> 00:26:38,502
Besides, those bastards at the checkpoint are no longer there.

435
00:26:39,303 --> 00:26:40,542
Go home Rome.

436
00:26:40,703 --> 00:26:41,102
Please?

437
00:26:43,063 --> 00:26:43,622
Mm.

438
00:26:44,023 --> 00:26:44,542
Fine.

439
00:26:45,023 --> 00:26:46,862
But let me go visit Tian at the hospital first

440
00:26:47,343 --> 00:26:50,422
Tian went back to Bangkok already with Ka molt at.

441
00:26:52,223 --> 00:26:52,902
What did'you say?

442
00:26:56,423 --> 00:26:57,622
I need to get Tian back.

443
00:26:58,423 --> 00:27:00,622
Ka molt at isn't really sick He is lying to Tian.

444
00:27:00,743 --> 00:27:01,862
Calm down.

445
00:27:02,663 --> 00:27:03,142
Pa.

446
00:27:03,223 --> 00:27:03,822
Listen to me.

447
00:27:04,503 --> 00:27:08,262
Go ask Pao to prove that Ka molt at isn't really sick.

448
00:27:11,103 --> 00:27:12,062
Okay,

449
00:27:12,383 --> 00:27:14,142
We should head back to Bangkok.

450
00:27:14,223 --> 00:27:15,302
We'll talk about this later.

451
00:27:23,823 --> 00:27:25,422
What if Rome was telling the truth?

452
00:27:26,103 --> 00:27:28,542
What if Ka molt at was pretending to be sick to lie to Tian?

453
00:27:30,703 --> 00:27:32,462
Even if he is pretending.

454
00:27:32,983 --> 00:27:35,782
it doesn't erase the fact that those two are father and daughter

455
00:27:36,623 --> 00:27:39,022
Stop talking about the Taks as ut

456
00:27:40,343 --> 00:27:40,902
Pa

457
00:27:41,783 --> 00:27:42,622
Go to bed.

458
00:27:43,183 --> 00:27:44,662
I'm heading back to Ranong in the morning tomorrow.

459
00:27:49,223 --> 00:27:50,262
Pao is right.

460
00:27:51,143 --> 00:27:54,142
We can't change the fact that those two are related.

461
00:27:55,063 --> 00:27:57,222
But if what Rome said is true,

462
00:27:57,783 --> 00:27:58,662
at least

463
00:27:59,263 --> 00:28:03,702
we would help Tian open her eyes and see her father's true color

464
00:28:04,943 --> 00:28:06,142
Please Dr.Pao.

465
00:28:06,663 --> 00:28:08,102
Please help Tian just once.

466
00:28:08,343 --> 00:28:11,062
Don't let Tian live with those bad people.

467
00:28:11,103 --> 00:28:12,982
I'm begging you!

468
00:28:13,303 --> 00:28:14,262
Please Doctor.

469
00:28:14,303 --> 00:28:15,262
No.

470
00:28:15,423 --> 00:28:16,182
Get up.

471
00:28:28,743 --> 00:28:30,502
No one is'willing to help us.

472
00:28:31,903 --> 00:28:34,942
At least you found out that Ka molt at is getting treated here.

473
00:28:35,543 --> 00:28:37,222
You can't give up.

474
00:28:37,823 --> 00:28:39,582
Don't pressure Pao.

475
00:28:40,183 --> 00:28:41,022
Pao...

476
00:28:41,743 --> 00:28:43,342
has done enough for Rome already.

477
00:28:43,743 --> 00:28:45,782
I'll go to the pharmacy.

478
00:28:46,303 --> 00:28:47,382
I'll ask around

479
00:28:47,943 --> 00:28:49,102
and see who is willing to help us.

480
00:28:53,823 --> 00:28:54,262
Oh.

481
00:28:54,743 --> 00:28:55,262
Ms. Thip.

482
00:28:57,663 --> 00:28:58,502
Mr, Pao.

483
00:28:59,423 --> 00:29:00,542
Long time no see.

484
00:29:00,983 --> 00:29:03,382
Are you okay? What's wrong?

485
00:29:03,663 --> 00:29:05,222
Mr. Kamoltat Taksasut,

486
00:29:05,343 --> 00:29:07,062
please pick up your medicine at window 7

487
00:29:10,383 --> 00:29:11,382
Excuse me.

488
00:29:20,103 --> 00:29:21,782
Ms. Thip came to pick up medicine for Ka molt at?

489
00:29:23,063 --> 00:29:23,862
Or...

490
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:25,822
She's probably working for him.

491
00:29:26,623 --> 00:29:28,222
Go try and ask the officials

492
00:29:28,583 --> 00:29:29,662
what medicine they prescribed

493
00:29:30,423 --> 00:29:31,982
Who can do that?

494
00:29:32,863 --> 00:29:33,502
It's illegal.

495
00:29:35,263 --> 00:29:37,542
But that medicine will let us know what's wrong with Ka molt at,

496
00:29:37,743 --> 00:29:39,142
and who's the doctor.

497
00:29:49,383 --> 00:29:51,462
Who was the guy named Pao earlier?

498
00:29:55,863 --> 00:29:57,022
An old acquaintance.,

499
00:29:57,543 --> 00:29:58,502
Go get the car.

500
00:30:02,183 --> 00:30:02,902
The medicine!

501
00:30:03,303 --> 00:30:03,942
Hurry!

502
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:07,902
Jane is insane.

503
00:30:08,183 --> 00:30:09,222
She's not picking up my calls.

504
00:30:09,703 --> 00:30:10,982
Where is she?

505
00:30:15,263 --> 00:30:16,982
What is your problem?!

506
00:30:23,903 --> 00:30:24,582
Jane.

507
00:30:25,583 --> 00:30:27,022
What the hell are you doing?

508
00:30:34,823 --> 00:30:38,102
We let the accountant checked. Ten million is missing.

509
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:39,502
That's not all

510
00:30:39,863 --> 00:30:42,742
Mr. Kula chart also stole the company'scar

511
00:30:43,103 --> 00:30:44,222
to transport drugs.

512
00:30:44,663 --> 00:30:46,342
I had to use connection to keep this quiet.

513
00:30:46,703 --> 00:30:50,342
Otherwise, our company would be trending right now and going viral

514
00:30:51,103 --> 00:30:52,382
You need to handle this Mr. Ka molt at.

515
00:30:53,103 --> 00:30:54,182
If you let this be,t

516
00:30:54,703 --> 00:30:55,502
everything you built will crumble

517
00:30:57,423 --> 00:30:58,582
I'm begging you sir.

518
00:30:59,143 --> 00:31:00,822
Please don't let your son manage this company anymore.

519
00:31:01,663 --> 00:31:03,542
Please reconsider sir.

520
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:06,542
Alright.

521
00:31:07,183 --> 00:31:09,822
I know Kula chart is embezzling money.

522
00:31:09,983 --> 00:31:11,502
It's ruining our reputation.

523
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:14,742
But don't worry, I'm going to'reset the whole system.

524
00:31:15,783 --> 00:31:17,502
I'll find someone to take his place.

525
00:31:19,423 --> 00:31:20,462
But tonight,

526
00:31:21,263 --> 00:31:24,262
you must all invite reporters from every agency.

527
00:31:24,943 --> 00:31:26,342
I will be holding a big press conference

528
00:31:27,063 --> 00:31:30,062
Who will be replacing Mr, Kula chart?

529
00:31:31,863 --> 00:31:33,302
We're executives.

530
00:31:33,703 --> 00:31:36,342
We should at least know beforehand

531
00:31:36,863 --> 00:31:39,262
who you will promote to take Kula chart's place.

532
00:31:40,303 --> 00:31:41,502
You guys don't'need to know!

533
00:31:41,543 --> 00:31:43,222
Just do as I say!

534
00:31:46,543 --> 00:31:46,982
Hey!

535
00:31:47,703 --> 00:31:49,022
I can't stay here anymore

536
00:31:49,543 --> 00:31:51,142
Yea h! I'm running

537
00:31:51,543 --> 00:31:53,302
The customer didn't get the drugs

538
00:31:53,543 --> 00:31:54,982
I can't get a hold of Chart either!

539
00:31:55,263 --> 00:31:57,262
They're gonna kill me for this!

540
00:31:59,223 --> 00:32:01,902
Damn! I'm not leaving with my mistress!

541
00:32:02,143 --> 00:32:02,822
Listen -

542
00:32:08,423 --> 00:32:09,502
I'm so bored.

543
00:32:09,743 --> 00:32:10,902
Dad took away my phone.

544
00:32:12,703 --> 00:32:13,862
Now where are you taking me?

545
00:32:14,423 --> 00:32:15,662
It can't be more ghetto than this

546
00:32:20,343 --> 00:32:20,942
Mr. Poh!

547
00:32:23,863 --> 00:32:24,822
Why did you capture him?

548
00:32:25,103 --> 00:32:26,062
Where are you taking him?!

549
00:32:26,303 --> 00:32:27,582
The same place I'm taking you

550
00:32:38,063 --> 00:32:39,222
I got him sir.

551
00:32:42,343 --> 00:32:43,662
Take care of it properly.

552
00:32:48,983 --> 00:32:50,342
I didn't know either

553
00:32:50,903 --> 00:32:53,902
that Kula chart would cause this much of a problem

554
00:32:55,303 --> 00:32:56,622
Embezzled money,

555
00:32:57,823 --> 00:32:59,022
selling drugs.

556
00:33:00,183 --> 00:33:00,982
Right now

557
00:33:01,623 --> 00:33:04,062
I don't even know where he is, I can't find him.

558
00:33:05,063 --> 00:33:07,302
The company is doing bad without your father.

559
00:33:08,703 --> 00:33:09,822
It's going to get worse.

560
00:33:13,143 --> 00:33:15,462
But doesn't the company have other executive members?

561
00:33:16,183 --> 00:33:17,342
Yes.

562
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:21,782
But in terms of policy,your father is the one who is managing everything.

563
00:33:24,823 --> 00:33:25,462
Tian.

564
00:33:26,543 --> 00:33:27,182
If you...

565
00:33:28,143 --> 00:33:30,902
don't step in as a consultant to ease the burden,

566
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:34,182
it will be bad for the company.

567
00:33:37,143 --> 00:33:38,222
The doctor

568
00:33:38,703 --> 00:33:40,542
doesn't want your father working too much.

569
00:33:41,823 --> 00:33:43,742
He's afraid your father might relapse.

570
00:33:48,783 --> 00:33:49,422
Tian.

571
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:50,782
If you...

572
00:33:52,143 --> 00:33:55,182
won't certify that you're the Taks asu t heir,

573
00:33:56,623 --> 00:33:58,782
the company might go bankrupt.

574
00:34:00,423 --> 00:34:03,302
Hundreds of people will be without jobs.

575
00:34:05,903 --> 00:34:07,302
Consider it a favor for me.

576
00:34:07,343 --> 00:34:09,582
Do it for your mom and dad.

577
00:34:23,663 --> 00:34:24,702
Yes Mr s. P itplern?

578
00:34:25,663 --> 00:34:26,982
Did you find Kula chart yet?

579
00:34:27,823 --> 00:34:28,702
Not yet.

580
00:34:29,383 --> 00:34:31,382
He probably escaped to the border.

581
00:34:33,503 --> 00:34:34,262
Mom!

582
00:34:34,343 --> 00:34:35,662
Mom, I'm right here!

583
00:34:35,703 --> 00:34:36,622
Mom!

584
00:34:37,063 --> 00:34:38,822
That's Kula chart'svoice

585
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:42,182
You might have misheard. I didn't hear anything.

586
00:34:42,343 --> 00:34:43,782
I have to go.

587
00:34:48,743 --> 00:34:50,742
How come the word "big'

588
00:34:50,823 --> 00:34:52,462
has so many synonyms?

589
00:34:52,663 --> 00:34:53,542
Crazy.

590
00:34:53,583 --> 00:34:54,582
It's not a lot.

591
00:34:54,943 --> 00:34:55,702
There's big,

592
00:34:55,943 --> 00:34:58,782
vast, large, huge, gigantic, massive, colossal.

593
00:34:58,903 --> 00:35:00,342
That's all.

594
00:35:00,623 --> 00:35:01,702
Freaking too much!

595
00:35:02,503 --> 00:35:06,102
So how come there's only one word for love?

596
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:08,342
Because the word love

597
00:35:08,503 --> 00:35:10,022
is used for only one person.

598
00:35:10,223 --> 00:35:11,502
You don't need many words for it.

599
00:35:12,863 --> 00:35:14,342
Confessing love to each other?

600
00:35:14,903 --> 00:35:15,822
No!

601
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:16,862
Teaching her the word love.

602
00:35:17,103 --> 00:35:18,102
No.

603
00:35:18,183 --> 00:35:21,182
Teaching her synonyms of the word "big "

604
00:35:21,863 --> 00:35:23,022
Did anything happen

605
00:35:23,983 --> 00:35:25,182
while l was asleep?

606
00:35:25,983 --> 00:35:28,902
Ka molt at is going to hold a big press conference at the company tonight.

607
00:35:29,863 --> 00:35:31,542
Why did you tell Rome?

608
00:35:31,903 --> 00:35:33,062
Are you crazy?

609
00:35:34,263 --> 00:35:35,782
He'll find out anyway!

610
00:35:36,143 --> 00:35:37,702
It's all over the internet.

611
00:35:39,583 --> 00:35:41,102
What about what I told you to investigate?

612
00:35:43,023 --> 00:35:44,062
You understood correctly

613
00:35:45,663 --> 00:35:46,502
Ka molt at

614
00:35:46,863 --> 00:35:48,262
doesn't have a brain tumor.

615
00:35:50,583 --> 00:35:51,262
How do you know?

616
00:35:51,903 --> 00:35:53,942
Jane stole Ka mol tat's medicines

617
00:36:01,183 --> 00:36:01,662
Hello.

618
00:36:03,463 --> 00:36:04,622
Is this Rome?

619
00:36:05,623 --> 00:36:06,342
Pit p lern?

620
00:36:08,463 --> 00:36:08,942
What's up?

621
00:36:19,823 --> 00:36:20,382
Okay.

622
00:36:23,583 --> 00:36:24,062
Rome.

623
00:36:25,463 --> 00:36:26,862
What did Pit p lern say?

624
00:36:27,503 --> 00:36:29,622
She called to tell me Tian is doing okay.

625
00:36:31,263 --> 00:36:31,902
Wait.

626
00:36:32,943 --> 00:36:33,702
Where are you going

627
00:36:34,983 --> 00:36:36,102
Going to see Tian?

628
00:36:36,343 --> 00:36:37,502
I'm coming too.

629
00:36:38,663 --> 00:36:39,342
No.

630
00:36:39,583 --> 00:36:40,422
I'm going to the police station.

631
00:36:41,183 --> 00:36:42,222
Clear the case

632
00:36:46,143 --> 00:36:47,422
Don't cause any more problems.

633
00:36:52,463 --> 00:36:54,182
Just get the evidence ready

634
00:36:55,063 --> 00:36:56,382
At tonight's press conference,

635
00:36:56,903 --> 00:36:59,302
we will go unveil Ka mol tat's mask

636
00:37:00,423 --> 00:37:02,182
and end this crazy story

637
00:37:10,503 --> 00:37:11,902
Why are you doing this to me?

638
00:37:12,583 --> 00:37:13,702
If you want money,

639
00:37:13,903 --> 00:37:14,862
give me the phone.

640
00:37:15,383 --> 00:37:16,582
I'll call and ask Dad

641
00:37:17,983 --> 00:37:18,862
How much do you want?

642
00:37:19,423 --> 00:37:20,942
10 million?20?

643
00:37:23,503 --> 00:37:24,302
You.

644
00:37:25,063 --> 00:37:26,662
are stupid til the very end.

645
00:37:27,783 --> 00:37:29,582
The person that told me to bury you here

646
00:37:30,343 --> 00:37:31,542
is your father.

647
00:37:34,303 --> 00:37:34,862
That's not true.

648
00:37:35,583 --> 00:37:36,502
I'm his son.

649
00:37:37,103 --> 00:37:38,582
Dad let me take over the company.

650
00:37:39,903 --> 00:37:41,222
So why would he do this?!

651
00:37:41,903 --> 00:37:42,742
Ka molt at

652
00:37:43,663 --> 00:37:44,742
isn't your father!

653
00:37:45,063 --> 00:37:46,942
You are a servant's son that he adopted.

654
00:37:48,223 --> 00:37:48,982
Tian on the other hand

655
00:37:49,543 --> 00:37:50,502
is his real daughter.

656
00:37:52,543 --> 00:37:53,062
You...

657
00:37:53,503 --> 00:37:55,222
are just a child that was used by him.

658
00:37:56,103 --> 00:37:59,662
So your father can receive the inheritance in the will.

659
00:38:00,423 --> 00:38:01,182
Idiot.

660
00:38:04,103 --> 00:38:04,662
That's not true.

661
00:38:11,263 --> 00:38:12,142
Kula chart!

662
00:38:17,263 --> 00:38:17,982
Damn it!

663
00:38:19,143 --> 00:38:19,862
Kill him!

664
00:38:23,663 --> 00:38:24,862
Don't!

665
00:38:29,463 --> 00:38:30,422
I survived!

666
00:38:31,503 --> 00:38:33,502
Someone came to save us

667
00:38:33,703 --> 00:38:35,462
Your father's minions for sure!

668
00:38:38,743 --> 00:38:40,622
Dad sent you guys to come save me?

669
00:38:41,103 --> 00:38:42,302
Mr, Ka molt at sent a message to you.

670
00:38:42,703 --> 00:38:44,782
The duty of a servant dog is to die for its master.

671
00:38:45,463 --> 00:38:46,342
As for you Kula chart,

672
00:38:46,423 --> 00:38:47,262
don't be sad.

673
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:49,982
Your real parents are waiting for you in hell!

674
00:38:53,303 --> 00:38:54,502
You and I

675
00:38:55,263 --> 00:38:56,902
are both useless now, Kula chart.

676
00:38:57,743 --> 00:38:58,542
Why is it like this?

677
00:39:01,023 --> 00:39:03,142
am very happy

678
00:39:03,503 --> 00:39:05,142
to hold today'spress conference

679
00:39:05,743 --> 00:39:08,982
Is it about Mr Kula chart being arrested for drug possession?

680
00:39:10,583 --> 00:39:11,782
That's fake news

681
00:39:12,823 --> 00:39:13,942
The truth is...

682
00:39:14,463 --> 00:39:18,022
Kula chart is no longer a Taks as ut

683
00:39:18,103 --> 00:39:19,502
Huh? Why?

684
00:39:20,183 --> 00:39:24,062
Cutting Kula chart from the family like this,you can not say l it has nothing to do with the case sir

685
00:39:25,023 --> 00:39:26,262
I'm Sila, their'lawyer.

686
00:39:26,623 --> 00:39:28,742
This is Mr. Kula chart's DNA result

687
00:39:28,823 --> 00:39:29,862
and Mr. Ka molt at

688
00:39:29,903 --> 00:39:32,462
It was found that Mr. Kula chart isn't the real son.

689
00:39:33,023 --> 00:39:35,542
There's been a swap of his child from a long time ago.

690
00:39:36,023 --> 00:39:39,062
He has now found his real child!

691
00:39:39,743 --> 00:39:41,342
Who is it?

692
00:39:41,623 --> 00:39:43,462
Who is the heir?

693
00:39:43,463 --> 00:39:44,902
Can you tell us?

694
00:39:45,463 --> 00:39:47,182
Isn't that Ms. Tian, Mr. Rome's relative?

695
00:39:47,223 --> 00:39:48,142
How is this possible?

696
00:39:49,503 --> 00:39:51,542
Don't tell meshe's the real heir?
I know, right?

697
00:40:02,583 --> 00:40:03,142
I'm...

698
00:40:03,703 --> 00:40:05,062
Doktian Taksasut.

699
00:40:07,263 --> 00:40:08,902
I'm Mr. Kamoltat's daughter

700
00:40:09,223 --> 00:40:10,382
with Mr s. P itplern

701
00:40:13,143 --> 00:40:15,462
But even though I'm the real heir,

702
00:40:16,863 --> 00:40:19,262
I am not taking any of the Taks as ut's inheritance.

703
00:40:20,143 --> 00:40:21,662
I will also not accept --

704
00:40:27,343 --> 00:40:29,502
Tian will come to work in the administration department

705
00:40:29,823 --> 00:40:31,062
I will be working behind the scenes.

706
00:40:31,863 --> 00:40:33,582
As for the child certification document

707
00:40:34,103 --> 00:40:35,462
I will pass it out to everyone

708
00:40:35,943 --> 00:40:37,582
after the press conference.

709
00:40:39,543 --> 00:40:40,502
Any other questions?

710
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:42,382
What about Mr. Kula chart?

711
00:40:42,623 --> 00:40:44,142
Where is he?

712
00:40:44,183 --> 00:40:45,502
What about Mr, Rome, Ms. Tian?

713
00:40:45,663 --> 00:40:46,382
Where is he?

714
00:40:46,423 --> 00:40:47,782
Yeah, where did he go?

715
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:49,342
Yes, where is he?

716
00:40:49,383 --> 00:40:50,942
Another-question please

717
00:40:53,543 --> 00:40:54,422
If there are no more,

718
00:40:54,943 --> 00:40:57,462
I'll end the press conference.

719
00:40:57,623 --> 00:40:58,582
Wait please!

720
00:40:58,583 --> 00:41:00,302
Please answer our questions.

721
00:41:00,543 --> 00:41:01,422
Yes, please!

722
00:41:01,903 --> 00:41:03,142
Where are they?

723
00:41:03,183 --> 00:41:04,222
I have a question

724
00:41:06,343 --> 00:41:07,462
Mr. Kula chart.

725
00:41:19,103 --> 00:41:20,822
There's only Ms, Tian

726
00:41:21,143 --> 00:41:22,782
that graduated high school.

727
00:41:24,503 --> 00:41:25,702
You ordered me

728
00:41:26,343 --> 00:41:27,382
to kill Kula chart

729
00:41:27,823 --> 00:41:30,382
even though he got his evil nature from you.

730
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:33,942
You're just like them!

731
00:41:34,343 --> 00:41:35,782
You tricked me into loving you!

732
00:41:36,823 --> 00:41:37,742
Even now,

733
00:41:38,223 --> 00:41:39,702
you're still lying to me!

734
00:41:43,463 --> 00:41:45,222
Let's die together Tian.
