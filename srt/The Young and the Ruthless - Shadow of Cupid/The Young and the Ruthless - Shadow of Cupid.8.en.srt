P and love that seems sincere

00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,719
PI trust you with everything

4
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:35,359
S But today your embrace feels empty

5
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,799
P The word love that doesn't seem sincere

6
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,399
P The closer you get,the further you are away

7
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,679

P Love me i like you did yesterday

14
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,159
Go stop them Mr Lak.

15
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,839
Give lit to Pao so he can run a DNA test

16
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,719
If they're father and daughter,

17
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,239
will you tell Tian?

18
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,079
We will discuss after the results are in.

19
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,159
The woman that came with your patient dropped this.

20
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,279
This is...

21
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,159
Kula chart Taks as ut,

22
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,359
Ka mol tat's son.

23
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,799
He got his evil blood from his father

24
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,679
I'm starting to wonder

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,279
it was probably him that ordered the hit on me.

26
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,439
Hello.

27
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,239
Is this the number of the handsome Kula chart?

28
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,359
I'm gonna be dead!

29
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,199
Good job Chart! You were so cool!

30
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,799
Please don't do anything to me!

31
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,999
I'm begging you!

32
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:34,959
Hey.

33
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,479
Don't be scared

34
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,319
I will give you a raise.

35
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,079
Just lie down and you'll enjoy it.

36
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,479
Let go!

37
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,079
Madam.

38
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,919
I just got done showering

39
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,679
Ae gets scared easily.

40
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,199
She thought she saw a ghost when she saw me

41
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,039
Kula chart

42
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,439
disappeared from the temple

43
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,119
He took the car too.

44
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,359
How did he go missing?!

45
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,799
What if he relapses and hits someone with the car?

46
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,239
We're gonna be screwed!

47
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,799
You...

48
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,119
were busy meditating that our son went missing

49
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:31,679
Hey.

50
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,679
You seem crazier than our son.

51
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,199
I took him to practice dharma

52
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,039
for psychotherapy.

53
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,799
It's better than letting him witness sinister things here.

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,319
Are you badmouthing me?!

55
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,079
What is it Napa?

56
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,599
What?

57
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,959
At the hospital?

58
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,079
What happened to Chart?

59
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,119
They're here.

60
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,039
Can we interview you?

61
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,559
When did Mr Kula chart come back to Thailand?

62
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,999
How is he doing?

63
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:11,919
I don't know

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,839
I just got here

65
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,959
Who took him to the amusement park?

66
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,639
3 Well?
-Who took him?

67
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,039
Please stop asking.

68
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,319
II just found out myself.

69
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,199
Excuse me.

70
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,279
Please let Mr K a molt at go visit Kula chart first.

71
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,239
We will arrange for an interview later

72
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,399
I'm really sorry

73
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,319
When will the interview be?

74
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,039
Kula chart.

75
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,399
How are you?

76
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,959
Are you hurt?

77
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:37,759
I'm...

78
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,079
I'm not dead yet, right?

79
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,159
Kula chart.

80
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,679
Tell me

81
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,919
how did you end up at the amusement park?

82
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,479
...

83
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,439
I don't know.

84
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,759
I just remember

85
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,319
I was sitting with you at the temple.

86
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,079
When l came about,

87
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,839
I was at the amusement park

88
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,079
There was a weird voice

89
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,879
telling me to do everything

90
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,039
I couldn't disobey.

91
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,919
everything just went dark.

92
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,199
You liar.

93
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,759
What voice would tell you to turn left and right

94
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,519
until you reached the amusement park?

95
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,799
Besides,

96
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,919
you're scared of heights.

97
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,719
Even when flying overseas, I told Napa to give you some sleeping pills

98
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:23,679
Hey.

99
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,279
Tell me

100
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,079
who did you go there with?

101
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,639
And.

102
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,079
why did you get on those rides?

103
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,239
-Dad!
6 Stop!

104
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,319
Don't.

105
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,399
Don't hit him.

106
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,799
I took him to the temple.

107
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,439
It was my fault.

108
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,519
If you want to hit someone, hit me.

109
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,079
Hit me till die.

110
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,599
No matter what,

111
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,719
I feel like I'm dead already

112
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,119
You should get out the way.

113
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,479
If you won't tell me the truth,

114
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,919
you will go to the lc U room.

115
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,519
Calm down sir.

116
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,079
It'll become an even bigger news.

117
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,559
How are you?

118
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,679
Do you feel better?

119
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,519
Bastard.

120
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,679
He's ruining my name

121
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,719
Who knows

122
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,999
I might just accidentally kill him one day.

123
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,959
It might be good iso all these problems can end.

124
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,719
You can't do that.

125
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,279
Kula chart is your only heir in Taks as ut.

126
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,359
But since this happened

127
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,759
we can't let him be under Mr s. Pitple rn's care.

128
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,439
She is spoiling him way too much

129
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,519
He was getting better

130
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,759
and now he might just get worse

131
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,119
You're right.

132
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,839
Chart has been spoiled since he was little

133
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,119
From now on,

134
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,799
you need to follow him everywhere and not lose sight of him.

135
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,559
Regarding today,

136
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,239
shut down all the news.

137
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,479
Sure.

138
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,679
For you,

139
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,399
I am willing to do everything.

140
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,999
Look at this.

141
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,999
Clip is going viral.

142
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,599
It's satisfying seeing him like this.

143
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,319
But I pity him a little

144
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,079
What crazy person is so afraid of heights?

145
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,879
You can be a cruel person.

146
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,999
I wouldn't dare pick a fight with you

147
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,799
That Kula chart.

148
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,679
Mr. Lak.

149
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,199
I forgot to turn on my phone

150
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,559
Boss has been calling

151
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,039
You think he saw the clip?

152
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,919
You need to call him back.

153
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,359
Right now.

154
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,519
Hello Tian.

155
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,519
Why-did you turn off your phone?

156
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,559
I was worried. I called you so many times.

157
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,399
I'm sorry.

158
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,039
It's just...

159
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,839
I forgot to turn it back on.

160
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,199
What did you do today?

161
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,799
Mr. La k and I.

162
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,399
I'm giving you five more minutes Tian.

163
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,799
Then get back to class

164
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,519
That's good.

165
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,399
Stay focus.

166
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,559
I'm on my way to pick up my client at Ranong's airport

167
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,399
If they agree to sign the contract

168
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,439
it'll be easy on us for a long time

169
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,879
Do you want anything?

170
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,079
I'll buy it for you.

171
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,759
Whatever you buy for me, I will like it.

172
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,439
In that case,

173
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,399
go back to learning

174
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,279
Don't be naughty.

175
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,399
See you later.

176
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,639
Okay.

177
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,519
Mr, Lak.

178
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,119
If he finds out that I lied to him,

179
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,399
he's going to be mad at me.

180
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,279
He won't.

181
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,879
If he finds out,

182
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,399
I'll tell him it was my plan.

183
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,319
Okay?

184
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,239
Je ab

185
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,079
Do you not have chores?

186
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,319
Why are you playing on your phone?

187
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,359
I finished all the chores you told me to do.

188
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,719
This is finished?

189
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,479
Did you use your hands or feet?

190
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,519
Hands.

191
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,239
Ms. Thip, can I have my phone back?

192
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,479
Ms. Thip.

193
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,519
I really did finish.

194
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,559
If you're done

195
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,679
then you can have your phone back.

196
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,959
You need to know time management.

197
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,079
Prioritize your duty first.

198
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,319
You may go.

199
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,399
If I didn't have you watching the house.

200
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,759
I wouldn't know what to do.

201
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,519
It's my job.

202
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,839
Do you have any business at the factory?

203
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,759
I have a big client to sign a contract with

204
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,599
Congratulations.

205
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,839
Are you hungry?

206
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,839
I will prepare your food for you.

207
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,319
I ate with my client already.

208
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,039
jl I just have coffee.

209
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,639
How's Kula chart doing?

210
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:47,879
Well,

211
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,119
he was afraid of heights and just passed out.

212
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,519
He has been discharged

213
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,519
It's suspicious

214
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,559
He's scared of heights but got on the rides.

215
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,359
He got on it a lot of times.

216
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:00,799
It's okay.

217
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,759
I'masocial media investigator

218
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,639
There's Kula chart

219
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,199
Tian.

220
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,159
Tian lied to me and said she was studying at home.

221
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,519
But she was actually with Kula chart

222
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:30,839
Hold on.

223
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,679
When did Tian and Kula chart know each other?

224
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,039
But this Tian kid seems popular.

225
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,759
The other day someone came looking for her.

226
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,279
You can even ask Je ab

227
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:44,999
That's right

228
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,119
Who came asking for Tian?

229
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,999
I'm not sure.

230
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,639
They came as a group.

231
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,239
Kids and adult.

232
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,639
The girl who looks like their leader

233
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,599
was dressed very sassy.

234
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,479
Gigi.

235
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,719
I think

236
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,399
want to give up on Rome

237
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,199
I have been seducing him

238
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,719
but he doesn't seem to care!

239
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,999
You're the one that left him to get married.

240
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,479
Of course he would sulk

241
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,559
But since he doesn't have a wife yet,

242
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,159
that means he still have feelings for you.

243
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,599
But the Tian kid he's taking care of

244
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,159
is suspicious to me

245
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,519
He seemed to purposely hide the origin of that kid

246
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,279
On a positive note

247
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,679
that kid

248
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:53,599
might just be a bluff or he's using her to spite you.

249
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,639
Listen to me.

250
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,119
If you want the cub,

251
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,519
you need to go inside the den.

252
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,759
You have nothing to lose Mont ira.

253
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,039
Mr.t La kl have an idea

254
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,599
On our way back we should buy soy milk and patong ko for breakfast.

255
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,399
Well?

256
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,079
Is my idea excellent?

257
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,279
Gosh,what do you mean excellent?

258
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,119
We're going to get fat.

259
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,319
We won't get fat.

260
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,079
'm shocked.
NIKE

261
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,399
Gee,

262
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,799
I have an online meeting

263
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,159
In ten minutes.

264
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,719
You see? I told you to turn off your oh one and leave it at the house like me

265
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,279
It's okay.

266
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,319
lll buy you something delicious on the way back

267
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:44,999
Okay?

268
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,199
Ill get going

269
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,319
Tian.

270
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,399
I need to talk to you

271
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:03,839
Here you go.

272
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:05,799
Thank you.

273
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,799
I'd like to speak with her in private

274
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,079
I'll call you when I'm done

275
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,439
It'll be a little uncomfortable Tian.

276
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,559
Rome is being too over protective of me right now

277
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,599
There's always a bodyguard looking after me.

278
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,239
He's always checking upon me every day.

279
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,359
Boss is a kind and cautious person

280
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:37,239
He's probably scared the man named Sam would come back to hurt you again

281
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,479
You won't be safe.

282
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,399
But Rome seems to care about you a lot

283
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,159
Let me ask you.

284
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,039
Which side of the family are you to him?

285
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,879
When I dated him

286
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,159
I've never seen you before.

287
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,999
I'm not his relative.

288
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,399
I'm an orphan

289
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,959
but he was kind to take me under his care

290
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,479
So,

291
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,639
how long have you guys met and where did you meet?

292
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,399
If anyone asks about us,

293
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,799
just tell them what l told you

294
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:12,959
Okay.

295
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,999
My parents were close friends with Boss.

296
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,679
But my parents were in a car accident and died

297
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,639
So Boss took me in

298
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,199
After I finished high school, he sent me to study abroad.

299
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,719
I was there for over a year

300
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,759
and came back to Thailand after I finished my course

301
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,039
Are my questions making you uncomfortable?

302
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,399
No.

303
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:45,159
But if you want to know about me,
you can ask Boss yourself

304
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,679
I'm afraid if I tell you the wrong thing.
Boss will get upset.

305
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,319
If you'll excuse me now.

306
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,119
Tian!

307
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,999
Oh!

308
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,759
I'm sorry.

309
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,279
It's okay.

310
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,799
Come pick me up.

311
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,359
Walk.

312
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:15,919
050945-3480

313
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,439
Mon.

314
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,879
You troublemaker!

315
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,319
Help!

316
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,239
Sam.

317
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,679
Help!

318
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,599
Hey.

319
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,559
Why isn't the girl here yet?

320
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,399
I've been waiting for 30 minutes

321
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,399
I'll tell your boss to shut this place down!

322
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,559
Why did you bring me here?

323
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,919
If you don't want to die,

324
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,999
call Rome to come here.

325
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,079
I want to get revenge on him for stealing my wife.

326
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,639
Women aren't objects where you men can steal back and forth.

327
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,479
You mistreated Mon first.

328
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,719
Who wants to live with you?

329
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,559
I do treat her well!

330
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,679
Whatever she wanted

331
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,919
I went and got it for her!

332
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,119
In exchange for abuse?

333
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,719
She's your wife, not an animal

334
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,479
People like you

335
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,479
don't deserve love from any woman.

336
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,719
If you don't call,

337
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,639
you die.

338
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,719
I can't remember Mr. Rome's number.

339
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,039
I'll have to use my phone.

340
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,479
Tian followed him on her own

341
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,559
I was in shock and didn't know what to do.

342
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,559
Take me to go find Tian right now.

343
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,039
I searched everywhere.

344
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,159
I couldn't find her.

345
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,879
I called the police already

346
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,639
Called the police for what?

347
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:00,839
It's Sam.

348
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,479
He took Tian.

349
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,159
No tricks.

350
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,679
You think I wouldn't dare kill you?

351
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,799
Mr. Rome turned off his phone

352
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,999
Maybe he's sleeping or..

353
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,799
on the airplane.

354
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,079
If you don't believe me, call him yourself.

355
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:31,599
6n558

356
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,799
134913 What are you doing?!

357
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,159
Hey

358
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:53,999
Get in the car!

359
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,119
You hurt me so many times

360
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,319
Go to hell!

361
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,799
Let me go!

362
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:02,999
Stop!

363
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,079
Let go!

364
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,639
Who was that American guy?

365
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,279
He kidnapped me

366
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,559
But you'rebleeding a lot

367
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,879
Let's go to the hospital

368
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:19,679
It's okay.

369
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,119
It's just a grazed

370
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,879
He was talking with vengeance.

371
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,519
You know him?

372
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,799
It's Boss's personal business.

373
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,799
I don't need to tell you.

374
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,559
Yes Boss?

375
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,239
Tian.

376
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,559
Are you okay?

377
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,679
Don't worry.

378
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,119
Ii mon my way home

379
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,519
Where are you?

380
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:53,599
Tian?

381
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,239
Tian? Hello?

382
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:55,799
Hello?

383
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,479
It's true I have issues with Rome.

384
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,999
But not with you. It's different.

385
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,079
Whoever has problems with Boss,

386
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,279
has problems with me

387
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,759
Thank you so much for saving me

388
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,599
You can stop up ahead, lim getting off.

389
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,719
It's okay. I'll drop'you off.

390
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:15,839
No need.

391
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,759
I don't want problems with Boss.

392
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,599
THN 6939

393
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,599
Oh my god Tian!

394
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,879
What happened?

395
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,359
I'm okay.

396
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,759
It's not my blood.

397
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,359
Whose blood is it?

398
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,159
67558

399
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:00,879
Ka molt at!

400
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:02,999
Why are you here?!

401
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,519
Rome

402
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,679
Why are you talking like that?

403
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,839
You should be thanking me.

404
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,599
Tian was getting attacked by.that American psychopath?

405
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,759
saved her

406
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,919
Plus I dropped her.off safe and sound

407
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,639
She's perfectly fine

408
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:19,879
You?

409
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,159
Saved Tian?

410
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,359
It's really destiny.

411
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,359
I saw Tian in danger at the right time.

412
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,159
But I came here

413
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,039
just to tell you

414
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,479
want you to take better care of your woman ;in your care.

415
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,799
I don't want you

416
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,239
to suffer a loss again like in the past.

417
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,479
Ka molt at!

418
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,519
All of this was your plan, wasn't it?

419
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,399
6558

420
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,199
6558 Calm down Rome!

421
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:45,919
6n558
Rome!

422
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,479
6558

423
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:52,999
I am cherishing a viper in my bosom

424
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,639
You should be grateful.

425
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,959
But forget it.

426
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,079
Your house is quite big

427
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,399
Business must be going well,right?

428
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:05,799
I'm happy for you

429
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,439
But yeah,

430
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,119
when you do something,

431
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,079
try using your brain more

432
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,999
Don't be impulsive and emotional like this.

433
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,479
It's not good

434
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,559
Hey Rome!

435
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,319
You should leave

436
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,839
before l you get any more wounds.

437
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,919
You're hurting me Boss!

438
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,679
Every ti me Iim not home

439
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,399
you're always causing problems!

440
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,679
Answer me right now.

441
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,959
How'did you meet with Ka molt at?

442
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:54,919
He killed his own brother,

443
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,439
raped his brother'sgiri friend

444
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,559
Why are you in contact,with a scumbag like him?!

445
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,199
Well.

446
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,719
he coincidentally saw me when Sam was attacking me.

447
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,599
It was just a coincidence.

448
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,199
The amusementpark with Kula chart

449
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,719
was also a coincidence?

450
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,279
You lied to me.

451
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,239
You belittled the goodwill and concern I have for you

452
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:20,719
I'm sad

453
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,519
and disappointed jin you

454
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,759
Boss.

455
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,839
I don't think like that.

456
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,839
With Kula chart, I just wanted to get revenge for you

457
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,079
Both with Ka molt at and Kula chart,

458
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:39,839
I swear to you I am not lying to you.

459
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,839
If I'm not telling the truth

460
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,239
I shall die in the next three to seven days.

461
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:01,799
About revenge,

462
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,399
I et that be my job.

463
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,719
From now on you must promise me,

464
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,959
you won't get involved with...

465
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,919
Ka molt at and Kula chart again.

466
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:17,839
Ka molt at

467
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,039
might be following you to get revenge on me.

468
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,279
I don't want you to be in danger.

469
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,279
You have no right to die.

470
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,479
Your life

471
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,359
is mine.

472
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,319
Yes.

473
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,639
I promise you

474
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,799
from now on

475
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,399
my life will be yours

476
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,519
Stop crying Mont ira.

477
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,119
Luckily Tian is safe.

478
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,039
She didn't get screwed over with your mess.

479
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,519
I know I'm bad luck.

480
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,359
But I want to thank Tian

481
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,519
for saving me from Sam

482
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,959
I never thought he would come back to cause more trouble

483
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,559
That's strange.

484
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,879
Ever since you got married to Sam,

485
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,239
Rome's life has gradually gotten better.

486
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,759
But it's getting bad because you came back

487
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,599
You're right.

488
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,839
Have your bodyguard

489
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,559
take you home.

490
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,039
In case Sam returns

491
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,599
I won't come back here if you want.

492
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,159
But...

493
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,599
I want to apologize to Tian.

494
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,679
I will have my lawyer contact you

495
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,879
I had Tian rest

496
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:52,679
Mon.

497
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,959
You should give your statement to \the police

498
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,279
Sam has been arrested now.

499
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,839
I'll have the bodyguard take l you!

500
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,399
Wait Ae.

501
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,959
Whose car is this?

502
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,479
Doesn't look familiar

503
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,879
Mr, Kamol tat'ssecretary. She came to drop off Mr. Kula chart.

504
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,519
The maid said you wanted to see me.

505
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,399
Have a seat.

506
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,879
Why are you staring at me?

507
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,079
Is there something on my face?

508
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,679
I am thinking

509
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,319
on where to begin.

510
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,799
You might think I'm just a stupid housewife.

511
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,759
But I'm not stupid

512
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,599
that I don't know that you

513
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,519
are one of my husband'swomen.

514
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,359
You've been for a long time

515
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,919
And?

516
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,719
Why...

517
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,079
are you getting involved with Kula chart?

518
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,319
What do you want?

519
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,119
Since you asked me straightforward,

520
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,599
I would have to answer truthfully

521
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,759
I love Kula chart.

522
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,119
Kula chart also loves me

523
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,719
The two of us

524
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:09,919
are in love.

525
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,039
And...

526
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,279
what about my husband?

527
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,479
Regarding Mr K a molt at

528
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,599
it was out of necessity

529
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,639
I had to endure my pain and suffering.

530
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,399
I had to give into him.

531
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,079
If I don't,

532
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,799
I would be jobless

533
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,199
I couldn't choose.

534
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,159
It was necessary.

535
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,079
I don't understand

536
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,439
Where has your fear

537
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:51,199
and shame of sin gone?

538
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,439
Why are you sleeping around like this?

539
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,239
It's not like that.

540
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,959
I'm not sleeping with Mr. Ka molt at any more.

541
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,039
I only love Kula chart.

542
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,279
Besides,

543
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,399
Mr, Ka molt at doesn't know about this.

544
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,199
The best option

545
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,079
is to stop getting involved with Kula chart

546
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,319
before Ka molt at finds out.

547
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,279
can't.

548
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,199
You already know

549
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,679
your relationship with Kula chart

550
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,919
can't happen.

551
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,039
Kula chart is still a kid

552
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,999
You're young

553
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,479
and beautiful!

554
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,719
You have a good job.

555
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,839
You have your own path.

556
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,719
If it's about this

557
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,199
I would have to go back and think about it.

558
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,639
Excuse me.

559
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,399
How's it going?

560
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,799
I heard you went to meditate since morning.

561
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,359
What level have you achieved?

562
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,919
What's wrong?

563
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,359
What happened to you?

564
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,119
A small accident.

565
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,039
Sit down first.

566
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,399
I need to talk to you.

567
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,159
Do you think

568
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,439
if Chart gets a good woman as his wife,

569
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,239
will he become a better person?

570
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,719
I don't know.

571
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,679
But if they are in love.

572
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,559
they would have a future together.

573
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,999
If they have a child together..

574
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,959
Oh. You don't need to imagine that far.

575
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,279
I met ayoung girl.

576
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,959
She has a sweet personality

577
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,679
If you meet her, you would like her too.

578
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,679
It would be nice if she becomes our daughter

579
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,999
But when it comes to this

580
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,239
we shouldn't force our son.

581
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,359
You should let him choose

582
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,119
I was just saying.

583
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:05,079
It's a pity that this girl is under the care of my business rival.

584
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,279
I won't let them be in love anyway.

585
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,999
May be...

586
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,839
Kula chart has someone he likes already.

587
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,999
I will not let him choose his own wife.

588
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,119
Retarded like him,

589
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,039
it'll definitely be a gold digger

590
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,519
Hello.

591
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,679
Jane.

592
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,159
Tian!

593
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,799
Is that you Tian?!

594
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:10,759
Tian.

595
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:14,199
Where have you been? Why didn't you call me?

596
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,719
How are you beach gang?

597
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,919
I'm fine.

598
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,759
I'm Mua.

599
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,159
I'm Toni!

600
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,719
How are you guys? I miss everyone.

601
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,679
We miss you so much.

602
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,759
We thought you were imprisoned.

603
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,719
No.

604
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,319
Boss has been taking good care of me. Don't worry.

605
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,159
Why did he take you to go live in Bangkok?

606
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:42,479
When l went to Boss Rome's house

607
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,519
they chased us out like some animals.

608
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,799
You came to see me?

609
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,039
Why didn't anyone tell me?

610
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,519
Tian, are you asleep yet?

611
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,639
Tian?

612
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,959
Sounded like someone came in so she hung up.

613
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:35,839
I think

614
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,839
it's a little strange.

615
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,079
Or...

616
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,279
Tian is being imprisoned by that boss guy.

617
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,239
I'm so angry. My whole family is embarrassed.

618
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,639
I must get revenge on her no matter what

619
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,319
Just name the price.

620
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,879
What's her name?

621
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:56,999
Can.

622
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,439
Candle.

623
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,559
Her name is Candle.

624
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,879
I'm not a cyber cop either.

625
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:09,439
Just check and see who is satisfied and is laughing at you.

626
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,879
See if any of them is using the name Candle

627
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,799
But this job will be over 10 thousand!

628
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,039
Try hacking their profile picture.

629
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,959
Freaking Chart.funny as hell

630
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,399
al hua

631
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,719
Who is it?

632
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,919
Jackpot slot machine! Found her!

633
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,199
Hello Ms. Mont ira.

634
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,519
What business do you have?

635
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,319
I came to see Rome

636
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,359
Is there a problem?

637
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,199
Just making sure

638
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,199
no one is following you again.

639
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,039
So the people in this house won't get hurt like last time.

640
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,079
If you're referring to my ex husband,

641
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,799
he's locked up right now.

642
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,759
He can't hurt anybody anymore.

643
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,679
I'm sorry for being rude.

644
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,719
But taking care of Mr Rome is my job

645
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,639
Please don't mind me.

646
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,879
If I remember correctly,

647
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,919
your name is Thip right?

648
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,919
Mr. Rome has let me supervise the orderliness of this house for ten years now.

649
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,639
Oh, is that so?

650
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,559
Jeez!

651
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,239
It's strange though

652
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,279
Rome has never mentioned you to me before

653
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,959
even though I am his only ex giri friend

654
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,599
But regardless,

655
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,559
please take care of me as well.

656
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,199
Because from now on,

657
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,359
I will be coming here often.

658
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,439
Mon.

659
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,399
Rome.

660
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,159
What's the matter?

661
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,239
I was just about to step out.

662
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,279
I have an appointment.

663
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,599
Well,

664
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,039
I want to ask you to find a lawyer for me.

665
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:11,119
I want to settle my divorce with Sam and l don't know anyone.

666
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,799
Sure, l'll find one for you

667
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,559
Can I catch a ride with you?

668
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,239
You can drop me off anywhere.

669
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,519
Hello!

670
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,679
You're here early. It's not time for class yet.

671
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,639
Sit and wait for your friends first

672
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,359
Go hide!

673
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,119
Who are you?!

674
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,079
You don't have to help me.

675
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,719
It's not much

676
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,919
I'm having Tian make lunch as punishment

677
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,959
f you're helping her like this

678
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,919
how can we call it punishment?

679
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,199
I came up with the plan.

680
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,839
If you want to punish Tian,

681
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,039
punish me too.

682
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,959
