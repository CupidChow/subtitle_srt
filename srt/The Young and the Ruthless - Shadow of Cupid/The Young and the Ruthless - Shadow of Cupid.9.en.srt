are in love.

19
00:01:44,623 --> 00:01:46,862
It sounded like someone came in so he hung up.

20
00:01:47,063 --> 00:01:48,782
It's just strange.

21
00:01:49,023 --> 00:01:49,942
Or...

22
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:53,102
Tian is being imprisoned by that boss guy.

23
00:01:53,143 --> 00:01:55,222
I must get revenge on her no matter what.

24
00:01:56,063 --> 00:01:56,862
Just name the price.

25
00:01:56,903 --> 00:02:00,622
and l don't know anyone.

26
00:02:01,823 --> 00:02:02,222
Sure.

27
00:02:02,343 --> 00:02:03,382
I'll find one for you.

28
00:02:04,063 --> 00:02:06,102
Can I catch a ride with you?

29
00:02:06,303 --> 00:02:07,862
You can drop me off anywhere.

30
00:02:12,703 --> 00:02:15,542
There.

31
00:02:23,783 --> 00:02:24,422
Mr. Lak.

32
00:02:25,343 --> 00:02:26,902
" If you don't want him to die,

33
00:02:27,343 --> 00:02:28,742
then come alone and don't call the cops.

34
00:02:31,783 --> 00:02:33,582
If you don't know the house number,
you can't go inside.

35
00:02:34,063 --> 00:02:34,982
Do you not understand?

36
00:02:35,783 --> 00:02:37,342
You're the one that doesn't understand!

37
00:02:37,383 --> 00:02:39,062
This is an emergency.

38
00:02:39,223 --> 00:02:41,902
My boyfriend got kidnapped by some pervert and is being imprisoned!

39
00:02:41,943 --> 00:02:43,542
Can we go in?!

40
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:44,182
You can't!

41
00:02:44,983 --> 00:02:45,822
Gosh!

42
00:02:46,983 --> 00:02:48,182
Don't pull!

43
00:02:49,063 --> 00:02:49,622
Jane!

44
00:02:51,623 --> 00:02:52,062
It's me Tian.

45
00:02:53,743 --> 00:02:54,542
Tian!

46
00:02:57,463 --> 00:02:58,422
How did you get here?

47
00:02:59,703 --> 00:03:00,582
Boss's address?

48
00:03:01,823 --> 00:03:02,502
I don't know.

49
00:03:02,663 --> 00:03:03,582
Go ask someone else.

50
00:03:03,943 --> 00:03:04,902
Dong.

51
00:03:05,063 --> 00:03:06,862
You're Boss's close subordinate

52
00:03:06,983 --> 00:03:08,662
If you don't know then no one knows.

53
00:03:08,863 --> 00:03:09,902
I'm not telling you.

54
00:03:10,183 --> 00:03:12,102
You guys are going to bother him.

55
00:03:17,143 --> 00:03:18,262
We're not going to bother him

56
00:03:18,423 --> 00:03:22,222
We just want to deliver anchovy sauce to have him taste

57
00:03:22,543 --> 00:03:23,582
Am I right Jane?

58
00:03:23,623 --> 00:03:25,102
That's right.

59
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:27,022

61
00:03:29,103 --> 00:03:30,062
Please Dong

62
00:03:30,103 --> 00:03:32,542
I just want to deliver something to Boss. I won't bother him

63
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:34,302
-Please Dong-Fine.

64
00:03:35,103 --> 00:03:36,262
But under one condition

65
00:03:38,903 --> 00:03:39,462
You

66
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:41,622
have to let me

67
00:03:41,943 --> 00:03:42,902
taste tone too.

68
00:03:44,623 --> 00:03:45,382
You got it.

69
00:03:46,303 --> 00:03:47,902
Just forget about that.

70
00:03:48,703 --> 00:03:50,382
Why are you dressed like this?

71
00:03:50,943 --> 00:03:51,982
Were you forced to do it?

72
00:03:52,223 --> 00:03:53,422
Did he force you to wear this?!

73
00:03:53,503 --> 00:03:54,662
I'll tell you later.

74
00:03:54,863 --> 00:03:56,662
There's an emergency right now

75
00:03:57,783 --> 00:03:58,782
It's me M r, Kiat.

00:03:59,503 --> 00:04:02,222
It have a friend who wants to discuss divorcing her foreign husband

77
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,782
Can l have her go see you at your office?

78
00:04:05,983 --> 00:04:06,382
Oh.

79
00:04:07,743 --> 00:04:08,902
Im about to drive pass that.

80
00:04:09,823 --> 00:04:10,462
Thank you so much

81
00:04:13,463 --> 00:04:15,502
The lawyer actually

82
00:04:15,743 --> 00:04:18,182
is talking to a client in a cafe up ahead

83
00:04:18,623 --> 00:04:19,502
I'll drop you off.

84
00:04:21,183 --> 00:04:22,422
Thank you Rome

85
00:04:22,663 --> 00:04:24,622
You're always sweet

86
00:04:25,183 --> 00:04:25,902
It's fine.

87
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:27,222
We're friends

88
00:04:31,823 --> 00:04:32,822
...

89
00:04:33,303 --> 00:04:35,702
want to go back in time.

90
00:04:37,663 --> 00:04:38,342
I think

91
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,102
it's impossible.

92
00:04:40,783 --> 00:04:42,142
You should move on.

93
00:04:46,103 --> 00:04:46,942
Hello Ms. Thip

94
00:04:49,063 --> 00:04:50,102
Tian left the house?

95
00:04:50,703 --> 00:04:51,542
Since when?

96
00:04:52,183 --> 00:04:53,302
Just now.

97
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:56,062
She probably got mad I told her to practice cooking.

98
00:04:56,143 --> 00:04:59,062
So she took the opportunity to leave while l turned my back on her.

99
00:05:00,183 --> 00:05:01,302
I think this kid

100
00:05:02,383 --> 00:05:03,782
is a lost cause.

101
00:05:07,783 --> 00:05:08,622
Tian.

102
00:05:08,743 --> 00:05:09,782
You devil!

103
00:05:23,463 --> 00:05:24,342
Where's Mr, Lak?

104
00:05:25,383 --> 00:05:26,902
Gosh, Can.

105
00:05:27,223 --> 00:05:29,142
You're not going to say hi to me?

106
00:05:29,423 --> 00:05:30,582
You're some an.

107
00:05:31,023 --> 00:05:32,022
Last time,

108
00:05:32,263 --> 00:05:35,742

109
00:05:37,223 --> 00:05:38,902

110
00:05:39,623 --> 00:05:40,822
Let Mr, Lak go.

111
00:05:41,303 --> 00:05:44,102
He looked in really bad shape.
I'm taking him to a doctor.

112
00:05:44,703 --> 00:05:45,222
Sure.

113
00:05:46,143 --> 00:05:48,022
But you have to become my girlfriend first.

114
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:49,342
las sure you

115
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:51,542
I will take good care of you

116
00:05:52,663 --> 00:05:53,622
My family's rich.

117
00:05:54,463 --> 00:05:55,462
Whatever you want,

118
00:05:56,143 --> 00:05:57,342
I will give it to you.

119
00:05:59,703 --> 00:06:00,142
Okay.

120
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:01,262
Deal.

121
00:06:01,423 --> 00:06:02,622
We're a couple

122
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:04,982
Now can you tell me where Mr, Lak is at?

123
00:06:05,463 --> 00:06:06,582
The room next door.

124
00:06:10,543 --> 00:06:11,422
What are you doing?

125
00:06:11,983 --> 00:06:12,462
Well,

126
00:06:12,703 --> 00:06:13,822
we're a couple

127
00:06:14,143 --> 00:06:15,502
We're in a motel room

128
00:06:15,703 --> 00:06:17,462
What do you think?

129
00:06:19,423 --> 00:06:19,862
Chart!

130
00:06:19,983 --> 00:06:20,302
Stop!

131
00:06:20,303 --> 00:06:20,782
Don't!

132
00:06:20,823 --> 00:06:21,422
Chart!

133
00:06:21,623 --> 00:06:22,222
Stop!

134
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:26,582
Should we barge in there?

135
00:06:27,103 --> 00:06:28,302
They went quiet

136
00:06:28,703 --> 00:06:30,902
Tian said to wait ten minutes.

137
00:06:31,303 --> 00:06:32,262
If he doesn't come out,

138
00:06:32,463 --> 00:06:33,622
then we barge in there.

139
00:06:33,823 --> 00:06:35,982
Do you think any police will come?

140
00:06:36,343 --> 00:06:38,182
Of course the police will come

141
00:06:39,303 --> 00:06:39,782
Hey.

142
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:40,942
Can you be quiet?!

143
00:06:41,263 --> 00:06:42,262
Pay attention to Tian.

144
00:06:58,743 --> 00:07:01,462
That woman is holding a knife to go into Tian's room!

145
00:07:01,823 --> 00:07:02,622
Shit.

146
00:07:03,543 --> 00:07:04,822
What do we do?

147
00:07:05,543 --> 00:07:06,822
Stop Chart!

148
00:07:06,863 --> 00:07:07,822
Get away from me!

149
00:07:07,863 --> 00:07:08,982
Get away!

150
00:07:13,303 --> 00:07:14,502
Don't go!

151
00:07:14,623 --> 00:07:15,702
Please stay

152
00:07:15,863 --> 00:07:16,822
Let go!

153
00:07:22,183 --> 00:07:23,742
You're trying to steal my man?

154
00:07:24,303 --> 00:07:25,142
Die!

155
00:07:34,983 --> 00:07:35,982
e Chart!
-Be mine!

156
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:36,742
Let me go!

157
00:07:37,783 --> 00:07:38,902
-Stay with me.
-Let go!

158
00:07:42,703 --> 00:07:43,782
Tian run!

159
00:07:44,023 --> 00:07:45,102
The police are on their way!

160
00:07:45,143 --> 00:07:46,302
You can't escape now!

161
00:07:55,623 --> 00:07:56,062
Oh.

162
00:07:56,503 --> 00:07:57,222
You're done?

163
00:07:57,983 --> 00:07:58,862
Where's Chart?

164
00:07:59,943 --> 00:08:00,742
He fell asleep.

165
00:08:03,623 --> 00:08:04,062
Mr. Lak.

166
00:08:04,823 --> 00:08:05,382
Come on.

167
00:08:07,183 --> 00:08:08,022
Thanks Tian.

168
00:08:21,743 --> 00:08:22,582
Don't let them go!

169
00:08:22,623 --> 00:08:23,422
Catch them!

170
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:24,462
Damn!

171
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:25,222
Catch them!

172
00:08:25,623 --> 00:08:25,982
Hurry!

173
00:08:26,863 --> 00:08:28,502
You betrayed me?!

174
00:08:28,623 --> 00:08:30,062
You cheated on me?!

175
00:08:30,063 --> 00:08:31,022
Damn!

176
00:08:31,423 --> 00:08:32,102
You're so annoying!

177
00:08:32,823 --> 00:08:33,902
Can we argue later?

178
00:08:34,343 --> 00:08:35,582
Did you not hear them?

179
00:08:35,903 --> 00:08:37,022
The police are on their way here!

180
00:08:37,903 --> 00:08:39,182
It won't open in time!

181
00:08:39,223 --> 00:08:39,942
Let's go!

182
00:08:40,143 --> 00:08:40,742
Hurry!

183
00:08:42,303 --> 00:08:43,022
-Hey!
-Get them!

184
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:44,262
Go!

185
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:45,302
You can't escape.

186
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:57,182
Jane!

187
00:08:57,903 --> 00:08:58,622
You wanna be tough?!

188
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:11,462
Go!

189
00:09:12,463 --> 00:09:13,542
How did you get here?

190
00:09:14,783 --> 00:09:16,422
I followed the GPS on Tian's phone

191
00:09:19,823 --> 00:09:20,622
Fuck!

192
00:09:20,983 --> 00:09:21,862
The plan is all ruined!

193
00:09:22,423 --> 00:09:24,702
I was so close to making candle my wife.

194
00:09:25,743 --> 00:09:26,622
Wife?

195
00:09:27,983 --> 00:09:29,142
I'm your wife

196
00:09:29,223 --> 00:09:30,102
bastard!

197
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:32,702
I'm giving Candle that wife title.

198
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,102
She...

199
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:36,742
is the angel of my dream.

200
00:09:38,023 --> 00:09:39,262
We're the same age

201
00:09:39,943 --> 00:09:41,302
We are compatible in every way.

202
00:09:44,463 --> 00:09:45,742
Not wrinkly and old like you.

203
00:09:46,983 --> 00:09:47,982
You're going to leave me?

204
00:09:49,783 --> 00:09:51,822
Do you know how tired I am with you?

205
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:53,822
Don't be pretentious.

206
00:09:54,783 --> 00:09:55,942
You got involved with me

207
00:09:56,303 --> 00:09:58,062
because you were bored with my dad

208
00:09:59,983 --> 00:10:00,942
Young like me,

209
00:10:01,463 --> 00:10:02,382
did you really think

210
00:10:02,863 --> 00:10:04,382
I want an old hag like you as my wife?

211
00:10:04,463 --> 00:10:05,142
Huh?

212
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:05,942
Kula chart!

213
00:10:05,983 --> 00:10:07,142
You want to die?

214
00:10:08,503 --> 00:10:09,302
Die then!

215
00:10:19,103 --> 00:10:20,542
What the hell man?!

216
00:10:23,703 --> 00:10:24,422
Hey!

217
00:10:26,463 --> 00:10:27,142
Napa!

218
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,102
It's all my fault.

219
00:10:30,823 --> 00:10:31,302
It's...

220
00:10:31,543 --> 00:10:33,862
Kula chart wanted to get revenge on me.

221
00:10:34,783 --> 00:10:36,342
So he lashed out on you.

222
00:10:38,783 --> 00:10:40,662
Why did you decided to go solo?

223
00:10:44,903 --> 00:10:46,262
How many times have I told you?

224
00:10:46,703 --> 00:10:48,142
Do you not listen?

225
00:10:52,703 --> 00:10:53,822
I thought you promised

226
00:10:54,223 --> 00:10:55,142
that you would listen?

227
00:10:55,983 --> 00:10:56,822
Shepherd's boy.

228
00:10:58,543 --> 00:10:59,502
Hey!

229
00:11:00,903 --> 00:11:01,862
Why are you badmouthing Tian?

230
00:11:02,543 --> 00:11:04,182
Tian just risked his life back there.

231
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:05,902
He almost died.

232
00:11:06,383 --> 00:11:08,142
Instead of comforting him, you criticize him?!

233
00:11:08,463 --> 00:11:09,902
This is between me and Tian.

234
00:11:11,823 --> 00:11:12,902
You're not involved.

235
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,622
Tian and l are a couple!

236
00:11:15,703 --> 00:11:17,182
I'm taking him back to Ranong

237
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,942
Couple?

238
00:11:19,783 --> 00:11:21,462
You two are a couple?

239
00:11:21,823 --> 00:11:22,702
You're crazy.

240
00:11:24,623 --> 00:11:26,182
You suddenly dressed Tian up as a girl.

241
00:11:27,063 --> 00:11:29,262
Tian is much more of a man than you two!

242
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:31,822
The best on the beach.

243
00:11:32,903 --> 00:11:33,782
Right Tian?

244
00:11:35,383 --> 00:11:36,462
Tell them

245
00:11:37,143 --> 00:11:38,382
what we are.

246
00:11:46,023 --> 00:11:46,622
Jane.

247
00:11:47,103 --> 00:11:50,822
I'm sorry l made you misunderstand that I like girls

248
00:11:52,183 --> 00:11:55,382
I did it because Mom asked me to

249
00:11:55,863 --> 00:11:56,902
But the truth is

250
00:11:58,143 --> 00:12:00,182
I'magir I just like you

251
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:02,262
What?

252
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:04,702
I don't believe you!

253
00:12:07,463 --> 00:12:09,502
You're being deceived by these two men right?

254
00:12:09,983 --> 00:12:11,142
You were forced to do it right?

255
00:12:11,543 --> 00:12:12,582
No.

256
00:12:13,423 --> 00:12:13,902
Jane.

257
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,582
I'm sorry.

258
00:12:15,823 --> 00:12:16,942
Take this money

259
00:12:17,383 --> 00:12:18,422
Go home.

260
00:12:22,863 --> 00:12:23,942
I'm not a charity case!

261
00:12:27,223 --> 00:12:28,222
Remember this Tian.

262
00:12:29,183 --> 00:12:30,062
Jane.

263
00:12:30,063 --> 00:12:31,302
Jane, I'm sorry!

264
00:12:49,063 --> 00:12:50,462
Where are you rushing off to?

265
00:12:50,543 --> 00:12:51,542
To the hospital.

266
00:12:52,303 --> 00:12:54,542
Why? Are you sick? Have the driver take you.

267
00:12:54,743 --> 00:12:55,902
It's okay.

268
00:12:56,063 --> 00:12:58,302
Your secretary Napa is in bad shape.

269
00:12:58,663 --> 00:13:00,422
Kula chart is looking after her at the hospital.

270
00:13:01,703 --> 00:13:02,462
What?

271
00:13:06,183 --> 00:13:06,822
Doctor.

272
00:13:07,423 --> 00:13:09,022
How's the patient doing?

273
00:13:09,943 --> 00:13:11,382
Congratulations.

274
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:12,302
The baby is safe.

275
00:13:15,383 --> 00:13:16,422
Excuse me now.

276
00:13:23,063 --> 00:13:23,502
Baby?

277
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:25,222
What baby?!

278
00:13:25,903 --> 00:13:27,342
Didn't I tell you to use protection?!

279
00:13:28,503 --> 00:13:29,902
Are you trying to destroy me,

280
00:13:30,103 --> 00:13:31,422
destroy my family?!

281
00:13:32,823 --> 00:13:34,502
I'm sorry sir.

282
00:13:35,463 --> 00:13:37,502
I didn't mean to.

283
00:13:41,983 --> 00:13:42,742
It was Kula chart.

284
00:13:43,063 --> 00:13:44,702
Kula chart raped me!

285
00:13:44,703 --> 00:13:45,102
Hey!

286
00:13:45,143 --> 00:13:46,182
You raped me!

287
00:13:46,503 --> 00:13:47,862
You forced me to do things!

288
00:13:48,463 --> 00:13:49,782
You threatened me that if I don't do it,

289
00:13:49,863 --> 00:13:51,262
you will tell Dad about school

290
00:13:51,823 --> 00:13:52,382
Dad!

291
00:13:52,983 --> 00:13:54,422
I was the victim.

292
00:13:54,743 --> 00:13:55,382
I was hurt

293
00:13:55,983 --> 00:13:56,622
and embarrassed.

294
00:13:56,783 --> 00:13:57,462
You were hurt

295
00:13:57,943 --> 00:13:58,902
and embarrassed?!

296
00:14:00,463 --> 00:14:01,382
You bastard!

297
00:14:01,663 --> 00:14:03,062
Where did you get this habit from?!

298
00:14:03,223 --> 00:14:03,742
Bastard!

299
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:04,182
Dad!

300
00:14:04,223 --> 00:14:05,382
Ka molt at!

301
00:14:05,503 --> 00:14:06,262
Stop!

302
00:14:08,263 --> 00:14:09,702
You hitting your son,

303
00:14:10,063 --> 00:14:11,742
what do you get from it?

304
00:14:12,503 --> 00:14:14,102
It happened already

305
00:14:14,543 --> 00:14:15,822
You can't fix it.

306
00:14:17,903 --> 00:14:19,462
Just accept the truth

307
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:23,382
Okay.

308
00:14:24,103 --> 00:14:24,582
Fine.

309
00:14:26,103 --> 00:14:27,222
You'can go home now

310
00:14:27,343 --> 00:14:28,862
I'll handle the rest

311
00:14:39,263 --> 00:14:40,302
Get rid of Napa

312
00:14:40,903 --> 00:14:41,902
Don't make it obvious :

313
00:14:42,343 --> 00:14:43,622
The quicker, the better.

314
00:14:44,743 --> 00:14:45,182
Take him.

315
00:14:45,183 --> 00:14:46,462
That's enough!

316
00:14:46,943 --> 00:14:47,662
Why are you arresting me?!

317
00:14:47,703 --> 00:14:48,062
Hey!

318
00:14:48,103 --> 00:14:49,142
-Take him.
-Wait!

319
00:14:49,463 --> 00:14:49,982
Let go!

320
00:14:50,383 --> 00:14:51,262
Why are you arresting my son?

321
00:14:51,383 --> 00:14:52,062
What did he do wrong?

322
00:14:53,383 --> 00:14:54,622
We have a warrant

323
00:14:55,903 --> 00:14:57,382
The victim filed a report

324
00:14:57,583 --> 00:15:00,022
that your son Mr, Kula chart,

325
00:15:00,183 --> 00:15:01,702
assaulted

326
00:15:02,263 --> 00:15:03,542
and imprisoned them.

327
00:15:04,423 --> 00:15:05,582
Deprived them of freedom.

328
00:15:06,943 --> 00:15:07,422
That's not true.

329
00:15:07,623 --> 00:15:08,502
Where's the evidence?

330
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,222
Let's go talk at the police station.

331
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:12,302
We have a witness

332
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:13,582
evidence,

333
00:15:14,183 --> 00:15:15,342
and CCTV footage

334
00:15:15,463 --> 00:15:18,022
capturing Mr, Kula chart very clearly

335
00:15:18,503 --> 00:15:19,742
Take him Sergeant

336
00:15:19,743 --> 00:15:20,262
Let's go.

337
00:15:21,423 --> 00:15:22,062
Dad!

338
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,582
Help me Dad!

339
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:26,902
What about Mr, Kula chart studying in England?

340
00:15:28,543 --> 00:15:29,382
What are you doing?!

341
00:15:29,623 --> 00:15:30,382
Hey!

342
00:15:40,223 --> 00:15:41,022
Dad!

343
00:15:41,663 --> 00:15:43,342
Dad! Help me!

344
00:15:43,623 --> 00:15:44,262
Who?

345
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:46,662
Who filed a report to slander my son?!

346
00:15:47,343 --> 00:15:48,022
Huh?!

347
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,262
The person who got assaulted

348
00:15:52,263 --> 00:15:53,902
was my brother Laksa mon

349
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:56,422
This time, your evil blood

350
00:15:56,783 --> 00:15:58,262
won't survive Ka molt at.

351
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,862
You again?

352
00:16:01,943 --> 00:16:03,182
You slandered him?!

353
00:16:03,703 --> 00:16:04,822
Bastard!

354
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:06,822
Sir!

355
00:16:06,863 --> 00:16:07,342
Calm down.

356
00:16:07,463 --> 00:16:08,462
Calm down Mr. Ka molt at

357
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:13,142
Want another assault charge on you Mr Ka molt at?

358
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,982
It's a direct offense.

359
00:16:15,383 --> 00:16:17,382
I'think it's best that you two don't confront each other.

360
00:16:17,823 --> 00:16:19,102
Regarding Mr. Laksa mon's case,

361
00:16:19,343 --> 00:16:20,382
I will work on it.

362
00:16:20,463 --> 00:16:21,182
Mr. Ka molt at.

363
00:16:21,703 --> 00:16:22,422
Please have a seat.

364
00:16:28,703 --> 00:16:30,182
Whatever you stole,

365
00:16:31,143 --> 00:16:32,702
keep it safe.

366
00:16:33,303 --> 00:16:35,662
Beware of those who have the rights

367
00:16:36,023 --> 00:16:36,982
coming to claim it back.

368
00:16:39,903 --> 00:16:41,142
Why you...

369
00:16:47,463 --> 00:16:48,182
Rome

370
00:16:51,063 --> 00:16:52,062
Ground Tian.

371
00:16:52,543 --> 00:16:53,622
Don't let her leave her room.

372
00:16:53,823 --> 00:16:54,422
But Rome --

373
00:16:54,423 --> 00:16:55,022
No but s!

374
00:16:55,063 --> 00:16:55,982
Do as I say.

375
00:16:56,143 --> 00:16:56,662
Ms. Thip.

376
00:16:57,983 --> 00:16:59,462
Keep an eye on Tian.

377
00:16:59,943 --> 00:17:00,862
If she goes missing again,

378
00:17:02,423 --> 00:17:03,862
I will condemn everyone for it.

379
00:17:04,503 --> 00:17:05,662
Yes Mr, Rome.

380
00:17:13,423 --> 00:17:13,942
Hello?

381
00:17:16,823 --> 00:17:17,742
Out on bail?

382
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:19,662
How so Inspector?

383
00:17:27,143 --> 00:17:29,622
Where were you all night to come home in the morning like this?

384
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,262
It's nothing Mom.

385
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:32,342
Just a small problem

386
00:17:33,023 --> 00:17:34,502
But I won't accept Nap a's baby as mine

387
00:17:34,983 --> 00:17:38,022
She probably got pregnant with someone else and is claiming it to be mine.

388
00:17:38,623 --> 00:17:41,302
Did you get involved with her though?

389
00:17:42,023 --> 00:17:42,422
Yes.

390
00:17:42,863 --> 00:17:43,822
But it's different.

391
00:17:45,703 --> 00:17:46,502
Kula chart.

392
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:48,862
How can you say it's different?

393
00:17:50,463 --> 00:17:54,622
You getting involved with your father's woman is bad enough

394
00:17:54,983 --> 00:17:57,302
I never thought you would do something like this.

395
00:17:58,063 --> 00:17:59,102
I didn't mean to do it.

396
00:17:59,303 --> 00:18:00,582
That old hag tricked me!

397
00:18:00,903 --> 00:18:01,622
She seduced me

398
00:18:02,223 --> 00:18:03,902
You want that kind of person as a daughter in law?

399
00:18:04,463 --> 00:18:08,302
Whether it's this woman or any other woman, she's still a woman

400
00:18:08,823 --> 00:18:12,142
I won't let another woman get harassed again

401
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:13,302
Especially

402
00:18:13,743 --> 00:18:15,702
if you harassed her

403
00:18:16,543 --> 00:18:18,222
You have to take responsibility.

404
00:18:18,783 --> 00:18:20,302
I'm the one that has to take responsibility

405
00:18:21,103 --> 00:18:21,862
Chart.

406
00:18:22,263 --> 00:18:24,062
Go pack up your things and be ready to fly.

407
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:26,302
Where are you taking him?

408
00:18:27,183 --> 00:18:28,702
Put him in a safe place.

409
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:30,622
Do you know

410
00:18:31,063 --> 00:18:33,062
what crime this bastard committed?

411
00:18:35,303 --> 00:18:37,142
Tell me what you did.

412
00:18:38,663 --> 00:18:40,702
Kidnapped and imprisoned Rome's brother.

413
00:18:41,223 --> 00:18:43,102
Lured the girl Tian to come out to see him

414
00:18:43,263 --> 00:18:44,622
so he can rape her!

415
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:45,702
Kula chart!

416
00:18:45,903 --> 00:18:47,702
How can you do something like this?

417
00:18:48,383 --> 00:18:49,662
Good thing he's smart

418
00:18:49,743 --> 00:18:51,182
and said Napa was the mastermind

419
00:18:51,943 --> 00:18:53,462
So the police let him out on bail

420
00:18:54,503 --> 00:18:54,902
You see?

421
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:56,622
Your son isn't stupid.

422
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:58,662
You wanna be smart with me?

423
00:18:58,703 --> 00:18:59,742
Will you go or not?!

424
00:19:03,543 --> 00:19:05,262
What are we going to do?

425
00:19:07,023 --> 00:19:07,942
Pray.

426
00:19:08,103 --> 00:19:08,902
You're good at it, no?

Without your help,

437

I would be in so much trouble

438
00:20:47,183 --> 00:20:49,102
I have my cards and cash in here 139.

You helped me.

441
00:20:53,903 --> 00:20:55,222
What a small world.

442
00:20:56,023 --> 00:20:57,022
Last time,

443
00:20:57,103 --> 00:20:58,982
I didn't get to ask for your name.

444
00:21:00,023 --> 00:21:01,062
What's your name?

445
00:21:01,703 --> 00:21:02,422
Tian.

446
00:21:02,863 --> 00:21:04,222
My name is Dok tian.

447
00:21:05,503 --> 00:21:06,262
And...

448
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:08,742
what are you to Rome?

449
00:21:10,543 --> 00:21:12,702
I'm a child under his care

450
00:21:13,023 --> 00:21:17,382
I'm an orphan so Boss took me under his care.

451
00:21:19,183 --> 00:21:20,062
I'm...

452
00:21:24,743 --> 00:21:26,822
used to be a close friend of Rome's.

453
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:29,262
Right.

454
00:21:33,663 --> 00:21:34,782
You look..

455
00:21:35,463 --> 00:21:36,902
very familiar.

456
00:21:39,143 --> 00:21:42,262
I must know your parents.

457
00:21:46,823 --> 00:21:48,302
My dad's name...

458
00:21:51,463 --> 00:21:52,142
Rome.

459
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:53,742
Pit p lern.

460
00:21:55,143 --> 00:21:56,382
I'm happy

461
00:21:57,823 --> 00:21:58,862
to see you

462
00:21:59,783 --> 00:22:01,222
happily living well

463
00:22:04,063 --> 00:22:04,982
As appropriate.

464
00:22:05,303 --> 00:22:06,262
I'm not struggling.

465
00:22:07,503 --> 00:22:08,742
You must be doing well.

466
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:10,782
You already know

467
00:22:12,343 --> 00:22:13,862
I had no choice.

468
00:22:17,343 --> 00:22:19,342
Thon asked me to stay alive......

469
00:22:21,743 --> 00:22:23,742
and I'm trying my best.

470
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:35,702

471
00:22:36,783 --> 00:22:37,502
Sit here.

472
00:22:43,783 --> 00:22:45,022
This is Mr s, P itplern,

473
00:22:46,623 --> 00:22:47,822
the person l told you

474
00:22:48,303 --> 00:22:49,982
that she used to date Kama it hon,

475
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:51,382
my best friend.

476
00:22:52,503 --> 00:22:54,862
I told Tian about some of the old stories.

477
00:22:54,983 --> 00:22:57,782
Tian is my friend'sdaughter.

478
00:22:58,783 --> 00:22:59,902
We're pretty close

479
00:23:02,143 --> 00:23:02,702
Alright.

480
00:23:03,263 --> 00:23:04,622
Let's talk about the present.

481
00:23:06,743 --> 00:23:08,742
Why did you come see me, Pit p lern?

482
00:23:10,863 --> 00:23:11,822
About my child.

483
00:23:15,863 --> 00:23:17,182
About Kula chart.

484
00:23:18,383 --> 00:23:19,782
So it's about that...

485
00:23:20,823 --> 00:23:22,462
brat of a kid

486
00:23:23,783 --> 00:23:25,382
I'm begging you Rome.

487
00:23:28,063 --> 00:23:29,102
Think of him

488
00:23:30,143 --> 00:23:31,702
as a son or nephew

489
00:23:31,863 --> 00:23:34,062
and not press charges against him.

490
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:35,942
He's still a kid.

491
00:23:37,863 --> 00:23:40,942
He did it without thinking it through.

492
00:23:41,423 --> 00:23:42,182
You know something?

493
00:23:42,223 --> 00:23:45,022
That brat kicked my brother and almost killed him!

494
00:23:45,103 --> 00:23:46,582
Plus he tried to sexually assault Tian.

495
00:23:46,703 --> 00:23:47,822
I can't let it slide.

496
00:23:48,063 --> 00:23:49,462
I'll leave it to the police

497
00:23:49,983 --> 00:23:51,302
to let them handle it

498
00:23:52,183 --> 00:23:52,862
Rome!

499
00:23:53,263 --> 00:23:54,782
I'm begging you.

500
00:23:56,783 --> 00:23:58,382
It's my fault

501
00:23:58,503 --> 00:23:59,462
and Ka molt at.

502
00:23:59,943 --> 00:24:01,222
We didn't raise him good enough.

503
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:03,582
That's why

504
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:05,942
Kula chart is like this.

505
00:24:06,623 --> 00:24:07,222
Kids

506
00:24:08,223 --> 00:24:09,822
are like a white fabric.

507
00:24:10,343 --> 00:24:12,262
They sometimes can get dirty

508
00:24:13,023 --> 00:24:15,142
That's because the parents labeled them that way.

509
00:24:15,863 --> 00:24:17,382
I'm begging you Rome.

510
00:24:17,903 --> 00:24:19,582
I never asked anything from you.

511
00:24:20,183 --> 00:24:22,142
Can you please forgive Kula chart?

512
00:24:22,423 --> 00:24:23,302
Can you?

513
00:24:23,583 --> 00:24:24,542
Don't do this.

514
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:25,302
No!

515
00:24:26,543 --> 00:24:27,942
I'm begging you.

516
00:24:29,663 --> 00:24:30,782
I will be g you

517
00:24:31,543 --> 00:24:33,462
until you forgive Kula chart.

518
00:24:36,343 --> 00:24:37,102
Tian.

519
00:24:39,783 --> 00:24:40,782
I promise you

520
00:24:42,023 --> 00:24:44,662
I won't let Kula chart bother you again.

521
00:24:47,743 --> 00:24:49,822
Can you forgive Kula chart?

522
00:24:55,823 --> 00:24:56,942
I'm begging you.

523
00:25:00,223 --> 00:25:01,222
For Thon's sake,

524
00:25:03,183 --> 00:25:04,742
for our friendship,

525
00:25:07,983 --> 00:25:08,942
I will forgive him.

526
00:25:12,183 --> 00:25:13,342
Thank you so much.

527
00:25:13,583 --> 00:25:14,422
Thank you.

528
00:25:14,463 --> 00:25:15,582
Thank you Rome!

529
00:25:35,823 --> 00:25:36,422
61558

530
00:25:40,103 --> 00:25:42,382
Thank you so much Tian

531
00:25:42,823 --> 00:25:45,462
for-forgiving Kula chart.

532
00:25:47,183 --> 00:25:50,942
My mother taught me that vengeance must be stopped by not holding vengeance

533
00:25:52,463 --> 00:25:54,342
You're a good kid.

534
00:25:54,703 --> 00:25:55,662
Your mother

535
00:25:55,983 --> 00:25:58,062
must have taught you well.

536
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:37,222
Why didn't you press charges?

537
00:26:39,423 --> 00:26:40,542
Do you think I did the right thing?

538
00:26:41,623 --> 00:26:42,662
More than right.

539
00:26:43,063 --> 00:26:44,222
I figured.

540
00:26:45,543 --> 00:26:46,262
Figured what?

541
00:26:47,223 --> 00:26:49,942
I figured you would do it for Mrs. Pitplern's sake.

542
00:26:50,303 --> 00:26:52,262
Forgive and not press charges

543
00:26:53,623 --> 00:26:54,622
Why do you think that way?

544
00:26:57,383 --> 00:27:02,582
Because my boss is a kindhearted and the best person in this world.

545
00:27:18,783 --> 00:27:19,902
For this case,

546
00:27:20,343 --> 00:27:21,822
Kula chart confessed to all charges.

547
00:27:22,263 --> 00:27:23,702
He told us who the mastermind was

548
00:27:24,623 --> 00:27:26,102
and is being held as a witness.

549
00:27:26,823 --> 00:27:27,982
Who was the mastermind?

550
00:27:28,863 --> 00:27:29,742
The name is Napa.

551
00:27:30,303 --> 00:27:31,862
We're questioning her right now.

552
00:27:32,903 --> 00:27:34,622
But she won't be able to escape.

553
00:27:35,143 --> 00:27:37,382
She's being treated at the hospital right now.

554
00:27:42,143 --> 00:27:44,622
The patient is in Room A616

555
00:27:45,023 --> 00:27:47,382
But I'm not sure if you can visit her or not.

556
00:27:47,503 --> 00:27:49,222
The police are outside the room

557
00:27:50,343 --> 00:27:51,022
Thank you.

558
00:28:10,503 --> 00:28:11,782
Taks as ut Group?

559
00:28:13,863 --> 00:28:16,502
I'd like to have the number for Mr, Kamol tat's secretary, Napa.

560
00:28:17,263 --> 00:28:18,582
She called me for a meeting

561
00:28:18,783 --> 00:28:19,942
but I can't get ahold of her right now.

562
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:25,822
Kula chart.

563
00:28:25,903 --> 00:28:26,582

00:28:28,703 --> 00:28:29,382

00:28:51,703 --> 00:28:52,502
What job?

575
00:28:53,343 --> 00:28:55,582
I know you're Kamol tat'ssecretary.

576
00:28:56,463 --> 00:28:58,942
You must know all of Taks as ut Group'stransactions.

577
00:28:59,423 --> 00:29:01,422
You want me to betray my boss?

578
00:29:02,343 --> 00:29:03,742
I'm giving you the chance

579
00:29:03,983 --> 00:29:05,582
to get revenge on your boss

580
00:29:06,663 --> 00:29:08,262
He has cut ties with you

581
00:29:09,423 --> 00:29:12,422
Kula chart told the authorities that you were the mastermind behind everything.

582
00:29:13,423 --> 00:29:14,382
There's no way.

583
00:29:17,223 --> 00:29:19,102
Kula chart would never betray me.

584
00:29:20,983 --> 00:29:21,622
Because...

585
00:29:22,703 --> 00:29:23,942
Because what?

586
00:29:25,783 --> 00:29:27,742
You won't get anything from me.

587
00:29:27,903 --> 00:29:29,302
Think about it.

588
00:29:30,863 --> 00:29:32,382
I'll be waiting for your answer

589
00:30:01,703 --> 00:30:02,302
It's me.

590
00:30:02,863 --> 00:30:04,102
Boss told me to help you escape.

591
00:30:05,543 --> 00:30:06,262
Escape?

592
00:30:07,383 --> 00:30:08,142
Escape to where?

593
00:30:09,143 --> 00:30:10,342
To a safe place.

594
00:30:11,463 --> 00:30:13,382
He doesn't want you to give birth in prison.

595
00:30:14,303 --> 00:30:16,062
The court has issued an arrest warrant for you.

596
00:30:39,023 --> 00:30:40,022
I won't go.

597
00:30:40,783 --> 00:30:42,782
I'll wait for him or Kula chart to pick me up.

598
00:31:27,543 --> 00:31:28,342
Stop!

599
00:31:29,063 --> 00:31:29,662
Okay.

600
00:31:30,463 --> 00:31:31,062
Stop!

601
00:31:37,623 --> 00:31:38,182
Hey!

602
00:32:04,743 --> 00:32:05,382
Stop!

603
00:32:08,583 --> 00:32:10,422
I'm begging you, please don't hurt me!

604
00:32:10,743 --> 00:32:12,782
I'm begging you!

605
00:32:14,943 --> 00:32:16,942
Once I marry Kula chart,

606
00:32:17,183 --> 00:32:18,022
however much you want

607
00:32:18,623 --> 00:32:20,022
I will give it to you!

608
00:32:20,143 --> 00:32:21,982
Just please don't hurt me!

609
00:32:24,383 --> 00:32:25,542
were asking for death

610
00:32:26,223 --> 00:32:27,822
You were too ambitious!

611
00:32:32,983 --> 00:32:33,662
Get up!

612
00:32:34,943 --> 00:32:37,982
Please don't hurt me. I'm begging you!

613
00:33:11,383 --> 00:33:11,822
Miss.

614
00:33:24,343 --> 00:33:26,382
Why did you bring me here?!

615
00:33:27,663 --> 00:33:29,822
I didn't even tell Pal had an urgent meeting.

616
00:33:29,863 --> 00:33:30,662
What's wrong?

617
00:33:30,663 --> 00:33:31,862
Stop talking.

618
00:33:32,063 --> 00:33:32,422
Let's go.

619
00:33:35,703 --> 00:33:36,382
Help her.

620
00:33:36,703 --> 00:33:37,782
She's critically injured

621
00:33:51,583 --> 00:33:52,342
How is she?

622
00:33:53,743 --> 00:33:55,902
The mother isn't so worrisome.

623
00:33:57,063 --> 00:33:58,302
But the baby...

624
00:33:59,623 --> 00:34:00,262
didn't survive.

625
00:34:02,223 --> 00:34:02,942
How pitiful.

626
00:34:03,703 --> 00:34:04,662
Not even two months yet.

627
00:34:05,983 --> 00:34:06,862
If I were to guess,

628
00:34:08,063 --> 00:34:09,182
the baby

629
00:34:10,143 --> 00:34:11,382
was Ka mol tat's baby.

630
00:34:12,743 --> 00:34:13,982
So he sent his men

631
00:34:14,863 --> 00:34:16,062
to silence her.

632
00:34:17,463 --> 00:34:17,902
Rome,

633
00:34:19,263 --> 00:34:20,302
You're guessing again?

634
00:34:21,063 --> 00:34:22,702
How many guesses have you made?

635
00:34:23,023 --> 00:34:25,062
Each one of them isn't a trivial matter either.

636
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:27,142
Look at her condition.

637
00:34:27,783 --> 00:34:29,782
I think you should file a police report.

638
00:34:30,383 --> 00:34:31,382
He's going to make an excuse

639
00:34:31,783 --> 00:34:32,822
and save himself again.

640
00:34:34,303 --> 00:34:35,142
This woman

641
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:39,342
is an important piece of evidence I will keep to get back at Kamolt at.

642
00:34:41,703 --> 00:34:42,622
Enough Rome

643
00:34:43,903 --> 00:34:45,342
I have to get back to Ranong

644
00:34:46,783 --> 00:34:47,382
Yeah.

645
00:34:47,823 --> 00:34:48,822
Ill handle this.

646
00:34:48,823 --> 00:34:49,342
Yeah.

647
00:34:50,743 --> 00:34:52,062
I have news for'you.

648
00:34:53,063 --> 00:34:54,702
But I don't know if it's good news or bad news

649
00:34:56,223 --> 00:34:56,782
Open it.

650
00:35:03,303 --> 00:35:03,742
11
12
10
11
11
11
13
11
11
121
12
13
11
12

651
00:35:16,583 --> 00:35:18,062
You have strong hands

652
00:35:19,823 --> 00:35:20,862
Do you have a boyfriend yet?

653
00:35:22,903 --> 00:35:24,502
What are you asking sir?

654
00:35:25,063 --> 00:35:26,582
I'm still single.

655
00:35:28,463 --> 00:35:32,022
In that case, I will transfer you from PR

656
00:35:32,343 --> 00:35:33,462
to my secretary.

657
00:35:34,063 --> 00:35:34,782
Any objections?

658
00:35:38,543 --> 00:35:40,182
I would very much appreciate that.

659
00:35:40,423 --> 00:35:42,182
I won't disappoint you.

660
00:35:43,303 --> 00:35:43,982
So...

661
00:35:44,423 --> 00:35:45,622
what about Napa?

662
00:35:46,503 --> 00:35:47,102
Oh.

663
00:35:47,423 --> 00:35:49,582
Another company will pay her more

664
00:35:50,223 --> 00:35:51,382
so she left me.

665
00:35:53,743 --> 00:35:55,822
I will never do that to you.

666
00:35:58,343 --> 00:35:58,862
Really?

667
00:36:12,623 --> 00:36:13,342
Leave first.

668
00:36:17,743 --> 00:36:18,582
All done?

669
00:36:21,423 --> 00:36:21,742
Yes.

670
00:36:22,743 --> 00:36:24,302
Staged as a robbery.

671
00:36:24,823 --> 00:36:26,862
She turned in her resignation letter in advance

672
00:36:27,023 --> 00:36:28,102
according to labor law.

673
00:36:30,223 --> 00:36:30,782
Good.

674
00:36:31,343 --> 00:36:33,142
She asked for her own death.

675
00:36:33,943 --> 00:36:34,702
And..

676
00:36:34,783 --> 00:36:35,902
what about Kula chart?

677
00:36:36,223 --> 00:36:37,342
What do you want me to do?

678
00:36:38,983 --> 00:36:40,222
Have him stay at the safe house for now.

679
00:36:40,943 --> 00:36:42,742
Wait until this dies down.

680
00:36:43,783 --> 00:36:47,022
But I have an important job for you right now.

681
00:36:48,663 --> 00:36:49,302
What is it?

682
00:36:52,303 --> 00:36:54,382
Get rid of my number one enemy

683
00:36:54,863 --> 00:36:55,502
Rome.

684
00:37:08,063 --> 00:37:09,062
You're back?

685
00:37:09,903 --> 00:37:11,102
Where have you been since morning

686
00:37:11,663 --> 00:37:12,582
The temple

687
00:37:14,143 --> 00:37:15,462
You think I'm stupid?

688
00:37:15,943 --> 00:37:16,742
l know

689
00:37:17,343 --> 00:37:19,182
you went to ask for Rome'saddress from Pat.

690
00:37:19,703 --> 00:37:20,502
Pat told me.

691
00:37:22,023 --> 00:37:23,182
You knew already.

692
00:37:23,343 --> 00:37:24,942
So why ask?

693
00:37:25,383 --> 00:37:26,342
Why did you go see him?

694
00:37:28,023 --> 00:37:29,742
I went to ask for his mercy

695
00:37:29,903 --> 00:37:31,742
not to press charges against Kula chart.

696
00:37:34,263 --> 00:37:36,622
You shamelessly went to beg him?

697
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:38,782
Both mother and son are so stupid!

698
00:37:39,743 --> 00:37:40,902
Loss of my dignity.

699
00:37:41,583 --> 00:37:42,502
Look.

700
00:37:42,703 --> 00:37:44,622
I went to do my duty as a mother

701
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:47,102
and l succeeded.

702
00:37:48,343 --> 00:37:50,342
Rome for gave Kula chart.

703
00:37:51,463 --> 00:37:53,782
You're the one that has to thank him.

704
00:37:54,223 --> 00:37:55,822
You're really stubborn.

705
00:37:56,063 --> 00:37:58,062
We will win the case regardless.

706
00:37:58,223 --> 00:38:00,062
Chart met with Napa at the motel!

707
00:38:01,023 --> 00:38:01,862
As for Lak,

708
00:38:02,063 --> 00:38:03,622
he got jumped by who knows who

709
00:38:04,183 --> 00:38:07,662
Tian went to save him because Lak sent her those photos of him getting beat up.

710
00:38:08,103 --> 00:38:09,662
Everything was a coincidence

711
00:38:10,023 --> 00:38:11,462
No evidence that connects us to it.

712
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:13,782
Most importantly,

713
00:38:13,823 --> 00:38:16,142
I used money to shut down every pathway.

714
00:38:16,583 --> 00:38:17,902
You troubled yourself for nothing.

715
00:38:17,983 --> 00:38:19,182
Does your money

716
00:38:20,303 --> 00:38:24,022
teach Kula chart to know right from wrong?

717
00:38:25,223 --> 00:38:26,302
Once this is over

718
00:38:26,303 --> 00:38:28,022
he will cause another problem

719
00:38:28,183 --> 00:38:29,022
Right now,

720
00:38:29,463 --> 00:38:31,222
he got a woman pregnant.

721
00:38:32,503 --> 00:38:33,622
That woman

722
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:35,782
probably won't take your money either

723
00:38:36,623 --> 00:38:37,542
Don't meddle

724
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:39,222
I will handle this matter.

725
00:38:39,543 --> 00:38:40,622
I can't not meddle.

726
00:38:41,863 --> 00:38:43,702
That baby is my grandchild.

727
00:38:47,743 --> 00:38:48,462
Ae.

728
00:38:48,623 --> 00:38:49,902
Bring me a basket.

729
00:38:50,583 --> 00:38:51,302
Ae!

730
00:38:52,023 --> 00:38:52,702
Hey!

731
00:38:53,303 --> 00:38:54,862
I told you not to meddle!

732
00:38:55,063 --> 00:38:56,702
I sent someone to take care of her.

733
00:38:56,983 --> 00:38:59,302
If you show up there, the reporters will know!

734
00:39:00,143 --> 00:39:01,062
Just stay put.

735
00:39:16,783 --> 00:39:17,342
Boss.

736
00:39:22,703 --> 00:39:23,862
That's blood.

737
00:39:27,063 --> 00:39:27,662
Red juice.

738
00:39:29,383 --> 00:39:30,902
A kid spill ed it on me.

739
00:39:32,423 --> 00:39:34,862
You're not lying to me are you?

740
00:39:36,023 --> 00:39:37,022
Gosh you!

741
00:39:37,743 --> 00:39:39,582
Who do you think you are to question me?

742
00:39:41,343 --> 00:39:42,302
Are you my guardian?

743
00:39:43,943 --> 00:39:44,782
No!

744
00:39:45,143 --> 00:39:45,782
It's just...

745
00:39:46,543 --> 00:39:48,862
I don't want to see you injured.

746
00:39:48,943 --> 00:39:50,582
I don't want to see anything happen to you.

747
00:39:50,863 --> 00:39:52,262
If that happens

748
00:39:52,303 --> 00:39:54,222
I would rather die in your place

749
00:39:56,023 --> 00:39:56,782
Is that'so?

750
00:39:57,623 --> 00:39:58,462
It's true.

751
00:39:58,823 --> 00:40:01,022
I can die for you

752
00:40:08,103 --> 00:40:08,942
Thanks Tian.

753
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:12,182
But nothing will happen to me.

754
00:40:13,463 --> 00:40:15,462
I gotten through my lowest point in life already.

755
00:40:16,663 --> 00:40:17,502
From now on,

756
00:40:18,303 --> 00:40:19,862
only good things will happen.

757
00:40:21,463 --> 00:40:22,142
And you...

758
00:40:24,783 --> 00:40:26,382
are the best thing that has happened to me.

759
00:40:55,423 --> 00:40:57,062
Ive been ready to go for a long time!

760
00:40:57,223 --> 00:40:57,902
Yo!

761
00:40:58,143 --> 00:40:59,222
Let's go Dad.

762
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:00,782
