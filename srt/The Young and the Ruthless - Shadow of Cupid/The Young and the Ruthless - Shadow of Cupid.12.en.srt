There's a gas leak Boss.

20
00:01:35,503 --> 00:01:36,462
What should we do?

21
00:01:36,543 --> 00:01:38,462
Quickly evacuate everyone out of there.

22
00:01:38,503 --> 00:01:39,942
I'll call and ask for help.

23
00:01:40,023 --> 00:01:40,622
This time

24
00:01:41,423 --> 00:01:43,302
Rome will completely go broke

25
00:01:43,543 --> 00:01:45,262
I'm just worried.

26
00:01:45,663 --> 00:01:47,982
He had to spend money on buying the condo

27
00:01:48,303 --> 00:01:49,902
then spend money on the lawsuit.

28
00:01:50,463 --> 00:01:51,542
It's over a hundred million.

29
00:01:54,943 --> 00:01:55,942
Tian left home.

30
00:01:56,663 --> 00:01:57,622
She's coming here to see me.

31
00:02:05,383 --> 00:02:06,142
What's wrong?

32
00:02:06,783 --> 00:02:08,942
I need to use the restroom. I can't hold it in any more.

33
00:02:09,823 --> 00:02:10,582
Yes.

34
00:02:10,623 --> 00:02:12,542
I will help you get revenge

35
00:02:13,103 --> 00:02:15,462
and will do whatever you tell me to do

36
00:02:18,223 --> 00:02:19,262
How are you son?

37
00:02:19,783 --> 00:02:21,302
What did you eat

38
00:02:21,423 --> 00:02:22,862
to be in critical condition like this?

39
00:02:24,103 --> 00:02:24,782
OW...

40
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:29,142
I think it was food poisoning.

41
00:02:31,743 --> 00:02:33,622
We need to sue that restaurant.

42
00:02:34,183 --> 00:02:35,222
Sue what?

43
00:02:35,783 --> 00:02:37,142
I went to ask the doctor

44
00:02:37,823 --> 00:02:39,302
There's only laxative found in your stomach.

45
00:02:42,063 --> 00:02:43,222
l shouldn't have named you Kula chart

46
00:02:43,783 --> 00:02:44,942
What a disgrace on your birth.

47
00:02:46,063 --> 00:02:47,222
When did you lose your way with her?

48
00:02:51,183 --> 00:02:52,222
I really don't know.

49
00:02:53,143 --> 00:02:56,262
Why didn't you use the sleeping pills I gave you?

50
00:02:56,503 --> 00:02:57,942
You were sitting in the car with her for so long.

51
00:02:58,063 --> 00:03:00,142
Why didn't you put it in her water or snacks?

52
00:03:01,863 --> 00:03:03,502
I'm a gentleman.

53
00:03:04,343 --> 00:03:05,822
I don't want to use the drugs.

54
00:03:06,663 --> 00:03:08,222
I want Tian

55
00:03:08,703 --> 00:03:10,022
to consent to me.

56
00:03:10,463 --> 00:03:11,702
It's much more pleasurable.

57
00:03:14,783 --> 00:03:18,582
I will not tolerate and acknowledge you guys evil deeds anymore.

58
00:03:26,783 --> 00:03:27,862
It's good your mother left.

59
00:03:28,463 --> 00:03:29,702
I can train you much easier.

60
00:03:31,063 --> 00:03:32,422
I'm good at this kind J of thing.

61
00:03:34,383 --> 00:03:35,502
Dad

62
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,342
Will I get to marry Tian though?

63
00:03:40,063 --> 00:03:41,822
Besides Mom,

64
00:03:42,343 --> 00:03:43,302
she is the only woman in the world I love.

65
00:03:47,383 --> 00:03:49,062
Tian.

66
00:03:50,343 --> 00:03:53,702
13 of our workers are at the hospital right now.

67
00:03:54,103 --> 00:03:54,862
Besides that,

68
00:03:55,383 --> 00:03:56,022
they all went home.

69
00:03:57,183 --> 00:03:58,902
They have social security.

70
00:03:59,343 --> 00:04:00,542
But the problem is

71
00:04:00,623 --> 00:04:02,582
villagers in the community surrounding the factory

72
00:04:02,663 --> 00:04:05,222
with more than 50 families, over300 people,

73
00:04:05,463 --> 00:04:07,702
some were willing to take our compensation money

74
00:04:07,903 --> 00:04:10,702
But some have prepared lawyers to file a lawsuit against us

75
00:04:11,263 --> 00:04:13,542
Lawyer Than on g is in the process of negotiating

76
00:04:13,983 --> 00:04:15,222
Most importantly

77
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:16,942
the Pollution Control Department

78
00:04:17,263 --> 00:04:18,862
has ordered to shut down our factory for 20 days.

79
00:04:19,503 --> 00:04:20,222
I think

80
00:04:21,743 --> 00:04:22,102
we won't be able to make our deliveries on time.

81
00:04:24,183 --> 00:04:25,262
In the contract.

82
00:04:25,863 --> 00:04:27,942
we have to pay a fine of ten times the price

83
00:04:28,943 --> 00:04:30,542
We have clients from over 20 companies

84
00:04:32,503 --> 00:04:33,862
What did the insurance people say?

85
00:04:34,423 --> 00:04:36,582
The insurance company's legal department argued that

86
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:38,182
our workers were the ones who caused the incident

87
00:04:38,863 --> 00:04:40,502
So there might be problems dividing the insurance money

88
00:04:44,103 --> 00:04:44,822
Okay,

89
00:04:45,503 --> 00:04:46,982
You guys can get back to work.

90
00:05:01,183 --> 00:05:03,982
Why didn't you tell us you were having problems Rome?

Subtitles by oh sweet haven.com Timing by Angel La korns

92
00:05:31,143 --> 00:05:32,462
How are you Boss?

93
00:05:39,983 --> 00:05:40,782
This house

94
00:05:42,143 --> 00:05:43,422
was built with my own two hands

95
00:05:45,783 --> 00:05:46,742
My factory,

96
00:05:47,663 --> 00:05:48,382
my dock,

97
00:05:50,303 --> 00:05:52,262
the vacant land by the sea,

98
00:05:53,503 --> 00:05:55,262
I developed and built everything up

99
00:05:55,903 --> 00:05:56,982
until it became like this today

100
00:05:58,703 --> 00:06:00,582
I won't lose it to anyone easily

101
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:12,782
How's it going Rome?

102
00:06:13,463 --> 00:06:16,902
Tian probably told you how worried I am about you

103
00:06:18,023 --> 00:06:18,822
Ka molt at.

104
00:06:19,623 --> 00:06:21,142
Don't bother me and Tian again.

105
00:06:21,463 --> 00:06:21,982
Hey.

106
00:06:22,263 --> 00:06:24,662
Why are you cutting ties with me like this?

107
00:06:25,463 --> 00:06:28,662
I just want to know about your well-being, that's all.

108
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:32,582
In case I can help you with anything.

109
00:06:32,943 --> 00:06:33,782
Look.

110
00:06:33,943 --> 00:06:35,182
If you are struggling,

111
00:06:35,943 --> 00:06:37,622
you can let me know.

112
00:06:38,103 --> 00:06:39,182
Don't talk smart with me

113
00:06:39,463 --> 00:06:40,542
You think I don't know?

114
00:06:41,623 --> 00:06:43,422
People who like to backstab people in the back

115
00:06:43,983 --> 00:06:45,022
I know who did it.

116
00:06:48,343 --> 00:06:49,382
Don't blame other people.

117
00:06:49,823 --> 00:06:52,622
Learn how to accept your own weaknesses.

118
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,222
As your senior,

119
00:06:55,823 --> 00:06:57,542
I will give you recommendations.

120
00:06:58,663 --> 00:06:59,422
Pardon me Boss.

121
00:07:01,303 --> 00:07:03,902
Someday, karma will catch up to you Mr. Ka molt at.

122
00:07:15,103 --> 00:07:15,942
Let me go!

123
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,342
Don't kill me!

124
00:07:22,103 --> 00:07:24,182
Don't come near me!

125
00:07:24,463 --> 00:07:25,062
Let go!

126
00:07:29,063 --> 00:07:30,142
What happened?!

127
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:30,862
Let go!

128
00:07:32,503 --> 00:07:33,462
Who are you guys?!

129
00:07:33,543 --> 00:07:34,782
I don't want to be here!

130
00:07:36,983 --> 00:07:38,222
Miss.

131
00:07:38,223 --> 00:07:39,222
Calm down!

132
00:07:39,463 --> 00:07:41,502
I'm the one that saved you from Pats a korn.

133
00:07:48,943 --> 00:07:49,942
If you tell us the truth,

134
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:52,062
you don't have to be afraid.

135
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:54,462
Stay with me

136
00:07:55,343 --> 00:07:57,102
and Ka molt at can't hurt you

137
00:07:57,983 --> 00:07:58,982
First question,

138
00:07:59,543 --> 00:08:02,262
how could you sleep with both father and son?

139
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:04,822
Who do you actually love?

140
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,222
Pa.

141
00:08:08,623 --> 00:08:09,502
No.

142
00:08:11,703 --> 00:08:13,342
I don't love either of them.

143
00:08:18,303 --> 00:08:20,022
When I was at Kamol tat's company,

144
00:08:23,263 --> 00:08:26,222
I was raped and harassed in so many ways.

145
00:08:28,103 --> 00:08:30,662
When he sent me to look after Kula chart at home

146
00:08:32,183 --> 00:08:35,182
Kula chart raped me as well

147
00:08:40,343 --> 00:08:42,662
He's probably scared that I would expose him of this

148
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:46,422
so he sent me and Kula chart abroad

149
00:08:48,423 --> 00:08:49,902
When I got there

150
00:08:50,903 --> 00:08:52,902
I found out I was pregnant.

151
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,702
Kula chart won't accept it

152
00:08:58,303 --> 00:08:59,782
so we came back to Thailand

153
00:09:03,263 --> 00:09:04,062
And...

154
00:09:05,143 --> 00:09:06,902
why did you lie

155
00:09:07,743 --> 00:09:09,702
Ka mol tat's baby

156
00:09:10,303 --> 00:09:11,422
is Kula chart's baby?

157
00:09:14,383 --> 00:09:16,062
Someone like Ka molt at

158
00:09:18,063 --> 00:09:19,342
would accept the baby as his?

159
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:24,022
A secretary's baby like me.

160
00:09:28,863 --> 00:09:29,702
Did you know

161
00:09:31,063 --> 00:09:33,102
when I told him

162
00:09:34,663 --> 00:09:36,742
that the baby was Kula chart's

163
00:09:37,223 --> 00:09:39,222
his own grandchild.

164
00:09:39,903 --> 00:09:41,382
he wasn't happy at all?

165
00:09:42,343 --> 00:09:44,702
He had no mercy whatsoever.

166
00:09:50,303 --> 00:09:51,462
What he did

167
00:09:52,903 --> 00:09:55,862
was ordered Pats a korn to kill me

168
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:58,742
He probably got scared

169
00:09:59,103 --> 00:10:00,982
that I would expose him

170
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,542
Mother is bad.

171
00:10:05,943 --> 00:10:07,342
the baby is evil.

172
00:10:22,303 --> 00:10:24,502
I think we should take Napa to file a police report

173
00:10:25,223 --> 00:10:26,502
This time Ka molt at

174
00:10:26,823 --> 00:10:27,862
would be charged with so many felonies

175
00:10:28,303 --> 00:10:30,142
And you want me to be a witness that saw the incident?

176
00:10:32,183 --> 00:10:33,382
The judge won't listen.

177
00:10:33,983 --> 00:10:35,582
People who have conflict with each other

178
00:10:35,783 --> 00:10:37,182
will testify against each other?

179
00:10:37,663 --> 00:10:38,742
After listening to Napa,

180
00:10:38,783 --> 00:10:42,102
you believe that Napa got raped by both the father and son

181
00:10:42,423 --> 00:10:43,502
and not be able to survive?

182
00:10:47,703 --> 00:10:48,382
That's true.

183
00:10:48,983 --> 00:10:49,942
You're right.

184
00:10:51,783 --> 00:10:52,502
In that case,

185
00:10:53,503 --> 00:10:55,022
what will you do next?

186
00:10:56,463 --> 00:10:57,542
I think Napa

187
00:10:58,383 --> 00:11:01,542
knows something about Ka molt at and Kula chart

188
00:11:02,183 --> 00:11:03,862
that will benefit us in the future.

189
00:11:12,303 --> 00:11:13,022
Greet and say bye when you come and go.

190
00:11:13,103 --> 00:11:15,022
Kids of your generation probably don't know that.

191
00:11:15,423 --> 00:11:16,942
Even with me and Mr. Lak,

192
00:11:17,303 --> 00:11:18,662
you were able to deceive us.

193
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:20,822
As long as you're home safe,

194
00:11:20,983 --> 00:11:22,142
I am happy.

195
00:11:22,503 --> 00:11:24,822
But if I knew that you really wanted to go,

196
00:11:25,383 --> 00:11:27,302
I would have accompanied you

197
00:11:28,983 --> 00:11:29,502
Alright.

198
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:32,822
I have already punished Tian for her mistake.

199
00:11:36,143 --> 00:11:36,702
Tian.

200
00:11:38,103 --> 00:11:39,302
What must someone do

201
00:11:40,063 --> 00:11:40,862
if they repented?

202
00:11:47,063 --> 00:11:48,942
I'm sorry Ms, Thip.

203
00:11:52,983 --> 00:11:54,862
I'm sorry Mr, Lak.

204
00:12:01,343 --> 00:12:02,142
Tian!

205
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:09,342
How did you get to Ranong? I was so worried

206
00:12:11,743 --> 00:12:13,182
I took a bus there.

207
00:12:14,383 --> 00:12:16,822
I was buying you a ticket

208
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:20,542
but suddenly a thief came and stole my purse.

209
00:12:20,623 --> 00:12:22,342
So I ranafter him

210
00:12:22,823 --> 00:12:27,222
But when l got back,you were gone, I was so scared

211
00:12:27,823 --> 00:12:30,262
I'm sorry I made you struggle.

212
00:12:30,543 --> 00:12:31,702
It's okay.

213
00:12:31,743 --> 00:12:33,102
No need to apologize.

214
00:12:33,303 --> 00:12:35,942
I was careless not to ask for your number.

215
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:39,822
But thankyou for dropping me off at the bus station.

216
00:12:40,823 --> 00:12:41,422
Mon.

217
00:12:44,903 --> 00:12:46,342
You should have dropped her off at home.

218
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,062
Not at the bus stop.

219
00:12:54,423 --> 00:12:55,382
Mr, Rome.

220
00:12:55,703 --> 00:12:58,182
Has the situation at the factory gotten better?

221
00:12:58,423 --> 00:13:01,382
From the news, I don't think it's a trivial matter.

222
00:13:03,263 --> 00:13:04,622
What happened to the factory?

223
00:13:04,703 --> 00:13:06,142
I'm not up to date.

224
00:13:06,903 --> 00:13:07,742
Gas leak.

225
00:13:08,143 --> 00:13:09,542
My nemesis did it.

226
00:13:09,703 --> 00:13:10,462
I knew it!

227
00:13:11,143 --> 00:13:14,382
An evil deed like this couldn't be done by anyone besides Ka molt at

228
00:13:17,543 --> 00:13:19,342
I practically served her on a plate for Kula chart

229
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:20,702
But he still missed

230
00:13:20,863 --> 00:13:22,782
I did everything in our plan.

231
00:13:23,063 --> 00:13:24,822
But you played outside the game

232
00:13:24,983 --> 00:13:26,622
You attacked Rome

233
00:13:29,343 --> 00:13:31,142
I'm so jealous of Rome

234
00:13:31,663 --> 00:13:33,902
that good women like you and Tian

235
00:13:34,023 --> 00:13:35,262
are concern about him

236
00:13:36,103 --> 00:13:37,262
Let me seriously ask you

237
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:40,022
Do you still want to own Rome?

238
00:13:41,063 --> 00:13:45,302
He's about to go bankrupt that he can practically sell his body

239
00:13:46,783 --> 00:13:47,622
There's no way.

240
00:13:48,423 --> 00:13:50,062
Rome isn't that stupid

241
00:13:51,183 --> 00:13:52,302
He can manage.

242
00:13:52,823 --> 00:13:53,862
Don't worry

243
00:13:54,383 --> 00:13:56,062
I won't let him fall to that extent.

244
00:13:57,703 --> 00:14:00,142
If you have the time, you should check in on him.

245
00:14:01,303 --> 00:14:02,302
He's stressed

246
00:14:02,543 --> 00:14:03,622
He needs moral support

247
00:14:21,983 --> 00:14:23,902
Don't stress too much that you kill yourself.

248
00:14:24,783 --> 00:14:26,902
Thon will be very disappointed.

249
00:14:30,423 --> 00:14:31,222
Ka molt at.

250
00:14:33,263 --> 00:14:34,222
Sonof abitch!

251
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:48,382
Boss.

252
00:15:20,663 --> 00:15:23,702
Rome refused to contact any financial institutions.

253
00:15:24,063 --> 00:15:26,462
My spy has been following him everywhere.

254
00:15:26,663 --> 00:15:28,422
He probably has his back against the wall now.

255
00:15:30,743 --> 00:15:33,062
That's what's scary.

256
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:36,582
He probably has something up his sleeves.

257
00:15:39,903 --> 00:15:41,942
Maybe he has hidden assets?

258
00:15:42,183 --> 00:15:42,942
No.

259
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:44,902
No nominees either.

260
00:15:45,263 --> 00:15:46,502
I checked in full detail

261
00:15:48,463 --> 00:15:49,302
Hi Dad!

262
00:15:50,703 --> 00:15:51,662
Hi Pat sa korn.

263
00:15:56,543 --> 00:15:57,062
Dad!

264
00:15:57,943 --> 00:15:59,542
I've endured to be a good person for you.

265
00:16:00,343 --> 00:16:01,462
I don't hang out with bad friends.

266
00:16:02,143 --> 00:16:03,102
I don't drink.

267
00:16:04,383 --> 00:16:05,742
I don't go to clubs.

268
00:16:06,223 --> 00:16:07,302
I don't even go near

269
00:16:07,863 --> 00:16:08,742
drugs and getting high.

270
00:16:09,263 --> 00:16:10,422
You want a thank you?

271
00:16:11,183 --> 00:16:12,182
Gosh Dad!

272
00:16:12,703 --> 00:16:14,502
I'm a good boy now

273
00:16:14,663 --> 00:16:16,622
So where is my beloved Can?

274
00:16:16,783 --> 00:16:17,822
I promise you

275
00:16:18,623 --> 00:16:20,142
if I get the chance to sleep with her,

276
00:16:21,143 --> 00:16:22,382
I will stay focus in school.

277
00:16:27,143 --> 00:16:27,782
Sir.

278
00:16:27,823 --> 00:16:29,502
Mr, Rome Pak an ant is here to see you.

279
00:16:34,343 --> 00:16:35,102
Wow!

280
00:16:36,103 --> 00:16:39,422
It's unbelievable that Boss Rome came here to see me.

281
00:16:39,703 --> 00:16:41,902
I'm very excited and happy

282
00:16:42,463 --> 00:16:44,222
If you're busy then I won't bother you.

283
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:45,782
Hey wait little brother.

284
00:16:45,783 --> 00:16:47,062
I was just kidding with you.

285
00:16:48,903 --> 00:16:49,942
What can I do for you?

286
00:16:53,023 --> 00:16:54,022
I'll be honest.

287
00:16:55,023 --> 00:16:56,422
I don't want to lose my house

288
00:16:57,103 --> 00:16:58,702
and my frozen food factory.

289
00:17:01,143 --> 00:17:03,542
You won't lose any assets.

290
00:17:04,503 --> 00:17:05,182
But...

291
00:17:06,143 --> 00:17:07,782
the value is quite high.

292
00:17:07,983 --> 00:17:08,942
I'm a businessman.

293
00:17:09,063 --> 00:17:10,302
You understand right?

294
00:17:11,623 --> 00:17:13,902
What's your condition, Ka molt at?

295
00:17:15,543 --> 00:17:17,142
I will mortgage

296
00:17:17,783 --> 00:17:19,382
your house and factory

297
00:17:19,943 --> 00:17:21,982
As for the details and conditions,

298
00:17:22,143 --> 00:17:23,502
it's whatever you decide.

299
00:17:23,903 --> 00:17:25,022
I'm only asking for one thing

300
00:17:26,343 --> 00:17:28,422
Tian must marry Kula chart.

301
00:17:37,503 --> 00:17:38,462
Boss!

302
00:17:39,703 --> 00:17:41,062
Tada!

303
00:17:41,463 --> 00:17:42,542
How do I look?

304
00:17:42,783 --> 00:17:43,702
Is this dress okay?

305
00:17:48,783 --> 00:17:49,222
Pretty

306
00:17:50,623 --> 00:17:51,182
You look pretty.

307
00:17:52,303 --> 00:17:54,502
You said you are taking me to an important event.

308
00:17:54,663 --> 00:17:57,102
So I had to look pretty for the occasion

309
00:18:00,183 --> 00:18:00,702
Tian.

310
00:18:01,903 --> 00:18:02,462
Yes?

311
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:04,622
You told me

312
00:18:05,703 --> 00:18:07,462
you will stay by my side forever, right?

313
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:09,742
Yes.

314
00:18:10,343 --> 00:18:13,782
I will stay by your side for eternity.

315
00:18:16,823 --> 00:18:18,622
No matter what I decide to do.

316
00:18:20,903 --> 00:18:21,862
you...

317
00:18:22,183 --> 00:18:23,422
won't object right?

318
00:18:25,383 --> 00:18:25,862
Yes.

319
00:18:26,423 --> 00:18:28,302
I trust you.

320
00:18:37,703 --> 00:18:38,462
Good kid!

321
00:18:41,983 --> 00:18:42,582
II'm hungry.

322
00:18:43,063 --> 00:18:43,862
Are you hungry?

323
00:18:45,183 --> 00:18:47,622
I was gonna stop to le at the local red curry

324
00:18:51,703 --> 00:18:53,342
Just hang on'everyone.

325
00:18:54,263 --> 00:18:56,822
May be Rome will take us to go eat.

326
00:18:58,143 --> 00:18:58,742
sushi.

327
00:18:59,223 --> 00:19:00,462
Or...

328
00:19:00,743 --> 00:19:01,822
Chinese food.

329
00:19:05,703 --> 00:19:08,342
Are you sure you won't have dinner here first?

330
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:19,222
Let's get going.

331
00:19:24,903 --> 00:19:25,502
Wow!h

332
00:19:25,863 --> 00:19:27,142
Whose house is this?

333
00:19:27,263 --> 00:19:28,982
It's so big like a politician's house.

334
00:19:30,023 --> 00:19:30,702
Hi.

335
00:19:31,263 --> 00:19:32,542
Welcome everybody

336
00:19:32,943 --> 00:19:33,822
Food is ready.

337
00:19:34,223 --> 00:19:34,822
Please.

338
00:19:49,663 --> 00:19:50,182
Pao.

339
00:19:50,463 --> 00:19:51,422
What's going on?

340
00:19:51,903 --> 00:19:52,622
I don't know.

341
00:19:53,343 --> 00:19:54,182
I'm confused too.

342
00:19:58,663 --> 00:20:00,182
Dig in. No need to feel considerate.

343
00:20:02,063 --> 00:20:02,742
Kula chart.

344
00:20:03,343 --> 00:20:05,542
What's on the menu today?

345
00:20:08,503 --> 00:20:09,782
Thank you for the question

346
00:20:10,863 --> 00:20:13,702
We have Thai, Chinese, Japanese, and American food!

347
00:20:14,263 --> 00:20:16,622
It was created by a Michelin star chef.

348
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:18,262
You don't need to taste

349
00:20:18,463 --> 00:20:19,462
because l did already

350
00:20:19,863 --> 00:20:21,702
Let me tell you it's wonderful

351
00:20:22,343 --> 00:20:23,262
But first of all,y

352
00:20:24,303 --> 00:20:25,022
Rome,

353
00:20:25,783 --> 00:20:26,302
do you have something to say?

354
00:20:29,303 --> 00:20:30,542
Everyone should know

355
00:20:33,303 --> 00:20:35,142
that my business isn't doing so great right now.

356
00:20:36,303 --> 00:20:39,102
I can't resolve the problem on my own.

357
00:20:40,863 --> 00:20:41,742
Mr. Ka molt at

358
00:20:42,943 --> 00:20:45,342
has l ended me his hand to help

359
00:20:46,983 --> 00:20:48,622
He is my benefactor.

360
00:20:51,903 --> 00:20:52,222
W

361
00:20:52,223 --> 00:20:53,142
My pleasure.

I am happy to restore everything of yours.

363
00:20:58,183 --> 00:21:00,502
We will become in laws soon.

364
00:21:02,423 --> 00:21:03,822
My Kula chart

365
00:21:05,503 --> 00:21:06,822
and your Tian

366
00:21:07,423 --> 00:21:09,342
will be getting married'soon.

367
00:21:10,063 --> 00:21:10,782
Huh?!

368
00:21:26,423 --> 00:21:27,222
Wait Rome!

369
00:21:28,263 --> 00:21:29,582
need to talk to you!

370
00:21:31,383 --> 00:21:32,262
I'm tired.

371
00:21:32,943 --> 00:21:33,902
Can we talk another time?

372
00:21:35,023 --> 00:21:36,662
How can you do this to Tian?!

373
00:21:37,343 --> 00:21:39,222
How can you sell Tian to that scumbag?!

374
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:42,462
Tian didn't mind.

375
00:21:43,103 --> 00:21:44,422
So why should you?!

376
00:21:48,623 --> 00:21:49,262
Lak!

377
00:21:52,663 --> 00:21:53,342
What is going on?!

378
00:21:53,943 --> 00:21:54,702
Lak!

379
00:21:55,743 --> 00:21:56,182
Rome!

380
00:21:57,223 --> 00:21:58,142
What the hell?!

381
00:21:58,783 --> 00:22:00,862
You guys are brothers! Is it good to be punching each other like this?!

382
00:22:00,943 --> 00:22:03,862
I don't consider a heartless person like this as my brother!

383
00:22:04,303 --> 00:22:05,142
Mr, Lak.

384
00:22:05,503 --> 00:22:06,982
Don't be aggressive to Boss.

385
00:22:07,303 --> 00:22:09,702
You are being sent to pay off his debt to Kula chart.

386
00:22:09,783 --> 00:22:12,382
Do you not realize Rome is sending you to hell?!

387
00:22:14,543 --> 00:22:16,542
If it's what Boss has decided already

388
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:18,982
whether it be hell or heaven,

389
00:22:19,503 --> 00:22:20,422
I will go.

390
00:22:35,023 --> 00:22:35,622
Dad.

391
00:22:41,263 --> 00:22:43,222
Please explain to me

392
00:22:43,623 --> 00:22:44,982
what is really going on here

393
00:22:46,983 --> 00:22:49,342
I defeated Rome once again.

394
00:22:49,383 --> 00:22:50,502
What's there to explain?

395
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:54,622
He had to come begging for my help

396
00:22:55,023 --> 00:22:56,822
Plus he gave Tian to Chart.

397
00:22:57,783 --> 00:22:58,622
Right now,

398
00:22:58,943 --> 00:23:00,982
whatever I order,he must obey

399
00:23:02,063 --> 00:23:03,222
You did everything

400
00:23:03,903 --> 00:23:06,102
just to defeat Rome.

401
00:23:06,623 --> 00:23:07,342
Well,

402
00:23:07,343 --> 00:23:08,342
that's right.

403
00:23:08,543 --> 00:23:10,502
Don't you adore Tian?

404
00:23:10,703 --> 00:23:12,622
Chart also love s Tian.

405
00:23:12,743 --> 00:23:15,862
Are you not satisfied that Tian will become your daughter in law?

406
00:23:23,383 --> 00:23:24,382
j promise

407
00:23:24,823 --> 00:23:26,862
I won't disappoint you two again

408
00:23:28,383 --> 00:23:30,342
Tian is like the light of dharma

409
00:23:31,303 --> 00:23:33,542
Leading me out of this dark tunnel

410
00:23:34,623 --> 00:23:35,702
From now on,

411
00:23:36,143 --> 00:23:37,342
I will be a new person.

412
00:23:46,783 --> 00:23:47,302
Tian.

413
00:23:49,743 --> 00:23:50,622
What is it?

414
00:23:51,023 --> 00:23:52,022
Come with me right now

415
00:23:52,263 --> 00:23:52,782
Come.

416
00:24:05,303 --> 00:24:06,742
Where are you taking me?

417
00:24:07,983 --> 00:24:09,702
Escaping this place

418
00:24:10,223 --> 00:24:11,742
Far away from everyone.

419
00:24:12,503 --> 00:24:14,342
I won't let you become a victim.

420
00:24:15,023 --> 00:24:16,062
What era are we in?

421
00:24:17,383 --> 00:24:18,462
Human traffickers.

422
00:24:19,943 --> 00:24:21,062
I told you

423
00:24:21,303 --> 00:24:22,542
I am willing to do it.

424
00:24:22,703 --> 00:24:24,262
I volunteered.

425
00:24:25,303 --> 00:24:26,342
Don't lie.

426
00:24:26,783 --> 00:24:28,822
I know you love and worship Rome.

427
00:24:29,903 --> 00:24:31,662
But you don't have to do this

428
00:24:34,943 --> 00:24:36,462
Stop the car.

429
00:24:37,303 --> 00:24:37,942
No.

430
00:24:38,383 --> 00:24:40,102
I will take you away from this place

431
00:24:41,903 --> 00:24:42,902
Stop the car.

432
00:25:03,783 --> 00:25:04,302
Tian!

433
00:25:08,623 --> 00:25:10,462
Your life is valuable

434
00:25:11,103 --> 00:25:14,622
You can't trade it with these people's nonsense.

435
00:25:15,223 --> 00:25:16,982
Boss is my benefactor.

436
00:25:17,743 --> 00:25:21,262
He's struggling right now and nobody can help him, so I have to help.

437
00:25:22,583 --> 00:25:24,862
Boss is your brother.

438
00:25:25,343 --> 00:25:27,742
But you were badmouthing and criticizing him.

439
00:25:28,423 --> 00:25:29,542
Instead of helping him

440
00:25:30,263 --> 00:25:31,982
That's called ungrateful.
77777777777

441
00:25:32,943 --> 00:25:35,302
But this isn't the way to resolve the problem

442
00:25:35,503 --> 00:25:38,062
There are other ways to do it Tian

443
00:25:38,823 --> 00:25:39,542
If there is,

444
00:25:40,143 --> 00:25:41,782
you think Boss wouldn't do it?

445
00:25:43,263 --> 00:25:44,662
You should already know

446
00:25:44,903 --> 00:25:47,262
how much Boss loves his frozen seafood factory

447
00:25:48,263 --> 00:25:50,782
Can you really stand to let Boss lose it?

448
00:25:53,983 --> 00:25:55,942
This wedding isn't even enough

449
00:25:56,903 --> 00:25:58,862
compared to how much gratitude he has over me.

450
00:26:00,783 --> 00:26:02,862
Even if Boss asked for my life,

451
00:26:03,783 --> 00:26:04,862
I can give it to him.

452
00:26:07,063 --> 00:26:08,342
Therefore I am begging you.

453
00:26:10,143 --> 00:26:12,342
Don't try and stop me.

454
00:26:15,583 --> 00:26:17,662
Both their phones are in their rooms

455
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:19,942
They probably didn't have time to take anything.

456
00:26:20,783 --> 00:26:22,542
Lak would never do that.

457
00:26:23,463 --> 00:26:25,022
I saw with my own eyes.

458
00:26:25,623 --> 00:26:28,622
Why didn't they inform anyone where they were going late like this?

459
00:26:29,383 --> 00:26:31,302
He just took her in the car.

460
00:26:32,463 --> 00:26:35,102
I think he ran away with her

461
00:26:35,423 --> 00:26:37,342
It's not just Lak that wants to help her escape.

462
00:26:38,623 --> 00:26:40,182
I want to too.

463
00:26:40,943 --> 00:26:41,982
What are you saying?

464
00:26:48,703 --> 00:26:49,302
Rome.

465
00:26:53,863 --> 00:26:55,062
Calm down!

466
00:26:56,623 --> 00:26:57,182
Rome!

467
00:26:57,623 --> 00:26:58,822
What the hell are you gonna do?!

468
00:26:58,943 --> 00:26:59,702
Let me go!

469
00:27:04,903 --> 00:27:05,422
Lak.

470
00:27:06,463 --> 00:27:07,302
Boss!

471
00:27:07,343 --> 00:27:07,862
-Boss!
Rome!

472
00:27:07,863 --> 00:27:08,622
Tian, move!

473
00:27:09,063 --> 00:27:10,302
How can you do this to me?!

474
00:27:10,623 --> 00:27:11,382
I'm sorry!

475
00:27:11,423 --> 00:27:12,262
You're sorry?!

476
00:27:12,343 --> 00:27:14,542
You think by taking Tian away.
it will help resolve things?!

477
00:27:15,983 --> 00:27:17,382
Can you not meddle in my business?

478
00:27:18,743 --> 00:27:19,622
Boss.

479
00:27:20,103 --> 00:27:21,542
Please forgive Mr, Lak.

480
00:27:22,303 --> 00:27:24,342
I explained everything to him already.

481
00:27:25,503 --> 00:27:26,062
Okay?

482
00:27:34,503 --> 00:27:35,622
I was impulsive.

483
00:27:36,423 --> 00:27:38,022
But I pity Tian!

484
00:27:38,703 --> 00:27:40,262
Is there no other way

485
00:27:40,663 --> 00:27:42,742
besides having Tian marry Kula chart?!

486
00:27:42,983 --> 00:27:44,542
I am the ruler of this house.

487
00:27:46,463 --> 00:27:47,702
I am your brother.

488
00:27:50,223 --> 00:27:51,422
Everything I am doing

489
00:27:53,103 --> 00:27:54,022
has a reason.

490
00:27:54,303 --> 00:27:55,182
You have to trust me

491
00:27:59,543 --> 00:28:00,502
Boss.

492
00:28:08,263 --> 00:28:11,022
Who did Mr, Lak said you're going to marry?

493
00:28:14,103 --> 00:28:14,902
Really?

494
00:28:15,983 --> 00:28:17,782
Tian is willing to marry Kula chart?

495
00:28:18,783 --> 00:28:21,742
Are you sure Ka molt at?

496
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:26,422
Okay.

497
00:28:27,023 --> 00:28:29,622
I will organize the wedding.

498
00:28:29,983 --> 00:28:31,782
Thank you so much for calling.

499
00:28:33,623 --> 00:28:33,982
Yes.

500
00:29:20,743 --> 00:29:21,262
I can't sleep.

501
00:29:24,903 --> 00:29:26,222
Me too.

502
00:29:36,343 --> 00:29:38,342
You're not curious why I --

503
00:29:38,383 --> 00:29:40,142
You don't have to explain anything

504
00:29:41,943 --> 00:29:44,382
Anything you deem appropriate

505
00:29:47,943 --> 00:29:49,582
J agree with you as well.

506
00:29:58,743 --> 00:29:59,502
Thank you.

507
00:30:04,663 --> 00:30:05,382
Go to bed.

508
00:30:45,703 --> 00:30:47,782
Can I not go Pa?

509
00:30:47,983 --> 00:30:49,822
I can wear anything.

510
00:30:51,223 --> 00:30:53,542
Rome promised them that you will go.

511
00:30:53,903 --> 00:30:56,142
Besides, Mr s. P itplern will be there with you.

512
00:30:57,783 --> 00:31:00,142
If it's Boss's order then lll go

513
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:03,062
At least you will accompany me.

514
00:31:11,983 --> 00:31:13,302
61558

515
00:31:16,383 --> 00:31:18,342
Hello big sister!

516
00:31:21,383 --> 00:31:22,182
Hello.

517
00:31:39,783 --> 00:31:40,422
After you.

518
00:31:52,223 --> 00:31:53,182
Thank you.

519
00:31:55,943 --> 00:31:56,582
Ms. Mon.

520
00:31:56,823 --> 00:31:58,702
Morning Tian.

521
00:32:02,663 --> 00:32:03,782
Why are you here?

522
00:32:05,663 --> 00:32:09,182
Ms. Mont ira is organizing the wedding.

523
00:32:10,343 --> 00:32:11,582
Our wedding will be amazing.

524
00:32:12,103 --> 00:32:13,182
I assure you babe.

525
00:32:14,503 --> 00:32:16,222
I've prepared everything

526
00:32:16,303 --> 00:32:17,262
Let'sgo

527
00:32:17,383 --> 00:32:18,062
Tian.

528
00:32:19,783 --> 00:32:20,862
You will look pretty.

529
00:32:21,063 --> 00:32:21,902
Please.

530
00:32:26,423 --> 00:32:27,142
Here.

531
00:32:27,223 --> 00:32:32,022
This is the haute couture runway wedding dress of this season.

532
00:32:32,463 --> 00:32:34,262
If you like off-shoulder style,

533
00:32:34,263 --> 00:32:36,142
I think this one is pretty.

534
00:32:36,343 --> 00:32:37,182
Or...

535
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:41,542
if you like lace then this one is beautiful.

536
00:32:41,823 --> 00:32:43,102
Or...

537
00:32:43,223 --> 00:32:44,262
do you want.

538
00:32:45,183 --> 00:32:47,702
What professionals would choose a wedding dress via a catalog

539
00:32:48,023 --> 00:32:49,502
instead of trying it on at a shop?

540
00:32:51,343 --> 00:32:55,102
I remember Tian's size from the first fitting

541
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,582
Don't worry about the shop

542
00:32:57,703 --> 00:32:59,862
I am using one of the tops of the country.

543
00:33:02,143 --> 00:33:04,222
Let'stake a break and have some snacks

544
00:33:04,263 --> 00:33:06,342
The cake from this shop is very delicious.

545
00:33:16,423 --> 00:33:17,102
I'm sorry!

546
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:21,102
You're so clumsy son.

547
00:33:21,783 --> 00:33:22,542
Tian.

548
00:33:23,023 --> 00:33:26,142
Why don't you use the restroom and wash up?

549
00:33:26,503 --> 00:33:27,742
I'll take her.

550
00:33:27,783 --> 00:33:28,142
Come.

551
00:33:29,583 --> 00:33:30,942
You don't have to go Pa.

552
00:33:30,983 --> 00:33:32,462
Stay here with Mr s. P itplern.

553
00:33:33,063 --> 00:33:33,982
Let's go Tian.

554
00:33:34,423 --> 00:33:35,982
You're all dirty now.

555
00:33:37,543 --> 00:33:38,582
Let's get you cleaned up

556
00:33:40,983 --> 00:33:43,022
Look at you. So dirty!

557
00:33:43,503 --> 00:33:45,502
Let's use tissue to clean you up.

558
00:33:45,543 --> 00:33:47,582
That's okay, I can do it myself.

559
00:33:48,423 --> 00:33:49,142
You can't.

560
00:33:49,143 --> 00:33:50,862
I have to look after my pretty bride.

561
00:33:50,983 --> 00:33:52,942
Or else Rome will be very mad at me.

562
00:33:53,503 --> 00:33:55,542
That won't come off. Use this

563
00:34:01,663 --> 00:34:02,382
Oh my god!

564
00:34:02,423 --> 00:34:03,382
You're all wet now!

565
00:34:03,423 --> 00:34:04,422
I'm sorry!

566
00:34:04,463 --> 00:34:05,382
What happened?!

567
00:34:06,063 --> 00:34:08,062
Why did you come in?! Go wait outside!

568
00:34:08,663 --> 00:34:10,462
I left the water on too long.

569
00:34:10,543 --> 00:34:13,862
You're all wet now. You have to change Tian

570
00:34:13,943 --> 00:34:15,822
Kula chart, take her to get changed.

571
00:34:16,743 --> 00:34:17,622
Go.

572
00:34:19,183 --> 00:34:20,182
This is the guest room

573
00:34:20,543 --> 00:34:21,622
Dad made it for guests.

574
00:34:22,103 --> 00:34:23,942
There are men and women clothes for you to change into.

575
00:34:24,783 --> 00:34:25,902
But the style is plain

576
00:34:26,503 --> 00:34:27,742
If you don't like it,

577
00:34:27,903 --> 00:34:29,902
I will go buy you some brand names for you.

578
00:34:30,543 --> 00:34:32,262
No need. I can wear whatever

579
00:34:32,583 --> 00:34:33,742
Go wait outside

580
00:34:44,663 --> 00:34:46,862
You don't have to stay and help me.

581
00:34:47,343 --> 00:34:48,702
You can go wait outside

582
00:34:50,303 --> 00:34:54,062
You don't think I pranked you, did you?

583
00:34:54,263 --> 00:34:55,262
No.

584
00:34:55,623 --> 00:34:56,822
Why would you do that?

585
00:34:58,223 --> 00:35:00,062
I'll wait downstairs then.

586
00:35:00,063 --> 00:35:00,862
Okay.

587
00:35:17,983 --> 00:35:18,582
You're done?

588
00:35:18,623 --> 00:35:19,262
That was fast.

589
00:35:19,583 --> 00:35:20,262
Not yet.

590
00:35:20,823 --> 00:35:22,502
I left Tian for you.

591
00:35:22,663 --> 00:35:24,382
Do whatever you want with her.

592
00:35:24,503 --> 00:35:26,182
Thank you sis!

593
00:35:27,423 --> 00:35:28,542
You're awesome Ms. Mon.

594
00:35:29,023 --> 00:35:31,462
I'll tell you it's going to be sweet!

595
00:35:35,223 --> 00:35:37,622
When did Mont ira become close with your family?

596
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:41,462
I wouldn't say close.

597
00:35:42,023 --> 00:35:44,702
I met her a few times.

598
00:35:45,383 --> 00:35:48,422
But I think she's doing business with Ka molt at.

599
00:35:49,743 --> 00:35:50,382
No wonder,

600
00:35:50,783 --> 00:35:53,982
people with the same mindset would get along really quickly.

601
00:35:54,383 --> 00:35:55,262
Pa.

602
00:35:55,863 --> 00:35:57,502
Just let bygones

603
00:35:58,463 --> 00:36:00,022
be bygones

604
00:36:01,263 --> 00:36:02,102
It's you guys

605
00:36:02,343 --> 00:36:03,822
that won't stop bothering our family,

606
00:36:04,183 --> 00:36:05,422
won't stop bothering Rome

607
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:07,822
Rome going bankrupt wasn't enough.

608
00:36:08,183 --> 00:36:10,022
Your husband had to destroy him

609
00:36:10,303 --> 00:36:13,262
that he had no option but to give Tian to your son.

610
00:36:13,823 --> 00:36:14,622
Destroy?

611
00:36:15,223 --> 00:36:16,182
Hurt Rome?

612
00:36:17,743 --> 00:36:19,102
What did Ka molt at do?

613
00:36:20,423 --> 00:36:22,702
J will believe that you don't know about it.

614
00:36:23,023 --> 00:36:24,542
But even if you did, l it's not strange.

615
00:36:24,623 --> 00:36:27,782
You and Ka molt at are the same people right now.

616
00:36:46,823 --> 00:36:47,542
Tian!

617
00:36:48,063 --> 00:36:49,022
Where are you Tian?!

618
00:36:51,303 --> 00:36:52,542
Tian left already.

619
00:36:53,223 --> 00:36:54,542
I didn't see anyone.

620
00:36:56,063 --> 00:36:59,942
I think Tian left the bathroom a long time ago

621
00:37:00,023 --> 00:37:02,742
Or maybe Chart took her around to see the house

622
00:37:03,943 --> 00:37:06,382
But I don't think they went upstairs though

623
00:37:06,423 --> 00:37:09,222
Do you want to check the backyard?

624
00:37:10,303 --> 00:37:10,702
Let's go.

625
00:37:10,903 --> 00:37:12,302
Let'sgo check the backyard

626
00:37:54,143 --> 00:37:56,262
Tian!

627
00:38:07,143 --> 00:38:07,942
Serves you right!

628
00:38:10,103 --> 00:38:11,062
Tian!

629
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:08,342
Factory land title deed of Rome Pak an ant to guarantee a loan

630
00:39:20,103 --> 00:39:21,422
Tian!

631
00:39:31,063 --> 00:39:32,742
Why are you right here?

632
00:39:33,343 --> 00:39:36,662
I saw a book fell sol went to pick it up for you.

633
00:39:40,223 --> 00:39:42,182
Your clothes...

634
00:39:42,783 --> 00:39:46,942
The clothes I wore got wet so Kula chart gave me new clothes to change into.

635
00:39:47,703 --> 00:39:50,102
I'll was hit and bring it back

636
00:39:50,503 --> 00:39:50,982
Bye.

637
00:39:51,903 --> 00:39:52,982
Wait Tian!

638
00:39:53,103 --> 00:39:54,222
Where's Kula chart?!

639
00:39:54,223 --> 00:39:54,822
Mom.

640
00:39:56,783 --> 00:39:57,622
Kula chart.

641
00:39:58,703 --> 00:40:00,262
What happened to you?

642
00:40:02,183 --> 00:40:03,222
I slipped and fell.

643
00:40:05,343 --> 00:40:07,822
Bad people are bad til the very end

644
00:40:08,583 --> 00:40:10,702
You should have kicked his balls

645
00:40:10,703 --> 00:40:12,462
So he can be sterile and can't reproduce any more

646
00:40:13,223 --> 00:40:15,582
He'll be limping for a few days.

647
00:40:16,663 --> 00:40:18,142
Mont ira as well

648
00:40:18,343 --> 00:40:20,302
Pretending to be nice only to stab you in the back

649
00:40:20,943 --> 00:40:23,462
We need to tell Rome how bad these people are.

650
00:40:23,703 --> 00:40:25,782
How can he send you to go live with them?

651
00:40:25,983 --> 00:40:26,982
Don't Pa.

652
00:40:27,503 --> 00:40:30,702
He's our creditor. He might just want to prank Boss, that's all.

653
00:40:32,303 --> 00:40:36,582
I saw the land title deed of Boss'sin K amol tat's room.

654
00:40:37,103 --> 00:40:37,822
What?

655
00:40:39,063 --> 00:40:42,222
That means Rome used the land title deed as collateral for the loan?

656
00:40:43,663 --> 00:40:44,462
No wonder

657
00:40:44,743 --> 00:40:46,342
Those people wouldn't help us for free

658
00:40:48,983 --> 00:40:50,182
That means

659
00:40:50,783 --> 00:40:53,142
if Boss can't pay Kamoltat back the money,

660
00:40:53,823 --> 00:40:55,582
he will take Boss'sl and?

661
00:41:01,943 --> 00:41:03,702
If I'm no longer here,

662
00:41:05,143 --> 00:41:07,062
can you look after Boss?

663
00:41:08,823 --> 00:41:09,942
No need to ask me.

664
00:41:10,383 --> 00:41:12,702
I will look after him

665
00:41:13,103 --> 00:41:14,182
because Rome

666
00:41:14,183 --> 00:41:15,822
has been mine since the beginning.

667
00:41:20,143 --> 00:41:21,982
You can't start any ceremony

668
00:41:22,823 --> 00:41:24,862
Kula chart can't marry anyone

669
00:41:25,543 --> 00:41:28,262
I'm his real wife.

670
00:41:29,303 --> 00:41:30,222
-Tian!
-Let go!

671
00:41:32,903 --> 00:41:33,702
You shameless boy!

672
00:41:34,463 --> 00:41:35,902
As for murder,

673
00:41:37,423 --> 00:41:38,982
I will be the witness

674
00:41:41,103 --> 00:41:41,622
Rome.

675
00:41:42,383 --> 00:41:43,222
Mara to my heart!

676
00:41:43,783 --> 00:41:44,982
