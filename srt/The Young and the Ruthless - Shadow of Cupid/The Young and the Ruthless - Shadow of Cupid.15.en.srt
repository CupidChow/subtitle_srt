and his son's wife.

23
00:01:37,423 --> 00:01:38,422
And yet still kills her

24
00:01:38,543 --> 00:01:40,622
I think you should stop for now.

25
00:01:41,623 --> 00:01:43,342
I still have my last card.

26
00:01:43,663 --> 00:01:44,262
One hundred thousand!

27
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:46,062
Where dol get that from?

28
00:01:47,303 --> 00:01:48,262
A hundred thousand?!

29
00:01:48,303 --> 00:01:50,182
I'm sorry Ms. Thip.

30
00:01:50,183 --> 00:01:52,582
-Fine.

31
00:01:53,503 --> 00:01:54,902
Then tell me

32
00:01:54,983 --> 00:01:57,022
what else have you told Mont ira.

33
00:01:57,103 --> 00:01:58,222
Mr, Lak.

34
00:01:58,223 --> 00:01:59,982
I think we should eat at this restaurant.

35
00:02:00,503 --> 00:02:03,462
You can order first. I want to use the restroom.

36
00:02:04,103 --> 00:02:04,742
Okay,

37
00:02:06,463 --> 00:02:07,542
How much do you want?

38
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:09,262
Can all of this be equal to one hundred thousand?

39
00:02:09,263 --> 00:02:11,342
One hundred thousand is fine Let's go with that.

40
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:13,342
Ms. Gigi b

41
00:02:15,303 --> 00:02:16,222
Thank you so much.

42
00:02:16,423 --> 00:02:19,102
Tian sold her purse and watch?

43
00:02:19,143 --> 00:02:20,662
She looked desperate

44
00:02:20,783 --> 00:02:22,262
She said she needed the money today.

45
00:02:22,663 --> 00:02:23,822
Thank you so much

46
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:26,742
You made me feel a little better

47
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:35,662
I need to talk to you Ms. Mon

48
00:02:37,103 --> 00:02:37,702
Sure.

49
00:02:43,703 --> 00:02:45,662
I know that you hired Je ab

50
00:02:46,063 --> 00:02:48,622
to report to you about the activities happening in this house.

51
00:02:51,023 --> 00:02:52,382
...

52
00:02:52,423 --> 00:02:53,422
Don't worry.

53
00:02:54,303 --> 00:02:56,342
Mr. Rome won't find out about this.

54
00:02:57,103 --> 00:02:58,462
I understand that

55
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:01,462
you are probably thinking the same like me.

56
00:03:02,023 --> 00:03:04,782
Being uncomfortable of Tian's behavior.

57
00:03:06,383 --> 00:03:08,262
Ever since that kid came into this house,

58
00:03:08,543 --> 00:03:10,222
there's always problems.

59
00:03:10,543 --> 00:03:12,862
Mr. Rome almost died

60
00:03:13,383 --> 00:03:14,982
In front of us, she acts weak.

61
00:03:15,383 --> 00:03:18,062
But behind closed doors,she acts like the lady boss of the boss.

62
00:03:18,703 --> 00:03:20,262
I can't stand her.

63
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:23,582
Is that so?

64
00:03:25,023 --> 00:03:26,342
I'll be honest.

65
00:03:26,543 --> 00:03:29,182
At first, I was curious

66
00:03:29,463 --> 00:03:35,342
But after seeing Rome treat her like she's fragile and innocent

67
00:03:35,703 --> 00:03:38,382
always protecting and pleasing her,

68
00:03:39,063 --> 00:03:43,222
I was unsure and asked Je ab to keep an,eye out for me

69
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:47,702
I think Mr. Rome is being deceived by this kid right now.

70
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:52,502
Watch this clip

71
00:03:53,063 --> 00:03:54,102
Then you'll understand

72
00:03:55,823 --> 00:03:56,342
Sure.

73
00:04:00,183 --> 00:04:01,502
Who is this man?

74
00:04:03,023 --> 00:04:04,502
I don't know either.

75
00:04:04,823 --> 00:04:06,582
But judging from his looks

76
00:04:06,783 --> 00:04:08,462
he's not her classmate from overseas.

77
00:04:11,103 --> 00:04:14,022
Why don't you tell Rome yourself?

78
00:04:15,863 --> 00:04:17,302
My words

79
00:04:17,703 --> 00:04:19,742
won't mean much.

80
00:04:20,103 --> 00:04:23,022
Perhaps I might even get fired!

81
00:04:24,103 --> 00:04:25,942
Mr, Rome believes everything that girl says

82
00:04:27,143 --> 00:04:29,422
But if you tell him,

83
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,862
maybe he will believe you.

84
00:04:32,543 --> 00:04:35,422
You were once his lover.

85
00:04:38,983 --> 00:04:41,302
I found this paper in Tian'sroom

86
00:04:45,863 --> 00:04:49,622
The hopes of making this house peaceful again

87
00:04:50,263 --> 00:04:51,702
is on you.

88
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:55,422
Chan!

89
00:05:20,623 --> 00:05:21,262
Hello?

90
00:05:22,103 --> 00:05:22,582
Huh?

91
00:05:23,463 --> 00:05:24,942
What? Speakup. I can't hear you.

92
00:05:26,863 --> 00:05:27,942
It's me Tian.

93
00:05:28,623 --> 00:05:29,542
Oh Tian?

94
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:30,862
What's up?

95
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:32,822
You got the money?

96
00:05:33,903 --> 00:05:34,422
What?

97
00:05:35,143 --> 00:05:37,382
I asked if you got the money yet?

98
00:05:38,183 --> 00:05:39,542
Yeah I got it.

99
00:05:40,463 --> 00:05:41,182
Good job.

100
00:05:41,863 --> 00:05:43,622
Now that's what you call true love.

101
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:46,662
Meet me at the neighborhood park tomorrow.

102
00:05:47,503 --> 00:05:48,022
Hello?

103
00:05:53,223 --> 00:05:53,982
Tian.

104
00:05:54,423 --> 00:05:55,342
You parasite

105
00:05:55,663 --> 00:05:57,582
You're really bad.

106
00:06:33,903 --> 00:06:34,422
Hello?

107
00:06:34,983 --> 00:06:35,862
Hello Chan.

108
00:06:36,343 --> 00:06:37,822
Now I can hear you better.

109
00:06:38,143 --> 00:06:40,022
I didn't hear you earlier.

110
00:06:40,063 --> 00:06:43,342
So are you clear that we're meeting up at the neighborhood park tomorrow?

111
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,142
You called earlier?

112
00:06:45,623 --> 00:06:46,822
You called me.

113
00:06:47,623 --> 00:06:49,582
So, did you get the money?

114
00:06:50,063 --> 00:06:51,382
I didn't call you.

115
00:06:51,823 --> 00:06:54,022
I wanted to tell you l got the money and see you at the park.

116
00:06:54,703 --> 00:06:55,582
Yeah.

117
00:07:04,303 --> 00:07:06,102
Please let Boss wake up late!

118
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,902
When my friend told me,

119
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:20,022
I didn't want to believe lit.

120
00:07:20,463 --> 00:07:21,782
But if it's not true,

121
00:07:21,863 --> 00:07:25,702
how did my friend ended up with the purse and watch?

122
00:07:26,503 --> 00:07:27,902
Tian went with Lak?

123
00:07:28,623 --> 00:07:30,222
She went there alone.

124
00:07:30,663 --> 00:07:32,062
Lak probably doesn't know.

125
00:07:32,343 --> 00:07:35,582
If he knew Tian was giving money to a guy, he would have stopped her

126
00:07:36,063 --> 00:07:37,142
I still don't believe

127
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,182
that Tian would do that.

128
00:07:40,343 --> 00:07:42,822
Then you must prove it.

129
00:08:08,143 --> 00:08:09,982
Rome, get in the car!

130
00:08:10,663 --> 00:08:12,022
You're here too?

131
00:08:12,463 --> 00:08:16,542
Yes. I'm worried about Tian too. Get in

132
00:08:22,423 --> 00:08:23,542
Gosh sis.

133
00:08:23,783 --> 00:08:25,262
You're punctual.

134
00:08:27,823 --> 00:08:29,222
You have to swear to me

135
00:08:29,983 --> 00:08:32,902
that you won't mess with Boss anymore after you take this money.

136
00:08:33,383 --> 00:08:35,502
Yeah! Why are you pestering me?!

137
00:08:35,543 --> 00:08:37,462
Just swear to me first!

138
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:38,302
Yeah!

139
00:08:38,623 --> 00:08:39,782
I swear!

140
00:08:44,623 --> 00:08:45,342
Is this all of it?

141
00:08:48,663 --> 00:08:50,142
Stay calm Rome.

142
00:08:58,703 --> 00:08:59,622
Stop Boss!

143
00:08:59,863 --> 00:09:00,782
Calm down!

144
00:09:01,463 --> 00:09:02,422
How could you do this?

145
00:09:03,023 --> 00:09:04,542
You stole some things and went to sell it.

146
00:09:04,783 --> 00:09:05,862
And gave him the money?!

147
00:09:06,263 --> 00:09:07,022
Who is he?!

148
00:09:08,623 --> 00:09:10,862
Talk nicely! Why do you have to get violent?!

149
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,542
Hey, you're gonna talk back?

150
00:09:13,663 --> 00:09:16,782
How fortunate that ll didn't call

151
00:09:17,183 --> 00:09:17,982
Answer us.

152
00:09:18,703 --> 00:09:20,822
What's your relationship to Tian?

153
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:21,782
Auntie.

154
00:09:21,783 --> 00:09:22,102
00

155
00:09:22,143 --> 00:09:24,062
I'm Tian's brother.

156
00:09:24,623 --> 00:09:26,062
She owes me a debt of gratitude.

157
00:09:26,623 --> 00:09:27,382
Ask her.

158
00:09:27,823 --> 00:09:28,662
Brother?!

159
00:09:31,623 --> 00:09:33,062
Go home Mon.

160
00:09:33,663 --> 00:09:34,542
Chan, Tian.

161
00:09:36,063 --> 00:09:40,702
Come with me.

162
00:09:46,703 --> 00:09:47,742
How did it go?

163
00:09:47,943 --> 00:09:48,862
Did you guys catch them in the act?

164
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:53,662
Was that guy Tian's boyfriend?

165
00:09:54,903 --> 00:09:56,582
What boyfriend?

166
00:09:56,703 --> 00:09:58,462
He's Tian's brother.

167
00:09:58,503 --> 00:10:00,182
Rome knows him.

168
00:10:01,223 --> 00:10:03,422
But Rome told me to come back

169
00:10:03,783 --> 00:10:06,502
and I don't know where those three went.

170
00:10:08,103 --> 00:10:10,862
She brought her brother here?

171
00:10:11,223 --> 00:10:12,022
Soon,

172
00:10:12,383 --> 00:10:15,062
will she not bring her delinquent'relatives?

173
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:16,662
What?

174
00:10:17,143 --> 00:10:18,342
Delinquent relatives?

175
00:10:19,903 --> 00:10:21,502
Isn't Tian from England?

176
00:10:23,063 --> 00:10:25,702
Those bastards of kids Ms. Mon.

177
00:10:26,023 --> 00:10:27,542
You've met them before

178
00:10:27,663 --> 00:10:30,262
They came to Mr Rome's house in Ranong on the first day.

179
00:10:30,983 --> 00:10:31,542
Fine.

180
00:10:31,823 --> 00:10:32,862
I'll leave.

181
00:10:33,303 --> 00:10:35,502
I'll see you later, Auntie!

182
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:43,702
13

183
00:10:44,823 --> 00:10:45,782
Who came now?

184
00:10:47,383 --> 00:10:48,542
Who are you here to see?

185
00:10:49,903 --> 00:10:51,222
came to see Rome

186
00:10:51,783 --> 00:10:53,702
My name is Mont ira, Rome's girlfriend

187
00:10:54,023 --> 00:10:55,262
Oh.

188
00:10:56,503 --> 00:10:58,622
Those kids are Tian's relatives?

189
00:11:02,303 --> 00:11:03,222
Ms. Thip.

190
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,142
Whatever you know,

191
00:11:05,223 --> 00:11:06,862
tell me everything.

192
00:11:09,463 --> 00:11:10,382
Boss.

193
00:11:10,383 --> 00:11:11,582
I gave you money already

194
00:11:11,823 --> 00:11:13,182
Why are you asking more from Tian?

195
00:11:14,143 --> 00:11:14,782
Boss!

196
00:11:16,143 --> 00:11:17,542
Please don't hurt Chan.

197
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,262
I'm begging you.

198
00:11:20,383 --> 00:11:22,742
Maybe he is struggling that's why he came to see me.

199
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:24,502
That's right.

200
00:11:24,863 --> 00:11:26,502
I just came to rely on..

201
00:11:26,943 --> 00:11:28,062
you and Tian.

202
00:11:29,223 --> 00:11:30,622
I fought through life

203
00:11:31,423 --> 00:11:32,502
but life fought back

204
00:11:33,383 --> 00:11:34,782
Ever since Tian came here with you,

205
00:11:35,183 --> 00:11:37,342
Ive been hunted by those loan sharks.

206
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:38,902
I can't get any job.

207
00:11:40,023 --> 00:11:41,262
I had to move houses.

208
00:11:41,823 --> 00:11:44,022
I went to ask for jobs but no one wanted to hire me.

209
00:11:45,383 --> 00:11:46,582
Sol had to come

210
00:11:47,303 --> 00:11:48,742
see you and Tian

211
00:11:50,663 --> 00:11:50,982
Fine.

212
00:11:52,463 --> 00:11:53,862
will hire you.

213
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:55,902
Tian!

214
00:11:56,743 --> 00:11:58,662
J wasn't wrong at all

215
00:11:58,863 --> 00:12:00,262
I can rely on you.

216
00:12:01,423 --> 00:12:03,102
From now on the two of us

217
00:12:03,103 --> 00:12:04,502
can be together again.

218
00:12:05,783 --> 00:12:08,102
I'll go pick up Aor from our motel.

219
00:12:08,703 --> 00:12:10,102
She will be thrilled

220
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,822
to come work in a big mansion

221
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,422
with you and Boss.

222
00:12:15,183 --> 00:12:15,982
Don't misunderstand.

223
00:12:18,223 --> 00:12:19,902
I im not hiring you to come work here

224
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:28,342
Ranong?

225
00:12:28,423 --> 00:12:29,982
What does he want you to do back there?

226
00:12:30,463 --> 00:12:32,862
Work at the frozen seafood factory.

227
00:12:33,463 --> 00:12:34,262
And you're...

228
00:12:34,423 --> 00:12:35,942
really gonna go work there?

229
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:39,182
Why are you so stupid?!

230
00:12:39,823 --> 00:12:41,502
Why should I tire myself out?!

231
00:12:42,343 --> 00:12:43,502
As of now,

232
00:12:44,143 --> 00:12:45,742
Tian already gave me the money

233
00:12:46,663 --> 00:12:48,102
I will take the money to invest

234
00:12:49,663 --> 00:12:50,302
Look!

235
00:12:51,383 --> 00:12:52,102
Money!

236
00:12:58,103 --> 00:12:59,302
I will send people down there.

237
00:12:59,503 --> 00:13:00,342
Please look after them.

238
00:13:01,343 --> 00:13:02,982
It's Chan and his wife.

239
00:13:03,463 --> 00:13:04,782
Have them start with a small task first.

240
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:06,022
Okay.

241
00:13:10,703 --> 00:13:12,822
I'm really sorry

242
00:13:13,423 --> 00:13:15,382
for troubling you about Chan.

243
00:13:17,623 --> 00:13:19,022
It won't be this troubling

244
00:13:19,903 --> 00:13:21,742
if you had told me the truth from the beginning.

245
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,182
And not do things behind my back like this

246
00:13:26,383 --> 00:13:26,742
Well,

247
00:13:27,543 --> 00:13:30,662
I didn't want Chan to go and bother you.

248
00:13:31,743 --> 00:13:32,502
Look what happened

249
00:13:33,943 --> 00:13:36,422
Do you know how things have escalated?

250
00:13:36,863 --> 00:13:38,702
Right now there How did it go

251
00:13:41,343 --> 00:13:43,342
Did everything go well?

252
00:13:43,743 --> 00:13:44,702
Jeez.

253
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:48,622
Why didn't you tell us your brother was visiting Tian?

254
00:13:48,623 --> 00:13:50,702
I got scared.

255
00:13:56,983 --> 00:13:58,342
Did Tian's brother

256
00:13:58,623 --> 00:14:00,782
come from overseas like Tian?

257
00:14:01,223 --> 00:14:03,102
But from the looks of it,

258
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,862
he came from the countryside instead

259
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:07,062
Enough Mon.

260
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:10,542
won't say much.

261
00:14:12,983 --> 00:14:13,982
But I'll ask for one thing

262
00:14:16,783 --> 00:14:17,182
Don't tell anyone

263
00:14:18,183 --> 00:14:18,662
about Chan.

264
00:14:22,663 --> 00:14:24,822
Including Tian's situation?

265
00:14:28,023 --> 00:14:29,262
From the looks of it

266
00:14:29,783 --> 00:14:33,142
you're not by any way related to Tian

267
00:14:35,463 --> 00:14:36,862
Just tell me the truth

268
00:14:41,703 --> 00:14:43,582
I have an important reason for doing this.

269
00:14:47,343 --> 00:14:48,502
For the sake of our friendship

270
00:14:49,823 --> 00:14:51,422
feelings we once had for each other.

271
00:14:57,143 --> 00:14:59,062
Are you wearing the necklace I bought for you?

272
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:02,302
No.

273
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:04,062
ou remember?

274
00:15:04,463 --> 00:15:06,382
I thought you only remember things about Tian

275
00:15:09,183 --> 00:15:09,862
think it suits you very much.

276
00:15:25,303 --> 00:15:26,182
Then...

277
00:15:27,063 --> 00:15:27,822
can you put it on for me?

278
00:15:53,943 --> 00:15:54,702
Well?

279
00:15:55,063 --> 00:15:55,862
Is it pretty?

280
00:15:56,783 --> 00:15:58,382
The more it's with someone that's worthy.

281
00:15:59,823 --> 00:16:00,742
the prettier it is.

282
00:16:02,983 --> 00:16:04,662
Thank you so much

283
00:16:09,063 --> 00:16:10,262
About Tian...

284
00:16:11,463 --> 00:16:13,102
Can trust you right?

285
00:16:14,503 --> 00:16:15,382
hope

286
00:16:16,623 --> 00:16:18,502
taking Tian under your care,

287
00:16:19,623 --> 00:16:21,622
you won't fall in love with her.

288
00:16:27,623 --> 00:16:28,262
No.

289
00:16:30,343 --> 00:16:31,702
t'sprobably impossible

290
00:16:33,463 --> 00:16:35,302
Then you can trust me.

291
00:16:36,343 --> 00:16:37,302
Because

292
00:16:37,983 --> 00:16:39,582
will do everything for you.

293
00:16:48,743 --> 00:16:50,022
Why are you in my office?

294
00:16:50,823 --> 00:16:51,622
What do you want?

295
00:16:53,423 --> 00:16:55,702
Are you getting back together with Mon?

296
00:17:00,383 --> 00:17:01,102
You won't answer,

297
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:02,742
that means you are dating her

298
00:17:05,383 --> 00:17:06,462
Whoever I date

299
00:17:07,303 --> 00:17:08,302
is none of your business.

300
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:11,702
It is my business.

301
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,942
can be certain what I should do

302
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,662
from here on out.

303
00:17:18,263 --> 00:17:19,262
What are you gonna do?

304
00:17:21,183 --> 00:17:22,462
Whatever I do

305
00:17:22,823 --> 00:17:24,222
is none of your business.

306
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:43,942
We have to rely on your prestige Father

307
00:17:44,543 --> 00:17:46,502
to teach Kula chart.

308
00:17:46,703 --> 00:17:47,542
Kula chart.

309
00:17:48,103 --> 00:17:50,502
While you're here, you must hold the eight precepts.

310
00:17:50,943 --> 00:17:52,342
You must chant and pray.

311
00:17:52,623 --> 00:17:53,182
And...

312
00:17:53,423 --> 00:17:55,022
be able to ordain.

313
00:17:55,503 --> 00:17:56,022
Ordain?!

314
00:17:56,503 --> 00:17:57,102
Huh?!

315
00:17:58,263 --> 00:17:59,022
Yes.

316
00:17:59,543 --> 00:18:01,142
I want you to ordain

317
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,462
to discipline your mind.

318
00:18:04,423 --> 00:18:06,542
It's fine if you can only be here for a few days.

319
00:18:07,383 --> 00:18:09,502
That's up to your willfulness.

320
00:18:10,183 --> 00:18:11,102
Ordain?

321
00:18:11,263 --> 00:18:12,582
I'm not at that age yet.

322
00:18:13,943 --> 00:18:14,982
You tricked me.

323
00:18:15,383 --> 00:18:17,462
I thought we are just here to pay respect to the monk?

324
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:19,382
Alright.

325
00:18:19,983 --> 00:18:21,102
I won't force you.

326
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:24,462
Just practice meditating is good enough

327
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:25,422
No!

328
00:18:25,503 --> 00:18:26,782
I can do that at home.

329
00:18:26,983 --> 00:18:28,302
I can do that in the prayer room with you

330
00:18:28,343 --> 00:18:29,382
Let's go home Mom

331
00:18:29,863 --> 00:18:30,582
If you...

332
00:18:31,103 --> 00:18:33,382
won't stay and practice dhamma with Father here,

333
00:18:34,303 --> 00:18:36,262
then don't call me mom ever again

334
00:18:44,103 --> 00:18:45,822
Pit p lern is really smart.

335
00:18:46,463 --> 00:18:48,182
She convinced Chart to go stay at the temple

336
00:18:49,023 --> 00:18:51,862
Now when someone asks,we can say he turned a new leaf.

337
00:18:53,783 --> 00:18:54,622
That's good.

338
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:57,222
He won't cause any more trouble

339
00:18:59,623 --> 00:19:00,502
But right now

340
00:19:01,023 --> 00:19:03,462
my hands are itchy.

341
00:19:04,183 --> 00:19:05,462
I want to get back at Rome.

342
00:19:06,863 --> 00:19:07,902
What should I do Pat?

343
00:19:09,463 --> 00:19:10,302
I think

344
00:19:11,263 --> 00:19:12,622
we should be patient for now.

345
00:19:13,423 --> 00:19:15,822
Napa's case is still active right now.

346
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,782
I don't know how much the police will connect

347
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:19,942
As for Rome,

348
00:19:20,143 --> 00:19:21,782
his reputation is quite ruined

349
00:19:22,863 --> 00:19:23,662
I think

350
00:19:24,383 --> 00:19:26,022
we should wait for another opportunity.

351
00:19:26,903 --> 00:19:28,142
Yes. You're right

352
00:19:28,943 --> 00:19:30,422
In a few months

353
00:19:30,463 --> 00:19:33,262
Kula chart be of legal age.

354
00:19:33,383 --> 00:19:35,382
It will affect the will

355
00:19:36,263 --> 00:19:36,942
I think

356
00:19:37,623 --> 00:19:40,382
we should prepare a second plan just to be safe

357
00:19:59,223 --> 00:20:00,062
Ms. Mon.

358
00:20:00,903 --> 00:20:01,742
Hello.

359
00:20:04,743 --> 00:20:05,822
Come here.

360
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:09,822
Yes?

361
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:12,582
Come help me make breakfast.

362
00:20:13,703 --> 00:20:15,982
This is Rome's favorite.

363
00:20:20,223 --> 00:20:21,462
Confused?

364
00:20:21,703 --> 00:20:24,622
I'm making a special fish and chips dish

365
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:27,702
Fish and chips?

366
00:20:28,263 --> 00:20:29,262
What's that?

367
00:20:30,703 --> 00:20:33,342
People in England love this dish.

368
00:20:33,463 --> 00:20:35,662
It's fish and fried potatoes.

369
00:20:38,743 --> 00:20:39,662
Tian.

370
00:20:41,263 --> 00:20:42,902
know the truth

371
00:20:43,463 --> 00:20:44,782
of where you came from

372
00:20:45,543 --> 00:20:47,262
Therefore when you're with me,

373
00:20:47,423 --> 00:20:49,982
you don't need to act like you're from overseas

374
00:20:50,863 --> 00:20:52,342
I know it's uncomfortable.

375
00:20:56,943 --> 00:20:58,822
If you'll excuse me then.

376
00:21:16,983 --> 00:21:17,782
Fish and chips

377
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:18,862
Looks delicious.

378
00:21:19,503 --> 00:21:21,182
You've done well Ms. Thip.

379
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,582
You're so cool Ms. Thip.

380
00:21:24,743 --> 00:21:25,862
You know how to make it.

381
00:21:26,663 --> 00:21:28,662
Actually, I didn't make it.

382
00:21:30,023 --> 00:21:32,302
The real chef is heading this way

383
00:21:39,383 --> 00:21:40,542
The truth is

384
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:42,982
you didn't have to do this Mon.

385
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,102
I wanted to.

386
00:21:46,383 --> 00:21:49,582
Living alone and eating alone isn't so great.

387
00:21:49,663 --> 00:21:52,622
Consider it a treat for the patient.

388
00:21:52,623 --> 00:21:54,502
Eat a lot so you can get well soon.

389
00:21:57,943 --> 00:21:58,902
Where's Tian?

390
00:21:59,303 --> 00:22:00,462
She doesn't want to eat?

391
00:22:01,103 --> 00:22:03,422
She came down but she said she's not hungry.

392
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:06,542
I guess she doesn't like American food like me.

393
00:22:06,943 --> 00:22:08,902
We're country people.

394
00:22:10,303 --> 00:22:11,742
I just want coffee.

395
00:22:16,663 --> 00:22:17,982
Actually,

396
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:21,542
Lak can't say that Tian is a country person.

397
00:22:21,543 --> 00:22:24,222
In case someone hears him,

398
00:22:24,263 --> 00:22:25,702
it will cause problems

399
00:22:25,903 --> 00:22:29,542
You should warn Lak a little

400
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:33,102
Let's just eat.

401
00:22:33,223 --> 00:22:34,182
I'm hungry.

402
00:22:36,463 --> 00:22:37,902
My head hurts already.

403
00:22:39,543 --> 00:22:40,622
What?

404
00:22:41,063 --> 00:22:42,102
It's Rome.

405
00:22:42,623 --> 00:22:44,262
I think he's back with Mon.

406
00:22:44,823 --> 00:22:46,902
saw him put a necklace on her that he bought.

407
00:22:47,023 --> 00:22:48,742
Hugging and kissing in the garden.

408
00:22:49,223 --> 00:22:50,542
I can't accept seeing them like that.

409
00:22:54,823 --> 00:22:57,022
Ms. Mon seems like a good person.

410
00:22:57,583 --> 00:23:01,342
If Boss is happy,we should be happy for him.

411
00:23:12,223 --> 00:23:12,902
And.

412
00:23:13,703 --> 00:23:14,542
you don't love

413
00:23:15,663 --> 00:23:17,222
or regret Rome?

414
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:19,342
Mr, Lak.

415
00:23:22,143 --> 00:23:23,782
I was wondering where you guys went.

416
00:23:25,783 --> 00:23:28,142
I made salad, Do you guys want some?

417
00:23:29,343 --> 00:23:30,942
I'm full.

418
00:23:30,983 --> 00:23:31,902
Thank you so much.

419
00:23:32,383 --> 00:23:32,862
I'm full too!

420
00:23:35,543 --> 00:23:37,382
Jeez,you two

421
00:23:37,543 --> 00:23:39,262
You guys think alike.

422
00:23:45,943 --> 00:23:46,702
Hello.

423
00:23:47,743 --> 00:23:49,582
One moment, I ill give the phone to Rome.

424
00:23:51,423 --> 00:23:53,302
I'll give it to him.

425
00:23:53,863 --> 00:23:55,462
You guys carry on.

426
00:24:01,263 --> 00:24:02,782
Yes, where are you calling from?

427
00:24:04,103 --> 00:24:06,342
Oh, the necklace is done?

428
00:24:06,623 --> 00:24:09,622
Rome is busy. I'll let him know.

429
00:24:10,303 --> 00:24:11,542
Yes, bye.

430
00:24:17,863 --> 00:24:18,862
Have you seen my phone?

431
00:24:19,463 --> 00:24:20,102
Oh.

432
00:24:20,743 --> 00:24:22,542
I found it at the table

433
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:25,302
Thanks.

434
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:27,222
Rome.

435
00:24:27,543 --> 00:24:28,942
Make sure your timing is right.

436
00:24:29,743 --> 00:24:34,302
saw Tian and Lak holding hands and being sweet back there.

437
00:24:34,503 --> 00:24:35,942
Sweet like that,

438
00:24:36,143 --> 00:24:37,862
I don't think they want to eat anything else.

439
00:24:41,943 --> 00:24:42,942
Let's go.

440
00:24:49,543 --> 00:24:51,262
This is what Mr. Rome ordered.

441
00:24:53,543 --> 00:24:56,702
Rome ordered to have this done?
Are you sure it's not the wrong item?

442
00:24:57,063 --> 00:25:00,462
It's not wrong. Mr. Rome picked it out himself and he only chose the necklace

443
00:25:00,503 --> 00:25:04,022
As for the ring, he only asked us to polish it.

444
00:25:16,623 --> 00:25:18,182
What?! Who are you running from?!

445
00:25:18,743 --> 00:25:20,742
What happened to your face?!

446
00:25:21,983 --> 00:25:23,342
I went to gamble and i lost.

447
00:25:23,423 --> 00:25:24,942
I got jumped.

448
00:25:26,023 --> 00:25:26,862
Again?

449
00:25:27,143 --> 00:25:29,102
Don't tell me you lost everything?

450
00:25:29,463 --> 00:25:30,942
I was winning at first.

451
00:25:33,023 --> 00:25:34,062
Fuck my life!

452
00:25:34,263 --> 00:25:36,102
What karma is this of mine?!

453
00:25:36,503 --> 00:25:38,142
How are we gonna survive now?!

454
00:25:38,343 --> 00:25:40,102
Gonna ask more money from Rome?

455
00:25:40,143 --> 00:25:42,022
He's gonna be at you up even more

456
00:25:42,063 --> 00:25:44,422
If Rome won't give it to me,

457
00:25:47,103 --> 00:25:48,222
then I'll ask Tian.

458
00:26:01,743 --> 00:26:02,782
Are you Chan?

459
00:26:06,223 --> 00:26:07,422
I'm Rome's giri friend.

460
00:26:07,943 --> 00:26:09,622
You can talk to me.

461
00:26:10,383 --> 00:26:11,662
It's nothing much

462
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:13,542
I came to ask for more money for my ride

463
00:26:15,143 --> 00:26:15,702
Ride?

464
00:26:16,703 --> 00:26:18,662
Your boyfriend Rome

465
00:26:19,063 --> 00:26:21,262
had me go work a t his factory in Ranong

466
00:26:21,543 --> 00:26:22,822
He only gave me a little bit for the ride fee

467
00:26:23,263 --> 00:26:24,782
I wasted it all paying for my room

468
00:26:26,823 --> 00:26:27,862
How much more'do'you need?

469
00:26:28,343 --> 00:26:28,942
30,000.

470
00:26:29,783 --> 00:26:32,982
If I get this money, I will go reestablish myself.

471
00:26:33,223 --> 00:26:35,782
las sure you that you won't see me again.

472
00:26:35,983 --> 00:26:37,782
Isn't that too much?

473
00:26:38,303 --> 00:26:39,302
Gosh!

474
00:26:39,463 --> 00:26:41,902
It's just 30,000

475
00:26:42,023 --> 00:26:44,102
Your boyfriend won't go broke over it

476
00:26:44,823 --> 00:26:47,662
You guys are going to sell Tian anyway.

477
00:26:47,783 --> 00:26:49,262
I'm only asking for 30,000

478
00:26:51,783 --> 00:26:52,502
Please?

479
00:26:58,983 --> 00:27:00,702
l don't have that much in cash

480
00:27:03,263 --> 00:27:05,062
But I have an item.

481
00:27:06,503 --> 00:27:06,942
Hey.

482
00:27:08,783 --> 00:27:09,502
Auntie.

483
00:27:10,663 --> 00:27:12,142
This looks like Tian's ring.

484
00:27:13,663 --> 00:27:15,102
Mom gave it to her.

485
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:18,902
Oh!

486
00:27:19,343 --> 00:27:21,022
The necklace would sell a lot.

487
00:27:22,583 --> 00:27:24,182
You will get more than 30,000.

488
00:27:24,543 --> 00:27:26,022
If you want it, take it.

489
00:27:27,463 --> 00:27:28,902
I will..

490
00:27:29,623 --> 00:27:30,902
give you extra as well

491
00:27:31,863 --> 00:27:32,502
Here.

492
00:27:33,063 --> 00:27:33,862
10,000.

493
00:27:35,063 --> 00:27:35,822
Thank you.

494
00:27:37,703 --> 00:27:41,222
You have to tell me everything about you and your sister.

495
00:27:49,103 --> 00:27:50,622
All done.

496
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:53,102
The wound is dried and healed

497
00:27:53,223 --> 00:27:56,542
Tomorrow, you don't need to put on the ointment and clean the wound.

498
00:27:58,943 --> 00:27:59,662
Too bad

499
00:28:00,863 --> 00:28:02,382
Kula chart missed his mark.

500
00:28:03,583 --> 00:28:05,382
He should actually aim right here.

501
00:28:06,423 --> 00:28:07,902
Sol can just die.

502
00:28:08,263 --> 00:28:09,822
Gosh Boss.

503
00:28:10,303 --> 00:28:12,662
Who will I live with if something happens to you?

504
00:28:12,783 --> 00:28:13,822
Many people.

505
00:28:14,783 --> 00:28:16,462
There's Pa,

506
00:28:16,863 --> 00:28:17,582
Pao,

507
00:28:19,343 --> 00:28:20,462
and also...

508
00:28:20,943 --> 00:28:22,182
your close acquaintance.

509
00:28:23,223 --> 00:28:23,822
Lak.

510
00:28:25,023 --> 00:28:26,902
If you don't want to live with me,

511
00:28:27,343 --> 00:28:28,462
I can go.

512
00:28:37,663 --> 00:28:38,702
Who gave you permission to leave?

513
00:28:58,703 --> 00:28:59,262
Hello?

514
00:29:00,103 --> 00:29:01,062
Mr, Rome.

515
00:29:01,543 --> 00:29:02,902
Mon is in trouble.

516
00:29:10,103 --> 00:29:11,742
Hey Gigi

517
00:29:11,943 --> 00:29:13,542
you called Rome here?

518
00:29:14,983 --> 00:29:17,782
How can I stay still with you getting hit like this?

519
00:29:18,663 --> 00:29:19,382
What happened?

520
00:29:19,983 --> 00:29:20,662
Who hurt you?

521
00:29:23,023 --> 00:29:23,902
Rome.

522
00:29:24,023 --> 00:29:27,142
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

523
00:29:28,063 --> 00:29:29,142
I went...

524
00:29:29,463 --> 00:29:31,062
to the mall

525
00:29:31,063 --> 00:29:33,342
and stopped by the jewelry shop

526
00:29:33,423 --> 00:29:37,142
I went to get the ring necklace that you had ordered

527
00:29:37,583 --> 00:29:41,342
But I was robbed at the parking lot.

528
00:29:42,943 --> 00:29:43,902
Ring necklace?

529
00:29:45,023 --> 00:29:45,982
Who were they?!

530
00:29:46,383 --> 00:29:47,342
Do you recognize their faces?!

531
00:29:47,383 --> 00:29:48,302
Did you file a report?!

532
00:29:49,303 --> 00:29:52,422
I wanted to take her but Mon refused

533
00:29:52,463 --> 00:29:53,462
You have to file a report!

534
00:29:53,543 --> 00:29:55,582
How else will you catch the thieves?!

535
00:29:57,583 --> 00:29:58,302
Rome.

536
00:29:58,783 --> 00:30:00,422
It's my fault.

537
00:30:00,503 --> 00:30:02,422
I didn't want to make it a big deal

538
00:30:02,703 --> 00:30:06,662
I will have them make a new ring necklace for you.

539
00:30:06,943 --> 00:30:08,262
I'm sorry.

540
00:30:11,263 --> 00:30:11,782
Forget it.

541
00:30:13,183 --> 00:30:14,742
It's good that you're safe

542
00:30:16,823 --> 00:30:17,422
Watch her.

543
00:30:18,343 --> 00:30:19,782
I have important things to do.

544
00:30:29,983 --> 00:30:31,022
I want to know

545
00:30:31,303 --> 00:30:33,782
if Tian finds out the ring necklace is missing,

546
00:30:33,983 --> 00:30:35,022
what will she do?

547
00:30:35,223 --> 00:30:36,542
What will you do?

548
00:30:37,063 --> 00:30:39,622
You went to get that ring necklace.

549
00:30:48,423 --> 00:30:50,262
What the hell are you doing?!

550
00:30:54,743 --> 00:30:56,142
Are you possessed?!

551
00:30:59,743 --> 00:31:03,342
When it comes to action, it has to look real.

552
00:31:10,383 --> 00:31:11,622
How about that?

553
00:31:12,223 --> 00:31:14,862
Rome doesn't even care about your condition

554
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:16,702
Let me conclude.

555
00:31:17,183 --> 00:31:19,342
As long as Tian still exist,

556
00:31:19,743 --> 00:31:21,222
you will never receive love

557
00:31:21,623 --> 00:31:23,102
from Rome.

558
00:31:26,743 --> 00:31:28,542
Don't be mad at Ms. Mon.

559
00:31:28,743 --> 00:31:31,822
The ring necklace is now gone. Just forget about it.

560
00:31:31,863 --> 00:31:33,022
How can I forget?

561
00:31:33,823 --> 00:31:35,422
That's your beloved item.

562
00:31:35,623 --> 00:31:37,022
Your mother gave it to you before she died.

563
00:31:37,943 --> 00:31:41,702
It's true Mom gave it to me but it's materialistic.

564
00:31:42,023 --> 00:31:45,142
It's gone but it doesn't mean l will forget Mom.

565
00:31:45,383 --> 00:31:46,902
But that's your life.

566
00:31:47,343 --> 00:31:48,302
No.

567
00:31:49,343 --> 00:31:51,462
You're my life.

568
00:31:52,503 --> 00:31:54,382
I wouldn't trade you for anything

569
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:06,262
You don't understand

570
00:32:08,463 --> 00:32:09,382
That ring

571
00:32:10,143 --> 00:32:11,382
is am important piece of evidence

572
00:32:12,823 --> 00:32:14,182
that will change your life.

573
00:32:15,503 --> 00:32:17,102
Important piece of evidence?

574
00:32:31,383 --> 00:32:31,902
What's up?

575
00:32:35,103 --> 00:32:35,582
What?

576
00:32:36,143 --> 00:32:37,062
He has n'tarrived yet?

577
00:32:37,823 --> 00:32:39,062
Thanks for letting me know.

578
00:32:43,823 --> 00:32:45,222
What now?

579
00:32:46,783 --> 00:32:48,342
Chan didn't go back to Ranong.

580
00:32:57,743 --> 00:32:58,582
Hey.

581
00:32:58,983 --> 00:32:59,662
Let me have some

582
00:33:01,103 --> 00:33:02,582
It's noon.

583
00:33:02,583 --> 00:33:05,822
Temple kids can eat but someone who is holding the eight precepts can't.

584
00:33:06,543 --> 00:33:07,502
Oh my!

585
00:33:07,543 --> 00:33:10,982
Precept Six Refrain from eating solid food after the sun has risen and midday has passed.

586
00:33:48,583 --> 00:33:49,742
Mr, Lak.

587
00:33:49,783 --> 00:33:50,982
You start led me.

588
00:33:51,503 --> 00:33:52,302
Gosh!

589
00:33:52,783 --> 00:33:53,902
What's wrong?

590
00:33:54,223 --> 00:33:55,302
If you're thinking about Rome,

591
00:33:56,263 --> 00:33:56,742
go inside

592
00:33:57,223 --> 00:33:58,742
He's in his office

593
00:33:59,223 --> 00:34:01,622
What are you talking about? It's not like that.

594
00:34:02,423 --> 00:34:03,622
Then what?

595
00:34:04,423 --> 00:34:05,422
If you won't tell me

596
00:34:05,783 --> 00:34:06,662
I won't talk to you

597
00:34:07,623 --> 00:34:08,902
If I tell you,

598
00:34:09,383 --> 00:34:11,662
promise me you won't tell anyone

599
00:34:15,223 --> 00:34:18,022
My beloved item is missing

600
00:34:19,583 --> 00:34:21,502
It'san heirloom l had since I was a kid.

601
00:34:22,503 --> 00:34:23,782
Most importantly,

602
00:34:23,983 --> 00:34:25,342
Mom gave it to me.

603
00:34:26,183 --> 00:34:26,702
And...

604
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:29,302
how did it go missing?

605
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:34,462
Inside or outside the house?

606
00:34:36,743 --> 00:34:37,182
And...

607
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:38,942
when was the last time you saw it?

608
00:34:41,183 --> 00:34:41,782
Gosh!

609
00:34:42,263 --> 00:34:43,102
That's crazy!

610
00:34:43,183 --> 00:34:44,702
You don't know anything I asked!

611
00:34:45,743 --> 00:34:46,862
In that case,

612
00:34:46,903 --> 00:34:49,462
there's only one way to get it back

613
00:34:50,143 --> 00:34:51,062
How?

614
00:34:51,863 --> 00:34:52,462
What do l do?

615
00:34:53,103 --> 00:34:54,662
Tell me Mr, Lak!

616
00:34:55,663 --> 00:34:56,622
Rely on religion.

617
00:34:57,503 --> 00:34:58,342
Religion?

618
00:35:00,183 --> 00:35:00,822
You're right!

619
00:35:01,063 --> 00:35:02,302
The last resort!

620
00:35:02,823 --> 00:35:03,382
Let's go.

621
00:35:03,423 --> 00:35:04,062
Tian.

622
00:35:04,103 --> 00:35:05,102
- Hurry!
- I was joking.

623
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,622
-You serious?!
-Yeah!

624
00:35:16,903 --> 00:35:19,342
Please let me find the ring necklace.

625
00:35:20,143 --> 00:35:21,902
Please don't let Chan

626
00:35:22,223 --> 00:35:24,302
cause any more problems.

627
00:35:24,743 --> 00:35:25,622
Amen!

628
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:41,022
It's time to talk about your future Tian.

629
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:43,502
According to the steps,

630
00:35:44,543 --> 00:35:46,022
you must do your Non-Formal Education,

631
00:35:46,103 --> 00:35:47,462
finish high school,

632
00:35:47,623 --> 00:35:48,902
then take your college entrance exam.

633
00:35:50,263 --> 00:35:51,982
We should get back on track.

634
00:35:54,463 --> 00:35:57,662
Whatever I study is up to Boss.

635
00:36:00,023 --> 00:36:00,662
And..

636
00:36:01,423 --> 00:36:03,982
have you thought about what you want to study?

637
00:36:04,303 --> 00:36:05,622
What job do you want to do?

638
00:36:08,743 --> 00:36:09,982
It's up to Boss.

639
00:36:11,663 --> 00:36:13,062
Rome this, Rome that

640
00:36:13,663 --> 00:36:14,942
What about you?

641
00:36:15,383 --> 00:36:17,742
You don't want to do what you want to do?

642
00:36:19,743 --> 00:36:21,702
My life belongs to him

643
00:36:22,103 --> 00:36:23,622
Whatever he wants me to do

644
00:36:23,743 --> 00:36:25,142
I will go along with it.

645
00:36:25,703 --> 00:36:27,502
Everyone has their own life.

646
00:36:28,143 --> 00:36:29,702
You determine your own life.

647
00:36:29,943 --> 00:36:31,502
Don't let anyone control it.

648
00:36:31,943 --> 00:36:32,822
Understood?

649
00:36:36,583 --> 00:36:37,702
Let's head back.

650
00:36:38,983 --> 00:36:39,542
Tian.

651
00:36:40,863 --> 00:36:41,902
I understand that

652
00:36:42,303 --> 00:36:43,902
your life belongs to Rome.

653
00:36:44,783 --> 00:36:45,542
So...

654
00:36:47,023 --> 00:36:48,022
what about your heart?

655
00:36:48,463 --> 00:36:49,622
Does it belong to Rome too?

656
00:37:01,543 --> 00:37:02,022
Yes?

657
00:37:02,463 --> 00:37:04,382
I came to make merit with Mr. Lak.

658
00:37:04,583 --> 00:37:06,022
We're heading back Boss.

659
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:14,622
My god!

660
00:37:15,063 --> 00:37:16,502
What happened?

661
00:37:18,263 --> 00:37:19,302
It's nothing.

662
00:37:19,343 --> 00:37:21,062
A little accident.

663
00:37:22,623 --> 00:37:23,502
Where's Rome

664
00:37:25,383 --> 00:37:26,822
Stressed in his room.

665
00:37:27,343 --> 00:37:28,862
But it's good you're here

666
00:37:29,063 --> 00:37:30,422
Good opportunity.

667
00:37:30,903 --> 00:37:32,582
Mr s. Paand Dr.Pao

668
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:33,702
left back to Ranong

669
00:37:33,903 --> 00:37:35,262
As for Tian,

670
00:37:35,663 --> 00:37:36,982
she stepped out with Mr, Lak

671
00:37:38,383 --> 00:37:39,902
Save that for later.

672
00:37:40,143 --> 00:37:42,742
I have something important to talk to you about

673
00:37:46,943 --> 00:37:48,662
Tian isn't really my biological sister.

674
00:37:49,543 --> 00:37:51,022
Mom and Dad adopted her.

675
00:37:51,983 --> 00:37:53,542
They loved her so much.

676
00:37:54,183 --> 00:37:56,262
She was a troubled child since we were little.

677
00:37:56,663 --> 00:37:58,902
She bullied and slandered me.

678
00:38:00,183 --> 00:38:01,742
But I for gave her

679
00:38:02,983 --> 00:38:04,902
After my parents died,

680
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:07,022
I took care of her

681
00:38:07,183 --> 00:38:08,422
I wouldn't let her starve.

682
00:38:09,423 --> 00:38:10,622
But you saw

683
00:38:11,063 --> 00:38:12,502
how ungrateful she is.

684
00:38:13,063 --> 00:38:15,502
She chased me away like I'm some animal

685
00:38:18,743 --> 00:38:19,262
Auntie.

686
00:38:20,063 --> 00:38:21,022
Like you promised!

687
00:38:21,943 --> 00:38:23,382
I told you everything.

688
00:38:24,623 --> 00:38:25,382
Where's my money?

689
00:38:39,903 --> 00:38:40,942
No wonder

690
00:38:41,143 --> 00:38:43,942
she has friends who are brats like those kids.

691
00:38:44,623 --> 00:38:45,502
The truth is

692
00:38:45,943 --> 00:38:48,462
she'sa beggar just like them

693
00:38:48,903 --> 00:38:50,102
But it's'strange

694
00:38:50,383 --> 00:38:53,862
I wonder what spell Mr. Rome is on

695
00:38:54,223 --> 00:38:56,742
to have taken her under his care like this.

696
00:38:58,063 --> 00:38:59,102
I know right?

697
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:03,142
But we can't let Tian deceive Rome like this

698
00:39:03,303 --> 00:39:04,462
There's no way,

699
00:39:05,143 --> 00:39:07,902
I've taken good care of this family for years

700
00:39:09,023 --> 00:39:10,942
I will make Mr, Rome open his eyes

701
00:39:14,743 --> 00:39:15,502
Rome.

702
00:39:15,943 --> 00:39:18,662
I think we should stop getting revenge on Ka molt at.

703
00:39:18,743 --> 00:39:20,382
Things are getting out of hand.

704
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:23,062
Tian is my sister.

705
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,662
Whatever I tell her to do, she will listen.

706
00:39:25,703 --> 00:39:29,102
tell her to go right, she goes right.

707
00:39:29,943 --> 00:39:30,782
In that case,

708
00:39:31,063 --> 00:39:32,462
you must be close to Rome.

709
00:39:32,823 --> 00:39:34,222
Boss Rome?

710
00:39:34,623 --> 00:39:36,862
He's the one that bought Tian from me.

711
00:39:37,343 --> 00:39:38,982
I'm not money hungry though

712
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:40,742
Where did you take Tian?!

713
00:39:42,623 --> 00:39:43,862
What's your problem?

714
00:39:44,143 --> 00:39:46,542
You barged into my house and is asking for Tian?!

715
00:39:53,383 --> 00:39:54,862
