=Episode 11=

23
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:50,180
(Zhongshan Villa)
Sir, My Lady, we've arrived.

24
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,090
Jinchuan,

25
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:05,930
as I recall, a waterway

26
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:08,240
connects the villa
and Prince Hengyang's Mansion.

27
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,410
I'll go there to check

28
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:10,930
while you prepare the things I need.

29
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,020
Yes, sir.

30
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:12,970
Go.

31
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,130
(It's the only way to rescue Zhao Yuan.)

32
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,620
Rain makes the ground slippery.

33
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,380
Will I fall?

34
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,100
Miss Luo.

35
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,220
Careful!

36
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,210
Thanks, Young Master Yun.

37
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,460
Please, Miss Luo.

38
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:53,620
The view here is impressive.

39
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,490
It'll be pleasant to hold a martial banquet.

40
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,100
It includes complicated games.

41
00:02:58,490 --> 00:02:59,380
Props are needed.

42
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,570
All of them need to be prepared in advance.

43
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,490
I promised to make this banquet perfect.

44
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:05,770
I'll get everything ready.

45
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,050
Aren't you going to help me?

46
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,980
Or are you reluctant?

47
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,210
The Winding Stream Banquet

48
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,290
is for scholars to compose poetry.

49
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:17,930
Now, it's turned into

50
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,020
a martial banquet.

51
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,100
You know how to cater to people's taste.

52
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:24,410
Tomorrow, it'll be
Prince Hengyang's one-man show.

53
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,100
It's his welcome banquet.

54
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,850
Isn't it to please him?

55
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,020
Would you rather go against him?

56
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:35,820
Besides,

57
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,540
how do you know he'll win for sure?

58
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,850
You're wise and brave.

59
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,820
Maybe you'll be even better.

60
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:44,940
Well said.

61
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,820
What are you looking at?

62
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,050
Peach blossoms are in full bloom.

63
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:02,330
My Lady,

64
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,410
we need to check the seats in the warehouse.

65
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,020
They need to be cleaned.

66
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,620
The kitchen asked us to taste the dishes.

67
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,570
The gatehouse told us

68
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,310
to double-check the guest list and carriages.

69
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,300
- And...
- Hold on.

70
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:12,770
One at a time, please.

71
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:13,970
You're occupied.

72
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:15,980
I'll go there to check

73
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,370
what else is needed. Take the umbrella.

74
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,810
Thanks, Young Master Yun.

75
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,130
The kitchen, gatehouse...

76
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,250
You're right, sir.

77
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,850
The villa and the mansion

78
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,370
are connected by water.

79
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,710
Have you got everything?

80
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:50,860
Yes, sir.

81
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,810
Whistling arrows and a horse
are ready for you.

82
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:56,810
Sir,

83
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,090
are you really going in there alone?

84
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,780
Take me with you.

85
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,290
I... I'll be your shield.

86
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:04,600
I can at least take stabs for you.

87
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:07,090
You have to be alive
to be Zhao Yuan's punch bag.

88
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:08,970
Don't worry.

89
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,180
I've had a plan.

90
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,500
The banquet is tomorrow. Stay alert!

91
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,620
- Yes.
- Yes.

92
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,740
(Although guards patrol)

93
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,900
(in shifts in the mansion,)

94
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,940
(all of them)

95
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,970
(pass the woodshed.)

96
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:57,340
Zhao Yuan must be locked there.

97
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,370
He cheated like this
when playing hide-and-seek in childhood.

98
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,180
Turns out, he hasn't changed.

99
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,460
Your Highness, all corners are guarded.

100
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,020
Whoever sneaks in won't get out.

101
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:46,860
And the side gate?

102
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,090
It's been sealed.

103
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,500
I think no one will see it.

104
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,160
The devil is in the details.

105
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,760
Have you not learned your lesson in war?

106
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,130
Guard the side gate!

107
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:13,970
Yes!

108
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,090
There! The side gate!

109
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:23,860
Zhao Yuan!

110
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:24,810
Zhao Yuan!

111
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:30,520
I should look at him with new eyes
after so long.

112
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:32,250
The east side is guarded, too.

113
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,780
(Area)

114
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,250
Are you alright, My Lady?

115
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,250
I don't know why

116
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:45,900
my heart suddenly squeezed.

117
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:49,060
Perhaps you've been working too hard.

118
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:50,580
Are you feeling better?

119
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:53,940
Are all the fireworks in place?

120
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,570
All set, My Lady.

121
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:56,820
I've checked three times.

122
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,130
They've been placed as to your plan.

123
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,900
Nothing will go wrong.

124
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,620
Hey, turn in early.

125
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:07,090
We have to get up early tomorrow.

126
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:07,930
I see.

127
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,130
I need some fresh air.

128
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:36,020
(Zhao Yuan should've gone far.)

129
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,690
- Seize him.
- Yes.

130
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,260
Wait!

131
00:08:58,370 --> 00:08:59,210
Don't kill him!

132
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:00,450
Yes.

133
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,260
No one's here.

134
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,500
Not here either.

135
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:19,410
Is he over there?

136
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,620
No.

137
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,300
He ran away!

138
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:30,370
(Why did my heart palpitate?)

139
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,860
(Perhaps I was exhausted.)

140
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,690
(Someone said he'd help me.)

141
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,420
(What did he do?)

142
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,250
I haven't seen Lu Yun since noon.

143
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,690
He must've gone back. How lazy.

144
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:48,940
Be quiet!

145
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,380
Luo Lingyu,

146
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:51,530
help me...

147
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,020
Young Master Yun?

148
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:00,780
Thanks for your help.

149
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:04,300
Once we arrive in Yuezhou,
I'll thank you properly.

150
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,860
(His mask is...)

151
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,570
Sit tight. Don't move.

152
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,490
Are you Mr. Lu's third son?

153
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,140
Take a guess.

154
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,420
I'm new here.

155
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:40,810
I really don't know.

156
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,810
Please tell me.

157
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,460
Do you really not remember me?

158
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,140
Thanks.

159
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,540
I said that day no need to thank me.

160
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,050
The waterway to Yuezhou.

161
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,170
The boat in the dark.

162
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,930
You've recalled it, right?

163
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:31,610
So far,

164
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,050
I've saved you twice.

165
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:35,650
Saved me?

166
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,420
When I was still wounded,

167
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:42,420
you forced me to jump off the boat.

168
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:45,050
Had I been any less skilled in swimming,

169
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:46,810
I would've drowned.

170
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,370
You're so ungrateful.

171
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:50,980
Hadn't I lent a hand,

172
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:53,310
you wouldn't have been here to argue with me.

173
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:54,900
Help!

174
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:57,020
(Siqi Chamber)
The thief is in the study!

175
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,570
Catch him!

176
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,930
Is this horse from the farmer's market?

177
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,050
Do you know

178
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:13,460
back in the Fan's,

179
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,340
hadn't you called me a thief,

180
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,510
I wouldn't have
ended up in the water, wounded?

181
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,250
The bond between us

182
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:21,980
goes much deeper than you think.

183
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,370
No wonder my dowry was heavy.

184
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,100
You stole everything!

185
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:33,980
So you were that thief in the Fan's.

186
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,370
You stole my dowry!

187
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,460
I didn't steal anything.

188
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,230
It was you who took my money bag.

189
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,570
How dare you ask me for compensation.

190
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,250
You dropped that money bag.

191
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,340
I made a meticulous plan to run away

192
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,220
on my wedding day.

193
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,690
But you sabotaged it.

194
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,640
You can be unreasonable,

195
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,610
but have a conscience.

196
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,130
Hadn't you grabbed my horse,

197
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,780
could you have got away?

198
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:00,930
If I hadn't lost my horse,

199
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:01,770
would I have...?

200
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,460
The past is the past.

201
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,690
Don't rake it up.

202
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,220
Since we owe each other,

203
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:13,980
our debts are offset. We're even.

204
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,010
It's late.

205
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,460
Go back and rest.

206
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:21,660
This way. Follow me!

207
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,260
Let's go.

208
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,540
- You heard that.
- Move!

209
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,940
- They're outside hunting me.
- There.

210
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,050
- If I go out,
- There.

211
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:32,460
I'll be digging my own grave.

212
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:36,410
At this point,

213
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:40,170
I can only stay the night in your room.

214
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,810
I'll ask Lingxi...

215
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:43,650
You can't tell her.

216
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,490
Who exactly is going after you?

217
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,980
I followed the bloodstain to the lakeside.

218
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,540
He wasn't in the water.

219
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:59,370
I think he had help.

220
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:00,690
The hostage is gone.

221
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,220
That man rescued the hostage

222
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,980
and managed to run away.

223
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:10,170
Clearly, he was familiar with Zhongshan.

224
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,050
The traps in the prison weren't activated.

225
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,130
He knew the hostage wasn't there.

226
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:21,460
I believe this man knows me quite well.

227
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:24,980
Do you have a suspect, Your Highness?

228
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,490
I know his figure all too well.

229
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:31,660
Lu Xuechen!

230
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,860
Secure all the exits in the area.

231
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:38,610
Not even a moth shall get out.

232
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:39,670
- Yes.
- Yes.

233
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,020
I'll seize him

234
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,420
in front of everyone at tomorrow's banquet.

235
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:46,570
He broke into my mansion

236
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,930
and took away a culprit.

237
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:56,050
Let's see if he can

238
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,220
escape the death penalty.

239
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:02,890
What?

240
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:04,900
Prince Hengyang is going after you?

241
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,060
Lower your voice.

242
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,660
No wonder you came here with me.

243
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:14,130
You used me as a front

244
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,220
for your plot.

245
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,860
I came to rescue someone.

246
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,250
I had no choice but to do this.

247
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,170
But why drag me into it?

248
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,460
I just want to live peacefully
with Hua in the Lu's.

249
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,690
Why get me involved in the fight

250
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,210
between you and Prince Hengyang?

251
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,370
Had you been afraid of trouble,

252
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,540
you wouldn't have saved me.

253
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,570
Don't worry too much.

254
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,370
I only need you to cover for me tomorrow.

255
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:50,170
Cover for you?

256
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,050
I no longer owe you.

257
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,020
Why should I help you?

258
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:55,810
And if anyone finds out about it,

259
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,540
I'll be doomed.

260
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,930
Just so you know,

261
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:06,460
we're in the same boat.

262
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,340
If I get caught,

263
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,250
you'll be the first one to go down with me.

264
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:14,690
Helping me is helping yourself.

265
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:22,700
Fine.

266
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:33,300
As soon as I entered the Lu's,

267
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,420
you recognized me, right?

268
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,450
You fooled me for so long.

269
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,930
You didn't ask.

270
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:49,370
I made a fool

271
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,810
of myself these days,

272
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,370
thinking you liked me.

273
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,690
I was glad about it.

274
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,300
You must've been laughing at me secretly.

275
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,060
I admit

276
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,300
that at the beginning,

277
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,180
I had a prejudice against you.

278
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:10,490
- Prejudice, huh?- But I...

279
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,180
Now, you're being honest.

280
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,610
In order to take in a husband

281
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,410
to regain my family property,

282
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:20,700
I paid all my attention to you

283
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,130
because you were my only hope.

284
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,810
- Do you know I...?
- Wait.

285
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,420
What did you say?

286
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,500
Take in

287
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:29,780
a husband?

288
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,090
And you wanted me?

289
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,540
I...

290
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,260
Take me in?

291
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,250
Didn't you call that idea clever?

292
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:43,180
You're good-looking

293
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:45,370
and talented

294
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,090
without any bad habits.

295
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,730
You have a good family and personality.

296
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,580
Or I wouldn't have wasted

297
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,850
over six months' time on you.

298
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,090
Are you saying

299
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:56,580
I should thank you for your appreciation?

300
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,610
You're welcome.

301
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,580
I need to regain my family property

302
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,730
while Fan Qingchen poses a threat to me.

303
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,660
If not, I wouldn't have

304
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:07,780
chosen you in haste.

305
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:09,930
Hey...

306
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,060
I'm not done yet.

307
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,380
(Virtues Shine)

308
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,330
I thought the Chen Clan

309
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:28,130
would host the welcome banquet
for Prince Hengyang

310
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:30,850
so that you could make a name for yourself,

311
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:34,820
but someone else got the chance.

312
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,010
It's only been a month since Miss Luo

313
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,520
came to the Lu's in Yuezhou.

314
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,540
I fear she'll outshine you soon.

315
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,450
Prince Hengyang asked her

316
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:48,210
by name to set up the banquet,

317
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:49,780
so

318
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,210
- it wasn't that I...
- I know.

319
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:52,660
But you have to

320
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,130
fight for the chance

321
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:58,250
to bring honor to your father and our clan.

322
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,250
You're a minister's daughter.

323
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,660
Don't let some humble nobody

324
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,940
steal your title
as the noblest girl of Yuezhou.

325
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,260
Otherwise,

326
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:07,940
all the effort we've put into you

327
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:08,850
over the years

328
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:10,250
will be vain.

329
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,020
Am I right, Master?

330
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:23,700
The Chen Clan rose without help.

331
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:26,090
In order to go a step further,

332
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:27,850
we'll have to

333
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,700
work a hundredfold harder.

334
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:31,780
I understand, Father.

335
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:39,930
Xiu,

336
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,090
you're my daughter.

337
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,940
(Minister Chen)
I have faith in you.

338
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:45,420
No one can defeat you.

339
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:49,300
Good night.

340
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:57,130
You can't lose

341
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,940
at tomorrow's banquet.

342
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,540
Don't disappoint your father.

343
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:01,810
Yes, Mother.

344
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,610
Don't worry, My Lady.

345
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,820
It's only been a month since Miss Luo
came here from the Northern Border.

346
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,610
It's hard to hold a grand banquet.

347
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:19,000
She'll make a spectacle of herself.

348
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,490
She won't be a threat to you.

349
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:23,570
Is that so?

350
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:55,370
We barely know him.

351
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:57,730
We've done our best to get him on board.

352
00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:59,330
If he ends up dead,

353
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,130
that's his fate.

354
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,940
(She's mean.)

355
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,020
(She's two-faced.)

356
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:16,300
(She's scheming.)

357
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,060
(She's moody.)

358
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:22,900
Say no more.

359
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:23,900
Shoes that don't fit

360
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:24,970
are useless!

361
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,780
(There's nothing good about her,)

362
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,660
(but why can't I get her off my mind?)

363
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:40,850
♪A cup of wine can't drown my loneliness♪

364
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:46,330

Lingyu already said no.

372
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,060
Stop pushing her.

373
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,090
(He helped me in the West Market)

374
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,970
(and the Sutra Hall.)

375
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:35,730
(Without him,
I couldn't have stayed in the Lu's.)

376
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:41,020
(Well, he did all that for a purpose.)

377
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:44,270
♪Tears will be shed forever♪

378
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:47,820
(Luo Lingyu, wake up.)

379
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:51,050
♪Drifts with the wind♪

380
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:54,360
♪Picking up a brush, I just want to♪

381
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:58,970
♪Draw the fleeting time and capture youth♪

382
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:03,300
(He'll blame me if he catches a cold.)

383
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,650
Don't be frozen to death in my room.

384
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:27,490
(Anyway,)

385
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:28,920
(we've been through a lot.)

386
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:31,330
(I'll talk things over with her.)

387
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:14,610
There's still time before the banquet.

388
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,850
No need to primp yourself up so early.

389
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:19,900
No one is a born beauty.

390
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:22,130
Good looks cost a lot of effort.

391
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,730
Do you wear so much makeup every day?

392
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:30,850
Beauty is meticulously crafted.

393
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,420
You don't understand.

394
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,850
After you discovered my identity yesterday,

395
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,730
you wouldn't bother to pretend to be nice.

396
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:44,130
I don't waste time

397
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,020
on worthless things.

398
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,420
Do you have light-colored lip balm?

399
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,260
What for?

400
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,940
There will be a huge crowd.

401
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,060
If I look too pale,

402
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,140
people will get suspicious.

403
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:08,210
Your makeup can make me look better.

404
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,130
I'll help you

405
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:18,900
for the sake of the banquet.

406
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,250
Once it's over, don't come to me ever again.

407
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:25,090
We'll go our separate ways.

408
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:44,860
Come closer.

409
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:55,690
Smile.

410
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,140
Finished.

411
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:38,780
No.

412
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:40,130
It's too red.

413
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,370
Don't touch a girl's handkerchief.

414
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,330
Here's a friendly reminder.

415
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,620
Given Prince Hengyang's identity,

416
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,040
he won't be your husband.

417
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,900
Don't waste your time on him.

418
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,090
Waste?

419
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:09,540
I wasted so much time on you.

420
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,180
Prince Hengyang is of noble birth.

421
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:16,780
There's no harm in getting close to him.

422
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:26,290
Listen,

423
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:27,970
in Yuezhou,

424
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,370
less is more in style.

425
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:32,300
Wearing too much jewelry is the worst.

426
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:34,490
It makes one look corny and flighty.

427
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:38,370
You can hardly be too elegant

428
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:39,540
at a prince's welcome banquet.

429
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,580
It's kind of you to help me.

430
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:46,900
I'll help you in return.

431
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,090
My hairpin!

432
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:50,170
You don't need it.

433
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:52,780
Miss Luo came back late last night.

434
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,130
Hasn't she woken up?

435
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:55,660
It's a big day today.

436
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:57,300
- Trust me!
- At this hour,

437
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,420
she must be putting on makeup.

438
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:02,730
You... Hide yourself!

439
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:04,010
Don't let her see you.

440
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,420
My Lady.

441
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:09,330
Get in here...

442
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:12,850
My hairpin!

443
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,140
Hairpin?

444
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:16,780
Which one?

445
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:22,020
I... didn't know which hairpin I should wear.

446
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:24,970
Lingxi,

447
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,700
help me freshen up.

448
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:27,820
There's still time.

449
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:28,730
Let's double-check

450
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:30,730
just in case.

451
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:31,900
Yes, My Lady.

452
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,660
This banquet will bring back
the Shuozhou style.

453
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:39,940
(That poor fool.)

454
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:42,580
(I'll teach him a lesson someday.)

455
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:51,860
- Be careful.
- Miss.

456
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:52,700
Look over there.

457
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,820
(Zhongshan Villa)

458
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,330
This way, please, sir.

459
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:58,460
(Zhongshan Villa)

460
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,180
Greetings, Mr. Lu.

461
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:11,450
Mr. Lu.

462
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,330
Greetings, Mr. Lu.

463
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,580
Did you return from the North, Uncle?

464
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,730
Father finished the inspection
and returned days ago.

465
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:24,660
Ever since I returned,

466
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,580
I haven't seen you until now.

467
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:29,300
I heard you seldom went to the Family School,

468
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,060
or you slept in class.

469
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,900
You've become even lazier.

470
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:34,810
That's terrible.

471
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:35,980
Guess I take that from you.

472
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,050
I'm outdoorsy.

473
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,060
You must be Miss Luo.

474
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:47,300
(The First Madam must've
spoken ill of me in her letters.)

475
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:48,660
Although you're

476
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,540
the host of today's banquet,

477
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,580
it concerns the Lu Clan's honor.

478
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,610
No mistake is allowed, Miss Luo.

479
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:56,570
I understand.

480
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:57,900
You have my word.

481
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,540
I'll join you later, Father.

482
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,620
Come here.

483
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,490
I gave you a task.

484
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:06,730
- Stop worrying.
- Get it done.

485
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:08,300
Aunt must've complained a lot

486
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,090
about you in her letters.

487
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,210
If so, I have to be extra careful

488
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:14,130
and make Prince Hengyang happy.

489
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,300
Even if I don't get credit for my work,

490
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,850
at least Mr. Lu won't blame me.

491
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:21,970
Long time no see, Chancellor.

492
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:24,660
How was your inspection tour

493
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:26,300
to the North?

494
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,020
It went well.

495
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,540
Thanks for your work while I was away.

496
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,520
This way, please.

497
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,330
That's not your concern, Young Master Yun.

498
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:35,450
It's really nice.

499
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:37,810
Slow down, Miss!

500
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:39,620
Leave me alone.

501
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:42,060
I'm going to the gate
to receive Prince Hengyang.

502
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,420
Stop following me.

503
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,300
Slow down, Young Master.

504
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,230
Watch your step, Young Master.

505
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:53,450
Yun, my divination today shows

506
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,610
your horoscope doesn't look well.

507
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,680
You might be in a fight with your brothers.

508
00:30:58,210 --> 00:30:59,330
What do you think that means?

509
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:02,300
Are we going to fight?

510
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:05,660
You look rather free, Xian.

511
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:07,210
Hey, look over there.

512
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,090
So many girls have come.

513
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,900
I can tell Uncle

514
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:12,450
to set you up with them

515
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:14,250
and get to know them.

516
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:15,090
No, thanks, Yun.

517
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:19,180
My head is spinning all of a sudden.

518
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:20,730
I need to sit down.

519
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:22,170
See you.

520
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:30,940
I heard Miss Luo

521
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,970
put together this banquet.

522
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,610
It looks fantastic.

523
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,370
Minister Chen, Miss Chen.

524
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:42,780
That's nice of you to say.

525
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,210
Compared with Xiu,

526
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,060
she's not her match.

527
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,090
Xiu is pretty, wise,

528
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:49,660
and cultured.

529
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,580
If only I had a daughter like her.

530
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,730
You're too kind, Mr. Lu.

531
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,820
Xian is a gentleman

532
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,540
with extraordinary knowledge.

533
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:57,820
And Xuechen is

534
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:00,780
one of a kind.

535
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,210
He's so talented

536
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:03,060
and free.

537
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,580
I admire them

538
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:06,490
a lot.

539
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,160
Minister Chen.

540
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:11,970
Miss Chen.

541
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,780
Xiu is right.

542
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:18,130
She and Yun are childhood sweethearts.

543
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:19,610
They grew up together.

544
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,900
Now that they're adults,

545
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,580
they should keep in contact

546
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:25,060
with each other.

547
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:29,210
Friends from childhood are precious.

548
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:34,060
I heard everyone in Yuezhou knew

549
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:36,330
Yun was popular among girls.

550
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,490
I fear

551
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:42,060
you'll find my daughter boring.

552
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:51,250
Princes Hengyang and Changyi arrived!

553
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:12,020
Greetings, Prince Hengyang,

554
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,970
Prince Changyi.

555
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:16,970
At ease.

556
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,260
Your Highness.

557
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:26,210
Xuechen,

558
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:28,090
this is my welcome banquet.

559
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,850
We haven't seen each other for years.

560
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:32,970
Let's drink together.

561
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,490
The more the merrier.

562
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:45,300
No problem.

563
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:00,370
(Cover for me.)

564
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:07,850
It's about time.

565
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,580
I'll lead you to your seat, Your Highness.

566
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:19,300
Thanks, Miss Luo.

567
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,140
This way, please.

568
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:26,930
Among the jewelry pieces on your head,

569
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,860
I don't see the one I gave you.

570
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,450
You don't like it?

571
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:33,650
I adore it.

572
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:35,820
I didn't wear it for fear of breaking it

573
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,380
at the banquet.

574
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,100
No need to be so cautious.

575
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:40,290
If you like it,

576
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:42,170
I'll give you more and better ones.

577
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:44,930
Thanks, Your Highness.

578
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,660
Xuechen,

579
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:49,050
are you alright?

580
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,880
I was shot to rescue Zhao Yuan yesterday.

581
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:53,380
I'm fine now.

582
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,860
Miss Luo treated trauma as well as

583
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,580
army physicians.

584
00:34:57,650 --> 00:34:58,890
Did she bind up your wound?

585
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:02,210
She's being so nice to Hengyang.

586
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:03,280
Will she sell you out?

587
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,730
Don't worry. She won't.

588
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,100
We've made a pact.

589
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:08,380
How's Zhao Yuan?

590
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:11,250
He was severely wounded.

591
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,420
But you're in the worst situation.

592
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,410
If necessary, I'll...

593
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:15,620
Don't help me.

594
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:17,020
The more you do,

595
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:18,020
the more he suspects.

596
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,620
You should stay out of this.

597
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:28,900
What are these?

598
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:31,890
They're part of the martial banquet.

599
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:35,410
The winding stream is from the Zixia Canal.

600
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:38,620
The wooden trays flow down

601
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:41,250
with pouches

602
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:43,410
containing games for today

603
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:45,650
mostly to test one's martial arts.

604
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:48,940
Throw copper coins at the trays.

605
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,540
When you hit one,

606
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,250
you'll play the game in the pouch on it.

607
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,620
You may choose games in that way

608
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:58,100
or play whatever games you like.

609
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,540
That's fine.

610
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:02,890
The winding stream is to spice things up,

611
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,580
not to restrict the players.

612
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:10,270
What do you think, Your Highness?

613
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:19,380
When you first told me about this idea,

614
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:20,890
I was intrigued.

615
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:23,060
Turns out,

616
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:24,570
it's indeed creative.

617
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:28,580
Other games also seem fun.

618
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,340
(Chuiwan)

619
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,340
Thanks for your effort.

620
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,380
I'm glad you like them.

621
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:35,100
Please be seated.

622
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:10,220
Sir.

623
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,620
Why did you suddenly send

624
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:15,690
a message to see me?

625
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,860
I've got news of Wang Chongming.

626
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,210
Finally,

627
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:23,580
you've done something useful.

628
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,170
Where is he?

629
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:28,330
He was spotted near the Xiaomei Village
in the suburbs.

630
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:33,780
Do you need me to silence him

631
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:35,450
for good?

632
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,180
No need.

633
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,650
Even if he's dead,

634
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,250
the account book is still missing.

635
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,100
I can't relax.

636
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,730
It's better to use him as bait

637
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:59,730
to find the mastermind.

638
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,020
You're wise, sir.

639
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:08,170
You and your clan caused huge trouble.

640
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,780
Or I wouldn't have to do anything.

641
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:15,490
How audacious of you

642
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:19,140
to keep the account book. Who did you

643
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:22,410
mean to threaten with it?

644
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:27,930
No, sir. We wouldn't dare.

645
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,210
You're a bunch of rats.

646
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:30,820
Aren't you used to

647
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,540
saying one thing and doing another?

648
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,380
This is the last time

649
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,060
I clean up your mess.

650
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,210
You've found Wang Chongming.

651
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:52,820
Leave immediately.

652
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:55,160
Unless otherwise ordered,

653
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:58,300
don't set foot in Yuezhou ever again.

654
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:05,250
Yes.

655
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:07,970
I have a few personal affairs to attend to.

656
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:10,340
Then I'll leave.

657
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:31,500
(Zhongshan Villa)

658
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:43,540
Your Highness, I promised to cook for you.

659
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:47,340
In the North, when soldiers return,

660
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:49,620
their families will make noodles

661
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:52,020
to wish them peace and happiness.

662
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:54,250
I made

663
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,780
this bowl of noodles for you.

664
00:39:58,250 --> 00:39:59,300
It's so thoughtful of you.

665
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:09,100
In order to welcome you back,

666
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,930
I can't hardly be too thoughtful.

667
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:17,580
The noodles convey my best wishes to you.

668
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:22,780
Your Highness, speaking of the North,

669
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,250
when I went all over there for inspection,

670
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,580
I was amazed by the scenery.

671
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:31,930
It's more fun to live there than in Yuezhou.

672
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:34,690
Too bad, I only stayed for a month.

673
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:36,380
If you like that place,

674
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,210
when I go back there,

675
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:41,410
you may join me and tour around.

676
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:45,890
Yes. The border is in peace

677
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:49,100
because of the dedicated North Army.

678
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:53,380
You've made remarkable achievements
over the years

679
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:54,940
when guarding southern Yuezhou.

680
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,450
You're the guardian of the Northern Border!

681
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:00,780
It's my honor to share a table with you.

682
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:03,490
I have to toast you, Your Highness.

683
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:05,050
Cheers.

684
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:10,100
- Cheers.
- To you, Your Highness.

685
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:16,250
Be seated, everyone. Sit.

686
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:29,690
Miss Luo and the Lu Clan
prepared this banquet.

687
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:32,410
It's grand. Thank you.

688
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:35,020
It must've cost you a lot of time and effort.

689
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:39,690
I heard the preparation started yesterday.

690
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,100
It's our pleasure.

691
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:46,780
We ought to

692
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:49,100
do our best for you.

693
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:54,490
I learned that Lu Yun arrived yesterday.

694
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:00,250
Did you walk around Zhongshan?

695
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:07,020
No, Your Highness.

696
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:09,090
No?

697
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:10,860
Zhongshan is beautiful.

698
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,340
It was a clear night last night.

699
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:15,450
Did you stay in your room all alone

700
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,140
the entire evening?

701
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:23,770
To be honest,

702
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,690
I wasn't in my room

703
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:29,540
because I had a wonderful night

704
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:31,780
with Miss Luo.
