Beautiful.

How beautiful!

28
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,220
(Luo Residence)
Look, everyone.

29
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,280
The portrait of Miss Luo

30
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,200
who's the fairest of Shuozhou!

31
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,120
Miss Luo?

32
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,600
Take a look.

33
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,070
- Don't fool us outsiders.
- That doesn't

34
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,280
- She can't be the fairest.
- look like her at all.

35
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,430
Why hasn't she come out yet?

36
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,470
She's turning 24 today.

37
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,630
That's one of the most important birthdays

38
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,400
for girls.

39
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,960
Be patient.

40
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,550
Keep waiting.

41
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,190
Wait makes the heart grow fonder.

42
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,280
People should learn to wait.

43
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,270
See?

44
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,400
My 24th birthday has finally come.

45
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,000
My Lady! My Lady! My Lady!

46
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,800
You won't believe how luxurious

47
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,960
the sedan that's waiting for you outside is.

48
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,520
Why are Uncle and Aunt

49
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,680
being so nice to us all of a sudden?

50
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,870
They mean to show everyone

51
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,000
(Luo Lingyu)
that I, Luo Lingyu,

52
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,910
has turned 24.

53
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,150
They're going to such great lengths

54
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:21,430
to marry me into the Fan Mansion.

55
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,920
Fan Mansion?

56
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,030
Because the Fan Clan will pay them a fortune.

57
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,280
A fortune?

58
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,800
Sister, you said

59
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,770
(Luo Yunhua)
before our parents died,

60
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,470
they had deposited our family property worth

61
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,060
500,000 taels of gold
in the government.

62
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,190
That's a lot more than a fortune.

63
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,520
According to the law, the government

64
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,220
(Lingxi)
keeps the family property

65
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,080
of those who lost their parents.

66
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,000
It can be withdrawn
once they become householders.

67
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,000
Are you going to marry into the Fan Clan?

68
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,710
If so,

69
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,080
my property will become theirs.

70
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:59,310
The Luo Clan from Jingyang
only allows people in,

71
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,630
not out.

72
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,170
All girls can take in husbands,

73
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,030
including me.

74
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,800
Hua,

75
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,150
do you still remember

76
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,470
our family motto?

77
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,520
"Never give up.

78
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,870
Bring honor to the clan."

79
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:14,870
That's right.

80
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,460
Once I find a matrilocal husband,

81
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,920
the great Luo Clan from Jingyang

82
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,510
will regain its former glory.

83
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,190
So you can't be married off.

84
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,320
Exactly.

85
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,640
Here you go.

86
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,920
We're going out.

87
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,360
I can plan my escape route.

88
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,800
Escaping from my wedding is like

89
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,970
playing with fire after all.

90
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,110
Let's go.

91
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,310
Lingxi, put the veiled hat on me.

92
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,400
Yes, My Lady.

93
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,060
(Luo Residence)

94
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,750
Miss Luo's turning 24!

95
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,070
She's coming out!

96
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,130
She's out!

97
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,680
She's out! She's out!

98
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,120
- Miss Luo!
- Miss Luo!

99
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,000
- Miss Luo!
- Miss Luo!

100
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,270
- Miss Luo!
- Miss Luo!

101
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:14,950
Miss Luo!

102
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,190
- How gorgeous!
- Miss Luo! Miss Luo!

103
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,270
No, thanks. Thank you.

104
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,950
- Excuse me.
- Coming through.

105
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,480
Thank you. Thanks, everyone.

106
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:29,920
Be careful.

107
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,470
Miss Luo!

108
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,800
Thank you. Thanks.

109
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,230
Miss Luo!

110
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
Miss Luo, this is my drawing.

111
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,860
I made this portrait for you.

112
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,750
You can give it to me, sir.

113
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,230
Sure.

114
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,510
She's captivating!

115
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,190
Miss Luo, how do you stay so slim?

116
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,240
Are there any tips?

117
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,480
My sister doesn't eat...

118
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,840
She doesn't eat.

119
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,590
Write it down.

120
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,560
No tips. I'm born this way.

121
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,880
Miss Luo,

122
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:02,120
I own a gold store.

123
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,040
These East Pearls are for you.

124
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,610
Miss Luo,

125
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,360
I made a gown with various birds' feathers.

126
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,070
Come to my shop to try it on.

127
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,630
I just created this face cream.

128
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:13,390
I got this bracelet from the Cloud Temple.

129
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,800
Please take it.

130
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,660
(100 Taels, 50 Taels, 15 Taels)
Look at my gift.

131
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,680
(One Copper)
Look at mine! This is my gift!

132
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,000
This is our family heirloom.

133
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,430
Look at my gift, Miss Luo.

134
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,360
Take a look.

135
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,680
Thank you, sweetie.

136
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,600
It's so nice of you to prepare these gifts.

137
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,630
But things like pearls are too expensive.

138
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,360
I don't deserve them.

139
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,560
I'm taking her bracelet from the temple

140
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,630
because it's the thought that counts.

141
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,840
Thank you.

142
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,750
My gown is out of this world!

143
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,320
Thank you.

144
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,630
- Miss Luo!
- See you. Goodbye.

145
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:53,430
Sister, that's a huge pearl!

146
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,800
Don't you regret turning it down?

147
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,080
Yes.

148
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,190
Of course I do.

149
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,510
But you win some, you lose some.

150
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,430
Pearls might be expensive,

151
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,600
but they can be bought.

152
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,000
If I took them,

153
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,310
others would think

154
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,800
such valuables could please me.

155
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:16,160
That bracelet is the opposite.

156
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:19,160
They think I'm not greedy at all.

157
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,480
I deserve the best things in the world.

158
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,920
You're brilliant.

159
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,510
You can always

160
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,160
prettify your greed so well.

161
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,000
You...

162
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,270
You're mean.

163
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,910
Hey, you.

164
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,210
I'll take my usual spot.

165
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,800
I'm really sorry, sir.

166
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,630
He's booked the whole floor.

167
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,800
You may eat downstairs, sirs.

168
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,400
Fine.

169
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:51,270
This way, please.

170
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,140
(Lu Yun)

171
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:04,240
We've followed that Beichu trade caravan

172
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,230
all the way here.

173
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,600
They should enter the city today.

174
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,830
They pretend to be a caravan for trade,

175
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,560
so someone must be in town
to pick up the goods.

176
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,770
When their carriages arrive,

177
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,190
we'll follow them.

178
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:16,380
Yes.

179
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,800
Whatever it takes,

180
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,720
I'll find out who the traitor is

181
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,000
today.

182
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,220
(The caravan has got in.)

183
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,230
They're in.

184
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,350
There they are.

185
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,550
They aren't afraid of committing treason

186
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,790
- Move!
- to smuggle saltpeter to Beichu.

187
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,840
I bet they're up to something even bigger.

188
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,040
Let's go.

189
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,040
Yes.

190
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:53,700
(Tingyu House)

191
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:09,630
- Miss Luo!
- Miss Luo! Miss Luo!

192
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,630
Zhao Yuan, follow them.

193
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:15,750
Yes.

194
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,080
Who's this man

195
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,550
going so over the top

196
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,200
to draw my attention?

197
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,960
"Large as the peony is,

198
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,320
it's useless with an empty branch."

199
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,630
She got in my way.

200
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Miss Luo,

201
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,840
you're indeed blessed.

202
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,870
Young Master Fan is so eager to marry you

203
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:50,720
that he's had 100 cases
of betrothal gifts sent to the Luo's.

204
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,960
How sweet!

205
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,550
He can't wait to tie the knot with you.

206
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,600
Tomorrow is your wedding day!

207
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,390
Great!

208
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:00,910
Congratulations!

209
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,110
I knew it.

210
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,300
Ever since I became old enough to marry,

211
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,910
Fan Qingchen has come to propose every year.

212
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,390
I could make excuses to stall the wedding,

213
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,150
but now that I'm 24,

214
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,720
it can't be delayed anymore.

215
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,260
(Map of Shuozhou)

216
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,510
(That girl ruined my plan.)

217
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,440
(Has Zhao Yuan kept up with them?)

218
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,000
I can't believe Miss Luo is

219
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,510
going to marry Young Master Fan.

220
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,440
Wake up. She'll never marry you.

221
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,560
You...

222
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,130
("Marry Young Master Fan"?)

223
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,870
Miss Luo didn't take these flowers.

224
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,840
Let's give them to this gentleman.

225
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,680
Here you go, sir.

226
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,240
No, thanks. No, no, no...

227
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,860
(Luo Residence)

228
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,120
What to do?

229
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,510
Lingyu,

230
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,030
why are you back so late?

231
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,670
Young Master Fan has been waiting for you.

232
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,600
Come here!

233
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,350
Lingyu.

234
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,150
Greetings, Young Master Fan.

235
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:24,020
(Fan Qingchen)

236
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,270
Young Master Fan,

237
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,440
you're a charming young man.

238
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:31,600
Only beauties like Lingyu

239
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,120
can be your match.

240
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:36,630
Others are somewhat beneath you.

241
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:37,870
Indeed, indeed.

242
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:38,710
Don't you agree?

243
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,080
Lingyu,

244
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,440
I'm here with the letter of marriage.

245
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,480
The two of them are a perfect match.

246
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,750
Your wedding day is tomorrow.

247
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,560
Please sign the letter, Miss Luo.

248
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,500
(Letter of Marriage)

249
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,790
Lingxi, brush and ink, please.

250
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,110
Yes.

251
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,030
The two of you

252
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,670
will grow old together

253
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,910
and have tons of children

254
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,240
to expand your family.

255
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,390
Fortune will fill your house.

256
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,120
What's wrong, Lingyu?

257
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,870
Uncle, Aunt,

258
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,200
I remember

259
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,150
my late mother left a set of jewelry to me.

260
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,360
You said when I got married,

261
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,550
you'd pass it to me.

262
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,790
Will you keep your promise?

263
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,390
Yes, of course.

264
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,680
Yes.

265
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:00,710
Lingyu,

266
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,720
sign the letter.

267
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,840
I'll put that set of jewelry

268
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:07,670
in your dowry.

269
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,670
Yes, that's right.

270
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,510
Aunt,

271
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:12,080
Fan's betrothal gifts

272
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:14,510
stretch for miles.

273
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,000
In return, Luo's dowry

274
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,630
should match theirs.

275
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,270
If it's too little,

276
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,960
others will say

277
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,790
our family's fawning on the Fan Clan.

278
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:28,240
Young Master Fan will look like a fool.

279
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,800
Financially speaking,

280
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:32,240
although we aren't half as rich as them,

281
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:35,960
we can't make Young Master Fan look bad.

282
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,360
Well...

283
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,550
when she put it like that,

284
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,750
it was as if we disregarded his dignity.

285
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:45,710
We...

286
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,270
What are you waiting for?

287
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,280
You...

288
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,550
Fetch that set of jewelry!

289
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:51,990
Now!

290
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,510
I'm going.

291
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,030
- Hurry.
- I'm going.

292
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:58,990
Lingyu,

293
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,320
I don't mind the things you just said,

294
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,870
but I'm so glad

295
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,630
that you care about me.

296
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:08,720
It's the least I can do

297
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:09,920
for you.

298
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,960
This is the full set.

299
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:26,510
I see.

300
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,870
I'm relieved now.

301
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,080
And the letter...

302
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,680
The letter?

303
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,980
(Signed by Fan Qingchen)

304
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,320
Take a look.

305
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,420
(Luo Lingyu)

306
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:03,630
Lingyu,

307
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,240
this day has finally come.

308
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,080
I think the same.

309
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,270
That ingrate

310
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,320
used the Fan Clan

311
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,320
to take away that set of jewelry from me!

312
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,440
I'm so mad!

313
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,000
Darling,

314
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,270
no pain, no gain.

315
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,360
We've got the money from the Fan Clan.

316
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,870
It's fine to give her some dowry.

317
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,240
Over here. Put them here. Here.

318
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,390
That's not right!

319
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,750
We found a perfect husband for her.

320
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,630
Instead of thanking us,

321
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,270
she's making us prepare her dowry.

322
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,080
How greedy and ungrateful!

323
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,080
Alright. You may leave.

324
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,350
- Yes.
- Yes.

325
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,670
What a bunch of boneheads.

326
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,870
Darling,

327
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,720
you picked up a pile of new clothes earlier,

328
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,150
but they didn't fit, right?

329
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,360
Don't rub it in!

330
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,320
It's a pity to see them go to waste.

331
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,480
Stuff them in this case

332
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,870
as her dowry.

333
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,510
Fill it up with waste.

334
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,270
That'll do, right?

335
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,670
I'm packing up the stall, Miss.

336
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,030
I'll give you a discount.

337
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,240
No, thanks.

338
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,470
Young Master.

339
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:30,990
Did you find them?

340
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,870
That caravan made a swap halfway,

341
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:33,990
but

342
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,630
I managed to track down one man

343
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,710
who entered the Fan's.

344
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:37,870
Fan Mansion?

345
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,870
Those of Beichu are wildly audacious.

346
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,550
Whoever is in cahoots with them

347
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,480
must be rich or powerful.

348
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,200
I knew it.

349
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,600
Only the top Imperial Merchant Clan,

350
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,420
the Fan Clan, could act without scruple.

351
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,240
It's easy to obtain the map

352
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,670
but hard to sneak in.

353
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,000
The Fan Mansion is huge.

354
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,600
Four squads are guarding it in shifts.

355
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:06,240
I tried my best but failed to get in.

356
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,400
There's a perfect chance.

357
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,550
Tomorrow, their sole heir is

358
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,350
going to marry Miss Luo.

359
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:19,160
Fan's son is marrying Luo's daughter?

360
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,400
Tomorrow is our big day.

361
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,120
We can't bring too many things.

362
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,440
Mother left

363
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,000
this set of jewelry to us.

364
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,880
I'll put those pieces on

365
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,070
in case Uncle and Aunt get suspicious.

366
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,640
I'll bring my toy, Yellow.

367
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,880
I'll pack up all our valuables.

368
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,240
A thousand days' training

369
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,590
is for one day's battle.

370
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:56,270
We've waited for so long to act tomorrow.

371
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:11,630
Keep up.

372
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,520
Come on!

373
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,550
Don't be so slow.

374
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,000
This is it, the biggest case.

375
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,480
Why should I hide inside?

376
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:31,000
- You're thin.
- Me?

377
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:45,140
When the wedding sedan
reaches Chen's stall tomorrow,

378
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:45,980
(Grocery Stall)

379
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,100
- people will surround it
- Give us something.

380
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,640
to get food, drinks, and money.

381
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,960
(Surround)
Share your luck.

382
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,800
Lingxi,

383
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:54,160
sneak out with our belongings beforehand.

384
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,110
Hire a horse to wait here.

385
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,580
When the sedan is surrounded,

386
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,720
I'll get out with Hua.

387
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,320
When I ride,

388
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,030
no one can stop me.

389
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,350
Remember to rent a boat.

390
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,790
We'll meet you at the dock.

391
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,510
- Understand?
- Yes, My Lady.

392
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,380
Listen, the goods

393
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:12,360
in the warehouse
and the account book in the study

394
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,240
are most important.

395
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,190
Let's split up.

396
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,740
I'll take the study. You, the warehouse.

397
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:16,470
Yes.

398
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,350
Be sharp and swift tomorrow.

399
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,110
Do not make any mistakes.

400
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,240
Hua, be swift tomorrow.

401
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,400
Stay close to me.

402
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,640
Make sure the dowry

403
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,880
enters the Fan Mansion, understand?

404
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,830
To be safer,

405
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,190
Lingxi,

406
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,880
tie another horse outside the Fan's tomorrow.

407
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,160
Yes, My Lady.

408
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,220
(Fan Mansion)

409
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,640
Remember, the sooner the better.

410
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,270
This case looks airtight.

411
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,560
Yes.

412
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:53,680
A girl's getting married.

413
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,960
Her dowry case looks big,

414
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,030
but only clothes are in it,

415
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,590
and they're so old-fashioned.

416
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,200
What a stingy family.

417
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,520
I'm getting in.

418
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,800
Careful.

419
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,760
Young Master,

420
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,840
sleep tight.

421
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,220
(Luo Residence)

422
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,830
Why hasn't she come out?

423
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:26,670
Right.

424
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,020
(Double Happiness)

425
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:36,630
Sister.

426
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,510
Let's go.

427
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,310
Use more strength.

428
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,550
Why is it so heavy?

429
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,160
One more time. Try again.

430
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,590
I'll go check.

431
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:04,430
What's wrong?

432
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:05,390
It's too heavy.

433
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:07,950
I'll try.

434
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:29,160
(Is my dowry so heavy?)

435
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:37,200
This case is heavier than others.

436
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,070
It must be filled with my dowry.

437
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,350
I thought Uncle and Aunt

438
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:44,070
would send me away with empty cases,

439
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,960
but they prepared so many things

440
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,400
for the sake of the Fan Clan.

441
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:49,920
Miss Luo,

442
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,310
it's about time.

443
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,590
Please hurry up.

444
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,550
Carry it.

445
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,880
Yes, My Lady.

446
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,790
Hua, let's go.

447
00:22:59,000 --> 00:22:59,840
Sure.

448
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,920
- Come on.
- Yellow.

449
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:03,630
Let's go.

450
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,350
Calm down.

451
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,750
Finally, we can marry her off.

452
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,980
(Luo Residence)

453
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:07,630
You two come here.

454
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:10,670
Be careful.

455
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,590
It's the dowry from Mr. and Mrs. Luo.

456
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,560
Don't drop it.

457
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,400
The time has come.

458
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,480
Heaven and earth are watching.

459
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:22,000
(Luo Residence)
The sunlight shines on the sedan.

460
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:24,440
Fortune will be granted.

461
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,920
Rise.

462
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,590
Those four cases of dowry

463
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:34,550
for Fan's betrothal gifts. It's a great deal!

464
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,480
Congratulations, Miss Luo!

465
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:48,590
Best wishes!

466
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:50,510
(We've arrived at the stall.)

467
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,800
Come on.

468
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,110
- Come.
- Young Master,

469
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:55,040
- we're surrounded.
- Curtains are spread.

470
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,920
The sedan's surrounded.

471
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,550
The bride's dressed up

472
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,480
to marry Young Master Fan.

473
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,030
Good!

474
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,720
Congratulations, sir!

475
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,480
(Looks like step one succeeded.)

476
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,620
(Succeeded)

477
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:11,670
Sister.

478
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,520
Congratulations.

479
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,960
It's time to act.

480
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:18,400
(Can I get into the Fan's?)

481
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:20,790
There's money! Money!

482
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:22,750
- Whose servant is that?
- Money!

483
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:23,960
He's dropping money. Let's go!

484
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,160
- Come!
- Money over there!

485
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,400
(Why did they run away?)

486
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:27,430
Over here.

487
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:28,430
Come here.

488
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:32,160
Where did that clumsy servant come from?

489
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,070
Sister, what to do?

490
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:34,910
Over here.

491
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,110
(Zhao Yuan is being swift.)

492
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,030
Rise. Make way.

493
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,040
The sedan is up.

494
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,080
Let's go.

495
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:46,270
Keep going. I haven't got any money.

496
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:48,670
(Go away, everyone.)

497
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:49,870
(Enter the mansion.)

498
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,590
(Young Master can't hold it anymore.)

499
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,920
(Can I get into the Fan's now?)

500
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,440
(Luckily, I asked Lingxi to prepare)

501
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,460
(another horse yesterday.)

502
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,300
(Succeeded)

503
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,500
(Failed)

504
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,580
(Fan Mansion)

505
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,800
Lingyu,

506
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,150
we've arrived.

507
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,550
Sister!

508
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:24,480
Sister, don't leave me!

509
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,160
- Hua, listen to me.
- Sister.

510
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,320
Step one failed.

511
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,830
I can only count on you now.

512
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,350
Go get some firewood.

513
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,720
Why hasn't Miss Luo got off?

514
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,270
We can't be late.

515
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:36,680
Yes. What's happening?

516
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:41,270
Young Master Fan, we can't be late.

517
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,240
You're right, Lingyu.

518
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:48,160
Fortune has been bestowed.

519
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:50,510
The bride can get off.

520
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:54,460
(Fan Mansion)

521
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:06,910
Congratulations!

522
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,070
What a perfect match!

523
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,440
What a perfect match!

524
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,920
She's gorgeous.

525
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,440
Bow to each other!

526
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,680
Complete!

527
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:40,830
Congratulations!

528
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:44,510
Let me take you to your room.

529
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,440
Don't cry.

530
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:47,960
Come back to visit us.

531
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,400
Where's that wild Luo Yunhua?

532
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,550
Did she run away again?

533
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:55,350
Don't worry. It's her sister's big day.

534
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,750
She won't ruin it.

535
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:01,920
I can hardly walk!

536
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:03,590
Keep going.

537
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:04,910
Let's go.

538
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,070
(Finally, I'm in.)

539
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:10,920
(I have to find the study fast.)

540
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:17,030
Sister said to choose an important room.

541
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,550
Do it outside without hurting anyone.

542
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,830
(Siqi Chamber)

543
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:22,670
There it is.

544
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,030
I'll go get more.

545
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,270
(A tiger in the bridal chamber?)

546
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,720
(How bizarre!)

547
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,720
My Lady,

548
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,030
this is the bridal chamber.

549
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,720
This is it.

550
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:18,910
Careful.

551
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:23,000
You may take a rest.

552
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Young Master Fan

553
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,720
will come after the banquet.

554
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,000
Thank you so much.

555
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,920
Make yourself at home.

556
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,440
(Let's see what valuables)

557
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,960
(Uncle and Aunt prepared for me.)

558
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,470
(Pack them up before leaving.)

559
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:04,950
What...?

560
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:13,350
(I knew they wouldn't be so nice to me.)

561
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,550
It's just clothes.

562
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,270
Not heavy at all.

563
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:25,020
(To Fan Qingchen)

564
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,500
(This room is near the corner gate.)

565
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,480
(Although guards are everywhere,)

566
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,510
(it's possible to sneak out in chaos.)

567
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:42,400
(These head jewelry is too heavy.)

568
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,030
(They will slow me down when I run.)

569
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:21,590
Who is it?

570
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,880
Stop right there!

571
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,550
No wonder my dowry was heavy.

572
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,000
You stole everything!

573
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,240
(A thief?)

574
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,200
(That's help from heaven!)

575
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:45,910
the study...

576
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:47,790
Help!

577
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:49,480
Catch the thief!

578
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:51,550
Go! Catch him!

579
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,720
Where is it? Catch him!

580
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,920
- Go!
- Catch him!

581
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,520
Catch the thief!

582
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,590
- Catch the thief!
- Catch the thief!

583
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,150
Catch the thief!

584
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:08,350
Go! Catch him!

585
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:18,920
Who is the thief?

586
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,280
Catch the thief!

587
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:22,240
- Catch the thief!
- Help!

588
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,910
- Where's the thief?
- Come on!

589
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,310
- Still looking.
- Catch him!

590
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:26,160
No one shall find

591
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,830
- any trace of Beichu.
- Yes.

592
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:29,750
- The bride ran away! Catch her!
- There!

593
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,480
Help! She's gone!

594
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,960
The bride ran away...

595
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,840
The study.

596
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:43,550
- How dare he set me up!
- Catch him!

597
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,480
Catch the thief!

598
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,400
Help! The bride ran away!

599
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,520
She ran away?

600
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,960
Go to the bridal chamber.

601
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,960
Come on. Let's go.

602
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:53,200
Catch the thief!

603
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:55,960
Thief? Catch him first.

604
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,350
- Yes. Over there.
- Catch him!

605
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:58,680
Catch the thief!

606
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,380
(Siqi Chamber)

607
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,150
Who put firewood outside the study?

608
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,320
A Luban Lock.

609
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,800
Hua.

610
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,800
Hua!

611
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:48,990
Hua!

612
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,120
Sister!

613
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,070
Sister!

614
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:52,870
Where's the firewood?

615
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:53,910
Over there.

616
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,630
Why are they looking for the bride?

617
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,710
He's smart.

618
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:57,550
I'm not dumb either.

619
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:59,190
Let's make a fire and...

620
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:01,470
Sister!

621
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,320
It's knocked down, Sister!

622
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,630
First, a thief stole my dowry.

623
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,400
Then someone messed up the firewood.

624
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,720
It's fine. Calm down.

625
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:15,590
This is only a little setback.

626
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,240
Saltpeter?

631

800...

632
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:14,110
Help! The thief's in the study!

633
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,050
Catch him!

634
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,630
That girl again!

635
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:19,800
Thief! Catch the thief!

636
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,640
Hua!

637
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,800
He's in the study!

638
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,630
I should've had Xian do divination

639
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:25,950
- before I left.
- Thief!

640
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,920
- I've been in bad luck since I arrived.
- Thief!

641
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,280
Catch the thief!

642
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:36,510
Who's there?

643
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:41,960
The thief escaped.

644
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,670
Find him and silence him.

645
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,110
Yes. Let's go!

646
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:49,390
You,

647
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,150
bring back my bride.

648
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,720
Yes, sir.

649
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,280
Young Master.

650
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,840
Did you find it?

651
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,010
Let's go.

652
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:16,320
Put on the mask to be safe, Young Master.

653
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,160
Sure.

654
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:24,150
Come on, Hua. We have to get out.

655
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:26,470
Run!

656
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:30,230
The horse Lingxi got should be near.

657
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,280
Over there, Sister!

658
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,640
Let's go.

659
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:36,800
There it is. Hop on, Sister.

660
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,280
Hua, this one is faster.

661
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:42,710
I knew I could trust Lingxi.

662
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,210
Where did she get a fine horse?

663
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:49,920
Sister, I'm a bit scared.

664
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,240
We're descendants of a hero.

665
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:53,110
Nothing can scare us.

666
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:03,190
She managed to get out.

667
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,290
That young lady is a charming rider.

668
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,760
That's my horse!
