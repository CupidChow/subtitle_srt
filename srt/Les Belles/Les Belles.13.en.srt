23
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,580
(Zhongshan Villa)

24
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:09,050
Your gift is truly wonderful.

25
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:13,850
How did you think of the sword dance?

26
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,540
I am from the North.

27
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,610
I know well the harshness of the border.

28
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:20,770
During marches, there's little for amusement.

29
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,900
We often use weapons in our dances.

30
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,260
So I created this dance

31
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,180
to bless southern Yuezhou.

32
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,380
I will protect the Northern Border

33
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,540
to fulfill your vision of peace.

34
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,380
Miss Luo,

35
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,620
you've put so much effort today.

36
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:43,760
I must do something for you in return.

37
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,690
Is there anything you desire?

38
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:48,020
I will strive to fulfill it.

39
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,100
This is what I should do.

40
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,180
However,

41
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,650
since you asked me,

42
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,690
I indeed face a dilemma.

43
00:02:58,410 --> 00:02:59,460
I wonder

44
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,490
if you could help me resolve it.

45
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:02,940
Miss Luo, please speak.

46
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,050
When I was in Shuozhou,

47
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,290
my Uncle and Aunt disregarded my wishes,

48
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,290
and sold me to Fan Qingchen as his wife,

49
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:14,820
arranging a marriage with the Fan Family.

50
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:16,900
A marriage?

51
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,380
Fan Qingchen?

52
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,650
That's why I happened to encounter him

53
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,650
when I visited the Lu Mansion twice.

54
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,650
But I have no feelings for him.

55
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:33,050
Before I left,

56
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,570
I left a letter with Fan Qingchen,

57
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,020
indicating I didn't want to marry him.

58
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:41,460
But he actually followed me to Yuezhou.

59
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,340
I really had no choice.

60
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,020
Miss Luo, no need to say more.

61
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:48,260
I will resolve this matter for you.

62
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,290
Though I haven't known you for long,

63
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,850
I feel as if we are old friends.

64
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,650
I consider you a friend.

65
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,320
When my friend is in trouble,

66
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,020
naturally, I will help.

67
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:16,460
Thank you very much, Your Highness.

68
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,570
It's a trivial matter.

69
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,660
No need to thank me.

70
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:20,210
When I return,

71
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,300
I will draft a letter

72
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,180
and send it to the Fan Family

73
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,570
to completely end this engagement.

74
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,370
Thank you, Your Highness.

75
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,290
Lingyu,

76
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,250
I will make you return to me willingly.

77
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,530
Miss Luo.

78
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,180
Why is the door open?

79
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,060
Miss Luo,

80
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:20,570
it's time to freshen up.

81
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,130
We're heading back today.

82
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,570
Young lady is still waiting at home.

83
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:29,930
Miss Luo!

84
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:31,970
Miss Luo!

85
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:34,780
Miss Luo!

86
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:37,650
Oh no!

87
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:38,900
Miss Luo is missing!

88
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,180
What should I do now?

89
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,780
(Zhongshan Villa)

90
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:47,810
Lingxi.

91
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,370
I received news Miss Luo is missing.

92
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,500
What happened?

93
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,130
What happened, Lingxi?

94
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,530
I called Miss Luo to get up.

95
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:56,780
But she wasn't in the room.

96
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,780
I searched the whole courtyard,

97
00:05:58,780 --> 00:05:59,850
but I couldn't find her.

98
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:02,410
Miss Luo would never leave for this long,

99
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:03,420
without leaving a message.

100
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,460
Something must have happened to her.

101
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,740
Among the guests who left yesterday,

102
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,370
was there anyone suspicious?

103
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,690
Your Highness, the guards reported

104
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,290
the Fan's coachman came yesterday,

105
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,530
saying Mr. Fan would go back soon

106
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,090
and came to bid farewell to you.

107
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,340
But he didn't have an invitation,

108
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,320
so he wasn't allowed to enter.

109
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,250
Fan Qingchen?

110
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,500
Fan Qingchen is sly and deceitful.

111
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,130
He has long coveted Miss Luo.

112
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,060
He chased from Shuozhou to Yuezhou.

113
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,290
He also shamelessly came

114
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,410
to ask for Miss Luo.

115
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,500
It must be him.

116
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:30,850
He is surely relentless,

117
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,570
so he took Miss Luo away.

118
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,660
How stubborn this person is.

119
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,220
Huo Dao, send someone to find them.

120
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,660
- If you find Fan Qingchen
- Jinchuan.

121
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,590
and other's whereabouts,

122
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:42,770
Understood.

123
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,250
- capture them immediately.
- Got it.

124
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:45,370
Wait.

125
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:51,060
Tracks.

126
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,830
They are left by Fan Qingchen.

127
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:56,980
The tracks are still fresh.

128
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:58,130
They shouldn't be far.

129
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,500
Sir.

130
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,020
- Await my news.
- Got it.

131
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,340
Huo Dao.

132
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,530
Send soldiers to follow the tracks.

133
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,780
Got it.

134
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,290
Move quickly.

135
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,980
Don't miss the auspicious time.

136
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,210
- Okay.
- Understood.

137
00:07:58,530 --> 00:07:59,570
(Where am I?)

138
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:02,860
(This is...)

139
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:03,940
(A wedding dress?)

140
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,090
(Could it be...)

141
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:37,490
Lingyu,

142
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:45,460
I know you're awake.

143
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:52,740
Young Master Fan.

144
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:56,730
Why are you here?

145
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,860
Why am I wearing this?

146
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:03,370
Lingyu, don't worry.

147
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,820
This wedding dress

148
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,930
was put on by a bridal attendant.

149
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,050
The dress is the same as that day.

150
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,170
You won't be wronged.

151
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,420
Where am I now?

152
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,100
Shouldn't I be in Zhongshan?

153
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,130
Zhongshan...

154
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:22,050
You had a great conversation

155
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:23,290
with Prince Hengyang last night.

156
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:25,980
I saw you smiling beautifully.

157
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:29,050
It truly made me feel sad.

158
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,250
Lingyu,

159
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,860
my belongings

160
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,490
cannot be touched or seen by others.

161
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,980
Not even a glance or a touch.

162
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:44,730
Since you're being so disobedient,

163
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,490
I should give you a minor punishment.

164
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,690
But I love you deeply.

165
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,050
If you suffer even a bit,

166
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:55,930
I couldn't bear it.

167
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:02,660
I didn't expect you

168
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,780
to care about me so much.

169
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:08,690
Once we get married today,

170
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,100
I'll ask someone

171
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,780
to announce your status as Mrs. Fan

172
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:15,980
and let everyone know it.

173
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,900
Let this minor punishment

174
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:19,220
serve as a lesson.

175
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:20,570
What do you think?

176
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,100
I've prepared the finest ink.

177
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,220
After you write your name

178
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,020
(Fan Qingchen)
on this letter of marriage,

179
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,980
from then on, others will call you

180
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,730
Mrs. Fan.

181
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,690
I didn't know your intentions before.

182
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:58,810
I understand it now.

183
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,370
I am willing to marry you.

184
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,730
But I left so suddenly,

185
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,420
Lingxi would be anxious to find me.

186
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,980
If this becomes a big issue,

187
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,490
it might cause unnecessary trouble.

188
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,170
- How about...
- Your words

189
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:14,810
remind me

190
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:16,810
of Lingxi and Hua

191
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,860
growing up with you.

192
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,050
I wonder, after our marriage,

193
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:26,300
do you want them to stay at the Lu Clan,

194
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,860
or bring them to live with us?

195
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,130
Lingyu, don't be sad.

196
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,490
I didn't expect you to miss them so much.

197
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:15,860
Lingyu,

198
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,490
tell me

199
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:23,020
how others will call you in the future.

200
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,250
Darling, are you missing Hua?

201
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,460
Shall I send someone now

202
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,620
to bring her from the Lu Clan?

203
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:49,730
Mrs. Fan.

204
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,580
(Mrs. Fan)

205
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:14,420
It's near the city gate.

206
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:15,690
There're too many carriages.

207
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,980
It's hard to distinguish.

208
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,540
Huo Dao, after entering the city,

209
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,460
search house by house.

210
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:22,570
Yes, sir.

211
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:25,900
The rest, follow me.

212
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,340
Go ask the nearby residents.

213
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,130
We must find Fan Qingchen.

214
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,740
Luo Lingyu,

215
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,860
where are you?

216
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,540
Lingyu, wait for a moment.

217
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:50,780
I will go arrange

218
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,810
the wedding hall now.

219
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:03,000
Once the auspicious time arrives,

220
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,660
we'll hold a wedding ceremony.

221
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,250
You will know soon

222
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:16,690
how much I love you.

223
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:46,220
(Lingxi will notice my disappearance,)

224
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,740
(but I don't know)

225
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,810
(if she can find the fragrant dew.)

226
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:55,100
Who are you? Where are you going?

227
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,060
Get some sleep.

228
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,020
(I can't just wait.)

229
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:38,770
Huo Dao.

230
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:41,700
Nothing.

231
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,540
Everyone, search every house thoroughly.

232
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:53,610
Don't miss anyone.

233
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:54,910
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

234
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,490
Have you seen a lady

235
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,330
- this tall?
- No.

236
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,540
- Have you seen
- This tall.

237
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,220
a lady this tall?

238
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,060
With long hair.

239
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,010
Have you seen her?

240
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,130
(It's harder to leave traces on the gravel.)

241
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:11,420
(No similar tracks was found.)

242
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,940
(Perhaps I should return to the villa)

243
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,490
(to check for more clues in her room.)

244
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,130
Where does the scent come from? So familiar.

245
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,780
How could you use a girl's handkerchief?

246
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,020
It's the dew from Luo Lingyu.

247
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:53,370
Excuse me.

248
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,540
It's done.

249
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,980
The auspicious time is approaching.

250
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:35,540
Lingyu, please tell me,

251
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,700
if others ask in the future,

252
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,540
how would you refer to yourself?

253
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,850
Mrs. Fan.

254
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,730
I can hardly hear you.

255
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:50,180
Lingyu,

256
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,820
could you say it again?

257
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:56,700
Lingyu,

258
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,780
say it again.

259
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,610
- Let go of me.
- Lingyu.

260
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,540
You were pretending just now.

261
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:11,730
Do you think

262
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,220
someone will come to save you?

263
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,850
Lingyu, don't be foolish.

264
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,820
Let go of me.

265
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:21,860
Lingyu,

266
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:23,330
you're hurt.

267
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:30,210
I have always loved you sincerely.

268
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,610
Why don't you give me a chance?

269
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:34,450
You take what you want.

270
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:35,850
Do you truly love me?

271
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,780
You only love yourself.

272
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,730
I don't ask for your love.

273
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,970
I only ask you to stay by my side.

274
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:57,420
Is that too much?

275
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:07,900
Let me go.

276
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:38,980
(Joyful and happy)

277
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,660
Lingyu!

278
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,090
(It's right in front of me.)

279
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:00,780
(The gate is there.)

280
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:02,810
(Hurry up.)

281
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,610
(Faster.)

282
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,210
(Luo Lingyu,)

283
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,420
(you cannot be taken back.)

284
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,450
I will not marry you.

285
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:21,700
♪It's hard to see through fate♪

286
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:22,900

I'm here.

Put her down.

300
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,420
Fan Qingchen.

301
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,730
I shouldn't let you stay in Yuezhou,

302
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:23,250
so that she was trapped in such danger.

303
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,370
If you harm her again,

304
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:32,970
I won't spare you.

305
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:34,860
Seize him.

306
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:35,860
Yes, sir.

307
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:43,020
Miss Luo was imprisoned for long.

308
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:44,900
And she was terribly frightened.

309
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,550
I'll take her back first.

310
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:54,090
Huo Dao, let Mr. Sun go to the Lu Mansion.

311
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,090
Yes, sir.

312
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,780
(Lu Mansion)

313
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:24,020
Sister, you just went to Zhongshan,

314
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,610
but came back like this.

315
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:27,450
Zhongshan...

316
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,610
Zhongshan...

317
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,610
Is Zhongshan so dangerous?

318
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:33,420
Young lady, please don't say that.

319
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,540
Quickly, touch wood.

320
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:35,620
Touch wood.

321
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,420
Mr. Sun, how is she?

322
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:42,690
How is it?

323
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:43,970
Did you find any issues?

324
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,260
Your Highness,

325
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,420
Miss Luo's symptoms are quite tricky.

326
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:59,180
What's wrong with my sister?

327
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,420
What illness does my sister have?

328
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,500
Sister!

329
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,130
Speak clearly.

330
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:05,370
What's going on?

331
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:06,850
Judging by the pulse,

332
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,060
Miss Luo's body is fine.

333
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,330
She just has some cuts on her wrist.

334
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:12,970
Apply some healing powder,

335
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:14,450
and she'll recover soon.

336
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:18,450
The wounds show no signs of infection.

337
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:21,490
Logically,

338
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,660
she shouldn't be unconscious this long.

339
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,820
How many days

340
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,490
until Miss Luo wakes?

341
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:30,420
I don't know, Your Highness.

342
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,620
You are the imperial physician.

343
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,200
You can't even cure such a minor illness.

344
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,020
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

345
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,900
How can you treat the nobles in the palace?

346
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,970
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

347
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:41,860
Your Highness,

348
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,210
don't make it difficult for Mr. Sun.

349
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:46,490
Mr. Sun is highly skilled.

350
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:48,940
Since even he can't see the symptoms,

351
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:55,780
it is likely Miss Luo has a mental ailment.

352
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,700
If she doesn't want to wake up,

353
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,060
even the best medicine

354
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:04,250
wouldn't be able to cure her.

355
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:11,810
Leave here.

356
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:14,990
Thank you, Your Highness.

357
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,820
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

358
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,500
Sister...

359
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,420
Sister...

360
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:52,020
Miss Luo has faced many difficulties.

361
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,180
Now she's frightened as well.

362
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,820
I will definitely make Fan Qingchen

363
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:00,450
give Miss Luo an explanation.

364
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,130
Fan Qingchen disregards the law,

365
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:20,490
and commits numerous misdeeds.

366
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:21,750
He's truly despicable.

367
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,420
I will not tolerate this

368
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:26,250
and will punish him severely,

369
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:28,700
to seek justice for Miss Luo.

370
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:35,180
The Fan Family donates a lot yearly.

371
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,730
Are you sure you haven't protected them?

372
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:42,130
Lu Xuechen, what do you take me for?

373
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,730
Is this why you conspired with Changyi

374
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,210
to ambush and attack me

375
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:51,250
on my way back?

376
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,060
Stop slandering me.

377
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:55,850
Instead of framing us,

378
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:57,020
why not think about

379
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,780
who you offended?

380
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:00,540
You're being irrational.

381
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:04,940
Miss Luo is still unconscious.

382
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,850
I won't argue with you on this.

383
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:10,940
Take good care of her these days.

384
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:12,540
If anything else happens,

385
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,370
I'll deal with you as well.

386
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,420
(Fragrant orchids)

387
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:33,880
Miss Luo looks so great riding a horse.

388
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,020
Sir,

389
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,660
I knew you'd be here.

390
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:55,850
The doctor said Zhao Yuan will recover soon.

391
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:57,850
He's recuperating at Xunmei House.

392
00:26:59,020 --> 00:26:59,860
I see.

393
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,660
Sir, are you worried about Miss Luo?

394
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,260
Today,

395
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:16,420
she seems different from before.

396
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:20,540
Miss Luo encountered danger today.

397
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:22,210
She was subject to great stress.

398
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:24,540
Anyone would react like this.

399
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:28,850
Sir, don't overthink it.

400
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:32,020
You don't understand.

401
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:35,900
She's different from others.

402
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,250
In the past, even if the sky fell,

403
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,450
she would find a way to fix it.

404
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:44,730
But today...

What on earth is going on?

00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:18,250
How is Miss Luo now?

411
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,130
Miss Zhu, please lower your voice.

412
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,730
Don't disturb Lingyu's rest.

She has been unconscious for two days.

00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:50,970
Why hasn't she woken up yet?

420
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,820
Perhaps in the past few days,

421
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,330
she's exhausted too much energy

422
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,850
and needs to gradually recover.

I have already expelled Fan Qingchen.

431
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:35,130
He'll never set foot in Yuezhou again.

432
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,780
(Xuewu Courtyard)

433
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,530
When the auspicious time comes,

434
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:54,330
we'll hold a wedding ceremony.

435
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,540
You will see

436
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,700
how deeply I love you.

437
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:02,290
Lingyu,

438
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:03,820
could you say it again?

439
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:06,540
I can barely hear it.

440
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,020
Do you think

441
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:10,530
someone will come to save you?

442
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,490
Let go of me.

443
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,260
I have to escape.

444
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,420
I can't be caught again.

445
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,020
This is Xuewu Courtyard.

446
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,210
It was a nightmare.

447
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:41,930
You're sleepy.

448
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:45,900
When will my sister wake up?

449
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:47,580
Is it soon?

450
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,850
Miss Luo will wake up soon. Don't worry.

451
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:52,540
I saw a little carp in my dream.

452
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:55,540
Lingyu must be getting better.

453
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,250
When my sister is well,

454
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:00,820
I will sleep with her.

455
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:02,970
Okay, Hua. Good girl.

456
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,020
Don't be afraid.

457
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:15,690
I'm here.

458
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:28,780
Sister!

459
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,250
Miss Luo, you're awake.

460
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:32,660
Sister, sister, you're finally awake.

461
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,290
You've been unconscious for three days.

462
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:36,250
It really scared me.

463
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:40,540
Don't cry, Hua.

464
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:42,540
See, I am fine.

465
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,540
It was just a little setback.

466
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:46,900
It's all over now.

467
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,210
I want to eat

468
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,130
locust leaf noodles from West Market.

469
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,330
Yes, My Lady.

470
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,130
Locust leaf noodles?

471
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:18,180
But all restaurants are closed now.

472
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:20,970
How about I go to the kitchen

473
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:22,900
and make you another bowl of noodles?

474
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:25,720
But I don't want to eat anything else.

475
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:26,740
All right.

476
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:29,210
Let's go.

477
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,220
Let's have locust leaf noodles.

478
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,850
You just woke up. Slow down.

479
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:49,170
It's fine.

480
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,420
(Zhang's Locust Leaf Noodles)

481
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:56,290
It's closed.

482
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:58,060
Let me knock on the door.

483
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:01,620
Excuse me.

484
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,730
Who is it? It's so late.

485
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:07,290
It is closed.

486
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:09,330
Please come tomorrow morning.

487
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:10,860
Wait.

488
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:12,090
What now?

489
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,820
Oh my dear!

490
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:18,240
Two bowls of locust leaf noodles.

491
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:19,210
Not just two bowls.

492
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,100
I can even give you this restaurant.

493
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,510
I'll cook it right away.

494
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,200
- I'll cook now, please wait.
- All right.

495
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:25,780
That's so great.

496
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:26,690
I am rich.

497
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:30,940
So,

498
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,540
you found me following the dew I left.

499
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:34,930
You,

500
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,260
are you really okay?

501
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:39,180
You have known me for a while.

502
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:41,420
It's just a minor issue.

503
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:42,940
After a few days of rest,

504
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,420
I will completely leave it all behind.

505
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:48,780
By the way,

506
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,850
why do you suddenly

507
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:52,070
want locust leaf noodles today?

508
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,680
Is there something special?

509
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:02,580
Actually, I've never tried them.

510
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:06,130
I've heard for a long time

511
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,330
that locust leaf noodles from Yuezhou

512
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:09,970
is delicious and flavorful.

513
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:14,060
But since I came to Yuezhou,

514
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:16,860
I've been constantly busy

515
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:18,260
and had no time to try it.

516
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,410
I'm not sure what I'm achieving.

517
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,100
You're doing great already.

518
00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:27,690
But even if I do well,

519
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,540
it's just repeating the past.

520
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:35,730
I fled from Shuozhou.

521
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:39,410
I thought I would be free.

522
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,580
But in the end,

523
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:45,690
I got further from the original goal.

524
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,730
After arriving in Yuezhou,

525
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,710
I have been busy with finding a husband,

526
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:54,380
just to reclaim the property quickly.

527
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,100
That's why I have been following you.

528
00:34:58,170 --> 00:34:59,450
I've caused you a lot of trouble.

529
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,420
I

530
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:11,300
apologize to you again.

531
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:25,020
But I didn't expect Fan Qingchen

532
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,780
to have chased me to Yuezhou.

533
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,860
He kept telling me

534
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:34,650
that one can't fight fate.

535
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,690
But I believe that human effort is key.

536
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:41,450
Until that day, I realized

537
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,650
why the elders always say

538
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:47,210
fate cannot be defied.

539
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:50,650
Why can't fate be defied?

540
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:53,490
From the first time I saw you

541
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:54,690
until now,

542
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:56,410
haven't you always fought

543
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:57,730
against your destiny?

544
00:35:58,250 --> 00:35:59,210
Last time

545
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:00,410
and this time,

546
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:01,970
you escaped successfully.

547
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,580
What about next time?

548
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:09,730
I feel trapped in a cycle,

549
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:11,820
always wanting to escape,

550
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,930
yet going in circles.

551
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:16,540
Even I,

552
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,730
can get tired.

553
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,730
Either sleeping,

554
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,540
or eating locust leaf noodles,

555
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:25,970
I just want to finish unfinished things,

556
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,890
without any hesitation.

557
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:34,490
Thanks to you

558
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:36,970
today.

559
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:53,930
Why drink so fast?

560
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,500
No one is competing with you.

561
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,930
I haven't had a drop of water for three days.

562
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,090
If it were you, you'd do the same.

563
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:09,980
Eat the noodles.

564
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:29,140
He really doesn't know how to console.

565
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:35,460
(Zhang's Locust Leaf Noodles)

566
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:41,490
Eat slowly.

567
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:47,250
Are two bowls enough?

568
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:48,820
I have some taels.

569
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:50,350
I'll buy you another bowl later.

570
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:51,450
Two bowls are enough.

571
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:54,250
Thank you for that.

572
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:56,410
Considering

573
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:57,780
you fulfill my small wish,

574
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:00,250
we are even.

575
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,450
From now on, you go your way

576
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:05,100
and I'll go mine.

577
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:09,580
What about your family property?

578
00:38:09,904 --> 00:38:10,910
Are you giving up on that?

579
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,040
Of course not.

580
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,960
However, lately I've realized

581
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,650
most things related to you

582
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,450
are unlikely

583
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:19,930
to be good.

584
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:22,340
To reclaim the family property,

585
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:24,380
I must rely on myself.

586
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,060
That's not necessarily true.

587
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,860
Someone who knows the intricacies

588
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:32,380
may be willing to help.

589
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:35,490
Mr. Lu, why do you say this?

590
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,100
You help me at Zhongshan.

591
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:38,690
I don't want to owe anyone.

592
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:40,690
I should help you with your goals.

593
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:44,580
Besides, didn't you also want

594
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,500
to recruit me as your husband?

595
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,650
You deceived me once.

596
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:56,930
I wanted to use you for family property.

597
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,610
You can still continue to use me.

598
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:00,100
Now, we owe each other nothing.

599
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:03,380
You don't have to say such things

600
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:04,410
out of guilt or sympathy.

601
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:05,820
I don't think

602
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:08,300
my situation is very bad now.

603
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,340
I don't need anyone's pity.

604
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:13,210
To have a live-in son-in-law or marry a man,

605
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:14,730
to achieve your goal,

606
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:15,930
there are only these two paths.

607
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:17,780
Without a candidate,

608
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,250
how will you reclaim the property?

609
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:20,340
Who says

610
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,850
there are only two paths in this world?

611
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:23,700
One path may be blocked.

612
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:25,130
Then I'll take a different path.

613
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:26,450
If there's really no path,

614
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:28,540
I'll carve out my own path.

615
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:31,140
I'll always find my own way.
