(Prince Hengyang)

24
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,800
Losers.

25
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,920
Charge together.

26
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,840
Speak.

27
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,830
Who sent you to kill me?

28
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:30,170
Your Highness, watch out!

29
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,470
I failed to protect you.

30
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,510
Please forgive me.

31
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,000
Go check

32
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:41,830
who's after me.

33
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,080
Yes.

34
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,080
Are you hurt, sir?

35
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,440
It's nothing.

36
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,200
Just a scratch.

37
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,440
Thank you for saving me again.

38
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,000
Without you,

39
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,320
I'd have been doomed.

40
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,360
Your Highness,

41
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,720
each move

42
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,080
of these people was lethal.

43
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,360
These aren't mere bandits.

44
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,880
They knew our route well.

45
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,800
I've told no one of my return.

46
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,360
And only one person

47
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,000
knew this path.

48
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,080
Xue Chen, my old companion.

49
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:19,790
Third Young Master,

50
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,720
I meant no harm earlier.

51
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,600
Third Young Master.

52
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,480
You're still upset, aren't you?

53
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,670
Aren't you strong-willed?

54
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,220
But now you're crying,

55
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,200
I feel a bit at a loss.

56
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,320
Perhaps you should head back early.

57
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,830
Please don't bother me again.

58
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Third Young Master,

59
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,830
there seems to be someone in the pavilion.

60
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,000
Could it be a friend of yours?

61
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,390
The night is dim.

62
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,110
You must have been mistaken.

63
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:17,320
This narrow path on the lake is unsafe.

64
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,160
I'll escort you back to the shore.

65
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,160
Thank you.

66
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,070
This way.

67
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,200
I pondered after returning.

68
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,220
I thought of the misunderstanding with you.

69
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,760
It remains unresolved,

70
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,830
so I want to try my luck again.

71
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,640
I didn't expect
the pavilion lights were still on.

72
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,510
I knew you were waiting for me.

73
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,070
Is that really all there is?

74
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,760
Truly.

75
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,600
Third Young Master,

76
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,600
I meant no harm today.

77
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,640
Please don't take it to heart.

78
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,000
Let's pretend it never happened.

79
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,280
Naturally,

80
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,440
I won't leak out

81
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:07,920
what I saw tonight.

82
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,720
Are you trying to set terms with me?

83
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,760
I heard it.

84
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,040
(Has he forgiven me...)

85
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,320
(or not?)

86
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,070
It's late.

87
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,670
Miss Luo, please return.

88
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:30,510
Third Young Master!

89
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,350
(I've fallen so hard,)

90
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,760
(yet you don't come to help me.)

91
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,510
Miss Luo, you've come a long way.

92
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,040
But you got all dirty.

93
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,110
Better not bother with it.

94
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,950
Or it'll just be awkward.

95
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,640
I just want to clarify things.

96
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,880
Why do you humiliate me so?

97
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,440
Have you always mocked me?

98
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,600
Am I just a joke to you?

99
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:28,790
Your shoe.

100
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,480
No need to remind me.

101
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:31,640
I won't keep any shoes

102
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:32,630
that don't fit.

103
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,480
Had I known earlier,

104
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,670
I wouldn't have come.

105
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:53,640
Miss Luo.

106
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:54,830
Miss Lau.

107
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,350
The night is cold and dewy.

108
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,440
The stone path is chilly and hard.

109
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,110
How can you walk with one shoe?

110
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,160
You are right.

111
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:10,720
It feels much better

112
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,220
than wearing one shoe.

113
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:17,550
You truly think differently.

114
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:18,950
What's the point

115
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,640
of being like others?

116
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,790
Maybe I should escort you back.

117
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,320
Thank you, Lady Lau.

118
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,710
It really hurts.

119
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,280
Take it slow.

120
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,110
Thank you for escorting me.

121
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,600
I appreciate it.

122
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,760
No trouble at all.

123
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,960
Miss Luo, did something happen today?

124
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,350
Why do you look so disheveled?

125
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,840
Just a small mishap.

126
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,550
I threw away ill-fitting shoes.

127
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:17,590
Even if they're unfit,

128
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,640
most ladies would endure,

129
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,200
and change them back in their rooms.

130
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,520
But you never seem to care

131
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,550
about anyone's opinions.

132
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,550
Truly spontaneous.

133
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,030
Do you think I'm unruly?

134
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,400
I simply believe walking

135
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,910
relies on our feet,

136
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:45,960
not on shoes.

137
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,400
If we wear shoes for their sake,

138
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,320
we forget the joy of walking.

139
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,910
Isn't that unreasonable?

140
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,000
Our feelings matter most,

141
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,070
don't they?

142
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,510
This is...

143
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:09,760
Today I noticed you liked Tongcao flowers,

144
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,710
so I wrote the steps in a booklet for you.

145
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,420
(Step two: Tie the petals)
This way,

146
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,030
you can learn at home.

147
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,550
No need to force yourself to socialize.

148
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,140
(To Craft Tongcao Flowers)

149
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,440
After walking barefoot,

150
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,710
you'll find it
more comfortable than in shoes.

151
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,880
For some reason,

152
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,880
seeing you so carefree,

153
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,150
I feel much more at ease inside.

154
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,320
I hope you can always be like this.

155
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,710
I also wish you happiness, Miss Lau.

156
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,800
Look,

157
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,000
you've seen me at my worst.

158
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:00,880
So don't be formal with me.

159
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:07,000
No one ever said such words to me.

160
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,400
If only I could be family with you...

161
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,000
We are already sisters.

162
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,320
From now on, we're family.

163
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:40,110
Xuechen, I've advised you before

164
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,300
to accept the Emperor's offer.

165
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,670
We wouldn't have to endure this,

166
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,840
in this cramped place with no escape.

167
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,590
Do you understand the wisdom of patience?

168
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,200
The more important the matter,

169
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:52,150
the simpler the place to discuss it.

170
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,550
I'm serious about this.

171
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:54,720
If you could enter the court,

172
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:55,960
wouldn't it be more convenient

173
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,520
to investigate General Lu's past?

174
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:01,960
You wouldn't need to use excuses

175
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,240
to rush around for investigation.

176
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,230
Be careful if Minister Lu finds out.

177
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:07,840
I won't stop until I uncover the truth

178
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,350
about my father.

179
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,790
Wouldn't that be unfair

180
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,270
to take an official position for this?

181
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:16,400
Besides, now in the court, apart from you,

182
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,960
everyone thinks my father betrayed them,

183
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:20,350
causing the loss of Jingyang.

184
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,670
Bringing up old matters publicly

185
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:23,520
won't help at all.

186
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,110
It'll only create obstacles.

187
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:26,630
Therefore,

188
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,670
it's unwise to investigate this openly.

189
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:35,750
Your Highness,

190
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,670
these were well-trained Death Warriors,

191
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,880
and had taken poison.

192
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,030
No clues can be found

193
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,320
on their bodies.

194
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:47,440
It's said Lu Yun
is close to Prince Changyi.

195
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,470
The Imperial Family

196
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,230
has always faced fraternal conflicts.

197
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,200
I'm afraid they're involved
in this matter.

198
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,590
Xuechen and I have been friends
since childhood.

199
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:05,550
Is he after me now

200
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,550
for power?

201
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,960
Everything changes in an instant.

202
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,790
Let alone human hearts.

203
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,880
Your Highness,
you just returned victorious.

204
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,150
What happened tonight

205
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:16,550
is of grave concern.

206
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,000
We've guarded
Northern Border for years,

207
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,400
and haven't smoothed out the court relations.

208
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,960
This matter requires
a thorough investigation.

209
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,880
Xuechen wasn't like this as a child.

210
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:31,080
He must have been deceived.

211
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,790
Since I've returned,

212
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,400
I must find out the truth

213
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,710
to see what he's really thinking.

214
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:43,990
What's on your mind?

215
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:49,000
Aman, I don't think Luo Lingyu came here

216
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,760
just for a temporary stay.

217
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,710
I didn't think much at first.

218
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,400
I just found her troublesome.

219
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,590
But seeing how she looked at you,

220
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,790
I can't help but suspect

221
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,350
that she might be a spy from Fan Clan.

222
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,400
I notice that Miss Luo

223
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,110
is quite different
from other women I've met.

224
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,070
But it's not that complicated.

225
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,080
Back in Shuozhou,

226
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,280
she blocked my path of pursuit.

227
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,710
Then she caused chaos
when I was investigating Fan Clan,

228
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,280
alerting them.

229
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,370
She rode off with the horse I prepared,

230
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,470
leaving me nearly trapped.

231
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:21,880
Then on the boat, she...

232
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,110
Forget it. Let's not mention it.

233
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,600
Isn't she trying to escape marriage?

234
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,790
If she were a spy for Fan Clan,

235
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,470
why would she run away?

236
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,470
That's the most suspicious part.

237
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,280
She loves money, and the Fans
are Imperial Merchants,

238
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,960
so why did she refuse the marriage?

239
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,550
The world is vast.

240
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,520
Why did she choose
to flee to the Lu Mansion?

241
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,280
Today, she sought out Tang.

242
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,080
But apart from a few elders of Lu Clan,

243
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,320
no one knows her identity.

244
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,430
Tonight, she...

245
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,480
Highly suspicious.

246
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,000
Aren't there already many ladies

247
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,670
trying to get close to you?

248
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,110
How could she be the same?

249
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:01,430
Why couldn't she?

250
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,320
For women,

251
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,670
propriety usually trumps affection.

252
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,960
They know when to retreat.

253
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,400
But she won't give up,

254
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,080
and keeps pestering me repeatedly.

255
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:12,520
She even followed me here tonight.

256
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,840
Is that so?

257
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,600
Believe it or not.

258
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:21,200
She's definitely not simple.

259
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:25,520
Alright, if she's not simple,

260
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,880
find a reason to send her away.

261
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,550
She's good at socializing.

262
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:32,520
It's like she's already settled in
at the Lu Clan.

263
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:33,760
It's not easy

264
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,600
to drive her away.

265
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,720
I've made up my mind

266
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,470
to risk getting close to her.

267
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,030
I can scam information

268
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,880
about Fan Clan out of her in that way.

269
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,670
Your relationship with her
has reached this point.

270
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,350
Is there still room to maneuver?

271
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,440
Alright, you're just recovering.

272
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,520
Don't trouble yourself with these.

273
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,080
Leave it to others.

274
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,600
You don't know.

275
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,400
This woman is cunning.

276
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:00,960
If I don't test her myself,

277
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,150
others might be deceived.

278
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,670
It's rare for me

279
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,280
to see you value someone so much.

280
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,400
Is it really just suspicion?

281
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:08,750
You don't believe me?

282
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,400
We'll see.

283
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:15,260
(Clear Breeze and Bright Moon)

284
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:25,750
My Lady,

285
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,150
have you sent Miss Lau back?

286
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:34,310
My Lady,

287
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:37,080
did you and Third Young Master
work things out?

288
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,030
Did something happen?

289
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,760
Why do you look like this?

290
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,550
He wouldn't really retaliate, would he?

291
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,230
That would be too petty.

292
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:51,550
Better left unsaid.

293
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,670
Earlier, I merely slapped him,

294
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,110
losing some dignity.

295
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:59,790
Now, even my pride is gone,

296
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:02,840
especially in front of other gentlemen.

297
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,160
Other gentlemen?

298
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:07,280
I saw his golden embroidery.

299
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,680
He must be from the Imperial Family.

300
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,270
Imperial Family!

301
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:14,230
How is Third Young Master
involved with them?

302
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,800
That's not our concern.

303
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,590
The urgent matter now

304
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,880
is to reclaim our ancestral property.

305
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,950
Ten years ago,

306
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,680
my parents sent Hua and me

307
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,800
out of Jingyang.

308
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,950
I will not let them down.

309
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:33,760
Lingyu, no matter what happens,

310
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,800
take good care of yourself.

311
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,860
(Luo Zhaowen, Lingyu's father)

312
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:38,920
(Li Guiyi, the mother)

313
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,950
And take care of Hua.

314
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:40,900
(Young Luo Lingyu)

315
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,280
Once you leave the city,

316
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,520
- The Luos will be there to help.
- Let's go.

317
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,760
Lingyu,

318
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,760
you will be the pillar of the Luo Clan.

319
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,560
The whole family depends on you now.

320
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:53,830
Remember the Ancestral Precepts
of the Luo Clan.

321
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:55,560
Do you understand?

322
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,070
Mother.

323
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,350
Father, Mother...

324
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,230
My Lady, don't be sad.

325
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,470
We've overcome past hardships.

326
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,880
This is just a minor setback.

327
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,830
It's nothing I can't handle.

328
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,590
Do you still consider Third Young Master

329
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,160
as a potential matrilocal husband?

330
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,400
Third Young Master is peculiar,

331
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,190
showing two faces to the world.

332
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,520
You invited me for a night meeting,

333
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:59,190
but teased me by the lake.

334
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,350
He's truly unpredictable.

335
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,280
Since it's unattainable,

336
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,830
I'll just let it be.

337
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:09,190
But still, I'll seek more opportunities,

338
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,190
rather than being stuck with one.

339
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,360
It's not worth it.

340
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,760
After you.

341
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,190
Tonight, Tang went back alone,

342
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,640
and didn't wait for me.

343
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,920
She used to cling to me.

344
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:34,950
But she's growing up now,

345
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,160
and has her own thoughts.

346
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,230
She's quite naive though.

347
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:39,920
I hope she doesn't get deceived.

348
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,360
I'm leaving now.

349
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:46,790
Oh right, Xuechen,

350
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,190
I need your help with something.

351
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,760
Tell me about it.

352
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:53,000
At the dock earlier,
I didn't find Zhou Yangling,

353
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,640
daughter of Zhou Tan from Wuzhou,

354
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,280
but I located her boatman.

355
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:57,950
I've sent someone

356
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:59,210
to keep an eye on her boat and boatman.

357
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,350
Have you searched the city thoroughly?

358
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,040
I've never seen her.

359
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,920
I don't know what she looks like.

360
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,560
I just arranged for an artist

361
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,680
to draw her based on descriptions,

362
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,110
and posted a notice there.

363
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:12,950
Aman,

364
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:14,800
there's one thing I don't understand.

365
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,190
Zhou Tan comes from a humble family.

366
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,400
You befriend Zhou Tan to connect with them.

367
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,470
Why must you marry his daughter?

368
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,420
Marriage has always facilitated

369
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,430
alliances.

370
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,110
Must we follow tradition blindly?

371
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,110
With your talent and political ambition,

372
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,430
even without the marriage,

373
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:33,190
Master Zhou might still support you.

374
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,600
Besides,

375
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,590
a lifetime-bound arrangement

376
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:37,950
is unfair to Zhou Yangling.

377
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,680
It's not fortunate for you either.

378
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,040
Sorry, I can't assist with this.

379
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,560
I'll consider your words carefully.

380
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,070
See you. You should head back.

381
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,040
Thank you, sir.

382
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,980
(Yuezhuo Ferry)

383
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:38,160
Who is this Zhou Yangling from Wuzhou?

384
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,270
Who is she anyway?

385
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,110
- I've never seen her.
- For days,

386
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,000
(Missing Person Poster)
It's everywhere.

387
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:44,190
Exactly.

388
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:46,710
When did I start looking like this?

389
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:57,590
I'm just casually looking.

390
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,110
- Not her.
- No.

391
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:01,590
- Not her. Let's go.
- Okay.

392
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,000
What are you doing?

393
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,230
- You ripped it down.
- I...

394
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,560
I...

395
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:32,920
Do you know this person?

396
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:34,270
I don't know.

397
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,950
Then you must know their location.

398
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,710
Tell me, and I'll surely...

399
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,070
Did she go that way?

400
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:46,310
She is in Yuezhou.

401
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:51,910
Thank you, sir.

402
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,430
He's looking for me.

403
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,230
Could he work for Prince Changyi?

404
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,000
(It seems Prince Changyi)

405
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,430
(doesn't know my appearance.)

406
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,590
(For now, I can be at ease.)

407
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,830
(But I must dispel his intention)

408
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,070
(to continue searching for me.)

409
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,020
(Notice)
Lu Clan is recruiting an assistant.

410
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,860
(Yuezhou Ferry)

411
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:33,380
(Xuewu Courtyard)

412
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,590
My Lady, if only the shoes weren't lost.

413
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:41,520
We could wash them,

414
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,040
and wouldn't need to buy new ones.

415
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,230
Although we earned some money

416
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:47,160
from the tea break,

417
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,190
it's better to be thrifty.

418
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,230
Forget about the old shoes.

419
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,470
They remind me of yesterday.

420
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,520
Better to let the old go for new ones.

421
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,720
Let's buy a new pair.

422
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,070
Don't dwell on the past.

423
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,480
My Lady,

424
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:02,590
is it wise for us to openly seek

425
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:03,680
Second Young Master?

426
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,830
It's not appropriate.

427
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:08,230
Since First Madam treats us poorly,

428
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:10,350
how can Second Yong Master

429
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:12,030
be a matrilocal husband to the Luo family?

430
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,760
You don't know that.

431
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,830
Who said we're seeking Second Young Master

432
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,590
to get a matrilocal husband?

433
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,520
After observing for a few days,

434
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,680
I found that he is well-connected in Yuezhou,

435
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:30,350
and quite familiar with many gentlemen.

436
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,430
Moreover, he is honest,

437
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:34,000
and we have a connection.

438
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:36,040
Having him help me find a husband candidate

439
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,310
would be the best choice.

440
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,190
Miss,

441
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,430
I wonder...

442
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:47,820
- It's you.
- It's you.

443
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,760
That day,

444
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,710
I regretted meeting you just briefly.

445
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:57,680
Didn't expect to see you here.

446
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:58,790
Indeed.

447
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,350
I thought I'd meet you in Yuezhou,

448
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,350
but I didn't expect us to meet so soon.

449
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:07,350
Thanks for your help that day.

450
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:11,350
By the way, your jade pendant is with me.

451
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:12,680
I didn't bring it with me.

452
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,640
I'll deliver it to you another day.

453
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:15,830
It's very kind of you.

454
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:16,830
It's just a jade pendant.

455
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:20,110
Consider it a gift from me to you.

456
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,160
I'll bring a return gift next time

457
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:25,710
to commemorate our meeting here.

458
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,840
Alright.

459
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:31,710
Mr. Zhou,
what brings you to the Lu Mansion?

460
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:34,680
I saw this.

461
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,830
(Notice)
The Lu Clan is hiring a teaching assistant.

462
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,190
I'm interested in it,

463
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:39,040
so I came here.

464
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:41,160
But the servant who led me in

465
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,280
said he had urgent business,

466
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,410
and left me to proceed alone.

467
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,430
I've searched all around,
but couldn't find

468
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:47,070
Second Young Master's courtyard.

469
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:48,270
Second Young Master?

470
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,400
I was just about to look for him too.

471
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,000
Come with me. I'll take you there.

472
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:54,160
Thank you, Miss.

473
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,280
Please come this way.

474
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:04,880
Here we are.

475
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,040
Second Young Master,

476
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,110
I heard you want to hire

477
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,920
a teaching assistant.

478
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:13,920
Look, I brought you someone.

479
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,110
Why is it you?

480
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:24,640
This is my brother's courtyard.

481
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,040
Why is it strange for me to be here?

482
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,350
But Miss Luo,

483
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,950
why did you bring flowers and people?

484
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,280
What brings you here?

485
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:35,310
Mr. Zhou is here to apply for the position.

486
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,640
We came to see Second Young Master.

487
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,110
I am Zhou Zibo,

488
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,190
a scholar for the exam in this city.

489
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,590
I heard you're hiring an assistant,

490
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:47,430
so I came to apply.

491
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,760
(You've just been here for a few days,)

492
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,770
(yet you're so impatient.)

493
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,760
(Now you're bringing in accomplices.)

494
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:57,310
How could it be possible
to pull the string

495
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,880
with just these flowers?

496
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,720
Lu Yun! Stop your nonsense.

497
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,190
Mr. Zhou has a kind heart

498
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:07,350
and great talent.

499
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,520
You're not his match.

500
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,830
Ridiculous.

501
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,500
Lu Yun.

502
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:14,040
I asked you to help me.

503
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:14,920
Why start an argument?

504
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:21,950
(What's happening?)

505
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,310
(Why does Miss Luo)

506
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,590
(know so many handsome guys?)

507
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,590
(Lu Yun looks furious,)

508
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:28,200
(I need to say something.)

509
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:32,160
Miss Luo, why are you here?

510
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,830
Are you here for Lu Yun?

511
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,360
No.

512
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,880
The magnolias are blooming
at Xuewu Courtyard,

513
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:46,000
so I thought of bringing some to you.

514
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,400
Look.

515
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:51,310
But on the way here,

516
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:53,400
I encountered Mr. Zhou
coming for recruitment.

517
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,920
I brought him along as well.

518
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:57,400
I am Zhou Zibo.

519
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,760
Are you Zhou Zibo,

520
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,840
Mr. Zhou?

521
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,760
Brother.

522
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:03,310
You know him?

523
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,360
Of course.

524
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:06,070
Mr. Zhou's reputation

525
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,920
is already well-known

526
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,250
among the exam candidates.

527
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,470
His articles have been read by many peers.

528
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,070
Even the teacher praises them highly.

529
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,110
It's truly a surprise

530
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,710
that he came for recruitment.

531
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,520
You flatter me.

532
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,190
The Lu Clan is deeply rooted in history,

533
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,640
full of renowned scholars.

534
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:26,430
If I could be offered a chance,

535
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,470
I'll surely learn a lot.

536
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,520
(He's made a thorough preparation.)

537
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,160
(Why does he keep watching Mr. Zhou?)

538
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,070
Although I admire your talents,

539
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:38,310
the standard interview process

540
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,280
cannot be skipped.

541
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:40,880
Of course not.

542
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,880
Then we'll wait

543
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,350
for your good news.

544
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,640
Lu Yun.

545
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:51,550
Lu Yun.

546
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:53,920
Since you like these flowers so much,

547
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:55,400
why not take a few?

548
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,950
I don't want any.

549
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,920
This is Miss Luo's gift for you.

550
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,190
How could I take it away?

551
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,310
(They're indeed fighting.)

552
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,800
Yu Lun, Miss Luo, please wait here.

553
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,520
Mr. Zhou, please follow me for the interview.

554
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,070
Alright.

555
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:19,550
This way.

556
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:59,470
(Could these flowers
have a hidden meaning?)

557
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,230
(He even followed me here.)

558
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,280
(What's he trying to do?)

559
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:08,160
(She remains calm.)

560
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,640
(She's truly deep in thought.)

561
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,590
(A composed type.)

562
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:18,310
Miss Luo, let's speak frankly.

563
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,520
I don't understand.

564
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,040
What do you mean by that?

565
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:26,920
What was your intent in approaching me?

566
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:29,640
We're both well aware of it.

567
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:33,110
Today, you even brought Mr. Zhou.

568
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,230
My brother is unaware of this,

569
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:39,230
but that doesn't mean I'm in the dark.

570
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,590
Third Young Master,
perhaps you're overthinking.

571
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,450
There are so many gentlemen in Yuezhou.

572
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:49,350
Why does it have to be you?

573
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:52,880
Besides, whether it's Second Young Master,

574
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,040
or Mr. Zhou,

575
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,830
we're just friends.

576
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:57,880
You can refuse my pursuit,

577
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:00,000
but can't stop me
from getting close to others.

578
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:01,280
What sense does that make?

579
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:04,400
Today, you pursue someone in the courtyard.

580
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,710
Tomorrow, you pick some magnolias,

581
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:08,110
pair with flirting gestures.

582
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,560
Miss Luo, what do you want?

583
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,000
Do you want me to imitate

584
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,880
your behavior in front of my brother?

585
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,000
You...

586
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:25,880
You are indeed talented and knowledgeable.

587
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:26,950
You flatter me.

588
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:33,910
Sorry about that.

589
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:43,640
If you despise me so much to mock me,

590
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:45,830
why do you keep watching my every move?

591
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,640
Today, you tried to stop me from meeting

592
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:51,000
Second Young Master,
and were wary of Mr. Zhou.

593
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,120
What about tomorrow?

594
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,280
Who will you stop me from befriending?

595
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:56,950
That depends on whom you see tomorrow.

596
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,040
(What does he really mean?)

597
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:07,760
These two people,

598
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:10,830
even their rapport
falls short of Chang and Hua.

599
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,920
Mr. Zhou, you're knowledgeable

600
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,280
and have literary talents.

601
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:28,160
I knew from the start
that this job was meant for you.

602
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:31,470
Miss, you flatter me.

603
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,520
I must thank you for guiding me today.

604
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,000
You're welcome.

605
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:39,230
My Lady, the carriage is ready.

606
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,560
Do you have plans to go out today?

607
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,430
Then I won't disturb you.

608
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,470
Now that I have this job,

609
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,590
we can meet
at the Lu Mansion in the future.

610
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,000
Then we must meet often.

611
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:52,400
I shall take my leave now.

612
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,160
Mr. Zhou is quite exceptional.

613
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,470
He's well-mannered and knows his place.

614
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,950
Truly a rare find in this world.

615
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:09,230
Third Young Master is already out of reach.

616
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:13,430
Perhaps consider Mr. Zhou
for the matrilocal list.

617
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,700
Don't speak such nonsense.

618
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,590
Mr. Zhou is a scholar aiming for exams.

619
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,880
He is talented with a bright future.

620
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:21,350
His demeanor is courteous and polite,

621
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,560
as radiant as the moon in the sky.

622
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,800
How can I exploit him?

623
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:28,550
Forget it.

624
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:30,110
Hurry to West Market,

625
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,190
or it'll be closed soon.

626
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,760
Yes, My Lady.

627
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,470
Lu Yun, you were too rash.

628
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,920
Miss Luo is delicate.

629
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:42,280
Even if you like her, you...

630
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,120
Delicate?

631
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,520
Brother, you misunderstand her.

632
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,430
This woman is very cunning.

633
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,830
You should avoid her.

634
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:54,760
Understood. Rest assured.

635
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,120
It's my first time

636
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,430
seeing you care so much for a woman.

637
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,070
Don't worry, I won't interfere.

638
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,950
That's not what I meant.

639
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,800
Just be cautious.

640
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,400
By the way, Brother,

641
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:14,600
why did you

642
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,440
call me here today?

643
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:19,980
(Roll Call List)

644
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,320
Compared to last month,

645
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,370
you missed three days of Family School.

646
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,300
(Lu Yun)

647
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:29,560
Lu Yun, I know you are talented,

648
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,720
but the study of governance is different.

649
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,360
You need to expand your knowledge.

650
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,950
Understood, Brother.

651
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,120
Why should I study governance?

652
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,320
I live in luxury.

653
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,320
Why endure such hardship?

654
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,390
With your abilities, given time,

655
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:44,430
you'll achieve much like Uncle.

656
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,400
Lu Yun,

657
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,600
I know you feel wronged.

658
00:34:56,910 --> 00:34:59,600
Perhaps you can help me read my fortune

659
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,630
to find my future exalted status.

660
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,560
Such matters can't rely on fortune-telling.

661
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,400
Third Young Master.

662
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:09,710
Second Young Master.

663
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:11,800
There's a new tune at Xunmei House.

664
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:14,040
They sent me to invite you to enjoy it.

665
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:15,800
Got it. I'll head there soon.

666
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:20,120
Brother, take a look,

667
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,520
this is my important task.

668
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,280
I'll leave matters of governance to you.

669
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:25,230
I'm off now.

670
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:27,710
Lu Xuechen!

671
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:34,770
I've always been frail,
and not good at archery.

672
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:37,360
You are better at everything.

673
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,390
Now I can only do small tasks.

674
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,720
But you are different.

675
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,150
You have great talent.

676
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:46,520
Even the Emperor appreciates you.

677
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:49,840
If you have no ambition,

678
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,080
I won't persuade you anymore.

679
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:53,280
But you once said you wanted to become

680
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,710
a great general. Have you forgotten?

681
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:58,280
That was just childish talk.

682
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,120
Do you know a general's success costs lives?

683
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,280
Glory is just dust in the wind.

684
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:08,040
The position of general...

685
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,800
How can it compare to my freedom now?

686
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,600
At least when you have time,

687
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:26,770
you should attend classes at Family School.

688
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:31,150
I've covered for you
several times already.

689
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:32,760
Otherwise,

690
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,430
when Father returns,

691
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:35,870
he'll punish you again.

692
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:39,230
Alright.

693
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,600
Thank you, Brother.

694
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,070
I'm leaving.

695
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:56,700
(Lu Yun)

696
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,280
(Xunmei House)

697
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,800
Xunmei House is extraordinary.

698
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:02,790
Indeed.

699
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,160
I was so scared.

700
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:25,280
The ladies here only work
as performers, not prostitutes.

701
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,190
You still try to take advantage of them.

702
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:32,150
This is not allowed.

703
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:33,800
They're just dancers.

704
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,280
How dare you hit me!

705
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,670
Watch as I smash your shop!

706
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:44,150
- Good! Well done!
- Yes!

707
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,230
- Good.
- Wait and see!

708
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:48,640
- Good.
- Just you wait!

709
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,810
Thank you, sir, for your help today.

710
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,670
But even if you hadn't stepped in,

711
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,840
I could still easily handle him.

712
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,630
I am the owner of Xunmei House.

713
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:04,080
And I'm meeting an esteemed guest today.

714
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,280
If he causes trouble,

715
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,560
it will ruin my matters.

716
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:10,600
He is already waiting.

717
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:12,310
Thank you, miss.

718
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:16,710
Over the years,

719
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:18,320
your skills have improved greatly.

720
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:20,230
What?

721
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,710
Are you just here for tea today?

722
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:26,230
That's not the case.

723
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:32,060
(To Prince Changyi)

724
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:43,870
(From Zhou Tan)
I received your letter and sought Yangling,

725
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,000
but the search was in vain.

726
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,670
I am truly ashamed.

727
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:52,230
The marriage is a matter

728
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:54,040
between Yangling and Your Highness.

729
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:56,120
Once Your Highness finds her,

730
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,670
you can decide together.

731
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,910
It is, after all, between you two.

732
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:01,670
None of this concerns me.

733
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,200
Look at the other one.

734
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,600
(From Zhou Yangling)
I have

735
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,950
arrived in Yuezhou.

736
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,800
No need to look for me further.

737
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,560
As for the marriage alliance,

738
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:19,320
it is a promise made by my father,

739
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:20,710
not a wish of mine.

740
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:22,520
Since it's between you two,

741
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:24,150
it has nothing to do with me.

742
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:26,140
From Zhou Yangling of the Zhou Family.

743
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,390
They're indeed blood-related.

744
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,840
Their bold nature is quite similar.

745
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,360
The Zhou Family dares to defy orders.

746
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,390
Perhaps you should ask His Majesty

747
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,520
to turn the entire southern Yuezhou
upside down

748
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,670
until Zhou Yangling is found.

749
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,470
Xuechen, stop teasing me.

750
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,560
As long as she is well in Yuezhou.

751
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:49,320
She has made it clear

752
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:50,870
that she doesn't want to see me.

753
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:53,080
I will write to inform Master Zhou

754
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,320
that his daughter is now safe.

755
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:57,470
However, this marriage

756
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,490
indeed needs careful consideration.

757
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:05,840
It's your turn.

758
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,600
Your Highness.

759
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,430
Young Master, Fan Qingchen entered Yuezhou

760
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:16,840
through the north gate an hour ago.

761
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,950
He arrived so quickly.

762
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:20,230
How many people came?

763
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,120
Where are they now?

764
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:21,990
A group of six.

765
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,710
They are staying at Lan Inn in West Market.

766
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:24,960
West Market?

767
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,400
Yes.

768
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,870
The Fan Family is the wealthiest in Shuozhou.

769
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:32,040
Why not stay at a grand hotel?

770
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:34,280
Why choose a humble inn in West Market?

771
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,040
Moreover, West Market
is full of fabric shops.

772
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:40,840
Usually, it's a place for ladies.

773
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,440
Jinchuan.

774
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:45,560
How is Miss Luo today?

775
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,360
Since she slapped you...

776
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:55,040
After she accidentally "caressed" your face,

777
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:57,080
she's barely left the house.

778
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,190
Today she went out with Lingxi.

779
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,040
They're currently at the West Market.

780
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,630
I see.

781
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,950
What a coincidence.

782
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,390
As soon as Fan Qingchen arrived,

783
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:10,230
she went out.

784
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:12,520
I don't have to especially look for her.

785
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,800
This time I'll see

786
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,840
what excuse she has left.

787
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:24,760
Come and see, small trinkets here!

788
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:28,950
If they're not fun, it's free!

789
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:31,800
These trinkets are nice.

790
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:32,790
Yes, indeed.

791
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,560
Young Master,
I know you care about Miss Luo.

792
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:40,320
But we're here for a purpose.

793
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,320
Apart from Miss Luo,
that person's whereabouts...

794
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:45,950
Since when is it your place to order me?

795
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:53,390
Lingyu,

796
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:55,670
where are you?

797
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:06,420
(Jinxiu Workshop)

798
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:08,920
My Lady,

799
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:10,280
there were so many

800
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,080
beautiful accessories and clothes.

801
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,520
Why didn't you buy any?

802
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:15,320
Didn't you say

803
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:16,560
that we need to save money?

804
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:18,910
Fortunately, I'm clever.

805
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,800
Let's pick two pieces of fabric.

806
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,800
We can make our own clothes.

807
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:24,390
They won't be worse than the store's.

808
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:25,920
You're right.

809
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:40,600
What's wrong, My Lady.

810
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,080
Maybe I'm just tired.

811
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,840
I feel a chill down my spine.

812
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,470
I'm hungry.

813
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:57,320
Lingxi, go buy two buns.

814
00:42:57,910 --> 00:42:58,760
Alright, My Lady.

815
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,120
Lingyu.
