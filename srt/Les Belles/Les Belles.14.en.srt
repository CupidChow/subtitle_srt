23
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,660
Lingyu,

24
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,610
you were always asleep when I visited you,

25
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,050
I didn't dare disturb you.

26
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:04,210
How are you feeling now?

27
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:05,900
The engagement

28
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:07,690
that troubled me is gone,

29
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:08,850
so I feel refreshed.

30
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,770
My only wish now

31
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,620
is to reclaim the property of my family.

32
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,620
However, past experiences made me realize

33
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,980
finding a matrilocal husband
only brings trouble.

34
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,460
Since this doesn't work,

35
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,100
I'll find another way.

36
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,100
Since you figured it out,

37
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,060
I feel relieved.

38
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,770
By the way, you mentioned before

39
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,570
that you came here disguised as a man

40
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,100
also to avoid marriage.

41
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,930
Why don't we find a solution together?

42
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,370
Let's call off your engagement.

43
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,620
Mine isn't so easy to resolve.

44
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,700
As long as it's not decreed
by His Majesty,

45
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:47,890
it's manageable.

46
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:49,490
I...

47
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:54,180
I'm avoiding marriage to Prince Changyi.

48
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:00,820
What?

49
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,540
I told you it's hard to handle.

50
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,820
You have an engagement
with Prince Changyi?

51
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,260
You dare to flee a royal marriage.

52
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:17,980
Tell me about it.

53
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,370
The Imperial Family values humble scholars,
so they want to

54
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:24,570
connect with my father
through this marriage.

55
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,490
I avoided the marriage,
but haven't been punished

56
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,620
probably due to my father's influence.

57
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,540
You've met Prince Changyi at the Lu Mansion.

58
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,770
Did he recognize you?

59
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:37,650
Not at all.

60
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,620
I hid my real identity well.

61
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:44,130
He thinks I'm just a teacher
of the Lu Clan,

62
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,700
Zhou Zibo.

63
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,540
This marriage is indeed difficult.

64
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,620
Didn't expect Prince Changyi,
such a gentleman,

65
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,980
to force a marriage like this.

66
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,020
Because of this marriage, I thought

67
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,490
he was someone
who disregarded others' feelings,

68
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,130
just like a selfish hypocrite.

69
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:07,490
But recently, after interacting with him,

70
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,100
I found he's not that kind of person.

71
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,130
So...

72
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,690
I think in the future,

73
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,620
if he knows my identity,

74
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:20,980
he won't treat me any differently.

75
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:24,900
Yangling,

76
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:30,100
are you...

77
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:32,860
Of course.

78
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:36,140
Prince Changyi is capable.

79
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,930
I want to be his advisor.

80
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:40,890
I've already decided

81
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,140
that I must excel as Zhou Zibo.

82
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:45,740
Miss Luo.

83
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,260
Why are you here?

84
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:52,610
You two...

85
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,490
I... I came for chives.

86
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,420
Yes, for chives.

87
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,650
Are you here for chives too?

88
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:09,130
No, no.

89
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,050
That's not what we came for.

90
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:16,330
We heard a lot about Mr. Zhou,

91
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,290
so we wanted to see him.

92
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:19,130
Yes, exactly.

93
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,330
Ladies, please enjoy.

94
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,490
Eat and drink well.

95
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:37,740
You're not just here for Mr. Zhou, right?

96
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,410
I just remembered

97
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,100
that Flower Goddess Contest is soon.

98
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,850
Mr. Zhou, maybe

99
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:49,890
it's time to lighten
those young men's studies.

100
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,570
We have no other intentions.

101
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,850
It's just that the contest
is an annual event.

102
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:58,140
Is it possible...

103
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:00,420
They want to invite gentlemen for an outing.

104
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,860
Mr. Zhou, I hope you will share with us

105
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:05,060
about their preferences.

106
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,300
Please tell us in detail.

107
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:12,050
- Sure.
- This...

108
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,210
What is Flower Goddess Contest?

109
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:18,900
Young Master,

110
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,860
(To Young Master Lu Yun)
the contest invites you as judge.

111
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,580
I won't go. Turn it down.

112
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,290
Young Master, about the judge...

113
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,260
You plan to refuse again.

114
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,700
I don't know how to face them.

115
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,210
Young Master Yun,

116
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,050
it was a surprise seeing you here.

117
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,860
This is Yuezhou's grandest event.

118
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:38,120
We've invited you every year,

119
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,100
yet you refused them all.

120
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,560
The contest is a grand annual event

121
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,890
that all Yuezhou's noble ladies
value the most.

122
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,420
Anyone who wins the title

123
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,050
will gain fame in Yuezhou.

124
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:51,490
Moreover,

125
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:52,690
the Flower Goddess

126
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:55,100
can receive a wish granted by His Majesty.

127
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,740
Will His Majesty grant any wish?

128
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,740
Of course.

129
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,260
(If I can get a wish from His Majesty,)

130
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:07,330
(I can easily reclaim
my ancestral property.)

131
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,610
(Gentle Breeze and Bright Moon)
I wonder

132
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,320
by what condition would you agree?

133
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,610
Aman,

134
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,850
you know it well,

135
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,170
I don't like crowds.

136
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:16,690
Please reconsider...

137
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:17,970
Your wage will be reduced...

138
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:18,860
Fine, I'm leaving.

139
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,780
Xuechen, why did you call me here?

140
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,740
What's the matter?

141
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,530
Previously, we struggled to find a reason

142
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:26,860
to search the Fan Family?

143
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,610
Since that day Fan Qingchen

144
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,300
acted disgracefully in public,

145
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,250
isn't this a perfect excuse

146
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,140
to search his family

147
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,770
for the saltpeter issue?

148
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:40,140
You want to use this chance
to eliminate them?

149
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,140
We've been too cautious after all,

150
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,970
keeping him around for so long.

151
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,270
And yet, trouble arises again.

152
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:48,660
It's causing innocent people to suffer.

153
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,500
We should act now.

154
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,170
I never expected this.

155
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:57,050
You used to be aloof from worldly affairs,

156
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,890
but now you're affected by love.

157
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:09,410
But Flower Goddess Contest spots are limited.

158
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:10,700
Only one candidate per household.

159
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,610
To be honest, Miss Luo,

160
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,330
don't hold onto false hopes.

161
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,450
You're a distant relative of the Lu Clan.

162
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,340
How could you get a spot from the Lu Clan?

163
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,610
Even if you could secure a spot,

164
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:25,170
since Miss Chen started participating,

165
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:27,130
she's won the Flower Goddess title

166
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:28,420
every year.

167
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:31,090
Miss Chen is exceptionally talented,

168
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:33,100
known as a gifted lady in Yuezhou City.

169
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:34,660
Moreover,

170
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,010
she is the legitimate daughter.

171
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,890
Miss Luo, we cannot compare.

172
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:47,010
You all have your own strengths.

173
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,060
Why belittle yourself so much?

174
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,130
Miss Luo is right.

175
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,860
Though I've just met you all,

176
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,650
I've noticed your exceptional qualities.

177
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,940
Among all the women,

178
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,810
some are clever and wise,

179
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:15,250
some are lively and spirited,

180
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,130
some are knowledgeable,

181
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:20,420
(Women's Commandments)

182
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,060
some are good at handwork,

183
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,570
some have courage and wisdom,

184
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,450
and some are quiet and elegant.

185
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,500
I am the princess of Nanyue.

186
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,420
But now I wish to protect someone.

187
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,890
As they say, "All charming beauties,

188
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:48,300
each shines in their own way."

189
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:49,970
Indeed.

190
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,570
You're fascinated
by the Flower Goddess Contest,

191
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,730
yet you fear a failure
that hasn't even arrived

192
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:55,770
and hold back.

193
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:56,940
It's a pity.

194
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,500
Lingyu, Mr. Zhou,
you have unique insights,

195
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,060
truly extraordinary.

196
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,450
Princess, you flatter me.

197
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:11,940
Ladies, make yourselves at home.

198
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,050
Have some tea and snacks.

199
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:14,940
See if you like.

200
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:18,890
(No matter what,)

201
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,380
(I must participate)

202
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,380
(in the Flower Goddess Contest.)

203
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,980
(Lu Mansion)

204
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,070
My Lady, mind your step.

205
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,770
Tang, thank you for bringing me back.

206
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,210
Lingyu.

207
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:40,180
Are you going to join
the Flower Goddess Contest?

208
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,380
It's a great opportunity.

209
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:42,380
Why not seize it?

210
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:44,980
I truly admire you

211
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:46,840
for your courage and action.

212
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:48,770
Unlike me.

213
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:53,860
Tang,

214
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,300
do you want to join the contest?

215
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:01,820
No,

216
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:03,250
I don't have any talent.

217
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:06,570
That contest is for talented,
beautiful ladies.

218
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,500
I'd just be laughed at.

219
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,140
Tang,

220
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,650
you always say you admire my freedom,

221
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,180
but the truth is, you can be free too.

222
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,380
Any change

223
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,540
starts with the first step.

224
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:24,060
Joining the contest could be your first step.

225
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,740
Are others' opinions
more important to you,

226
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:30,740
than your own desires?

227
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:33,450
Tang,

228
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,620
do what makes you happy.

229
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:37,570
Become who you want to be.

230
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:40,380
Then, you won't always have a frown.

231
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:48,500
Thank you, Lingyu.

232
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,140
I'll be off now.

233
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:01,860
My Lady.

234
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,180
You advised Princess Ningping to participate.

235
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,310
Aren't you giving yourself more rivals?

236
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,540
I didn't join the contest to beat anyone,

237
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,010
nor to prove who's better.

238
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,450
As long as I am strong enough,

239
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,380
why fear who the opponent is?

240
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,330
Don't worry. I believe in myself.

241
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,010
As long as I give it my all,

242
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:24,620
I will surely win the title.

243
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:26,860
Don't even mention it.

244
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,980
You can't even enter
the Flower Goddess Contest.

245
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,050
The ladies just mentioned

246
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,730
that this contest values lineage.

247
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:33,690
Spots are limited.

248
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,100
How can we participate?

249
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,300
Look.

250
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,540
(Lu Mansion)

251
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,450
Doesn't the Lu Clan have a spot?

252
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,690
Aunt Ying has just returned from her trip.

253
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:48,770
Let's go see her.

254
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,060
You're right.

255
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,140
Let's go.

256
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,420
The hardest task each year

257
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,300
is choosing a gift for Mother.

258
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:01,570
It must please her.

259
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:06,690
Aunt, although I'm not a Lu Family lady,

260
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:09,100
I still wish to join
the Flower Goddess Contest

261
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,330
to bring honor to the Lu Clan.

262
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:14,130
Aunt, please speak to Madam Lu for me.

263
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,860
Lu Clan has few direct daughters,

264
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,100
but you're not the only female cousin.

265
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,690
Why does it have to be you?

266
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:29,210
Because I'm your only niece.

267
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,420
Only I inherited your talent and wisdom.

268
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:35,060
I will surely excel in the contest.

269
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,810
You always know how to sweet-talk me.

270
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,300
This painting is by a renowned master.

271
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:42,540
What do you think of it?

272
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,770
The mountains overlap majestically.

273
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,100
It feels like a fairyland.

274
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,380
It's perfect for Madam Lu.

275
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,450
Wrap this up.

276
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,450
Yes.

277
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:53,810
(Clouds and Spring Trees)

278
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:55,250
Most women wish to marry well,

279
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,690
finding a good family to rely on

280
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:59,740
to have support in the future.

281
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,770
Why are you so different?

282
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:05,250
I just want to rely on my own ability

283
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,500
to make a name in Yuezhou.

284
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,060
If all efforts prove futile,

285
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,810
I will seek another path.

286
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,450
At such a young age,

287
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:18,060
you have such thoughts.

288
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,100
It's because you taught me well.

289
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:27,220
(Time Slips Away)

290
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:31,210
Miss Luo wants a spot
in the Flower Goddess Contest,

291
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,670
- (Does she?)
- What do you think?

292
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:37,100
Mother, over the years,
although we've sent ladies

293
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,940
of our Clan to the Flower Goddess Contest,

294
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,010
they always ended up unsuccessful.

295
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:43,860
Since Lingyu is eager,

296
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,740
why not let her give it a try?

297
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,300
She is talented,

298
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,420
and has a keen mind.

299
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:49,540
Perhaps,

300
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,330
she might actually win the title.

301
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,420
This must be the path she wants to take.

302
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:57,820
Lu Yun,

303
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,300
what are you mumbling about?

304
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:00,650
Nothing.

305
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:03,420
Yun,

306
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:06,890
what do you think of Miss Luo's matter?

307
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:09,540
Grandmother, Aunt is right.

308
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,300
Miss Luo performed at Zhongshan,

309
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,180
astonishing everyone.

310
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,940
All the guests were amazed.

311
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:17,060
If she could join the contest
as part of our clan,

312
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,550
she'll surely bring glory to us.

313
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,180
All these years,

314
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,620
I've rarely seen you praise anyone,

315
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,300
especially the ladies.

316
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,330
When Xian fell into the lake last time,

317
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:34,610
you praised Miss Luo's integrity,

318
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:37,380
kindness, and courtesy to others.

319
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:40,770
Now you commend her talent.

320
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,810
It's truly rare.

321
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:48,060
Grandmother, I'm just speaking the truth.

322
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,180
Am I right, Aunt?

323
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,300
Yes.

324
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,770
Well...

325
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:57,500
Since both of you say so,

326
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,180
if I don't agree,

327
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,620
it would seem unreasonable.

328
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,300
So this matter

329
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,100
is settled then.

330
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,980
- (Flower Goddess Contest)
- Okay?

331
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,330
(I must help her well.)

332
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,020
(Zichen Palace)

333
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:20,100
(The Emperor)

334
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,650
Your Majesty, Prince Hengyang is here.

335
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:26,210
Let him in.

336
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,540
Greetings, Father.

337
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:34,970
As you were.

338
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,300
Thank you, Father.

339
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,180
Hengyang,

340
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,980
I've heard from Changyi

341
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,610
that the Fan Family
is colluding with foreigners,

342
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:46,810
and allowed his only son to commit misdeeds.

343
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,740
You handled it well.

344
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,650
As a prince,

345
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,380
you've set an example

346
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,740
and have done justice.

347
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:56,540
You really have

348
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:58,810
a bit of the flair I had back in my day.

349
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:00,300
Thank you, Father.

350
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,020
Your Majesty,

351
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,420
this is the list
for the Flower Goddess Contest

352
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,330
by Ministry of Rites.

353
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,260
Bring it here.

354
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,180
(Flower Goddess List:
Princess Ningping, Lau Tang)

355
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,860
Lau Tang is participating this year.

356
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,620
It's rare to see her so proactive.

357
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:27,530
I'll definitely go support her.

358
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:28,660
Great.

359
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:33,930
You can meet all the ladies there.

360
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:37,020
Your brother Changyi is already engaged.

361
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,810
Yet, you remain unmarried as the elder.

362
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:42,210
Tell me,

363
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,660
how can this be justified?

364
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,380
Though I'm unmarried,

365
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,290
my heart belongs to someone.

366
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:51,660
What use is a heart's desire?

367
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,330
Still, I am all alone.

368
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:59,020
A lady from Lu Clan is competing.

369
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,330
(Lu Clan, Luo Lingyu)

370
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,660
Luo Lingyu?

371
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,380
Seems to be a rising star.

372
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,420
Father,

373
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,620
may I see the candidate list?

374
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,500
Alright.

375
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,380
Eunuch Gao.

376
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:18,690
Your Highness.

377
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:23,980
(Lu Clan, Luo Lingyu)
Miss Luo is joining the contest.

378
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,900
(It seems she is fine now.)

379
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:29,530
Miss Luo?

380
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,410
You were enraged for a beauty.

381
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,020
Is it her?

382
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:43,380
Your heart belongs to someone, right?

383
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,980
Yes. Father, you may not know

384
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:48,050
Miss Luo prepared a Fiery Dance

385
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,140
at the Zhongshan Banquet

386
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,500
to bless the soldiers at the frontier.

387
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:53,810
The entire North Army

388
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,660
was deeply moved by it.

389
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:57,980
Therefore, I believe

390
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,380
Miss Luo deserves
the title of Flower Goddess.

391
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:06,290
Since you have such faith in Miss Luo,

392
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:09,100
do you dare to make a bet with me?

393
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:10,170
What do we bet on?

394
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:14,290
Whichever lady wins the title this year,

395
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:17,450
I will grant her marriage to you

396
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:19,810
as princess consort. How about that?

397
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,020
Father, please don't.

398
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:25,170
Miss Luo is the only one I love.

399
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:26,570
What if I lose the bet?

400
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,530
Wouldn't that ruin my lifelong happiness?

401
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:33,660
You've never been afraid
on the battlefield.

402
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,850
It seems like

403
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:39,140
Miss Luo doesn't have real skills.

404
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,780
Now that I've secured the spot,

405
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:46,810
I need to get a fine outfit.

406
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:50,330
I'm afraid even 10 taels of silver
won't cover it.

407
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:52,090
I also need to hire a teacher,

408
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,930
which is another big expense.

409
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,170
- Plus...
- Miss Luo.

410
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,020
Third Young Master.

411
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,210
Wait.

412
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:10,330
I heard you're joining
the Flower Goddess Contest.

413
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:13,500
You hope to reclaim the property
by the Emperor's wish.

414
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:16,980
Yes, I mentioned to you before.

415
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,020
I'll handle it in my own way.

416
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,620
That's a good approach.

417
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,740
It's your first time in this contest.

418
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:28,500
If there's anything unclear,

419
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,060
feel free to ask me anytime.

420
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,100
It's no trouble at all.

421
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:34,530
I appreciate your kindness.

422
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,570
I can handle the contest myself.

423
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,290
You don't have to worry about it.

424
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:44,050
Third Young Master, you must be busy.

425
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,450
I shall take my leave first.

426
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,100
Actually, I...

427
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:52,810
We are even now.

428
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:55,900
In the future, you can follow your own path,

429
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,660
and I'll take mine.

430
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:01,260
(This feels a bit unfamiliar to me.)

431
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:03,620
Oh, Young Master.

432
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,180
Why can't you speak directly to Miss Luo?

433
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,420
You spoke up for her just now

434
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,450
before Madam Lu.

435
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:11,620
I naturally help with
what she wants to do.

436
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,020
What's there to say?

437
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,280
But now with the Flower Goddess Contest,

438
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,740
she doesn't need you anymore.

439
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,500
In the future,

440
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,740
what reason will you have to see her?

441
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,980
She doesn't need me,

442
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:27,260
but I need her.

443
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,290
Young Master, wait for me.

Miss Luo.

Jinchuan broke my inkstone.

448
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:50,410

Sorry to bother you again.

454

Jinchuan also tore my paper.

455
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,530
May I borrow some of yours?

456
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:10,870

that you'll say,

It'd be a pity to throw them away.

Better repair them."

All tools are here.

00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,690
Goodbye, Third Young Master.

482
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:16,210
Wait a moment.

483
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:20,300
Young Master, my lady also said,

484
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,140
"If it doesn't work, replace Jinchuan.

485
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:23,670
He's damaged so many things.

486
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:25,260
Better to find a careful person."

487
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:27,140
Is your lady at home?

488
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:30,060
She went out to learn skills today.

489
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,420
She's preparing for the contest,

490
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,370
she's awfully busy.

491
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:33,900
Young Master, no need to look for her.

492
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,140
See you.

(Xuewu Courtyard)

494
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:41,620
Young Master,

495
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,580
what about this table?

496
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,550
Take it back for repairs.

497
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,300
I wonder what skills she'll learn

498
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,500
to join the contest.

499
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:53,570
Jinchuan, I have an idea.

500
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,840
Tomorrow, get some money from the bank.

501
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,130
Visit all the entertainment houses
in Yuezhou.

502
00:23:58,130 --> 00:23:59,140
Bribe them all.

503
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,130
If she goes to learn skills...

504
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:02,170
they'll refuse her,

505
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,130
and she will then seek your help.

506
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:05,410
Ask them to reduce the fee.

00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:21,900
Brother.

510
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:26,260
Changyi, have you just left Imperial Study,

511
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:29,020
and reported something
I shouldn't know to Father.

512
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,330
I've been investigating
saltpeter smugglers.

513
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:34,780
A few days ago,

514
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,740
I caught someone linking with Beichu.

515
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:40,740
You happen to know this person.

516
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:44,930
Just say what you want to say.

517
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,210
The saltpeter ends up in one place,

518
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:50,810
the Fan Family.

519
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,620
The Fan Family is Shuozhou's wealthiest.

520
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,020
They're Imperial Merchants.

521
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,740
Why would they betray
for such petty gain?

522
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,160
They colluded with the enemy.

523
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,020
The evidence is solid.

524
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,050
Father has ordered
a thorough investigation.

525
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,260
Brother,

526
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,500
the North Army

527
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,020
(Zichen Palace)

528
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,730
has had dealings with the Fans for years.

529
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,930
You really know nothing about this?

530
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:19,210
Regarding military supplies,

531
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,140
I don't needed to handle it personally.

532
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,420
It's all...

533
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:25,930
(Could this involve Mr. Kong?)

534
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,100
Changyi, if you intend to harm me,

535
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:30,900
there's no need for such a detour.

536
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:34,210
I have no such intention.

537
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:35,900
If the Fan Family is truly behind this,

538
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:37,570
I won't be lenient.

539
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:39,660
But if someone is framing us,

540
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,660
they won't get away with it.

541
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:44,810
I hope you investigate thoroughly.

542
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,530
I will uncover the truth.

543
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,500
Your Highness.

544
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,760
Weren't you going to the Ministry of Rites?

545
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,840
Why are you here?

546
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,530
I did visit the Ministry of Rites today.

547
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:31,020
Your Highness, you seem troubled.

548
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:33,140
It's nothing major,

549
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:34,970
just that more humble scholars

550
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:36,460
are joining the Imperial Examination.

551
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,430
The noble clans have expressed concerns.

552
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:40,180
The power of the noble clans

553
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,410
affects everything intricately.

554
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:42,980
I can't just ignore it,

555
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,560
but if we consider the noble clans,

556
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,740
the opportunities
for humble scholars will diminish.

557
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:51,450
Zibo, what's your opinion?

558
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:52,660
I...

559
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,780
I happened to make Lard and Chive Pie.

560
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:03,210
Could you help me with something first?

561
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:04,860
Of course.

562
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,100
Your clothes are dirty.

563
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:24,910
Thank you, Your Highness.

564
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,170
The dough is a bit dry.

565
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:32,020
Could you add some water?

566
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:33,780
Alright.

567
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:42,450
Your Highness, what are you doing?

568
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,310
I'm afraid of adding too much.

569
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:48,450
No worries, just add it.

570
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,530
If there's too much water, add flour.

571
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,620
Enough, enough.

572
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:57,860
Look,

573
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,060
the noble clans

574
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,100
are like water,

575
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,860
and the humble scholars like flour.

576
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:05,030
If there's too much flour, add water,

577
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,410
or the other way around.

578
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,410
But it can't be done overnight.

579
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,530
It must be done
according to circumstances.

580
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:23,450
I understand now.

581
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:24,930
Your Highness, you're indeed wise.

582
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,660
It was definitely worth visiting you.

583
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:33,140
Usually, I hear too much scholarly talk.

584
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:35,170
Watching you make a pie is better.

585
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:38,500
Zibo, you always enlighten me.

586
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:48,210
Your Highness.

587
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,980
Your Highness, may I become your...

588
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,540
become your...

589
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,020
advisor?

590
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:08,690
Ad...

591
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:09,930
Advisor?

592
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:17,690
Your Highness, you're unwilling, right?

593
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:19,300
No, no, that's not it.

594
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,210
I... I certainly am willing.

595
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:22,810
Really?

596
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,690
Then thank you, Your Highness.

597
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:28,660
Today

598
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,620
marks my first day as your advisor.

599
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:33,050
The Lard and Chive Pie must be well made.

600
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:36,260
Wait. Let's add another dish for you.

601
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,140
How about scrambled eggs with chives?

602
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:40,390
Scrambled eggs with chives,

603
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:41,210
Lard and Chive Pie...

604
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,260
I love eating chives.

605
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:44,810
That's good.

606
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,700
Zibo, you added so much filling.

607
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,810
It might spill out.

608
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:51,860
No worries.

609
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:54,980
Let me make a bigger one for you.

610
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,020
Alright.

611
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:00,330
Look.

612
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,930
Your nose...

613
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,140
Look at this.

614
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:18,460
(Lu Mansion)

615
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:25,090
Prince Hengyang?

616
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,690
What brings you here?

617
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:35,210
I'm here to deliver something to you.

618
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:42,290
You said that the jade hairpin is fragile,

619
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,020
so you didn't dare to wear it out.

620
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,620
I selected a few more items

621
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:46,900
and brought them for you.

622
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,020
No need to be so careful anymore.

623
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:50,210
If it breaks, it breaks.

624
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:51,530
You can replace it.

625
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:53,900
This gift

626
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:55,930
is truly precious.

627
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:57,330
I cannot accept it.

628
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:59,010
You're entering the Flower Goddess Contest.

629
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,780
These will surely be useful.

630
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:04,660
How did you know I'll compete?

631
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,970
On the list selected by my father,

632
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:12,170
I saw your name,

633
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,050
and brought the invitation to you

634
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:17,020
to share the good news with you.

635
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,420
(Flower Goddess Invitation)

636
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,460
(Lady Luo Lingyu has been accepted.)

637
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:28,780
You're so thoughtful.

638
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:30,530
I'm deeply grateful.

639
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:34,410
Miss Luo, regarding your participation,

640
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:36,260
is there anything I can assist with?

641
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:39,100
Do you need me to
request palace dancers to help,

642
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,740
a musician to accompany you,

643
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:42,810
or anything else?

644
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,420
I'll get it done.

645
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:45,900
If you have faith in me,

646
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,410
you need not do anything.

647
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,660
Just go back and relax.

648
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:50,650
As for the Flower Goddess Contest,

649
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:52,630
I will win on my own merits,

650
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:54,570
and earn the title of Flower Goddess.

651
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:01,660
But this gift is truly valuable.

652
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:03,250
The matter of Fan Qingchen

653
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:04,620
was resolved thanks to your help.

654
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:07,500
I should've brought a gift to thank you.

655
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,140
How could I accept your gift?

656
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:10,980
Resolving Fan Qingchen's matter

657
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:13,660
was a promise I made to you,

658
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,450
so I had to fulfill it.

659
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,020
As for this gift,

660
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:20,570
you can send me another one in return.

661
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:22,450
Then, we will be even.

662
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:24,210
A gift in return...

663
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,050
I left in a hurry,

664
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:32,380
and didn't bring anything.

665
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,530
I made this Tongcao Flower myself.

666
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:37,020
Hope you'll like it.

667
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:40,100
Your creations are the finest.

668
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:47,290
Are you going out
for the Flower Goddess Contest?

669
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:49,170
Indeed.

670
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,330
Then I won't hold you.

671
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:58,780
Thank you.

672
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,500
Miss Luo,

673
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:05,210
you must win the Flower Goddess Contest.

674
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:10,690
Miss Luo doesn't have real skills.

675
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,450
A bet is a bet.

676
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:16,500
Miss Luo will not lose.

677
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:17,900
Good.

678
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:19,780
It's a deal.

679
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,780
(Xunmei House)

680
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:31,660
So many dancers at Xunmei House, all popular.

681
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:35,090
Why did you specifically choose me?

682
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:36,500
Qiniang, no need to be modest.

683
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,450
With your remarkable talent,

684
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:41,330
I fear you'll be stolen away from me.

685
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,500
Even if it means waiting all night,

686
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:44,930
it's worth it.

687
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,450
Since you asked for me,

688
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:49,860
you must know I value money over people.

689
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:52,330
How much are you offering?

690
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:01,900
Miss Luo, it's not that
I overestimate myself,

691
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,730
but with such a small sum,

692
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:06,450
you can't even buy a moment of my time.

693
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,490
Yet you want me to teach you to dance?

694
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:11,290
Qiniang, you are mistaken.

695
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,570
I came here

696
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:16,010
not for myself,

697
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:17,970
but for you.

698
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:21,620
I'm all ears.

699
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:30,620
Although your Qipan Dance is famous,

700
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:33,140
it's still too refined,

701
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,150
hard to find an appreciative audience.

702
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:39,050
This one-time deal won't last.

703
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:43,050
If you help me
win the Flower Goddess title,

704
00:34:43,890 --> 00:34:45,330
things would be different.

705
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:47,890
You're quite confident.

706
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:50,490
But becoming the Flower Goddess isn't easy.

707
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:54,330
Have you heard of Zhongshan's Fiery Dance?

708
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:56,950
It was performed at the banquet

709
00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:59,100
for Prince Hengyang.

710
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:02,010
Seems like your information is up-to-date.

711
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:05,250
Do you know who performed it?

712
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:09,730
That's right.

713
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,490
It's me.

714
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,940
The Fiery Dance is from the Northern Border,

715
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,100
but once it passes through my hands,

716
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:19,900
it has become widely loved in Yuezhou.

717
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:22,520
The Flower Goddess Contest
is a great chance.

718
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:25,490
With a small change to the Qipan Dance,

719
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:28,180
it'll be appreciated
not just by the noble clans,

720
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:29,940
but also by common people.

721
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,530
As long as we combine our talents.

722
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:35,570
The Flower Goddess title is within reach.

723
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:40,100
Once this opportunity opens up,

724
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,810
whether it's spectators

725
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,940
or those coming to learn dance,

726
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,810
they'll flock to Xunmei House.

727
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:51,530
Earning great fortune won't be a pipe dream.

728
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:00,490
I can give you at most four hours a day.

729
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,220
Anything more will cost extra.

730
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:07,220
If you agree,

731
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,660
sign this contract.

732
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,660
(Sign: Luo Lingyu)

733
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,020
(Sign: Luo Lingyu, Mei Qiniang)

734
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:34,460
(Sign: Luo Lingyu, Mei Qiniang)

735
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:42,460
Your Highness, this is just a fake flower.

736
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,700
Why are you so happy?

737
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,250
You don't understand.

738
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:50,180
It represents
Miss Luo's deep affection for me.

739
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:53,250
But she didn't mention her affection.

740
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:57,330
How did you interpret it
as true affection?

741
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:01,530
A gentleman judges by actions.

742
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,570
She hosted a banquet for me,

743
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,250
and performed Fiery Dance.

744
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:09,570
Now she gives me
an ever-blooming Tongcao Flower.

745
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:13,770
It symbolizes our enduring affection.

746
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:15,970
On the contest day,

747
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:18,050
I will surely bring it there.

748
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:26,420
(I must win this bet with Father).

749
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,660
Since he has awakened,

750
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,490
and only minor injuries remain,

751
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:40,970
a couple more days of rest will suffice.

752
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:42,980
Thank you.

753
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,460
Jinchuan, see the physician out.

754
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:46,420
Sure.

755
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,100
This way, sir.

756
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:51,980
You're lucky.

757
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:54,970
I'm glad you're fine.

758
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:56,050
In the coming days,

759
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,770
rest and recover at Xunmei House.

760
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:58,970
Just focus on recovery.

761
00:37:58,970 --> 00:37:59,810
Young Master.

762
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,100
I previously discovered

763
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,860
Fan Qingchen is looking for Wang Chongming.

764
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:04,730
Is there any news on this matter?

765
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:07,420
I've already had Aman
send someone to inquire.

766
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,570
I got the news.

767
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,670
I just hadn't had time to tell you.

768
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:17,420
His identity is indeed not simple.

769
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,730
He was the only one in the North Army

770
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,140
who could decipher Yin books.

771
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,140
Over ten days ago,

772
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:27,180
he left Xiaomei Village
in the western suburb.

773
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,100
His whereabouts

774
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:30,220
remains unknown.

775
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,690
Perhaps it was Fan Qingchen's arrival

776
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:33,970
that alerted him,

777
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:35,520
making him hide in haste.

778
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:36,730
Aman,

779
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:39,700
we must find him
before those masterminds do,

780
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:40,810
or he'll be silenced.

781
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,660
I have another matter to discuss with you.

782
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,050
In the Fan Mansion,

783
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:49,380
they indeed found
a lot of unshipped saltpeter.

784
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:51,100
Master Fan took his own life on the spot.

785
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:53,090
What?

786
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:55,530
Be careful.

787
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,140
There might be greater forces behind them,

788
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,290
which made him so terrified

789
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:02,940
that he ended his own life.

790
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:05,620
He wanted to settle the saltpeter issue.

791
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:08,460
Earlier, I met Hengyang at the palace

792
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,770
and tested him with this issue.

793
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:12,420
Just as you said,

794
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,100
he knows nothing about saltpeter.

795
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,650
It seems the mastermind

796
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:17,570
even set him up.

797
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:18,660
Indeed.

798
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:20,330
Prince Hengyang has the North Army.

799
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:22,460
If someone uses him,

800
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:23,900
it could end badly.

801
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:26,650
Better to clear up the misunderstandings

802
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:27,810
between us and him early.

803
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,700
I've already invited him to come.

804
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:46,860
Young Master, you must be tired.

805
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:47,940
Shall we take a rest?

806
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,380
Young Master.

807
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:59,620
Lingyu, you have such a cruel heart.

808
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:03,460
Why can't I let go of you?

809
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,140
I'll find another chance

810
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:10,660
to bring you back to me.

811
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:26,570
Be careful!

812
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,140
Who sent you here?

813
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:33,250
You know too much.
