=Episode 21=

23
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:44,700
Who is this?

24
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,610
Drunk like this in broad daylight,

25
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:47,450
blocking the road?

26
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,140
Do you know who's in the carriage?

27
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,530
Sir,

28
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,060
I drank too much.

29
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,740
I didn't notice you.

30
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,700
Miss, it's Young Master Lu.

31
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:02,970
Xuechen,

32
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,610
why did you drink so much?

33
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,980
(Isn't it the carriage of Minister Chen?)

34
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:10,980
(Why is Miss Chen here?)

35
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:13,930
Don't let him drink more.

36
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,410
The lady whom I love will marry...

37
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,650
someone else.

38
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,410
Why can't I drink?

39
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:23,490
Xuechen,

40
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:24,900
let me send you back first.

41
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,540
If you are seen drinking in the street,

42
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,740
it will do harm to your career.

43
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,620
I'm not going.

44
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:31,740
I'm not going home.

45
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:33,380
I don't want to see her.

46
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,900
I don't want to see her.

47
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,490
Fine, we don't go home.

48
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:37,740
We don't.

49
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,290
Help him get on the carriage.

50
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,460
Okay.

51
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:45,970
Be careful.

52
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,740
(Prince Hengyang's Mansion)

53
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,180
You have been reviewing for a while now.

54
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,380
Is there any error in the register?

55
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,100
(Register)

56
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:21,280
Winter is approaching soon.

57
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:24,620
Are the soldiers' winter clothes ready?

58
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:25,690
Your Highness,

59
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,130
it's only just early autumn.

60
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:33,260
(I wonder how Miss Luo is doing over there.)

61
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:47,770
Your Highness,

62
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,380
there's an error in the accounts book.

63
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,980
Two accounts don't reconcile properly.

64
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:54,130
I'll take a look.

65
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,740
It's just a minor issue.

66
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,100
Let someone else handle it.

67
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,290
This concerns the northern soldiers.

68
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,200
Several bookkeepers are also waiting.

69
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,130
We shouldn't delay them.

70
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,020
Then I'll go with you.

71
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,850
You have military matters to attend to.

72
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:12,210
I'll handle this task for you.

73
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:03,620
Qiuyue, we first stop by at Qianxiang Shop

74
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,130
to buy the pastries my father loves.

75
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,290
Alright, Miss.

76
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,180
Xuechen,

77
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,530
why do you look like this today?

78
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,530
Did something happen?

79
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,090
I'm asking you,

80
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:32,250
if someone you care about made a mistake,

81
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,180
what would you do?

82
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:44,220
Is the lady you care about Miss Luo?

83
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,920
The emperor's order can't be disobeyed.

84
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,020
Even if Miss Luo is powerless,

85
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,130
she ultimately can't oppose His Majesty.

86
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:00,690
Why insist, Xuechen?

87
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:04,220
The emperor's order can't be disobeyed.

88
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,370
Did she ever once

89
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,130
desire to defy the order?

90
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,740
Once some people make a decision,

91
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,370
even close ones

92
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:21,130
can't change it.

93
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,850
(She seems to know something)

94
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:25,880
(about what Minister Chen has done.)

95
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,020
You're right.

96
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,780
If someone insists stubbornly,

97
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,130
while others try hard to pull them out,

98
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,570
it just leads to exhaustion

99
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,090
and ends up with nothing.

100
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,370
Xuechen...

101
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,420
(Zheng Hongye, Yang Zhaowei, Lu Zhan)

102
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:58,060
(No signs of anyone moving it.)

103
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,810
(Could it be that I overthink it?)

104
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:08,900
Someone.

105
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,680
Here.

106
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:14,020
Go find where Miss Luo is.

107
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:14,880
Yes, My Lord.

108
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,900
(Records of Personages)

109
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:25,370
So exquisite.

110
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:26,290
Indeed, and delicious.

111
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,850
I personally cooked this.

112
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,060
I see.

113
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,610
Full of color, aroma, and flavor, right?

114
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:39,970
Your Highness.

115
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,290
You came back just in time.

116
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,250
Miss Luo made the pastries by hand.

117
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,620
Have a taste.

118
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,900
Why do you come so late, Mr. Kong?

119
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,090
I personally cooked this for His Highness,

120
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,850
but he said he does not like pastries.

121
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,130
Please have a taste

122
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:04,130
to let him know what delicacy he missed.

123
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,220
So,

124
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,660
was you just preparing pastries?

125
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,810
I acted recklessly before

126
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:13,130
and nearly damaged our relationship.

127
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:15,410
I must make amends to His Highness.

128
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:17,620
I was just joking with you.

129
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,370
I will surely eat

130
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,250
the pastries you made.

131
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,210
By the way,

132
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,850
you just went to check the account book.

133
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,220
Is there any issue?

134
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:31,220
Just a minor mistake.

135
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:33,340
Do not worry.

136
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,570
Look, they are almost done with the pastries.

137
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,570
Mr. Kong, please have a taste.

138
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:42,730
Thank you.

139
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,660
Your Highness, let's sit and eat.

140
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:51,650
Delicious.

141
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:05,780
(Lu Mansion)

142
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:13,460
Qiuyue, go inform them

143
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,490
that Young Master Lu has arrived

144
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,300
and ask them to pick him up.

145
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:19,450
Yes, Miss.

146
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,930
Xuechen, it's the Lu Mansion.

147
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,620
Don't drink so much in the future.

148
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,170
It's not worth it.

149
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,050
Since it's not worth it,

150
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,370
why do you help me?

151
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,100
You said that exhausting all energy

152
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,980
will end up with nothing.

153
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:48,130
But to me, important people or things,

154
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,660
I can't bear to see them suffer

155
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:53,780
and pretend not to notice.

156
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:57,980
So, regarding your father,

157
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,420
do you feel the same?

158
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:02,860
Even if he aims

159
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,980
to harm the entire Nanyue?

160
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:06,210
I surely...

161
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:10,780
You aren't drunk.

162
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,100
I am not drunk.

163
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,880
I thought it's Minister Chen in the carriage.

164
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,340
This is how I inadvertently deceive you.

165
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:20,970
Sorry.

166
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:24,540
Since you decide to deceive me,

167
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,300
why tell me right now?

168
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,660
And the things about my father.

169
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,780
Aren't you afraid I tell others about it?

170
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:39,730
The year we first met,

171
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:42,130
I have told you,

172
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,540
if one day you decide to leave,

173
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:48,450
come find me.

174
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,420
Today, I'll send you back first.

175
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:54,130
If you truly wish to leave later,

176
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:55,610
then find me.

177
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,900
I know it's hard for you to decide now,

178
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,140
but I want to tell you,

179
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,300
even after all these years,

180
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,070
my promise remains unchanged.

181
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,820
(Lu Mansion)

182
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,300
Your Highness, it's the Lu Mansion.

183
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,540
Miss, I have informed them.

184
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,050
Alright. Coming.

185
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,100
Xuechen.

186
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,380
Be careful.

187
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:56,650
Be careful.

188
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,860
Xuechen,

189
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:09,010
you're drunk.

190
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:09,860
Let me help you.

191
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,050
(Didn't he go to find Minister Chen?)

192
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,690
(Why are they together?)

193
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:16,410
No need.

194
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,220
Wait, Xuechen.

195
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:22,050
Everyone saw

196
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,900
you drunkenly crashed into my carriage.

197
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,170
And everyone knows your conflict

198
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:28,520
with Miss Luo and Prince Hengyang.

199
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,900
Why don't we complete this play together,

200
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,130
to avoid revealing any flaws?

201
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,980
(I'll have to explain to Lingyu later.)

202
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:42,330
Be careful.

203
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:49,050
(He's going too far. They're so close.)

204
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,300
Young Master Lu, you're so carefree.

205
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:03,860
You get drunk in a lady's carriage.

206
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,220
(He knows it's just acting,)

207
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:11,220
(but he actually holds Lingyu's hand.)

208
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:14,570
(Turns out you're not so affectionate.)

209
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:21,370
Seeing you are still as close as ever,

210
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:23,780
I feel relieved.

211
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,300
(How dare he say this?)

212
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,170
No need to care about me.

213
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,020
Your Highness, please escort me inside.

214
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:35,210
Alright.

215
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:40,650
Sir.

216
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:43,980
Sir, how did you drink so much?

217
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,340
- Let's go.
- Okay.

218
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:53,130
Whenever you're ready to talk,

219
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,170
I'm here to listen.

220
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:06,700
(Lu Mansion)

221
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,730
Thank you for the water.

222
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,900
I see your hands steady and stable.

223
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,460
Are you sober now?

224
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,740
Why is it so sour?

225
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,730
Sourness can make you sober up.

226
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,340
We agreed to act drunk

227
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,420
and then collide with Mr. Chen's carriage.

228
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,730
Why is Miss Chen

229
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,690
who sent you back?

230
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,220
Today's matter is unexpected.

231
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,780
I've already sung halfway through the play.

232
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,810
Unexpectedly, it was Miss Chen.

233
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:09,300
Then I can only finish the performance.

234
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:14,570
Besides,

235
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,660
I think you and Prince Hengyang

236
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,690
talked happily.

237
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:20,300
From his mansion to Lu Mansion,

238
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,780
you are still holding hands.

239
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,170
Did you have to talk while holding hands?

240
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,220
That can't compare to you and Miss Chen.

241
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,900
Hiding secretly in the carriage.

242
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,930
Who knows if she has given you sober-up soup?

243
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:52,130
I feel like you are more sour than grapes.

244
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,020
Be serious.

245
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,570
I have something to tell you.

246
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,090
Look at this.

247
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,420
(New Imperial Scholars)
What's this?

248
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,980
Today, Prince Hengyang covered for me.

249
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,900
I went to Mr. Kong's room

250
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:14,340
and found this list.

251
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:16,490
I wrote it down when I came back.

252
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,490
He didn't suspect you, did he?

253
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,660
He did suspect something,

254
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:22,050
but fortunately,

255
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:23,690
Prince Hengyang and I

256
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:24,900
cooperated well,

257
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,050
and didn't alert anyone.

258
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,860
He's truly the commander of the North Army.

259
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:32,340
I've noticed your opinion of him lately

260
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,490
is getting higher.

261
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:37,130
Do you regret calling off the engagement?

262
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:39,730
You better not make me regret it.

263
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,810
What's really on this?

264
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:49,220
Newly Imperial Scholars.

265
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:53,980
He has been undercover for decades.

266
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:55,730
How could he be so careless?

267
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,810
Since this list can be easily found,

268
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,780
it shows the person behind it

269
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:02,940
probably thinks

270
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:05,060
there's nothing crucial on it.

271
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,730
We can only

272
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:08,850
start by examining their connections.

273
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:12,420
These names look somewhat familiar.

274
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,700
The Ministry of Personnel drafted

275
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,090
a list of newly appointed officials,

276
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,640
and it includes these people.

277
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,020
They seem to be the Imperial Censors.

278
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:22,610
Imperial Censors?

279
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:26,300
Imperial Censors oversee all officials.

280
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:28,020
The spies of Beichu planted in the court

281
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,040
can't escape the investigation

282
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,300
if they take any action.

283
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,850
So they want to place these individuals

284
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,490
in the position of Imperial Censor.

285
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,060
That seems to be the case.

286
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,970
I'll find a way to investigate

287
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:40,210
the information on these people

288
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:42,250
and see if I can trace back to find anything.

289
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,730
I just don't know who are

290
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:47,820
Chen Hao's henchmen on this list.

291
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:50,810
Aman,

292
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,580
could you bring this year's exam papers?

293
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:55,780
Yangling,

294
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,420
do you have a plan?

295
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,780
If they want to insert these people,

296
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,700
they must ensure they excel in the exam

297
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,450
and get His Majesty's favor.

298
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:05,940
If there's any tampering,

299
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,180
we might find clues in the essays.

300
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,490
That's a good idea.

301
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,370
Let's handle this together.

302
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:18,860
Alright.

303
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,700
These are the exam papers of all candidates.

304
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,180
(Wang Yichang)

305
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,820
Look at this one.

306
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:03,660
This year's exam topic

307
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,020
is about the Heart of the Emperor,

308
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,130
and the Governance of the Emperor.

309
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:07,660
Most candidates focus on benevolence,

310
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,450
righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust.

311
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,300
But this one takes a different approach.

312
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,020
He discusses true heart and true governance.

313
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,610
Implement governance with true heart,

314
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,300
thus true governance achieves great merits.

315
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:20,540
These terms were introduced by my father.

316
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,970
It seems this person is guided by someone.

317
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,060
I think I just saw this phrase too.

318
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:29,420
Those must have a true heart.

319
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,730
For officials, they have laws to follow.

320
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,050
For people, they have laws to govern by.

321
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,580
Look at this sentence.

322
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,980
(For officials, they have laws to follow.)

323
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:40,940
And this one.

324
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,900
Only these three mentioned this.

325
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,450
But His Majesty never mentioned it outside.

326
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:47,660
At least,

327
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:50,300
I've never seen it in other essays.

328
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,540
These three have consistent views.

329
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,180
It's quite a coincidence.

330
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,330
They are likely Minister Chen's informants.

331
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,900
To ensures their smooth success in exams,

332
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:01,900
Minister Chen informed them in advance.

333
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,120
Someone has committed fraud in the exam.

334
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,540
Let's search again

335
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,020
to avoid missing any other ones.

336
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,060
The position of Imperial Censor

337
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,820
is indeed significant.

338
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,900
- Minister Chen.
- Minister Lu.

339
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,310
It has the power to oversee all officials

340
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,490
and directly advise the throne.

341
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:29,330
This position

342
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,730
can't be vacant for long, right?

343
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:38,370
Mr. Lu, do you know His Majesty's plan?

344
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:43,060
Minister Chen, it's best to wait patiently.

345
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:47,020
Prince Hengyang and Prince Changyi arrive.

346
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:52,520
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

347
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,000
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

348
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,780
His Majesty has arrived.

349
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:14,540
Long may you reign, Your Majesty.

350
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,380
Rise.

351
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:18,420
Thank you, Your Majesty.

352
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:21,290
Announce.

353
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:26,060
Summon the new Imperial Censor.

354
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:20,250
I am the new Imperial Censor Lu Yun.

355
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:21,940
Greetings, Your Majesty.

356
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:24,970
Rise.

357
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:27,270
Thank you, Your Majesty.

358
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:30,940
Recently, an anonymous report surfaced,

359
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:35,300
claiming some officials are selling positions

360
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,780
and engaging in factional schemes.

361
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,420
You all are trusted by me.

362
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:49,090
There's chaos below, yet no one noticed.

363
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:53,820
Your Majesty, please calm down.

364
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,540
Xuechen.

365
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,420
Here.

366
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,590
As the new official in charge,

367
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:07,450
you conduct a thorough investigation into it

368
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:08,860
and ensure

369
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:13,330
that this group of vermin in the court

370
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:14,700
is exposed.

371
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:18,180
I accept the decree.

372
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:31,940
(Zichen Palace)

373
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:32,850
Young Master Lu.

374
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,420
Minister Chen.

375
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:37,660
You're too kind.

376
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,730
You can call me Xuechen from now on.

377
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:43,580
You are really something!

378
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,180
At the Zhongshan Banquet,

379
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:47,450
you were mischievous and playful.

380
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:51,540
Now you seem much more composed.

381
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:56,660
His Majesty appoints you

382
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:57,900
as the Imperial Censor.

383
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,450
He has high hopes for you.

384
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:02,170
Minister Chen,

385
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,850
I have just started my official career,

386
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:06,780
and was immediately assigned

387
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:07,780
such an important task.

388
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:09,500
I don't even know where to begin.

389
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:12,020
I'm afraid I can't handle things well

390
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,770
and will disappoint the Emperor's grace.

391
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:19,050
Come.

392
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:24,250
A new broom sweeps clean.

393
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:28,450
But the situation in the court is complex.

394
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:32,420
I'm afraid you can sweep clean,

395
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,820
but get you dirty.

396
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:36,490
It will be bad.

397
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:41,940
Thank you for your guidance.

398
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:43,690
Actually,

399
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,250
your talents surpass many of my students.

400
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,420
Now that you're in the court,

401
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,730
no wonder Xiu

402
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,450
has deep feelings for you these years

403
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,060
and has never changed her heart.

404
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:58,050
Mr. Chen,

405
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,660
I am just a playboy.

406
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,060
How can I be worthy of Miss Chen?

407
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,470
Please, don't joke about this.

408
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:05,490
How could it be a joke?

409
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,940
You're part of us now.

410
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,490
Your future career

411
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:11,660
will be supported by your uncle

412
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,180
and me.

413
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:16,130
Your future is limitless.

414
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:17,420
You've made great progress.

415
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:18,850
I'm willing

416
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,850
to marry my daughter to you.

417
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,180
- But I...
- Xuechen.

418
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:26,170
Uncle.

419
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:30,490
He, a member of Lu Family,

420
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:32,610
holds an important positions in the court.

421
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,490
I will definitely support him.

422
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:37,300
No need for your advice.

423
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,130
Xuechen, let's go.

424
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,620
Yes.

425
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:44,970
Xuechen,

426
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,420
regarding what I told you earlier,

427
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,450
take a few days to consider it

428
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,420
and then give me your reply.

429
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:54,930
Understood.

430
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,740
(Chen Mansion)

431
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,370
Lu Xuechen is still young.

432
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,950
His foundation is not strong.

433
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,090
He is an Imperial Censor now.

434
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,660
From now on, our actions

435
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,000
will become increasingly difficult.

436
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,660
What do you find inappropriate?

437
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:31,610
Luo Lingyu visited Prince Hengyang's Mansion.

438
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:34,300
She and Prince Hengyang were cordial,

439
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:36,610
but not particularly close.

440
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:39,180
There seemed to be no conflict.

441
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:43,210
She asked to call off the engagement lately,

442
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:45,090
which caused quite a stir.

443
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:49,210
Something unusual about their marriage?

444
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:56,700
Whether it's deceit

445
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,940
or just a mistake,

446
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,060
as long as they marry,

447
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,820
we can seize this opportunity.

448
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:02,820
What do you mean by that?

449
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,330
After my probing,

450
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:07,130
Lu Xuechen has a deep hatred

451
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,520
for Prince Hengyang and Luo Lingyu.

452
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:10,660
I can take this opportunity

453
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:12,780
to betroth Xiu to him,

454
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:16,370
keeping him by my side.

455
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:18,580
In his role as Imperial Censor,

456
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,780
he will make every decision

457
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,060
under my control.

458
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,180
But that Lu Yun

459
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:23,730
is likely investigating

460
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:25,940
the mastermind behind the saltpeter case.

461
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,070
Isn't keeping him around the perfect way

462
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,820
to eliminate the problem completely?

463
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,700
If we can use his hand to complete our task

464
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:41,900
and place our people in the court,

465
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:44,940
even if it becomes exposed in the future,

466
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,370
it won't be connected to us.

467
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,370
It's truly a double win.

468
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:00,940
What did you say?

469
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,660
Want me to marry Xuechen?

470
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:06,330
Xuechen grew up with you.

471
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,970
Though he was a bit mischievous as a child,

472
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:11,540
he's matured now.

473
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,900
He looks quite good.

474
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:17,300
Besides, you've always admired him.

475
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:20,820
This fulfills your wish.

476
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,610
Although he is from Lu Family,

477
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:28,730
he's just a dependent nephew.

478
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,490
He's known for being charming.

479
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:31,840
His actions are quite unrestrained.

480
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,300
He might not be a suitable match.

481
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:37,450
Although he is new to the officialdom,

482
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:40,730
he has been appointed as Imperial Censor.

483
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:42,490
His future is very promising.

484
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:43,780
He's a young man.

485
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,300
He has indeed improved a lot.

486
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:50,300
Haven't you always wanted to marry him?

487
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:52,420
Your father understand your wishes.

488
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,820
You should thank your father.

489
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:00,540
When Xuechen had no official position,

490
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,210
you felt he wasn't worthy of our Family.

491
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:07,940
He is an official now.

492
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,660
Then you thought of my marriage.

493
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:12,780
People might think our family

494
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,210
is trying to curry favor.

495
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,260
Watch your words!

496
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,290
What are you saying?

497
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:19,610
If you weren't so fond of that guy,

498
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,450
I wouldn't have brought it up.

499
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:22,810
Besides,

500
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:25,780
you brought him, who was drunk,

501
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,120
onto your carriage a few days ago.

502
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:29,330
Do you know how people say about you?

503
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,020
That day, Lu Yun was drunk.

504
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,450
He just rested briefly in my carriage.

505
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:36,250
I sent him back to the Lu Mansion

506
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,210
and left immediately.

507
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:40,780
I did nothing inappropriate with him.

508
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,820
You did something so disgraceful.

509
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:44,250
What more excuses do you have?

510
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:09,940
It's my first time wearing this uniform.

511
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,350
How do you think it looks?

512
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,850
I'm surrounded by royalty and nobility.

513
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:17,060
It's refreshing to see an inferior official.

514
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,970
A change is nice sometimes.

515
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:25,660
The position of Imperial Censor

516
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,540
has been eyed by Chen Hao for a long time.

517
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,540
Now that I've taken this position,

518
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:31,570
he will surely try to win me over.

519
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:34,350
However, by getting close to him,

520
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:37,020
I can uncover the truth from years ago.

521
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,970
Will Chen Hao trust you?

522
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:44,610
Chen Hao is cunning.

523
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,900
If I want him to see me as an ally,

524
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:49,540
I need Miss Chen to mediate.

525
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:52,850
Will Miss Chen

526
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:55,250
help you?

527
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:57,570
It's uncertain.

528
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:02,210
Xuechen,

529
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,780
marry me.

530
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,140
What do you think?

531
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,500
What?

532
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,240
Rather than being his daughter,

533
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,130
I'm more a citizen of Nanyue.

534
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:31,820
If what he does will endanger the people

535
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,540
of Nanyue and the hard-won stability,

536
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:36,020
I can't turn a blind eye to it.

537
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:39,490
But the marriage...

538
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:40,940
It was suggested by him.

539
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:42,940
He is eager to act

540
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:44,780
and wants to win over Xuechen.

541
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:48,850
It means they aim to do something

542
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,400
in the position of Imperial Censor.

543
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,610
If not resolved,

544
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:54,670
there will be future troubles.

545
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,180
Since he has this idea,

546
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:02,580
we might as well go along with it

547
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:05,730
and get married.

548
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:09,780
Then you

549
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:13,060
can naturally approach my father.

550
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:15,900
Miss Luo,

551
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:17,970
are you willing?

552
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:23,730
Not to mention if she's willing,

553
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:25,420
you should ask if I'm willing.

554
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,090
That is indeed a good plan.

555
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,620
But...

556
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,210
Yes, yes, but.

557
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,670
Hurry and tell her but what.

558
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,130
But,

559
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:41,180
in order to help us,

560
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:42,610
you use your own marriage.

561
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,250
It's unfair to you.

562
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:47,300
It's not to help you.

563
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:52,130
Duty surpasses personal feelings.

564
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,010
- Xuechen.
- Young Master Yun.

565
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,140
- What do you think?
- What do you think?

566
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,000
Does my opinion matter now?

567
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,260
Does it still matter?

568
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:28,730
Look at your gloomy face.

569
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,940
Push me away with words,

570
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:32,580
but you regret once she's gone.

571
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:34,090
Let me clarify it now.

572
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:34,930
There's still time.

573
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:38,620
Have a seat.

574
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:44,300
I was thinking

575
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,820
although I lost my parents at a young age,

576
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:50,580
I remember they loved and cared for me,

577
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:53,370
treating me and Hua like treasures.

578
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,540
But Miss Chen's situation is different.

579
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:58,580
I used to envy her

580
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,610
for having parents to rely on.

581
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:02,940
But now it seems

582
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:05,000
she has lived more cautiously

583
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,090
than I have all these years.

584
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:12,060
Even she's willing to marry you.

585
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:13,930
Willing to marry me?

586
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:16,340
When you first came to the Lu Mansion,

587
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,410
you didn't think this way.

588
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:18,890
Times have changed.

589
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:20,170
Times have changed.

590
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:21,450
You only care about her,

591
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:22,570
why don't you care about me?

592
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:24,170
It's not her alone getting married.

593
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,140
Who hasn't gotten married before?

594
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,860
Who hasn't worn wedding attire?

595
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,970
I've signed the letter of marriage twice.

596
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:36,140
Nowadays, I am still single,

597
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,450
enjoying the peace

598
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:38,780
and freedom.

599
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:40,940
Come here.

600
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,690
Single? Peace?

601
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:45,930
Peaceful ears.

602
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,780
Are you saying I talk too little?

603
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:52,730
♪Let love not be late♪

604
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,490
It's getting late now.

605
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:55,650
I'm leaving.

606
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:59,210
We both have our own engagements now.

607
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:00,690
To avoid gossip,

608
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,730
you should return half an hour later.

609
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:05,980
Lingyu.

610
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,350
Are you leaving just like this?

611
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,650
Do you really not want me anymore?

612
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:13,140
♪Take it slow, don't be tense, it's true♪

613
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:16,550
♪Love is love, hate is hate, no debate♪

614
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:20,280
♪Don't waste this life, make it great♪

615
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:35,900
Minister Chen.

616
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:41,250
Mr. Lu.

617
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:44,620
Didn't we agree before

618
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:45,930
you can call me Xuechen?

619
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,340
I must call you like that.

620
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,620
There are many officials here.

621
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:53,020
If I don't call you that,

622
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:56,490
how do you establish your authority?

623
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:59,380
You consider so thoroughly for me.

624
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:01,540
I am truly grateful.

625
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,930
A few days ago, you mentioned the wish

626
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,540
for our two families to unite by marriage.

627
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:10,970
I pondered deeply upon return

628
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,730
and finally understood

629
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:15,690
your genuine care for me.

630
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:19,490
So what are your plans now?

631
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:22,380
I hold respect in my heart.

632
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,450
I wish to marry Miss Chen.

633
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,780
Great! That's wonderful news.

634
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,340
You're a promising young man.

635
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:31,170
If you truly feel this way,

636
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,780
then entrusting Xiu to you

637
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,450
will set my mind at ease.

638
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:36,580
Thank you, Minister Chen.

639
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:41,490
In that case, a good day is approaching,

640
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:43,020
perfect for marriages.

641
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:45,780
Let's set it as the engagement day.

642
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:46,900
Is it good?

643
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:53,660
Good.

644
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:54,530
That's good.

645
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:57,540
I'll prepare carefully

646
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,620
and conduct the ceremony personally.

647
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:00,730
Okay.

648
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,370
I'll be waiting for you.

649
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,730
Then I'll take my leave.

650
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,380
(He agreed so readily.)

651
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:18,930
((Has this guy really figured it out,)

652
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,210
(or is there a trick involved?)

653
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:27,860
(Lu Mansion)

654
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:30,780
You want to marry Chen Xiu?

655
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:31,940
Yes.

656
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:34,730
What are you up to?

657
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:39,210
Uncle, I have thought it through.

658
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:41,220
Don't try to fool me with these words.

659
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:42,920
I've been talking to you about marriage,

660
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,670
but you have rejected it countless times.

661
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,690
And you're also entangled

662
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:48,340
with Miss Luo.

663
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:51,650
You treat the marriage as if it were a game.

664
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:54,380
What are you planning?

665
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,770
Uncle, you're overthinking.

666
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:58,250
I met Miss Chen when we were young,

667
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,450
and our ten-year friendship

668
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:01,100
is even deeper than that with Lady Luo.

669
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,170
Do you think I'll believe you?

670
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:06,210
Regarding the blindness,

671
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,100
I've investigated the cause.

672
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:12,860
Uncle, if you don't believe me,

673
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:13,870
there's nothing I can do.

674
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:16,490
But Miss Luo taught me a lesson,

675
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:19,250
only simplicity can last long.

676
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,890
As they say, once bitten, twice shy.

677
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,650
I should cherish those around me.

678
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:32,490
Alright,

679
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:36,140
I'll take your word for it.

680
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:39,450
But now you are an imperial official,

681
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:42,650
be cautious in your words and actions.

682
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:44,820
Don't bring trouble to the Lu Family.

683
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,650
Yes, Uncle.

684
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,580
(Chen Mansion)

685
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:00,930
Place everything in Xiu's room.

686
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:02,590
- Yes, My Lord.
- Yes, My Lord.

687
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,620
Spray the flowers with water.

688
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:07,210
Make sure they look vibrant.

689
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:08,430
- Yes, My Lord.
- Yes, My Lord.

690
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:11,010
Father.

691
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:13,020
What's going on?

692
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,170
You look so pale.

693
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:16,450
Didn't you hang out with Xuechen today?

694
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,540
Did his lively nature

695
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:19,890
upset you again?

696
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,890
Xuechen is always carefree.

697
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,170
But he's always kind to me.

698
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:26,580
It's just that...

699
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,780
When you put it that way,

700
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:29,300
it must be your fault then.

701
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:31,930
I've told you many times.

702
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:33,210
Your temperament is just too dull

703
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:36,250
because of how your mother raised you.

704
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,340
Once you're married,

705
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,780
how will you get along with Xuechen?

706
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,380
You should know

707
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:46,210
I have never been one to curry favor.

708
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:51,340
Are you asking me to learn to curry favor?

709
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:54,140
Xuechen is now an Imperial Censor.

710
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,730
His status is different from before.

711
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:59,890
Xiu, you've grown up too.

712
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:03,210
You need to share more burdens for us.

713
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:04,380
Do you understand?

714
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:11,620
So, father,

715
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:14,060
you don't care if I'm happy or not,

716
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:15,650
whether I'm content or not.

717
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:19,300
Everything is for your own future.

718
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,300
- Is that so?
- What are you saying?

719
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,650
Without my future,

720
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:27,100
how could you live such a luxurious life?

721
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:30,490
You are becoming more and more unreasonable.

722
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,590
I understand my mistake, father.

723
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:39,410
I hope you won't be angry.

724
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:44,660
Alright.

725
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,210
Tomorrow is the day of engagement.

726
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:48,730
Prepare well for it.

727
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:50,690
Make sure there's no mistake.

728
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,780
Don't disgrace the Chen Family.

729
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:03,170
I've told you

730
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:04,540
to water all those flowers

731
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:06,250
to make them look lively.

732
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:26,820
It's just putting on a show.

733
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,580
This silk brocade is really good,

734
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:34,380
perfect for making a wedding dress.

735
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:36,930
I should've saved a piece for myself.

736
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:38,780
You keep it.

737
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:39,690
It's enough already.

738
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:43,450
Seems we're missing a wild goose.

739
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:46,620
It's too important to be left out.

740
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:47,730
I'll go find one now.

741
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:50,210
Lingyu, I'm marrying Miss Chen.

742
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:51,450
Don't you care at all?

743
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:52,930
Care about what?

744
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:53,930
Could it be

745
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:56,490
you really plan to marry her?

746
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:57,330
Of course not.

747
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:59,300
Then what's the worry?

748
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:02,060
It's just for show.

749
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:03,930
Do I seem like a petty person?

750
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:05,890
Rest assured.

751
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:08,170
I'll arrange your wedding properly.

752
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:10,450
So you can go and propose with great fanfare.

753
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:17,450
Today's matter

754
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:18,620
is mere a play

755
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,780
to investigate Chen Hao.

756
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:21,340
Don't take it so seriously.

757
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:22,970
When you marry me someday,

758
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:25,100
it will be a thousand times better.

759
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,140
Everything you need will be prepared.

760
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:32,020
Who said I will marry you?

761
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:35,140
We both have our own engagements now.

762
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:37,060
It's almost gone.

763
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:40,490
When everything is settled,

764
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:44,210
you should consider marrying me.

765
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:46,930
Don't be overly sentimental.

766
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:48,780
This box is full.

767
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:50,060
Sort it yourself.

768
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:01,490
I like this silk brocade.

769
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:02,520
Don't give it to others.

770
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:03,650
I'm taking it.

771
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:04,820
I've already told you

772
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:05,860
to keep it.

773
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:08,820
(So impatient!)

774
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:15,650
The hairpins for the ceremonial box

775
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:17,890
should come in pairs.

776
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:20,020
It means good things come in pairs.

777
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:22,300
Why are you getting more enthusiastic?

778
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:23,650
It's truly beautiful.
