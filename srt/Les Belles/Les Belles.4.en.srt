=Episode 4=

23
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,550
Back in Shuozhou,

24
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,680
you were the talk of the town.

25
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,950
But here in Yuezhou...

26
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,190
Even if I'm not the top beauty,

27
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,440
but I don't

28
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,480
rely on looks alone.

29
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,870
Beauty is my least important asset.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,190
What I truly rely on,

31
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:01,670
is here

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,840
and here.

33
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,310
Your hair and clothes?

34
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,830
Mind and heart.

35
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,560
Yes.

36
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,360
Mind and heart.

37
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,440
Heart,

38
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,550
I'm truly envious of Lu Yun

39
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,110
for seeing such a beautiful face
in the morning.

40
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,800
I'm truly envious of you

41
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,360
for being positive every day.

42
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,800
We're not far from the Qing Courtyard.

43
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,630
Could there

44
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,830
be any surprises?

45
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,670
Might we run into Lu Yun?

46
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,600
Is that you, Lu...

47
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,440
Lu Yun.

48
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:47,960
Miss Han?

49
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,390
Miss Luo?

50
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,520
What's this about?

51
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,960
Why are you here?

52
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,750
I...

53
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,240
I was just passing by.

54
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,230
Just passing by.

55
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,390
Passing by.

56
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,030
Miss Luo?

57
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:03,910
How come it's you?

58
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,720
Miss Liu, you're passing by too?

59
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,360
Of course.

60
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,750
You're all here.

61
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,310
Good morning.

62
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,750
Morning.

63
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,910
Why are they here on this path too?

64
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,550
Indeed.

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Miss Luo, why are you here?

66
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,230
I...

67
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,750
Madam Lu

68
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:42,270
allowed me to choose a courtyard.

69
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,000
I came to see

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,440
which courtyard is suitable.

71
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,000
Unfortunately, I got lost.

72
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,750
Getting lost and ending up here?

73
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,110
Stop pretending already.

74
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,720
Or do you fancy

75
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,110
the Xuewu Courtyard near Lu Yun's?

76
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,920
Uh...

77
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,520
Miss Liu, of course not.

78
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,720
I'm just new here

79
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,550
and unfamiliar with the estate.

80
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,360
How would I know where Lu Yun lives

81
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:16,550
or who I'd meet along the way?

82
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,440
But...

83
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,270
I know the Etiquette Hall

84
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,390
is not far from here.

85
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,880
It seems you were

86
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,550
just heading there

87
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,880
and happened to meet.

88
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,760
Yes.

89
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,160
That's true.

90
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,200
The garden is on the way
to the Etiquette Hall,

91
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,830
and Lu Yun's Qing Courtyard

92
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,440
is nearby.

93
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,950
Yes, it seems like

94
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,560
Miss Luo didn't do it intentionally.

95
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:46,670
She didn't.

96
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,670
You are right, girls.

97
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,600
But if you don't hurry,

98
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,760
you'll miss the lesson

99
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:54,200
and face Nanny's scolding.

100
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,480
- It's Nanny.
- Nanny's here.

101
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,440
- Miss Luo, we must go now.
- Let's go.

102
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,280
Hurry up.

103
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,230
Go.

104
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,760
Let's check the courtyard
next to the Qing Courtyard.

105
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,700
Sure.

106
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,640
The courtyard next to ours?

107
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,880
Miss Luo wants to be our neighbor?

108
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,670
If she stays by our courtyard,

109
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,110
we'll never have peace again.

110
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,350
That would be wonderful, sir.

111
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,550
It'll be livelier

112
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,640
if Miss Luo's there.

113
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,550
Absolutely not.

114
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,830
She mustn't choose the nearby courtyard.

115
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,160
I didn't expect

116
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,320
so many romantic thoughts in the garden.

117
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,720
Such wonderful sunlight.

118
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:43,872
Don't let it go to waste.

119
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,550
Today, let's choose the right courtyard.

120
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,320
Miss Luo.

121
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,040
Lu Yun?

122
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,350
Why are you here?

123
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,110
Guess.

124
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:58,720
(Guess again?)

125
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,390
I happened to overhear earlier

126
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,640
Miss Luo talking with others

127
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,510
about choosing a courtyard.

128
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:06,630
Indeed.

129
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,350
I just got lost with Lingxi.

130
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,880
We were discussing it

131
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,200
when you arrived.

132
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,110
It must be fate.

133
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:17,790
The empty courtyards and the garden
are far apart.

134
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,600
Miss Luo managed to get lost here.

135
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,550
What a coincidence.

136
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,315
Since we have such a connection,

137
00:06:25,335 --> 00:06:26,532
why not let me show you around?

138
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,760
(Truly a surprise.)

139
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,070
(He's so forthcoming.)

140
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,720
(Could he be interested in me?)

141
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:34,320
I'm unfamiliar with this place.

142
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,230
If you could guide me,

143
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,040
it would be wonderful.

144
00:06:39,175 --> 00:06:40,507
I was just thinking of going there

145
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,670
when you...

146
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,600
There are big comfortable courtyards here,

147
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,670
perfect for you and your sister.

148
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,760
Let's go take a look.

149
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:49,910
I think...

150
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,070
Let's go, Miss Luo.

151
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:52,657
- My Lady.
- There...

152
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,230
Miss Luo, this courtyard suits you best.

153
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:58,920
It's bright and comfortable,

154
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,642
with trees and blooming flowers.

155
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,440
In spring and summer, it's fragrant,

156
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,950
and in autumn and winter,
red leaves and snow.

157
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,280
What do you think?

158
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,950
Lu Yun, this place might not work.

159
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,320
I've been allergic to pollen since childhood.

160
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,070
Just standing here is severe enough.

161
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,365
If I were to live here,

162
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,600
I'm afraid my life is at stake.

163
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,350
No rush. There's another one.

164
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,320
This way.

165
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,480
- We...
- Come on.

166
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,070
This way.

167
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:31,950
Watch your step.

168
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,670
Nice view, right?

169
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,390
It's by a lake.

170
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,040
The clear water

171
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,640
means good fortune.

172
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,790
The courtyard aligns with the waterway.

173
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:45,000
This feng shui will ensure your wealth.

174
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,950
It's auspicious.

175
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,480
(If you marry into my family,)

176
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,830
(I can reclaim my property.)

177
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,320
(You're my source of wealth.)

178
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,390
Lu Yun,

179
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,510
this house is built by the lake.

180
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,670
There must be many leeches and insects.

181
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,440
If heavy rain falls,

182
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,920
the lake will be rising.

183
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,600
It's extremely dangerous.

184
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,760
It's not safe

185
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,320
for Hua to stay here.

186
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,040
I'll go check over there.

187
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,880
It's alright.

188
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,160
There's more over there.

189
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:13,630
Please.

190
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:14,910
I...

191
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,070
(If I keep walking with Lu Yun,)

192
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,320
(I won't get that courtyard for sure.)

193
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,510
Miss Lingxi, please.

194
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,670
Miss Luo, this way, please.

195
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:42,110
The lake is as green as jade.

196
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,670
It's truly beautiful.

197
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:45,910
Lu Yun, don't you think so?

198
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,670
The water is so clear.

199
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:00,320
Lu Yun, care to join me?

200
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,520
Let's see how long you can keep up the act.

201
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,230
This water is so clear.

202
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,640
Lu Yun, would you like to join?

203
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:26,950
Lingxi.

204
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:28,320
Butterfly.

205
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,640
Beautiful butterflies.

206
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,400
Let's catch the butterfly.

207
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,520
Catch the butterfly.

208
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,160
So beautiful.

209
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:57,110
Butterfly, where are you going?

210
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,520
Oh no, my courtyard.

211
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:01,630
Catch the butterfly.

212
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,680
It's so beautiful.

213
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,200
That's what you want.

214
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,710
I won't let you have it.

215
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:09,750
Butterfly.

216
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,230
Catching butterflies.

217
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,350
Miss Lingxi.

218
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,400
I must say,

219
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,470
Miss Luo prepared so well.

220
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,470
Good job.

221
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,720
Impressive.

222
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,580
(Xuewu Courtyard)

223
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:34,910
I've visited many courtyards,

224
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,230
but this is the best.

225
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,937
I can see Lu Yun's second floor from here.

226
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,960
I want...

227
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,840
Wait a moment.

228
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,800
Miss Luo.

229
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,840
Lu Yun.

230
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:58,750
Miss Luo,

231
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,400
your makeup is smudged.

232
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,382
Your lip color is on your cheek.

233
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,960
Here, let me wipe it for you.

234
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:09,470
Why won't it come off?

235
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,190
On the right too.

236
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,320
I...

237
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,412
It's getting even more.

238
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,280
Let me

239
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,190
wipe it again.

240
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,670
No worries. Let me wipe it.

241
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,910
Lu Yun,

242
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,030
I'm a bit tired today.

243
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,327
Perhaps some other day.

244
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,230
That won't do.

245
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:27,482
You haven't picked one yet.

246
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,520
Let me wipe it for you.

247
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:29,860
- It's fine.
- Let me help.

248
00:11:29,877 --> 00:11:31,230
- Rain check.
- Just a quick wipe.

249
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,350
There's plenty of time.

250
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,507
- No rush.
- It's alright.

251
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,860
- Finish it today.
- Gotta go.

252
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,425
- We're not done yet.
- Thank you

253
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,535
for today.

254
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:42,960
Think I'd fall for that?

255
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,660
(Xuewu Courtyard)

256
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,320
Where am I getting?

257
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:50,550
This part.

258
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,110
What about this one?

259
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:54,000
My Lady, you're back so soon.

260
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:58,950
My makeup

261
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,670
is truly smudged.

262
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,520
Lu Yun is truly considerate,

263
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:07,440
willing to give up time with me,

264
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,790
just to remind me,

265
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:12,000
so I won't lose face before others.

266
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,910
My Lady, I was gone just a moment,

267
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,550
and your makeup's ruined?

268
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,822
When you went to the Qing Courtyard,

269
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,350
your lipstick was still fine.

270
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,840
Someone must have played a trick.

271
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,960
Miss Luo, your makeup is smudged.

272
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,275
Let me wipe it for you.

273
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,350
So it seems,

274
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,670
Lu Yun smudged my lip color on purpose.

275
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:41,310
It must be so.

276
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:42,710
That's outrageous.

277
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,110
That's wonderful.

278
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:44,950
What?

279
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,590
I told you yesterday.

280
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,200
Special means

281
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,960
he likes me.

282
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:51,630
Have you ever seen

283
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,910
Lu Yun treat another girls like this?

284
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:55,790
Boys often

285
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,960
tease the girls they like.

286
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:03,280
But it feels something's off.

287
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,150
Today, he put so much effort in,

288
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:10,110
choosing a courtyard for me.

289
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,800
However,

290
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,790
he doesn't understand

291
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,200
that all I want is to stay

292
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,030
by his side

293
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:20,280
and let our love blossom.

294
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,540
(Etiquette Hall)

295
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,390
Do you all know?

296
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,520
Miss Luo truly chose the Xuewu Courtyard.

297
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,510
What?

298
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,670
I've had my eye on it for a long time.

299
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,790
Me too.

300
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,000
I've always wanted to move in.

301
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,200
It's alright.

302
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,880
No girls has ever secured it

303
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,030
over the years.

304
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,150
Luo Lingyu definitely won't move in.

305
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,590
On the banquet,

306
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,640
she didn't seem like an ordinary lady.

307
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,227
Whether she can move in Xuewu Courtyard

308
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,640
depends on Madam Lu's decision.

309
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:51,760
Do you really want to choose Xuewu Courtyard?

310
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,110
Yes, Madam.

311
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,710
Let me remind you.

312
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,320
That courtyard hasn't

313
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,150
been occupied for a long time.

314
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:00,030
It's quite rundown

315
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,150
and remote,

316
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:03,030
not as good as other courtyards.

317
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,760
Thank you for the reminder.

318
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,200
This Xuewu Courtyard,

319
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,440
compared to the one I lived in Shuozhou,

320
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,840
is much better.

321
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:12,640
I know a bit about repairs.

322
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,200
I will handle it myself.

323
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:16,910
Then do as you wish.

324
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,350
Go to the warehouse

325
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,880
and prepare more items for Miss Lingyu.

326
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,470
Thank you, Madam.

327
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:29,030
What? She's staying at Xuewu Courtyard?

328
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,390
Yes.

329
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:34,030
I knew she had deep intentions.

330
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,230
Since she's reaching out to me,

331
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,080
she must not stay.

332
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,230
We must not let her have it.

333
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:46,740
(Xuewu Courtyard)

334
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,960
My Lady, is this the place?

335
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,720
Lingxi.

336
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:53,950
Go check inside.

337
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,880
- My Lady.
- Come.

338
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,000
I barely pushed. How can it...

339
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,390
Oh my heavens.

340
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,200
Be careful.

341
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,590
Madam Lu said it's quite rundown,

342
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,710
and that's conservative.

343
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:26,550
No worries.

344
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:30,470
Even the best courtyard needs repairs.

345
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,120
Come on.

346
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:33,990
Be careful.

347
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,320
How long has this been empty?

348
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,760
These weeds, this pond...

349
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,550
It's so messy.

350
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:45,550
No problem.

351
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,030
Clean up, and it'll be livable.

352
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,720
Hurry up.

353
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:50,750
This is the place.

354
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,320
Miss Luo.

355
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,670
I heard you moved to a new home,

356
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,910
so I brought some items

357
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,400
I usually can't bear to use

358
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,840
as your housewarming gifts.

359
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,000
You're a new guest at Lu Mansion.

360
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:18,470
If you need anything,

361
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,000
just let us know.

362
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,230
Thank you, Miss Liu.

363
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:37,080
Sister, why are they bringing old furniture?

364
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:02,000
We know the Xuewu Court is simple,

365
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,760
so we all worked together

366
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,560
for your housewarming gifts.

367
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,000
Miss Luo, don't waste it.

368
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,560
It's a token of our goodwill.

369
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,830
- Indeed.
- Yes.

370
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,040
I thought Shuozhou was remote

371
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,710
and not comparable to Yuezhou.

372
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,640
Now it seems

373
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:22,110
Shuozhou isn't that remote.

374
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:25,830
Whatever were popular in Shuozhou 5 years ago

375
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,590
are still given as gifts in Yuezhou now.

376
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,430
It's...

377
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,680
Your kindness is noted.

378
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,760
Miss Liu's speech

379
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:43,160
embarrassed us all.

380
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,310
No wonder Miss Chen stopped us.

381
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:47,560
I think we should listen to Miss Chen.

382
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,240
Miss Luo,

383
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,230
we've delivered the gifts.

384
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,830
We shall take our leave now.

385
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,240
Goodbye.

386
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,600
Goodbye.

387
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,040
Don't go.

388
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:03,400
I've heard

389
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:05,710
Xuewu Courtyard is haunted.

390
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:06,950
I suggest

391
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,040
you don't stay.

392
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,560
Thank you for your kindness.

393
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:13,000
But I've always believed

394
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,430
that the righteous fears no spirits.

395
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,310
Well,

396
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,800
it's taking all the space here.

397
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:08,280
No wonder it was chilly

398
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:10,000
when we stepped in here.

399
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:13,070
Is it really haunted by ghosts?

400
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,920
Isn't the Lu Clan the largest in Yuezhou?

401
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:20,000
How could there be such an eerie place?

402
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,310
There's no such thing.

403
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,640
Besides,

404
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,640
nothing's scarier than poverty.

405
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,030
Sister,

406
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,880
I don't think

407
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,190
the poor would live here.

408
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,110
What's wrong with it?

409
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,400
It's just a minor setback.

410
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,190
Minor setback?

411
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,400
Oh my.

412
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:45,950
Don't we have

413
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,760
the grand gifts from the girls?

414
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,560
What grand gifts are these?

415
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,310
These are just trash.

416
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,000
Look.

417
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,590
There's always a way.

418
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:26,110
My sister is so skillful.

419
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:31,680
Our yard has flowers,

420
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,430
trees,

421
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,590
and elegance in every corner.

422
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,280
It's just a bit old.

423
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:39,680
Nothing to worry about.

424
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,272
As long as we're willing and diligent,

425
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,230
life will go on.

426
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,680
For now,

427
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,430
we must tidy up this courtyard

428
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,590
before we proceed with the next plan.

429
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,000
It's so dirty here,

430
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,310
but not even a broom.

431
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,280
That's good news.

432
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,710
Good news?

433
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,190
It's too late to buy one at the market now.

434
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,470
Why not borrow it from Lu Yun?

435
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,880
Wait, I need to fresh up.

436
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,000
I've been busy for quite a while,

437
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,230
and I am really exhausted.

438
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,240
Lingxi.

439
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:29,550
Got it.

440
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,420
(Qing Courtyard)

441
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,720
Sir,

442
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:46,000
Miss Luo is truly remarkable.

443
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,070
The other ladies
make things difficult for her,

444
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:51,800
but she moved into Xuewu Courtyard anyway.

445
00:21:55,950 --> 00:22:01,160
This shows her genuine feelings for you.

446
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,100
(Military Supplies for Jingyang North Army)

447
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,720
Jinchuan,

448
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:04,670
come here.

449
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,310
Why are you talking so much today?

450
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,310
What genuine feelings?

451
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,497
It's good enough
if she doesn't cause trouble.

452
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:15,030
By the way,

453
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,760
any reply from Aman?

454
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,040
Not speaking?

455
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,190
Didn't you say I talk too much?

456
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,920
Alright, then your monthly pay will be...

457
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,710
Prince Changyi said he has a lead.

458
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:32,642
He'll meet you in two days
at the usual place.

459
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,062
Your pay remains the same.

460
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:38,710
Then I should thank you.

461
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,000
You got nothing

462
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,120
to do today?

463
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:44,670
Got it.

464
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:46,950
Hang on.

465
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:51,310
Close the gate.

466
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,640
Jinchuan is playing games with me.

467
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:24,190
Jinchuan, are you done yet?

468
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,310
Lu Yun.

469
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:41,430
Miss Luo.

470
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:43,270
How can I help?

471
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,680
We moved to Xuewu Courtyard today,

472
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:47,400
and I'd like to send my regards.

473
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,360
Got it.

474
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,400
We're cleaning the yard

475
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:59,710
and need a broom.

476
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,640
May I borrow one from you?

477
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,520
Wait a moment.

478
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,400
Please take your time.

479
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:22,950
Here you go.

480
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:23,990
You're welcome.

481
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,880
Thank you.

482
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:37,910
Miss Hua,

483
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,920
please move the toys over there.

484
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,662
- Okay.
- They're in the way of my sweeping.

485
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,500
Alright.

486
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,620
(Hammer, scissors, axe, machete, broom, saw)

487
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:50,070
These are the items we need.

488
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,710
That's a lot.

489
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,880
All these need to be purchased?

490
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,710
Hammers, scissors, axes, machetes...

491
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,880
So many of them.

492
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,040
Who said to buy it?

493
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,190
We borrow.

494
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:06,430
That's inappropriate
to borrow so much at once.

495
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,430
Not all at once.

496
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,800
Don't forget

497
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,160
why we moved here.

498
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,680
We must find every way

499
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,430
to achieve our grand plan.

500
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,280
I need to meet him more often.

501
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,360
That makes sense.

502
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,860
(Qing Courtyard)

503
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,380
What now?

504
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,040
I'm here to borrow a saw.

505
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,230
It's urgent.

506
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:56,710
I'm waiting for you here.

507
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:01,230
Thank you.

508
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,260
(Qing Courtyard)

509
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,120
Lu Yun,

510
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:13,880
I want to borrow a sickle.

511
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:18,070
Lu Yun.

512
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,280
Thank you.

513
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,760
I think this cape looks nice.

514
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,680
This is quite lovely.

515
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,150
Look.

516
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,350
Apologies, Lu Yun.

517
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,520
I'm here to borrow an axe.

518
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:53,920
Thank you.

519
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:07,920
Lu Yun?

520
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,720
Lu Yun?

521
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:14,110
Lu Yun, I thought you'd nap.

522
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:16,640
This is my place.

523
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,070
Why do I act like a thief?

524
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,280
Lu Yun?

525
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,640
If you need anything,

526
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,160
just ask Jinchuan.

527
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:30,310
You misunderstood.

528
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,280
I'm here to return these.

529
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,190
That's right.

530
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,950
A good lender

531
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:40,520
deserves another.

532
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:43,110
This time I'd like to borrow

533
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,800
a big hammer.

534
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:48,950
A big hammer?

535
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:54,950
A big hammer.

536
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,150
You're welcome.

537
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,000
- I got you.
- Thank you, Lu Yun.

538
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,480
My Lady, let me.

539
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,800
Lu Yun, could you lend me something?

540
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,950
Lu Yun,

541
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,920
this time I want to borrow

542
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,190
you.

543
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,070
Stay back. Don't.

544
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:54,430
Sir,

545
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:55,790
what's wrong?

546
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,470
Did you have that nightmare again?

547
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,760
Not this time.

548
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,520
There's another nightmare?

549
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,310
That can dispel your long-time fears.

550
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,520
That's truly remarkable.

551
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:10,430
My Lady.

552
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,920
I wish it were more stable.

553
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,950
That's the firecrackers in my dream.

554
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,400
Lingxi, look.

555
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:23,000
Jinchuan, whatever you do,

556
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,950
get her out of Xuewu Courtyard now!

557
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:27,950
Sir, be careful.

558
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:29,680
Your wound hasn't healed.

559
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,230
My Lady, how's this?

560
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:40,680
Seems I must return to my old ways.

561
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,920
I'm a playmate, a confidante, a messenger...

562
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:48,350
and now I have to be a ghost?

563
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,470
It's never an easy job.

564
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,190
Oh, dear sir,

565
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:55,880
tell me,

566
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:57,430
where else can you find

567
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,190
a servant as affordable and caring as me?

568
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,900
(Xuewu Courtyard)

569
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:07,590
Miss Luo,

570
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:10,430
I'm sorry.

571
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,430
Pinchy, pinchy.

572
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,710
We've been busy all day.

573
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:29,800
Finally, it looks like a courtyard.

574
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:32,950
The lantern

575
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:34,190
looks beautiful.

576
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:36,800
Just like the ones you used to make.

577
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,830
Back when you were at the Luos in Shuozhou,

578
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,830
everything was the worst quality.

579
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:46,830
Even the lanterns had to be made by yourself.

580
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,950
You should have lived like a noble lady,

581
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,190
with everything done for you.

582
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:55,560
The hard times are behind us.

583
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:58,310
The present matters most.

584
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,760
Where's this wind from?

585
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,520
My Lady.

586
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:22,040
Is this place haunted?

587
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,520
My Lady?

588
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,400
No way.

589
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:39,520
I feel something's here.

590
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,230
Hua, don't be afraid.

591
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,600
Something's here.

592
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,110
They said it's haunted.

593
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:58,710
Could there really be a ghost?

594
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,070
A ghost.

595
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:21,230
There you are.

596
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,800
I will catch you.

597
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:34,520
Lingxi, come and catch the ghost.

598
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,927
What kind of ghost is this?

599
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,070
I'll catch you.

600
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,760
Come here.

601
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,680
Here's my chance.

602
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,800
I'll beat you. Lingxi, come on.

603
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,680
Get it.

604
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:50,680
Oh my, there's really a ghost here.

605
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,040
It's truly terrifying.

606
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:55,230
Lu Yun is alone in the courtyard.

607
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:57,950
Hope the ghost doesn't find him.

608
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,760
Lu Yun, don't be afraid.

609
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:02,190
I'll be there to protect you.

610
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,500
Did Jinchuan

611
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,640
(used the old method?)

612
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,880
(If not for swimming,
this wound would've healed.)

613
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:23,680
Lu Yun, are you alright?

614
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,070
(What did I just see?)

615
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,280
(Was he not properly dressed?)

616
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:34,800
Why are you here?

617
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:37,680
I saw a ghost in Xuewu Courtyard,

618
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,970
which was quite frightening.

619
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:40,920
I fear that ghost didn't get me,

620
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:43,070
and instead, target you.

621
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:44,760
Concern led to confusion.

622
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:46,950
So, I rushed in here.

623
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,920
Please don't blame me, sir.

624
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,680
Don't be afraid.

625
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,150
I'm here.

626
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,590
I won't let the ghost hurt you.

627
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,470
Where is it?

628
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:08,840
There's no ghost here.

629
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,190
Miss Luo must be mistaken.

630
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:17,190
Is there really no ghost?

631
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,000
I saw it a moment ago.

632
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,360
No.

633
00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:01,050
♪It's hard to see through fate♪

634
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:06,220
♪I sit alone amid the downpour at night♪

635
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,070
Sir.

636
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,190
Pardon me.

637
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:26,630
You even

638
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:30,870
have the leisure to have fish in here.

639
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,040
Like a lotus blooming from clear water.

640
00:35:34,522 --> 00:35:36,230
The beauty's natural, without embellishment.

641
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,655
(I mustn't let her see the account book.)

642
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:01,230
Your eyes are still glued, I see.

643
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:03,190
Still not satisfied?

644
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,600
Want to see more?

645
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,520
No.

646
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:14,040
Sorry for interrupting.

647
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,440
Bye.

648
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,280
So shy and innocent.

649
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:21,230
Why is she still pretending?

650
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:30,950
We barely know each other
and he's undressing?

651
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:33,150
Isn't that moving a little fast?

652
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:43,080
He has trouble sleeping, too?

653
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,360
Hammer.

654
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,070
Check.

655
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:52,800
Axe. Check.

656
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,120
Where should this go?

657
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:55,790
Put it inside.

658
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:57,360
Almost finished.

659
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:02,360
Sister, how do you and Lingxi manage?

660
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,120
I want to help too.

661
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,230
Come here.

662
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,000
Don't think I don't know your tricks.

663
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:13,390
No slacking off. Don't even think about it.

664
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,917
Have you finished today's lessons?

665
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:16,880
Almost.

666
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,600
You can skip meals,

667
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,470
but you can't skip reading.

668
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:21,470
Alright.

669
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,120
Go on.

670
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,130
♪Our love story, I'll slowly pen♪

671
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:29,680
♪In this life, I wish for your words♪

672
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,670
♪From black hair to white,
we'll brave time's trend♪

673
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:35,830
♪In this life, may our love forever blend♪

674
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:37,060
♪Let's go together♪

675
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:40,600
This place is a total wreck,

676
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:44,120
but she's managed
to make it look like it used to.

677
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,280
Anyone else would've

678
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,840
bolted at the first sight of this dump.

679
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:55,360
But your resilience is misplaced.

680
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:56,750
My Lady,

681
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,840
you turned what they sent

682
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:58,950
into treasures.

683
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:01,430
It looks quite nice.

684
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,520
Yes, it looks very nice.

685
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:10,080
Confronting her only fuels her spirit.

686
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:12,760
It's best to avoid her if possible.

687
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,870
Their morale is too high.

688
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,150
I'll have to avoid battle for now.

689
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:32,560
Astragalus, placenta, and cordyceps.

690
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,630
The previous page is fabric, this is herbs.

691
00:38:36,007 --> 00:38:37,315
These are all the usual stuff

692
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:40,190
that goes to the Northern Border and Beichu?

693
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,950
Lu Yun?

694
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,640
Miss Luo?

695
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:48,560
Sir, Miss Luo's here.

696
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,680
Please come in.

697
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:55,120
Aren't you going to stop her?

698
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,150
Should I?

699
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,400
Lu Yun.

700
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,680
My Lady.

701
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:09,390
You're reading a book.

702
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:11,600
I came uninvited this morning.

703
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:13,560
Am I disturbing you?

704
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,080
Since you're aware,

705
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,520
but I don't think you're leaving.

706
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,670
It seems

707
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:25,430
you intended to disrupt.

708
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:29,710
I'm sorry about last night.

709
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,560
So, I brought you

710
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,230
a handmade item

711
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,640
to apologize.

712
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,190
I won't accept a unique gift.

713
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,390
Please, take it back.

714
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:49,150
(He's still embarrassed about last night.)

715
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:52,710
How do you know it's unique?

716
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,760
If it's not unique,

717
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,040
I won't accept it, either.

718
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,910
This fan is crafted with care and skill,

719
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,000
taking half a day to make one.

720
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:06,630
How could I have such luck

721
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:08,800
to have Miss Luo work so hard for me?

722
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:13,760
Please don't ever get me any more gifts.

723
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,430
You just didn't want me to overdo it.

724
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:20,430
That's so thoughtful.

725
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,800
Your consideration for me is remarkable.

726
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:26,280
How could I possibly feel tired?

727
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:00,360
That's not what I meant.

728
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,040
I appreciate your thoughtfulness.

729
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:04,670
I specially

730
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:07,870
made this fan with silk gauze.

731
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:09,360
It's the coolest.

732
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:12,600
But it's still a bit chilly these days.

733
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:14,842
Use it after summer starts.

734
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:20,750
Good day.

735
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:27,320
Miss Luo, take care.

736
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:40,165
Didn't you say
you wouldn't accept unique gifts?

737
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,630
It's just some tricks.

738
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,320
She excels at pretending.

739
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:48,470
While saying you won't accept it,

740
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,120
you happily enjoy it.

741
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,430
If Miss Luo finds out,

742
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:53,840
even I will be

743
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,470
completely disgraced.

744
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,670
Sir, look,

745
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,560
since you've accepted her gift,

746
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,910
even if you don't like it,

747
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:09,000
you should at least respond.

748
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,150
Otherwise, it's quite rude.

749
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,630
Take something from my room
and send it over.

750
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,080
That's more like it.

751
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:16,990
Wait.

752
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,427
Something not valuable.

753
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:20,990
Understood.

754
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:29,000
A valuable gift might make her overthink.

755
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,040
If the enemy doesn't move, I won't.

756
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:34,630
This way, nothing should go wrong.

757
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:41,120
Lu Yun, I'm here to give you a fan.

758
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:42,560
What fan?

759
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,640
I don't want it.

760
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,760
- Lu Yun...
- Hua.

761
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:48,510
Sister,

762
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,280
did you give him the folding fan?

763
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,150
Of course, I did.

764
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:54,950
That folding fan

765
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:57,430
must be your love token with Brother Yun.

766
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,320
But others' tokens of love

767
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,150
are either gold or jade.

768
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:08,600
They are all valuable treasures.

769
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,230
You only gave him a fan,

770
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:14,080
isn't that too shabby?

771
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,430
Lu Yun has seen

772
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,360
a lot of treasures.

773
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:20,230
For someone like him,

774
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:23,600
genuine intentions are rare.

775
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:25,270
My Lady,

776
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:26,950
but I noticed that Lu Yun

777
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,630
isn't very fond of that fan.

778
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,150
Did we give the wrong gift?

779
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,560
Last night, he used sincerity.

780
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:37,360
Today, it's the second move:

781
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:38,710
Hard to get.

782
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,080
Hard to get?

783
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,320
What does it mean?

784
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:46,560
Miss Luo.

785
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,280
Here he is.

786
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:55,360
Please come in.

787
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:00,420
(Xuewu Courtyard)

788
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:12,100
Miss Luo,

789
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,520
he's been quite busy lately.

790
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:16,080
And he's not good with words.

791
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:17,840
But he means no offense to you.

792
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:19,800
He's really interested.

793
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:25,950
Isn't this painting of you?

794
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,600
Why do I have a bad feeling?

795
00:44:45,077 --> 00:44:47,067
It must be because
I didn't sleep well last night.
