=Episode 12=

23
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:40,410
To be honest,

24
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,330
I was not in my room last night.

25
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:45,860
Instead, I was with Miss Luo,

26
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,410
spending a pleasant night.

27
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:57,180
Miss Luo, is this true?

28
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,180
(We're in the same boat.)

29
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:03,690
(If the boat capsizes,)

30
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,140
(we'll both suffer.)

31
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,050
(Fine. You win.)

32
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:10,650
Indeed.

33
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,060
But Lu Yun and I

34
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,540
are planning to present a gift to you.

35
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,980
By the way,

36
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,770
he shared many stories
about your childhood together.

37
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:26,850
One by one,

38
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,620
he remembers them all.

39
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,980
He said he always admired
your noble demeanor,

40
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,620
and youthful spirit.

41
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,540
(When did I ever flatter him like that?)

42
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,050
Seriously?

43
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,100
Yes.

44
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,060
So, Xuechen, what did you say?

45
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,460
Did you mention I was good at archery

46
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,360
and never missed every time I shot?

47
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,690
About how I learned it on my own,

48
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,340
and battled wits with the Grand Tutor,

49
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,260
did you speak of that?

50
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,290
Yes, I did.

51
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,900
Xuechen, when did you start admiring me?

52
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,540
It's...

53
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,850
It's when I was as light as a swallow,

54
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,210
with a heart of gold,

55
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,560
so I climbed up the tree,

56
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,490
to save the wounded bird for you.

57
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:15,100
You guessed right.

58
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,130
That moment stayed with me forever.

59
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:18,340
So...

60
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,100
it's since then you decided

61
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,340
to follow in my footsteps,

62
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,060
set lofty goals,

63
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,460
and stand
shoulder to shoulder with me one day.

64
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,340
Indeed.

65
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:32,980
You praise me too highly.

66
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:35,370
I'm not as great as you say.

67
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:39,930
Your Highness, you are far better than that.

68
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,930
It was all for today's banquet.

69
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,570
It seems Brother Xuechen

70
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:48,730
truly cares deeply for Your Highness.

71
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,420
Miss Luo is more attentive than I am.

72
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,130
You left in a hurry last night,

73
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,290
and forgot your hairpin.

74
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,540
Here. I brought it with me.

75
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,620
I threw the old one,

76
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,770
and bought a new one.

77
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,860
Thank you, Young Master Yun.

78
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,050
No need for thanks.

79
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,740
Alright, alright.

80
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:25,930
Since the banquet is ready,

81
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,210
let's start it.

82
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,650
You shouldn't just stand here.

83
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,010
Yes.

84
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,860
Today we're hosting a banquet
for His Highness.

85
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,330
Everyone, enjoy the food and drinks.

86
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,500
Come on.

87
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,490
Please, everyone, eat and drink well.

88
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:56,800
Why is Mr. Lu sitting next to

89
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,210
Prince Hengyang?

90
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:07,410
Come over here.

91
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,540
Mr. Lu, you're a branch member
of the Lu Family.

92
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,690
You sat right beside Prince Hengyang.

93
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:22,740
It is disrespectful.

94
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,580
That's why I called you over.

95
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,620
Mr. Zhou, this game seems intriguing.

96
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,780
Let's go check it out.

97
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,820
We'll discuss the game later.

98
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,900
- While grading assignments...
- Mr. Zhou, let's go.

99
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,260
I noticed you didn't submit yours.

100
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:41,020
Studying requires consistency,

101
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,260
not a sporadic approach.

102
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:43,370
Though you're avoiding,

103
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:44,740
you still need to submit them.

104
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,690
Since you have the chance
at Lu Family School...

105
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:48,050
- You...
- Mr. Zhou.

106
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:53,170
Prince Changyi.

107
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,210
Greetings, Your Highness.

108
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,370
I'm sorry.

109
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,220
I didn't tell you,

110
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,370
because I feared
you'd only be formal with me,

111
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,540
and wouldn't interact with me freely.

112
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:11,930
Your Highness, I...

113
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:14,900
Your Highness,

114
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,700
Lingxi said Miss Luo needs me.

115
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:18,900
I must leave.

116
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,420
(Chuiwan)

117
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,260
(Mushe)

118
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,340
(Touhu)

119
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:38,970
Touhu.

120
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,140
Let's go play Touhu.

121
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,090
Alright.

122
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:42,130
Over here.

123
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:43,770
Let's have some tea.

124
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,540
Let's join them for some fun.

125
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,210
It's just Touhu.

126
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,460
Who wants to play that?

127
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,410
You can go by yourself.

128
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,060
Xuechen.

129
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:17,410
Your Highness.

130
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:21,700
The pouches for channels are running out.

131
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:24,140
But you haven't started any game.

132
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,450
Are you feeling unwell?

133
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:28,700
No, Your Highness.

134
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,490
I'm about to toss the coin.

135
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,370
Young Master Yun drew the lot for...

136
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,820
(Touhu)

137
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,490
An archery contest.

138
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,930
(It really is what I fear the most.)

139
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,650
I remember

140
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,610
you beat me in archery
a few times 10 years ago.

141
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,370
Why don't we have another contest today?

142
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,300
Your Highness, over the years,

143
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,580
I've forgotten many of my old skills.

144
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,650
How could I compare to you now?

145
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,250
Man up. You shouldn't lack morale.

146
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,330
Today is my welcome banquet.

147
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,650
You wouldn't spoil the mood, right?

148
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,540
Your Highness, you're right.

149
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,330
I would never spoil the mood.

150
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,620
(Is he crazy?)

151
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:56,420
But I want Miss Luo to join me

152
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,060
to compete with you.

153
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:02,210
(You're truly a madman.)

154
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:11,740
Your Highness, it is unfortunate

155
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,740
that I've never learned archery

156
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,810
and may dampen your enthusiasm.

157
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:17,620
Perhaps...

158
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,890
you can choose others for His Highness.

159
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,250
- Then we shall
- You're not skilled in archery.

160
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:25,650
That is perfect.

161
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:26,890
I will teach you.

162
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:34,940
Your Highness,

163
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:36,620
you may know

164
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,300
I'm not really interested in archery,

165
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:43,010
but with a fair lady by my side,

166
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:44,740
it might be more entertaining.

167
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:47,210
I would be glad to compete with you.

168
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,270
If you want the banquet to end smoothly,

169
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,740
help me through this challenge.

170
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,050
Are you threatening me?

171
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,300
No way.

172
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,420
Miss Luo, if you don't like it,

173
00:09:58,370 --> 00:09:59,450
don't force yourself.

174
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:04,100
Your Highness, I've always wanted
to learn archery.

175
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,900
If someone would teach me,

176
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,210
I wouldn't mind learning.

177
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,010
Miss Luo, if you want to learn,

178
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,550
I can teach you as well.

179
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,740
- Your Highness.
- Thank you.

180
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:14,810
Alright, then let's move...

181
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,330
Thank you for your kindness.

182
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:19,980
I truly never learned archery,

183
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:22,060
but today is your day.

184
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:24,860
If I hold you back,

185
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,860
I would feel uneasy.

186
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,210
Moreover,

187
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:32,620
Miss Luo is a relative of the Lu Clan.

188
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,530
As an outsider, Your Highness,

189
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:35,940
it's inappropriate to do so.

190
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:38,770
Let me handle the teaching.

191
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,650
Your Highness, after you.

192
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:00,060
Prince Hengyang is going to shoot.

193
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,380
Your Highness.

194
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:17,650
Your ability to cause me trouble
has improved.

195
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:19,460
I said I can't shoot arrows.

196
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,300
It doesn't matter.

197
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,860
I'll handle the aim.

198
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,770
Just support my right elbow.

199
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:44,890
What a precise shot.

200
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,540
Didn't expect him to be so skilled.

201
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,420
Indeed.

202
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,650
It's your turn.

203
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:55,860
Yes.

204
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,140
Miss Luo.

205
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:11,980
You think by helping you shoot arrows,

206
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,180
Prince Hengyang's doubts will vanish?

207
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,180
The human heart is like paper,

208
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,500
once stained with ink,

209
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,690
it can't be erased.

210
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:38,300
Good for you.
You've become so proactive.

211
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,810
A perfect match.

212
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,540
They're a perfect match.

213
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,010
They're about to shoot arrows together.

214
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,100
He must be fond of her.

215
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,810
I've never seen Young Master Yun

216
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,300
treat a lady this way before.

217
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:50,890
Does he actually like

218
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:53,740
people who defy societal norms?

219
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,620
Exactly.

220
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,010
Lingyu and Young Master Yun?

221
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,860
What's going on?

222
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,710
Xuechen is about to shoot.

223
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,980
Oh no.

224
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,690
Doubts will always arise,

225
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:11,740
but whether I'm injured or not,

226
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,100
he can't really tell.

227
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:14,740
Without solid proof,

228
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,380
he can't do anything to me.

229
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,020
Actually, if I turn this into proof,

230
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,620
and claim I've been threatened,

231
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,450
it might not be impossible.

232
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:24,940
You wouldn't.

233
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,300
Shoot.

234
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,170
An empty arrow?

235
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,010
You...

236
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,010
Why shoot upwards?

237
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,100
- What's their intention?
- Why?

238
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,810
Xuechen, it's really you.

239
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:46,450
It's a turtle dove.

240
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:47,540
Not an empty arrow.

241
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,380
Miss Luo can even shoot arrows,

242
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,130
truly talented and versatile.

243
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,300
Miss Luo surely wins this round.

244
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,740
It was Young Master Yun who aimed true.

245
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,060
That's why it hit perfectly.

246
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,130
Not Miss Luo's credit.

247
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,050
What do you know?

248
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:01,890
Right back to you.

249
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,770
Didn't you say you couldn't shoot?

250
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:07,770
And you believed me?

251
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:38,770
That was...

252
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:41,060
That was just an accident.

253
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,500
I've fulfilled my promise to you.

254
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:45,770
Don't bother me again.

255
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,260
Your Highness,

256
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:57,690
I have other preparations tonight.

257
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:58,810
I shall take my leave.

258
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,740
Your Highness,

259
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,500
the loser picks up the arrows.

260
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:13,450
Does our old rule still count?

261
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,620
Lu Yun, His Highness is noble.

262
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:16,570
How can he do that?

263
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,130
If it's the rule,

264
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:20,650
it naturally counts.

265
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:22,820
Let it go this time.

266
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,500
Your Highness,
could you help me put it away?

267
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,300
Your Highness, shall we test him again?

268
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,140
No need.

269
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:44,460
The way he shoots is just like before,

270
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,300
without any injury.

271
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,690
Even if last night's person wasn't him,

272
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:50,770
it must be related to him.

273
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:53,740
Keep someone watching him.

274
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:55,620
Observe him secretly.

275
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:01,130
My Lady, something's wrong!

276
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:04,820
My Lady.

277
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:07,210
The rain stopped long ago.

278
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,250
Why are the fireworks still wet?

279
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:11,780
Move quickly.

280
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,450
Hurry, clean up. It's getting dark.

281
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:17,980
What about tonight's performance?

282
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:22,810
That game was really fun.

283
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:25,570
We can enjoy ourselves well.

284
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:27,540
You sure know how to flatter.

285
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,130
- I...
- These are fireworks.

286
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,860
You want to set off fireworks tonight.

287
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,380
But these fireworks are already soaked.

288
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,690
They can't be used at all.

289
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,860
Someone must dislike Miss Luo

290
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,330
using these shabby things to fool us.

291
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,660
This is an act of justice.

292
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,540
Though they got wet, it's not a big deal.

293
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:45,570
Miss Jiang, you say so.

294
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:46,980
Could it be you who got them wet?

295
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,050
Miss Han, being from a merchant family,

296
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,540
you're adept at blaming others.

297
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:51,530
You...

298
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,380
Lingyu,

299
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:54,940
what's going on here?

300
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,100
The feast is about to start soon.

301
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:58,540
What should we do now?

302
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,300
But it's not raining.

303
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,130
How did it get wet?

304
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,860
No worries. Without fireworks,

305
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,290
there are other performances.

306
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,260
You'll have an enjoyable night.

307
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:17,980
Ladies, you can have a rest over there.

308
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,900
My Lady, what should we do now?

309
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,930
Wet fireworks can't be dried under the sun.

310
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,050
Let's find someone to remove them first.

311
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,090
Alright.

312
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:44,940
It's a pity, My Lady.

313
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,210
You spent all day decorating.

314
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:48,980
You two, come over.

315
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:50,330
Move this away.

316
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,420
- Yes.
- Yes.

317
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,420
Tell me the truth.

318
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,810
Are you involved in the fireworks matter?

319
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,020
Rest assured.

320
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:09,090
Without the fireworks,

321
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:10,740
Luo Lingyu's banquet will be mediocre.

322
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,290
She won't be a threat to you.

323
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,930
Who allowed you to do this?

324
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,140
I despise underhanded tricks.

325
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,690
You've been with me for so long.

326
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:20,570
Do you still not know the rules?

327
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,140
I only did it for you, My Lady.

328
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:26,290
You all claim the same thing.

329
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:28,900
But did anyone ask if I wanted it?

330
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,210
Is that what I desired?

331
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,930
My Lady, I'm sorry.

332
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:43,900
Miss Chen, if you don't like fireworks,

333
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,410
you can tell me directly.

334
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,780
I can change the performance.

335
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,570
The fireworks were my doing.

336
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,620
I apologize.

337
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:54,570
If you want to report me,

338
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:55,740
I won't argue any further.

339
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,730
It's not related to her. It's me.

340
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:58,570
Silence.

341
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,210
Such a deep sisterly bond.

342
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:04,690
What do you mean by this?

343
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,450
You pretend every day
with Brother Xuechen.

344
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:09,450
Do you think everyone

345
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,570
acts as pretentiously as you?

346
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,260
Even if I'm just acting,

347
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,100
I wouldn't mean harm.

348
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,100
Nor would I act harmfully.

349
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:20,570
Today's incident wasn't your doing.

350
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,260
Yet you're the one who benefits.

351
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,260
I said you could tell everyone about it,

352
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,250
including Brother Xuechen.

353
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,090
It's already done.

354
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:30,970
Even if I reported it,

355
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,210
those fireworks won't work.

356
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,050
It won't solve my problems.

357
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:36,980
I won't do useless things.

358
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:39,810
Why pretend to be so generous?

359
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:46,050
You always cling to Brother Xuechen

360
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,690
only for the Lu Family's power.

361
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:50,530
You want him to fall for you.

362
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,060
This is a perfect chance

363
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,780
to show weakness and act pitifully.

364
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:55,900
Will you let it pass?

365
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,930
I approached Young Master Yun before,

366
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,100
only because he is Lu Yun,

367
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,690
not because he's from Lu Clan.

368
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,500
Today, I am sparing you,

369
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,020
not out of generosity.

370
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,170
It's just that

371
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:10,210
I think you're not as glamorous
as you seem.

372
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,130
How can you speak so boldly?

373
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:13,210
That's just who I am.

374
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:14,660
I say what I want,

375
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,620
and do as I please.

376
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,810
Good or bad, it's my true heart.

377
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,740
I'm not ashamed to be honest.

378
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:25,130
But the etiquette teaches women...

379
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:26,570
If you believe in the etiquette,

380
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:27,980
I won't interfere.

381
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,810
But let's set it aside.

382
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:32,740
What is truly in your heart?

383
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,690
If one loses their true self,

384
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:37,500
the etiquette will become shackles.

385
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:45,930
My Lady.

386
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:00,330
My Lady, I've removed all the fireworks.

387
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:02,100
Should I find some new ones?

388
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,980
Finding so many fireworks is difficult,

389
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,980
let alone setting them up again.

390
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,410
It takes a lot of time.

391
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:08,980
It's just such a pity.

392
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,330
The stage is all set.

393
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,290
I thought we'd see
"blazing trees and flowers".

394
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,530
"Blazing trees and flowers"...

395
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:17,900
You're right.

396
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,330
It's not just fireworks

397
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:20,690
that can create such an effect.

398
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:26,170
Since the fireworks setup is ruined,

399
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:29,050
let's simplify things.

400
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:31,290
In the north,

401
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:34,050
there's a dance
that makes flames seem alive.

402
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:36,210
But the oil needed...

403
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,530
Zhongshan might not have it.

404
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:42,170
Indeed, we're in the mountains.

405
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:43,810
Where can we find oil?

406
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:46,100
Lingyu, there is some.

407
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,740
But no long swords.

408
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:50,960
That can be arranged too.

409
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:52,410
What about dancers?

410
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,810
Is ten enough?

411
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:55,330
In this desolate wilderness,

412
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,740
where are you going to find those?

413
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,140
Don't forget

414
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:02,210
I am the princess.

415
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,330
Thank you, Tang.

416
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:07,330
Don't worry, Lingyu.

417
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,740
I'll bring everything for you.

418
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,660
I'll go prepare now.

419
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,660
- Okay.
- Let's go.

420
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:22,330
My Lady, the feast is about to start.

421
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:24,740
Is it still time to arrange it?

422
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:27,290
In any case,

423
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,570
we must prepare the performance by tonight.

424
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,140
But this venue is so large.

425
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,260
What we have isn't enough.

426
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,810
Lingxi, go find Yangling.

427
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:40,170
Ask her to help me.

428
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,530
Yes, My Lady, I'm on it.

429
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:53,100
Place those here.

430
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,540
Tang.

431
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:01,610
Lingyu, the oil is here.

432
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:02,530
Time is tight.

433
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,060
This is all I could bring.

434
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,020
See if this is enough.

435
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,930
If not, I can get more.

436
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,020
It suffices.

437
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,410
No need for more.

438
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:11,900
Thank you, everyone.

439
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,020
Please place these over there.

440
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:15,450
Understood.

441
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:22,450
Leave it to me.

442
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:25,450
My Lady, I'm moving it in now.

443
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:26,980
Take it slow.

444
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:27,930
Don't worry.

445
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:29,810
In this way,

446
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,530
we can prepare everything before dusk.

447
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,330
Thanks, Tang.

448
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,570
Glad to help you.

449
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,180
There are many games over there.

450
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,260
Alright, let's go over.

451
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,380
Let's go.

452
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,980
How is he Prince Changyi?

453
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:50,980
When I taught him how to grow chives,

454
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,100
I even scolded him.

455
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:03,050
But judging from his behavior,

456
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,740
he didn't seem to recognize me
as Zhou Yangling.

457
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:07,910
He won't recognize me.

458
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,690
He definitely won't.

459
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,380
Zhou...

460
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,740
Is Your Highness okay?

461
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:20,020
(His expression...)

462
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:22,290
(He must be upset I lied earlier.)

463
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,660
(Why isn't he speaking?)

464
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:26,900
(Is he going to confront me?)

465
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,740
- Sorry.
- Your Highness.

466
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:34,170
I'm truly sorry.

467
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:37,930
No matter the reason,

468
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,130
I shouldn't have deceived you

469
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:41,530
about being Prince Changyi.

470
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,570
Do you mind it?

471
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,260
I don't mind at all.

472
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,140
Your Highness, you're noble.

473
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:52,260
You must have your reasons.

474
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,020
Zibo.

475
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,100
Your Highness,

476
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:58,210
I previously lectured you as a teacher.

477
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,020
Please don't take offense.

478
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:02,930
Why are you so distant?

479
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,290
I respect you because I like farming.

480
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:09,930
When I first attended your class,

481
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:12,570
you said to live up to
people's expectations.

482
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,260
That's why I know
we share the same spirit.

483
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:19,170
But I worry that by revealing my status,

484
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:21,290
we will become as distant as today.

485
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,250
I pride myself on caring for the people,

486
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:25,940
but before meeting you,

487
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,660
I didn't know about the grains,

488
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,980
nor the hardships of the people.

489
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:32,100
It was you who taught me
to take on my duties.

490
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:34,140
With such a disposition,

491
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,660
even without me,

492
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,060
someone will surely teach you

493
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,570
to identify grains and wheat.

494
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:39,570
Mr. Zhou,

495
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:43,410
can we interact as freely as before?

496
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:46,530
Is that okay?

497
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:53,980
I remember when we first met,

498
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:56,050
weren't you looking for someone?

499
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:59,140
Now that I know your identity,

500
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,810
I'm quite curious

501
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:03,930
about who it might be

502
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,930
that you went to find yourself.

503
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:11,980
It was a woman.

504
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,930
I valued her father.

505
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:16,140
So I thought of marrying her.

506
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:17,330
But I forgot

507
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,380
we hadn't even met.

508
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,860
I never did find her.

509
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:23,930
Now I'm looking for her,

510
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,410
just to know that she is well.

511
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,780
Rest assured then.

512
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,020
She's quite well.

513
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:33,620
What did you say?

514
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,140
I mean...

515
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:42,050
Your Highness, just call me Zibo.

516
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:45,660
After all, I only taught you to grow chives.

517
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,380
Not much else.

518
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,980
Alright, Zibo.

519
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:57,140
You just said you want to help Miss Luo.

520
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,300
Yes.

521
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:01,140
Is there anything I can assist with?

522
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:03,140
No need, Your Highness.

523
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:05,450
I'm just measuring the site for her.

524
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:06,780
It's for the rehearsal.

525
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:09,170
I can handle this alone.

526
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:10,900
As for you, Your Highness,

527
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,330
go enjoy the banquet.

528
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:16,780
It's okay. Let me help.

529
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:18,780
Two people make it easier.

530
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:21,740
How about you teach me to measure?

531
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:24,050
Alright.

532
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,210
I have a step length

533
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:30,450
of 18 inches.

534
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:34,380
Three steps would be 54 inches.

535
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,980
Your Highness, walk towards me.

536
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:43,530
One step. Two steps.

537
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:47,020
Two and a half steps.

538
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:49,810
Each step is 21 inches.

539
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,260
Your Highness.

540
00:27:57,250 --> 00:28:00,570
I think we should check the performance site.

541
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,940
(Zhongshan Villa)

542
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:13,330
Xuechen,

543
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:14,900
are you alright?

544
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:19,500
My brother was troubling you
at Archery Range.

545
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:20,810
How are you now?

546
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:22,050
Don't worry.

547
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:24,620
I just overexerted while shooting arrows,

548
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,780
and pulled on the wound.

549
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,370
But I managed to cover it up

550
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:30,380
before Prince Hengyang.

551
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:32,970
That's good to hear.

552
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:34,780
Have some tea.

553
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,420
Let me.

554
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,930
It seems a bit dirty here.

555
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:53,020
She is wiping
Mr. Zhou's face with a handkerchief?

556
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,290
(Handkerchief?)

557
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:05,500
Yangling, you've worked hard today.

558
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,980
Once Tang brings the items,
everything will be ready.

559
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:11,060
But is today's performance really okay?

560
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,100
I'm also wondering.

561
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,330
You haven't practiced this skill
for many years.

562
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:15,740
You must be rusty.

563
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,300
If you get injured,

564
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,530
it will be a big problem.

565
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,570
The banquet is in its final stage.

566
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,210
I will ensure I perform flawlessly.

567
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,260
Lingyu,

568
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,660
you must be very careful.

569
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:28,660
Don't worry.

570
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,530
I wouldn't let myself get hurt.

571
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,380
Tang.

572
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,170
Lingyu, the swords are here.

573
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:40,620
Take a look. Are these two fine?

574
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:42,980
I've had them oiled for you.

575
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,140
Such exquisite swords

576
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,960
are not just for shows,

577
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,690
and are even worthy of
collections at home.

578
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:54,570
Lingyu, your skills

579
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,020
are rarely seen.

580
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:57,400
I haven't seen it before.

581
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,410
You must impress me.

582
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:03,050
Lingxi.

583
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,980
Take them to find a good spot.

584
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,210
I'll join you shortly.

585
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,780
Yes, My Lady.

586
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:08,810
This way, please.

587
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,330
Be very careful.

588
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:26,380
You said men aren't worthy
of your handkerchief.

589
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,210
Why are you here again?

590
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,660
You really are persistent.

591
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:33,980
Or is Zhou Zibo actually a woman?

592
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:38,450
This...

593
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,290
What are you saying?

594
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,810
How can you claim
that Mr. Zhou is a woman

595
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,780
just because he has a fair face?

596
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,020
What a coincidence!

597
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:47,930
The same surname,

598
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:49,290
the same origin,

599
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,780
even arriving in Yuezhou at the same time.

600
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:53,530
I never expected

601
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,140
the daughter of Master Zhou,

602
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:56,330
Prince Changyi's...

603
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:57,410
How did you know?

604
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:59,860
I had doubts about Ms. Zhou's identity,

605
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:01,690
and couldn't understand

606
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:03,570
why you two were so close,

607
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,180
until I saw you with her just now

608
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,410
like close girlfriends.

609
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:08,780
That's how I found out.

610
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:11,330
Young Master Yun, what is this habit

611
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:13,100
of eavesdropping?

612
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:17,930
So, you intend to reveal this

613
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,380
to Prince Changyi, right?

614
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,020
Why should I tell him?

615
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,290
Choosing to be a man or lady

616
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:26,900
is her own decision.

617
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:28,800
First, I have no right to interfere.

618
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,210
Second, I lack the interest.

619
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,900
Then, I thank you on Yangling's behalf.

620
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:39,410
Is that all?

621
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:42,050
I'll have Yangling thank you personally.

622
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:47,810
I just wanted to talk to you.

623
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,660
(What do you want to talk about?)

624
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:56,260
I said everything I needed last night.

625
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:58,740
I also did what I promised today.

626
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,450
Let's go our separate ways.

627
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:03,690
Please keep this in mind.

628
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:15,620
(It seems she truly wants to
cut ties with me.)

629
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,900
Lingyu has prepared so carefully.

630
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:24,780
It seems she holds my brother
in her heart.

631
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:29,020
Go see how Lingyu is doing.

632
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:31,130
Is there anything else she needs?

633
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:31,970
Yes.

634
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:42,780
What did you say?

635
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:46,290
Miss Luo together with Lu Yun

636
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:50,500
prepared the welcome banquet yesterday.

637
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:54,260
These two are truly a perfect match.

638
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:56,380
Go check on Miss Luo as well.

639
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:58,510
Don't let my future sister-in-law get tired.

640
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,020
Understood.

641
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:03,860
Young Master Xian.

642
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:07,660
You...

643
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:08,980
- Me?
- You...

644
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,620
- Me?
- You, you, you...

645
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,540
Me?

646
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:12,810
Don't speak nonsense.

647
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:24,620
(Zhongshan Villa)

648
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,040
Xuechen.

649
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,740
I was busy helping Mr. Zhou
measure the site.

650
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,980
Do you know what Miss Luo prepared?

651
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,260
She didn't tell me either.

652
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:54,690
Someone is coming.

653
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:55,900
Look over there.

654
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,420
This is so breathtaking.

655
00:34:57,650 --> 00:34:59,330
Such graceful dance movements.

656
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:44,940
(This is Sword Dance.)

657
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:46,700
(No.)

658
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,250
(Not just Sword Dance.)

659
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:02,970
In Fiery Dance, heavenly blessings descend.

660
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,940
Firelight brings good fortune.

661
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:19,570
First, may our country last forever,

662
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,490
and the world live in peace.

663
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:29,650
Second, may the weather be good,

664
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:31,460
and resources be abundant.

665
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:40,380
Third, with loyal souls as armor,

666
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,020
tough bones as spears,

667
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,780
we'll fight till death.

668
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,620
Long live our country!

669
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,570
Long live our country!

670
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,530
Long live our country!

671
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:53,330
Long live our country!
Long live our country!

672
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,420
What is that?

673
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,180
It can make the sword ignite.

674
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:00,140
Miss Luo applied oil to the swords.

675
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,420
The swords catch fire when struck.

676
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,650
This skill originates
from the Northern Border.

677
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:06,970
It's rare in Yuezhou.

681
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:22,810
(But she chose the Fiery Dance.)

682
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:26,250
(Only she understands my true thoughts.)

683
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,050
(Without fireworks,)

684
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:30,330
(she devised this Fiery Dance.)

685
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:32,970
(She always turns nothing)

686
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,390
(into something from scratch,)

687
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:36,810
(finding ways to turn the tables.)

688
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,250
(If it's her,)

689
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:41,290
(nothing seems impossible.)

690
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,140

691
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:52,380
(You're presenting)

692

(Did you please Prince Hengyang this much)

694
00:37:58,170 --> 00:37:59,860

695
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:04,420
