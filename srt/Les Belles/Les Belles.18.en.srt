=Episode 18=

23
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:39,980
Your Highness.

24
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:41,330
No need. Let Miss Luo...

25
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,290
Your Highness.

26
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,500
Sit.

27
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:49,210
Miss Luo.

28
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:52,810
Have a seat.

29
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:54,940
Thank you.

30
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,730
I wonder what brings you here today,

31
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:04,450
Your Highness?

32
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,220
Let me serve you some tea.

33
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:16,700
Miss Luo.

34
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:17,980
Let me do it.

35
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,380
Lu Yun is just blind.

36
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:27,530
It's not like he's lost his limbs.

37
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,730
He doesn't need someone
to serve him tea.

38
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,220
Then, Miss Luo, don't trouble yourself.

39
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:48,810
I'll do it myself.

40
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,140
Well...

41
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,500
If it's spilled,

42
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,950
it would be even more troublesome.

43
00:02:58,770 --> 00:02:59,610
Miss Luo,

44
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:00,850
let me do it.

45
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,700
Your Highness,

46
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,100
why not let her handle...

47
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,130
Your... Highness...

48
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,250
Miss Luo, I'll take care of it.

49
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:19,980
Thank you.

50
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:21,940
Alright.

51
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:23,330
I truly feel better.

52
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:24,820
I really...

53
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,050
thank you for visiting me today.

54
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,780
Who said I'm here to see you?

55
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,500
I'm here to invite Miss Luo out.

56
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,410
Our wedding day is near.

57
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,940
So much still needs to be done.

58
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:42,770
Xuechen,

59
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,060
on my grand wedding day,

60
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,900
will you come and give your blessings?

61
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:52,610
Actually, I...

62
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:53,730
Your Highness,

63
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:55,650
there's still a month until the wedding.

64
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:56,700
No need to rush today.

65
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,570
Perhaps things might change.

66
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,180
Is that so?

67
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:04,770
Your Highness,

68
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,230
I've been dealing with many things.

69
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,180
It's been really tiring.

70
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,730
Can we postpone the wedding
to another day?

71
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,260
Alright.

72
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,530
I have many days ahead with you

73
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,290
in the future.

74
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,580
No need to rush it.

75
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,410
I'll return tomorrow.

76
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,140
Thank you, Your Highness.

77
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,820
Xuechen, your wound

78
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:27,510
can be delayed for a while,

79
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,530
but not forever.

80
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,530
Miss Luo, we'll meet tomorrow.

81
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:35,850
Farewell, Your Highness.

82
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,370
Farewell, Your Highness.

83
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,180
(Qing Courtyard)

84
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:58,260
O you, with the blue girdle-gems,

85
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,410
Oh, how my heart longs.

86
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,370
- Although...
Isn't it "Oh, how I yearn"?

87
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:07,660
Can you see it?

88
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,460
I can't see.

89
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,900
I read "The Book of Songs" sometimes.

90
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,240
That song is my favorite.

91
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,700
I remember every line of it.

92
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,660
You've read it.
Why should I read it out?

93
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:21,170
Seeing and hearing are different.
Continue.

94
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,930
Young Master, Miss Chen is here.

95
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:26,730
Miss Luo.

96
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:31,050
I'll take my leave.

97
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,410
I heard you injured your eyes,

98
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,020
so I came to see you.

99
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,660
The injury isn't severe.

100
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,530
It'll heal in a few days.

101
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,240
Thank you for your concern.

102
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,580
That's good.

103
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,580
Brother Xuechen,

104
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,820
I actually came today

105
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,780
to talk to you.

106
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,340
Just speak your mind.

107
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,260
I just wanted to ask,

108
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,660
did you get gravely injured

109
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,490
because you upset someone?

110
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,260
What do you mean, Miss Chen?

111
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,140
It's nothing.

112
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,370
Since your eye injury isn't healed,

113
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:16,900
I won't disturb you further.

114
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:18,780
I'll take my leave.

115
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,700
Let me escort Miss Chen out.

116
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,170
"O you, with the blue girdle-gems,

117
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,220
Oh, how my heart longs."

118
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,260
Congrats
on winning the Flower Goddess title.

119
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:06,220
Thank you. Your Qipan Dance
was impressive too.

120
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,850
You must look down on me

121
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,580
for stealing your dance,

122
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,490
and taking the advantage.

123
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,290
Yet I still couldn't surpass you.

124
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,020
Winning is important.

125
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:20,580
But I don't see you as despicable.

126
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:27,050
You're still the same,

127
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:29,730
pretending to be noble and generous.

128
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,100
But it's just you and me here.

129
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,820
You can speak your mind out.

130
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:35,340
You're right.

131
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,020
I'm neither noble nor generous.

132
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:39,610
But I know you well.

133
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:43,410
If you really used such tricks
in the contest,

134
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,210
you should know

135
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,530
that with my sharp tongue,

136
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,140
I won't let you get away with it,

137
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,170
or win the title.

138
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,340
Someone as clever as you

139
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:55,020
definitely wouldn't take on

140
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:56,780
a thankless task like this.

141
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,290
You do seem to know me well.

142
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,290
So what if you won
the Flower Goddess Contest?

143
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,580
Now, His Majesty has decreed a marriage.

144
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,900
Between you and Brother Xuechen,

145
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:09,760
there's no way you can be together.

146
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,730
Nothing is impossible.

147
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,780
Actually, it doesn't have to be him.

148
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,370
I really can't understand.

149
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,290
What exactly are you thinking?

150
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:29,930
But sometimes, I do envy you.

151
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:34,100
You speak and act without restraint.

152
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:35,970
Though your family lacks power,

153
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,820
you're free from entanglements.

154
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,100
Miss Chen,

155
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:43,850
we must rely

156
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,180
on ourselves.

157
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,540
Whether others help in prosperity

158
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,340
or in adversity,

159
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,460
it should not be relied upon.

160
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,250
It's hard for women in this world.

161
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,430
The options left for women

162
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,010
are only a few.

163
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:02,700
Most times, others force our choices.

164
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:06,260
We often walk paths we don't choose.

165
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,580
Paths are made by walking.

166
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,490
No path is predetermined.

167
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,580
If we don't want this path,

168
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:12,890
we can choose another.

169
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,420
Follow your heart,

170
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,460
and reach where you wish.

171
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,370
Miss Luo, you needn't see me off.

172
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,770
His Majesty has decreed a marriage.

173
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,920
Between you and Brother Xuechen,

174
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:52,940
there's no way you can be together.

175
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:55,500
Your eyes are badly injured.

176
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,540
Why did you come here?

177
00:09:58,410 --> 00:09:59,250
I promised you

178
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:01,700
I would definitely come.

179
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,970
Little fish... Little fish.

180
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,700
Since you kept it,

181
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,620
why not give it a name?

182
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,460
I already did.

183
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:10,980
Little fish.

184
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,580
Little Yu.

185
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:14,700
I used your name "Yu".

186
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:17,820
Wait a moment.

187
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,330
His Majesty granted the marriage.

188
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:22,700
Is that what you want?

189
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:29,650
My Lady, My Lady.

190
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,730
You've finally left
Young Master Yun's house.

191
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,940
Is there any improvement in his eyes?

192
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:37,540
It seems he's getting better.

193
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:44,180
My Lady,

194
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,420
why do you care for him this much?

195
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,300
Seeing him hurt,

196
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,850
I feel worried.

197
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:55,220
Even knowing he does dangerous things,

198
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,700
I still want to be close to him.

199
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,850
When he pretends to be weak,

200
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:01,890
I can't help but take care of him.

201
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:04,890
Lingxi.

202
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,250
You might not believe this,

203
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,890
but my heart belongs to him.

204
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,180
My Lady.

205
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,260
But you are engaged
to Prince Hengyang.

206
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,820
It's granted by His Majesty.

207
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,260
Yet Young Master Yun...

208
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,180
I never wanted this marriage.

209
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,170
Must I be bound

210
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:22,020
by this marriage?

211
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:24,010
But it is
an imperially bestowed marriage.

212
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,940
If this isn't handled well,

213
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:27,810
it might bring trouble upon us.

214
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:28,690
I understand.

215
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:31,180
I need to find the right time

216
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:33,300
to explain things to Prince Hengyang.

217
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,250
Within a month,

218
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,820
I will annul this marriage.

219
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,370
However...

220
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,060
Although
it's an imperially bestowed union,

221
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:43,970
I don't have feelings for him.

222
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,890
The imperial decree can't be defied.

223
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:50,470
Well...

224
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,820
Fine white flour.

225
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:56,410
200.

226
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:04,770
1,020.

227
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,580
Order, compliance, nature.

228
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:25,490
Jinchuan.

229
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,100
Give me another.

230
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,370
Young Master.

231
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:39,060
Please take a rest.

232
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:40,820
Don't strain your eyes.

233
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,340
(This Yellow Courts...)

234
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,420
(What secrets does it hold?)

235
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:56,890
3,000.

236
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,100
Prospect.

237
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:15,580
Young Master Yun.

238
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,770
- Miss Luo.
- Hurry.

239
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,970
I have something to tell you.

240
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,730
Why are you here so early today?

241
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:30,970
Young Master Yun, since you can't see,

242
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,770
why are you still reading?

243
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,540
It's Jinchuan.

244
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,820
Isn't it?

245
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:44,650
- Yes.
- It's Jinchuan.

246
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:46,060
I'm the one who's reading.

247
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:47,410
For some reason,

248
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,930
I've been into reading lately.

249
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:49,770
Yes.

250
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:53,170
As the saying goes,
"Burning the midnight oil."

251
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:54,980
A man should study hard, right?

252
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:55,820
Indeed.

253
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,010
You two talk.

254
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,060
I'm heading out now.

255
00:13:58,980 --> 00:13:59,820
Take care.

256
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:12,340
By the way, I sent Jinchuan
to Xunmei House,

257
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,940
he got back the taels Qiniang owed you.

258
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,060
Look.

259
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:25,850
It's really returned.

260
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,620
I thought it was a lost cause,

261
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,820
never to be seen again.

262
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:37,410
That's strange, the amount of silver...

263
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,500
How is it wrong?

264
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,340
How could that be?

265
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:40,460
I counted it myself.

266
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,340
You just said you counted it.

267
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:53,970
I had Jinchuan count it.

268
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:58,890
By the way,

269
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,620
you rushed here.
Is there something you need?

270
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,980
I'm here to tell you...

271
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,650
Today I will accompany Prince Hengyang.

272
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:06,750
I can't take care of you.

273
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:08,610
- You...
- Wonderful.

274
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,890
I also wanted to invite you today.

275
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:15,530
Miss Luo,

276
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:18,060
I want to take you somewhere today.

277
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:19,860
Alright.

278
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:29,010
Your Highness, forgive me, I'm unwell,

279
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,130
and unable to curtsy.

280
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:32,010
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

281
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:35,010
I truly need someone to care for me.

282
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,100
Alright.

283
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:44,220
Miss Luo and I will accompany you.

284
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,060
Is that okay?

285
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:49,850
No need, Your Highness.

286
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,060
Young Master Yun, if you're unwell,

287
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,340
you should see a physician.

288
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:57,540
Or your conditions might worsen.

289
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,420
I promised you an outing.

290
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:03,820
I will keep my word.

291
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:08,820
Young Master Yun, please rest well.

292
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:14,740
- I feel awful.
- Let's go.

293
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,100
Luo...

294
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:30,890
Jinchuan.

295
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,510
- Coming.
- Jinchuan.

296
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:34,020
What's wrong?

297
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,010
Go find Physician Xue.

298
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,460
Ask if there's a poison

299
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:38,130
that causes temporary blindness,

300
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,570
but clears by the next day.

301
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:40,930
Temporary... Clears the next day.

302
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:41,850
Hurry up!

303
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:42,860
Are you crazy?

304
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,220
- Go, hurry.
- Alright, alright.

305
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:03,650
Yun.

306
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,710
I heard Prince Hengyang
and Miss Luo are out.

307
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:11,580
You just let him take her away?

308
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,170
What else could I do?
They planned it earlier.

309
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:15,820
I have no reason to stop them.

310
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,620
You didn't see how anxious

311
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:20,850
Miss Luo was yesterday.

312
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,780
She is clearly upset with you.

313
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,680
That's why she's out
with Prince Hengyang.

314
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,930
Why didn't you stop her?

315
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:27,850
I can't see. I'm blind.

316
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:31,740
That's not right.

317
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:33,930
According to today's divination,

318
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:36,060
your eyes should have healed,

319
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:38,470
and the propitious tar should be active,

320
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,410
bringing you a beauty.

321
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:41,610
How could this be?

322
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:43,410
Whether I'm recovered,

323
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,260
only the physician can confirm that.

324
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:48,170
Your divination is so mysterious.

325
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:49,300
How can it be reliable?

326
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:52,890
Alright,

327
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,540
you find it mystical,

328
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,820
here's something practical.

329
00:17:58,090 --> 00:17:59,080
Did you get this injury

330
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,580
while investigating that old case?

331
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,060
All these years, how many wounds

332
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,790
have you endured
for investigating that case?

333
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,850
I've advised you countless times.

334
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:14,130
Peace is hard to come by.

335
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,530
This time it's your eyes.

336
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:17,450
What about next time?

337
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:18,780
Risking your life?

338
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:21,780
Truth is worth the risk.

339
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,540
My father bore shame for ten years.

340
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:27,650
Mother suffered alongside him,

341
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:28,850
passing away with regret.

342
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:30,170
And I,

343
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,100
though
knowing my father wasn't a traitor,

344
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:36,340
have to act like I've gotten over it.

345
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,820
Now I finally have a clue,

346
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,370
just a step away from the truth.

347
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:42,540
If you were me,

348
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:45,690
could you let it go?

349
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,170
I know,

350
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,570
you haven't been as carefree
as you seem,

351
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:56,890
carrying many burdens inside.

352
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:59,540
- But you...
- If you truly feel me,

353
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:01,780
you wouldn't persuade me.

354
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,850
Actually,
Father asked me to speak with you.

355
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,370
He wants to know

356
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,850
how you injured your eye.

357
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:25,060
So, what will you tell him?

358
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,610
I'll tell him

359
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:28,540
it was an accident.

360
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:31,820
Thank you.

361
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,690
But I must remind you.

362
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:39,570
Father is suspicious of this matter.

363
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:40,690
He will keep an eye on you.

364
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:41,890
If you continue this way,

365
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:43,740
I can't cover you up anymore.

366
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,260
Alright.

367
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,630
If you plan to take risks,

368
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:50,170
at least inform me first.

369
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:51,900
I need to cover for you,

370
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,340
so let me know the situation.

371
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,650
Understood.

372
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,140
(Yellow Courts, Volume V)

373
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:23,890
Miss Luo.

374
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,890
Today is our first outing together.

375
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,340
If only I could accompany you daily,

376
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,260
I would be satisfied.

377
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:34,970
Your Highness,

378
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:36,900
I actually have something to tell you.

379
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:37,740
We've arrived.

380
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:43,260
Here we are. Let's go in.

381
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,300
Your Highness, you're here!

382
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,100
Your Highness.

383
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,690
Your Highness.

384
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,650
Your Highness, look,

385
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,290
the houses you repaired for us

386
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:01,370
are truly sturdy.

387
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:02,610
Indeed.

388
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:03,740
As long as you like it.

389
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,370
If there's anything else you need,

390
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,100
let Huo Dao know.

391
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,650
And about my eldest son's work,

392
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,450
thank you, Your Highness.

393
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:16,740
It's nothing, really.

394
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:20,610
It's the first time
seeing you bring a lady.

395
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,980
And this lady is?

396
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,650
This is Miss Luo.

397
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,850
So, she is the princess consort.

398
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:27,850
Princess consort.

399
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,020
Indeed, she's like a celestial beauty.

400
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,580
- Truly beautiful.
- Yes, indeed.

401
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,540
I've never seen such a beautiful lady.

402
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,020
Your Highness, you are lucky.

403
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,220
When can we celebrate your wedding?

404
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,470
- Exactly.
- Alright, alright.

405
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,610
Don't make such a fuss.

406
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:41,370
Your Highness,

407
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,740
who are these people?

408
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,090
They are the families
of fallen soldiers.

409
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,450
They usually live here.

410
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,690
You rascal,

411
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,650
where have you been wandering
for so long?

412
00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:00,130
I've cared for you all these years,

413
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:03,500
but you don't go home.

414
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,370
Granny, I haven't gone anywhere.

415
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:07,260
I've always been home.

416
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,540
Granny is getting old.

417
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:12,690
She often mistakes him
for her fallen grandson.

418
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,340
For many years,

419
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,260
he has kept up the act.

420
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:20,910
Don't just stand there.

421
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:22,540
Please take Granny inside to rest.

422
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:23,780
Hurry.

423
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,420
- Come.
- Your Highness.

424
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,580
Gifts from His Highness.

425
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,940
So many gifts again, thank you, sir.

426
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:33,820
- This way.
- Okay.

427
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:42,410
The soldiers of the North Army
are at the border.

428
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:45,690
Some sacrificed for the nation.

429
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,170
I must care for their families.

430
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,130
This is also my responsibility.

431
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:00,980
(It's not a good time
to break the engagement.)

432
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,540
Aman.

433
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:21,340
Why isn't Qiniang here today?

434
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:23,780
I've expelled her from Xunmei House.

435
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,370
She indeed possesses the talent,

436
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,420
but she knew that Miss Luo and Miss Chen

437
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,220
are competing,

438
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,580
yet she taught them both a dance.

439
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,220
Keeping
such a self-serving person around

440
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,300
will be a hidden threat.

441
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:42,540
Are you going to
keep pretending to be blind?

442
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:44,170
One lie leads to a hundred more.

443
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,450
What else can I do?

444
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,580
Oh, by the way,

445
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:48,980
you arrived just in time.

446
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,130
Lu Xian told me today

447
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,580
that Uncle has noticed
my secret investigation.

448
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,260
I need to be more discreet.

449
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,410
I'll have to rely on you.

450
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:56,500
Alright.

451
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:58,930
After all, your eyes are still blind.

452
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:01,120
You're always bringing up
the wrong things.

453
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:02,820
Aman, you weren't like this before.

454
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:05,740
Let's talk business.

455
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:08,850
How's the decoding going?

456
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,650
The original Yellow Courts

457
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:12,980
and the annotations

458
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,260
differ in words.

459
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,840
They can't form complete sentences.

460
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:17,310
To decode the original version,

461
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,450
we need other versions,

462
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:20,820
then we can decode the secret letter.

463
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,170
I knew it wouldn't be so easy.

464
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,660
I specially gathered for you

465
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,060
many versions of Yellow Courts.

466
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:32,610
Some are ancient.

467
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,020
Some are bought
from the Beichu market.

468
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,130
I also assigned more people
to decode it.

469
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,300
You are thoughtful.

470
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:47,130
But I must say,

471
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:49,370
my father's decree of marriage
is unavoidable.

472
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,170
What's your plan about it?

473
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,300
To kidnap the bride

474
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:54,820
and then elope,

475
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:55,980
living a life on the run.

476
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:57,450
I'll make it an accomplished fact.

477
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,930
So the Imperial Family will back off.

478
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,610
Have you been drinking?

479
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:05,060
Why do you sound like you're drunk?

480
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,580
That's indeed nonsense.

481
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:09,100
But I have a plan.

482
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:11,220
What His Majesty will get

483
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,740
is just a good daughter-in-law.

484
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:14,780
If I want him to change his mind,

485
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,980
I must offer someone more important.

486
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:18,970
Offer someone?

487
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:20,820
Who?

488
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:22,780
Me.

489
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:25,060
You? As the offer?

490
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:26,780
What do you mean?

491
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,260
We have more important matters
to do.

492
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,850
We'll discuss it later. I must go.

493
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,170
Stop the carriage.

494
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,260
Your veil.

495
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:37,340
Aren't you blind?

496
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:44,740
Miss Luo, have you ever

497
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,060
admired the view from the rooftop?

498
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:52,500
You seem to do that often.

499
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:55,470
I was mischievous as a child.

500
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,850
I would skip lessons
and hide on rooftops,

501
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,890
snickering as I watched them
search for me.

502
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:07,690
So, you're a repeat offender.

503
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:09,930
Yes.

504
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:16,850
And then, I went to the border.

505
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:18,540
Years spent away.

506
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:23,060
Even I, obsessed with martial arts,
would get tired.

507
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,410
There were times I missed home.

508
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:28,020
Whenever that happened,

509
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:31,130
I would look from north to south,

510
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:33,130
in the direction of Yuezhou.

511
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,260
Now that I've returned to Yuezhou,

512
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,500
and see everyone live in peace.

513
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:42,020
I feel all those years at the border

514
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:44,410
were worth it.

515
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,260
I toast to you,

516
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,020
Your Highness,

517
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:57,580
and to everyone who guards peace.

518
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:12,930
I used to drink alone here,

519
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:15,610
but now you accompany me.

520
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:21,260
If only it could always be like this.

521
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:25,340
(It's best to clarify with him soon.)

522
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:42,450
Your Highness, I came to see you today

523
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:46,340
because I have something to tell you.

524
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,610
Please speak, Miss Luo.

525
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,260
Whatever you need,

526
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,340
I will certainly help.

527
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,340
I want to talk about

528
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,610
our arranged marriage.

529
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,540
- I...
- Lingyu.

530
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:05,260
Why are you here?

531
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,130
You drank so much.

532
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:07,570
- I'll take you back.
- Wait.

533
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:09,000
- Lu Xuechen.
- I haven't finished.

534
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,850
You were pretending.

535
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:11,060
You're not blind at all.

536
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,130
I truly can't see.

537
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,780
But I surely will recover.

538
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,260
Let's go back.

539
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,750
Lu Xuechen, let go of her.

540
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,170
I'll take her home myself.

541
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,580
It's none of your concern.

542
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,570
She's not used to

543
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:26,340
riding in others' carriages.

544
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:29,290
My carriage has cushions, perfume,

545
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,740
and the pastries you love.

546
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:32,500
You'll definitely like it.

547
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,660
Are you still trying with sweet words

548
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,260
to entangle Miss Luo until when?

549
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,570
If you can't make her promises,

550
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:41,890
don't blame me for stepping in.

551
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,500
Both of you, I...

552
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,820
You exerted power and pressure,

553
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,090
making a unilateral marriage agreement.

554
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:48,170
Isn't that entanglement?

555
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:49,820
Did you ask how she feels?

556
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,610
Do you know if she agrees?

557
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:01,930
I let go of her today

558
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:03,610
not because of you, Lu Xuechen,

559
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:06,410
but because I care about
Miss Luo's feelings.

560
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:15,890
Alright.

561
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,200
Then, I take my leave.

562
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:18,780
Let's go.

563
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,340
Lu Xuechen.

564
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,310
Since I've fallen for her,

565
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,890
I will fight with all my might,

566
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:36,060
and never give up easily.

567
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:57,850
Aren't you supposed to be blind?

568
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:00,300
Why aren't you pretending now?

569
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:02,060
You're about to be taken away.

570
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,500
How could I keep pretending?

571
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,500
What about the carriage?

572
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:10,020
You mentioned
cushions, perfume, and pastries.

573
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:11,690
Why are they all missing?

574
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:14,130
This is all that's left.

575
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,610
I rushed here to find you,

576
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:18,100
and didn't have time to prepare those.

577
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,020
Once we return,

578
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:22,370
I'll take you for a ride, alright?

579
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,980
I was so close,

580
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:28,130
so close to saying it.

581
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,130
Why are you coming now?

582
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,540
What do you mean?

583
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:33,780
Am I in the way,

584
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,500
interrupting your time together?

585
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:40,170
Usually,
you're like a clever fox spirit.

586
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,740
Why are you acting foolish now?

587
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,300
Who's the fox spirit?

588
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,530
I'm talking about you.

589
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:49,130
Lu Xuechen, silly fox.

590
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:52,020
You don't know what I want to tell him.

591
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:52,860
Well,

592
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,170
what did you want to tell him?

593
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,370
I wanted to talk about

594
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:02,170
the arranged marriage.

595
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:04,580
What?

596
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:06,860
Speak up.

597
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:08,630
Wake up.

598
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:11,390
♪In this life,
may our love stand like mountains♪

599
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:14,460
♪Through seasons' change,
our whispers weave♪

600
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:17,170
(Lingyu,)

601
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:20,120
(I'll uncover the truth
from ten years ago soon.)

602
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,020
(I will unburden myself,)

603
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:23,890
(and come to your side.)

604
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:43,450
Young Master, the clothes
have been sent for washing.

605
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:46,780
You haven't had rest for several nights.

606
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:49,930
Perhaps you should rest early today.

607
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:52,850
We are taking action,

608
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,930
and so are they.

609
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:57,370
The sooner we decode it, the better.

610
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,540
The words are incoherent.

611
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,820
(know, we,
betrayed, 14 days, plan to)

612
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:40,020
Lingxi.

613
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:45,340
My Lady, you're up so early.

614
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:46,980
I made you some Hangover Soup.

615
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,300
Hangover Soup?

616
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:51,930
I only had a little to drink.
I wasn't drunk.

617
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,500
But, My Lady, last night,

618
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,930
you were completely intoxicated.

619
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:57,680
You threw up all over Young Master Yun.

620
00:32:58,530 --> 00:32:59,410
What did you say?

621
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,500
My Lady, have you forgotten?

622
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:05,100
Yesterday, I shared drinks
with Prince Hengyang.

623
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,850
It seemed the moment was ripe.

624
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:08,770
But before I said it,

625
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:10,260
Young Master Yun interrupted.

626
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,260
I am unaware of what happened then.

627
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,380
(Eliminate)

628
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:43,820
"Eliminate".

629
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:49,690
So that's how it is.

630
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,600
(He knew our betrayal and planned to
kill us at Yi Pass in 14 days.)

631
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,460
(We must silence him.)

632
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:09,170
With just a few words,

633
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:13,580
they changed a person's fate.

634
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:18,610
Father,

635
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,610
you've been criticized for ten years.

636
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:28,650
I've been investigating for ten years.

637
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:30,900
In the end,

638
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:35,060
it all started with this piece of paper.

639
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:38,100
(We must silence him.)

640
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,980
Young Master Yun, last night I...

641
00:34:58,530 --> 00:34:59,500
Young Master Yun?

642
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,380
What happened?

643
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:05,420
Are you feeling unwell?

644
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,220
My father...

645
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,170
It turns out he's really gone.

646
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:15,340
(We must silence him.)

647
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:33,250
Knowing we've betrayed,

648
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:35,380
he planned to kill us

649
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:38,420
at Yi Pass in 14 days.

650
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:40,690
We should

651
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,580
silence him.

652
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:49,330
Does Yi Pass

653
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,100
refer to Jingyang?

654
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,420
Are you investigating Jingyang?

655
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:08,420
The Battle of Jingyang
was ten years ago.

656
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,690
Why are you investigating it?

657
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,380
My father

658
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:15,770
was a commander
in the Battle of Jingyang.

659
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,140
Lu Jie.

660
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,690
Is your father General Lu Jie?

661
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,980
But no one ever mentioned it at home.

662
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,500
The name "Lu Jie"

663
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,130
is a taboo for the Lu Clan.

664
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,250
Uncle feared
it would sadden me and Grandmother,

665
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:43,580
but I...

666
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:46,730
never forgot him.

667
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:53,460
I know your parents died in that battle.

668
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:55,460
It's widely rumored

669
00:36:56,860 --> 00:37:00,100
the battle was lost
because of my father.

670
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,730
You must resent me, right?

671
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,770
But you still told me.

672
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:14,480
I didn't want to hide it from you.

673
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,250
We lost the Battle of Jingyang.

674
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:18,650
I do have my grievances,

675
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,610
but in essence,

676
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,810
the fall of Jingyang
was due to Beichu's invasion.

677
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:26,770
If there is blame,

678
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,100
it is on the enemies.

679
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,730
As for General Lu Jie,

680
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:36,020
I don't know the full story,

681
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,330
and won't judge it lightly.

682
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:45,130
My father would never
abandon the city and flee.

683
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,610
My father said the same thing.

684
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:50,530
Really?

685
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:54,940
My father was the prefect of Jingyang.

686
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:57,290
He had associated with General Lu Jie.

687
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:01,290
If he said such things,

688
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:05,060
it means there must be more
to the story.

689
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:12,130
So, did you go to Shuozhou

690
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,730
for this matter?

691
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,770
I traced the clues to Shuozhou.

692
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:26,730
At the Fan Family, I found a ledger.

693
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:31,770
Its contents were a secret letter
in code.

694
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:34,060
Yet, I was discovered.

695
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,650
That's why I fell into the water.

696
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:38,130
And you saved me.

697
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:42,940
This paper contains
the content of the secret letter.

698
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,820
(We must silence him.)

699
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,210
So...

700
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:55,250
the hidden truth is

701
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:59,210
General Lu Jie did not flee
before the battle.

702
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:01,810
He led a squad to an ambush,

703
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,460
but was silenced by a traitor
in the North Army.

704
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:06,730
That's correct.

705
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:11,290
However, one anonymous letter

706
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:14,860
can't clear my father's name.

707
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,460
I must investigate further,

708
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:18,810
and find solid evidence.

709
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:22,580
Only then will the truth be revealed.

710
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,290
Look at your current state.

711
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:30,810
We haven't even started yet,

712
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,060
and already scared off the spies.

713
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,340
How about

714
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,460
going out

715
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,380
to lift our spirits?

716
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:44,930
Sounds good.

717
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:57,130
So you have such a deep secret.

718
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:59,420
You want to clear General Lu's name.

719
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,580
But what evidence is left now?

720
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:06,210
The ones who sent the secret letter
ten years ago

721
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:08,460
knew such a confidential operation.

722
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:12,100
They must hold a high position
in the North Army.

723
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,460
According to the letter,

724
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,300
two people
within the army were involved.

725
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,170
A single move
can affect the whole situation.

726
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:22,530
Therefore,

727
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:24,900
I must be extremely cautious this time

728
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,540
to avoid alarming the enemy.

729
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:30,060
So you should start with the North Army.

730
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:33,980
I will ask Prince Changyi
to find two lists.

731
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:37,020
First,
a key figure in the Battle of Jingyang.

732
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:40,540
Second, apart from Prince Hengyang,

733
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:43,940
those who can command the North Army.

734
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,380
The people appearing on both lists

735
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,940
are the spies.

736
00:41:11,611 --> 00:41:14,301
♪Clouds dream of garments,

737
00:41:14,301 --> 00:41:17,511
