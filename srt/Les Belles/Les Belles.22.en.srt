(Chen Mansion)

24
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,750
The Lu Clan is coming for the betrothal.

25
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:49,330
Be careful.

26
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,460
Eunuch Gao, Miss Luo.

27
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,290
Greetings, Minister Chen.

28
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:01,250
His Majesty is pleased
about the union between

29
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,730
Young Master Yun and Miss Chen.

30
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,050
He specifically sent me
to deliver this gift.

31
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,300
Alright.

32
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,100
Prince of Hengyang is occupied today.

33
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:12,650
He asked me to congratulate Miss Chen.

34
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:13,620
That's wonderful.

35
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,370
I'm grateful to His Majesty for his kindness,

36
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,730
and to Prince of Hengyang's gesture.

37
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,180
I've brought a box of lip balm.

38
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,900
I wanted to present it
to Miss Chen myself

39
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,420
to share in her joyous occasion.

40
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,620
Miss Luo, you're truly thoughtful.

41
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,210
However, I heard...

42
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,730
you and my daughter had a fight
a few days ago.

43
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,370
I'm afraid she'll act
on her impulses again,

44
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,130
and might offend you.

45
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,700
So, it's better if I deliver it for you.

46
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,930
Lip balm is feminine stuff.

47
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,130
How can I trouble you with it?

48
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,460
You're right.

49
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,290
Young Master Yun is here.

50
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,260
(Majestic Heights)

51
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,420
Mr. Chen, Eunuch Gao.

52
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,340
Mr. Chen, you only have one daughter.

53
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,260
She must have been raised
with great care.

54
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,810
She's the noblest girl of Yuezhou.

55
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,010
How could you easily marry her to someone?

56
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,820
Some people are blind and ignorant.

57
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,340
They can't tell good from bad.

58
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,900
But Mr. Chen, you and Miss Chen

59
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,820
are surely wise, perceptive,

60
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,260
and discerning.

61
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:45,650
So, congrats to you

62
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,490
for finding a good partner.

63
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,980
Congrats to you and the Prince of Hengyang.

64
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,620
May you have a happy union.

65
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,370
Look at you two,

66
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,060
Xuechen is young and capable.

67
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,580
He and my daughter make a perfect pair.

68
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:01,630
He is now an official

69
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,260
and is favored by His Majesty.

70
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,260
He will surely bring great success.

71
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,420
Let's hope so.

72
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,210
I'm going to see Miss Chen.

73
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:12,980
Alright, alright.

74
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:20,930
Eunuch Gao.

75
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,020
It's hot outside. Please come in.

76
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,210
Okay.

77
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:28,650
Xuechen,

78
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,500
I heard some rumors recently,

79
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,490
saying you got drunk over Miss Luo.

80
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,930
I wonder if it's true or not.

81
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,420
Mr. Chen, to be honest,

82
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,860
I'm now distant from Miss Luo.

83
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:44,890
She has found someone more prominent.

84
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,170
Naturally, she won't waste effort on me.

85
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,300
I just regret not realizing it sooner,

86
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,650
and almost disappointed Miss Chen.

87
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,860
Regarding marriage,

88
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,770
it's best to find a suitable match.

89
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,210
You're absolutely right.

90
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:01,650
I've been busy, neglecting her a bit.

91
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:04,490
Please speak kindly of me to her, Mr. Chen.

92
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,650
Please ask her not to blame me anymore.

93
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:08,650
Of course.

94
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,180
I've just taken office.

95
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,970
Are you assisting His Majesty

96
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:15,770
in thoroughly investigating corruption?

97
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:16,820
Not entirely.

98
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,270
Thanks to His Majesty's trust,

99
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,330
I happened to discover

100
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,490
there might be a spy in the North Army.

101
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,020
This is a serious matter.

102
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,140
I'm up to my eyeballs in it.

103
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,570
Mr. Chen, back then,

104
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,370
you seemed to serve in the North Army.

105
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,140
Any clues you might have?

106
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,980
How could there be a spy
in the North Army?

107
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,540
The North Army has many people.

108
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:43,860
And it's been so long.

109
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,260
If you don't know,

110
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,170
I have even less to go on.

111
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,450
Indeed, it will be a tough investigation.

112
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,210
If you need any help,

113
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,980
feel free to ask me.

114
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,330
I understand.

115
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:01,650
Mr. Chen,

116
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,490
Miss Chen is virtuous and kind.

117
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,260
I cherish her deeply.

118
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,890
Today, I've brought generous gifts.

119
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:12,320
Please allow me to deliver them
to the courtyard

120
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,540
as a gesture of my sincerity.

121
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:16,860
That sounds good.

122
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:18,450
Then go ahead.

123
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,180
Yes.

124
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:23,740
Move everything inside.

125
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,320
Hurry.

126
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,020
How is it?

127
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,100
It went smoothly.

128
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:02,410
What about Qiuyue?

129
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,020
She's asleep
after taking the sleeping pills.

130
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,610
Are you really sure about this?

131
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,050
There's no turning back now.

132
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:16,930
I have no choice.

133
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:20,820
I can't back down now.

134
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,370
This tea is exceptional, Minister Chen.

135
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,530
If it impresses you,

136
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,180
I'm truly honored.

137
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,020
Come on.

138
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,020
Help! There's a thief!

139
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:47,410
Hurry!

140
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,740
Help! There's a thief!

141
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,860
Quick, there's a thief!

142
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:03,700
Minister Chen, what has happened?

143
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:05,930
Eunuch Gao,

144
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,300
there's been a thief.

145
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:09,940
You know in my study,

146
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,180
there are national secrets.

147
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,300
We cannot afford any mishaps.

148
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,650
Please forgive my abrupt departure.

149
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,650
Then I'll accompany you.

150
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:19,410
Very well.

151
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,770
I appreciate your assistance.

152
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,210
- This way.
- Let's go.

153
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:25,940
- Let go of me.
- There's a thief!

154
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,180
- Let go.
- Catch the thief.

155
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,020
- Let go!
- Over here!

156
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:31,300
Let go of me.

157
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,250
My Lady, where's the thief?

158
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,450
Who do you call a thief?

159
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:37,570
Naturally, it's you.

160
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:38,610
Today is a joyous day.

161
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:39,570
What are you doing here?

162
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,180
Could it be you haven't forgotten
Brother Xuechen?

163
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,770
Trying to ruin my engagement ceremony?

164
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,250
Miss Chen, you're overthinking it.

165
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,570
You see everyone

166
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,130
as being longing for
your Brother Xuechen.

167
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,490
My Lady, Miss Luo,

168
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,690
I heard someone shouting
there's a thief here,

169
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:56,790
and came to catch them.

170
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,570
Who can't get over, who regrets,
you know best.

171
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,250
Don't think with your tricks,

172
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,810
you can deceive him
to fall for you again,

173
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:08,220
- Who deceived him?
- You did.

174
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,570
He likes me on his own.

175
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:10,540
What's it to you?

176
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,380
You...

177
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:14,010
Are they fighting over a man?

178
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,100
My Lady, if there's nothing else,

179
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,010
I'll take my leave.

180
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,730
We won't hold them back like this.

181
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,180
Sorry, but we have to act.

182
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,130
- Luo Lingyu!
- My Lady.

183
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,450
Let go of me!

184
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,690
- Let go!
- You first.

185
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,450
- You first.
- Ladies, stop.

186
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,610
- Stop it.
- Stop hitting.

187
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:39,500
Luo Lingyu!

188
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,010
My Lady.

189
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,860
- Stop.
- My Lady, stop it.

190
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,250
Let go, ladies.

191
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,090
My Lady.

192
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,020
Let it be, My Lady.

193
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,130
What should we do now?

194
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,090
Ladies.

195
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,300
How dare you call me a thief.

196
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:55,940
Let go!

197
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:56,930
You first, let go.

198
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,160
- What now?
- He likes me.

199
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,330
Mr. Lu.

200
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:20,650
Ladies.

201
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,540
- Let go.
- Let go.

202
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,740
Ladies, stop fighting.

203
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,450
Minister Chen truly didn't come.

204
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:28,450
Stop fighting.

205
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,010
Come on.

206
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,300
Stop now.

207
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,100
Aren't you fighting?

208
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,100
I won't turn violent with her.

209
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:40,620
It's beneath my dignity.

210
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,380
I'll talk to her myself.

211
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:43,740
Leave us alone.

212
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,010
Yes.

213
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:47,620
Hurry, let's go.

214
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,100
Tomorrow, we'll create a diversion.

215
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,420
The key is who will be the decoy,

216
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:03,540
and who will act.

217
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:06,860
On the surface, Lingyu covers me

218
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,860
to draw away Chen Mansion's guards,

219
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,540
but Chen Hao is cunning.

220
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,650
He won't be easily fooled,

221
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:14,770
so I must act as the real bait

222
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,250
to stall him.

223
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,420
And as for Lingyu,

224
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,240
take the chance to search for the token

225
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,420
Miss Chen mentioned.

226
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,250
But the Chen Mansion is vast,

227
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,900
and we are unfamiliar with it.

228
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,210
We must prepare early.

229
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,450
We're unfamiliar with it,

230
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,740
but surely someone knows it well.

231
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:30,500
I truly don't know where it is.

232
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,620
Think hard.

233
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:33,380
Is there any place

234
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,130
where you and your mother can't even go?

235
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:40,210
The only place here is the study.

236
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,740
But Minister Chen

237
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,300
would destroy what he can.
As for the rest,

238
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,860
he'd move them to a safe place.

239
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:53,620
He could stay hidden in Nanyue for ten years,

240
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,980
which shows he's cautious.

241
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:00,100
I guess the evidence
is in the Chen Mansion.

242
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:03,360
Tell me everything you've seen

243
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,620
at the mansion these days.

244
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,620
Recently...

245
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:14,620
Minister Chen.

246
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:18,210
Xuechen, what are you searching for?

247
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,740
I just passed by the study,

248
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,700
and suddenly remembered

249
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,740
you once served in the North Army.

250
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,370
So I wanted to see this place

251
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,420
to check for any documents from that time.

252
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,060
Xuechen,

253
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:32,940
if there's anything you'd like to see,

254
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,300
feel free to ask me for it.

255
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:35,500
You should know,

256
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,060
in my study,

257
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:40,450
it's filled with confidential state affairs.

258
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,340
Not just anyone can browse freely.

259
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,100
I am newly appointed to office,

260
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,420
and only know that as Imperial Censor,

261
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,330
I'm tasked with overseeing officials.

262
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:50,420
I didn't think too much.

263
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,060
It seems I was out of line.

264
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,540
Mr. Lu.

265
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,540
Only with His Majesty's permission
can you investigate.

266
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:00,940
Searching without consent is inappropriate.

267
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,370
Please leave quickly.

268
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:03,620
Eunuch Gao, you're right.

269
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,740
I shall take my leave then.

270
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,090
Wait a moment.

271
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:12,980
I have

272
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:15,690
nothing to hide here.

273
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,620
Your search will be in vain.

274
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,500
Have you checked this already?

275
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,900
Look at you.

276
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,380
Sneaking quietly into my study.

277
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,980
Are you trying to

278
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,890
steal court secrets?

279
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,380
Minister Chen,

280
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,570
how could you say that?

281
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:48,010
Xuechen, don't think I don't know.

282
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:51,730
Your duet with Miss Luo today

283
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,460
was to tie up my mansion's forces,

284
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,890
then sneak into my study quietly.

285
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,980
If I remember correctly,

286
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,810
Miss Luo should be from the North.

287
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:04,540
That's everything.

288
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:10,010
You usually pay your mother visits
at the ancestral hall.

289
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,890
Why at her bedchamber yesterday?

290
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,570
Mother is very disciplined.

291
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:16,060
She offers incense
in the ancestral hall every day.

292
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,500
So I'm used to it.

293
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:19,690
Daily greetings
are in the ancestral hall.

294
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,620
But yesterday, my mother felt unwell,

295
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,620
so I went to her bedchamber instead.

296
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:28,510
Has this happened before?

297
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:29,740
Rarely.

298
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,020
It's said that the very next day
after my birth,

299
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,940
she went to the ancestral hall for incense.

300
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:39,740
Is there a problem
with the ancestral hall?

301
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,370
Many have traveled from the North to Yuezhou.

302
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:46,650
Do you think

303
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,900
that anyone from the North

304
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,770
or with family there

305
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,100
should be considered a spy?

306
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,860
But you are different.

307
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,570
Your father, Lu Jie, betrayed us.

308
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,300
Currently,

309
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,660
you are entangled with Luo Lingyu.

310
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,690
This clearly indicates

311
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:06,770
your past complex connections

312
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:09,060
are still weighing on you.

313
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,540
Perhaps the entire Lu Clan is tainted.

314
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:12,570
Utter nonsense!

315
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:14,180
Do not speak ill of my father.

316
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:16,970
Eunuch Gao,

317
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,210
did you see that?

318
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:21,610
He truly resents the Imperial Court

319
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:23,010
because of his father's matter.

320
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:25,370
Lu Jie made grave mistakes back then,

321
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:27,020
but His Majesty did not assign blame,

322
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,130
and now even gave you a chance to serve.

323
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:30,500
Not only are you ungrateful,

324
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,770
but you try to steal court secrets from me.

325
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:38,540
Coincidentally,
Eunuch Gao is here today too,

326
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,650
and can serve as a witness.

327
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,740
Guards!

328
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,790
- Yes.
- Yes.

329
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:45,250
I'll purge the court
on behalf of His Majesty.

330
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:48,130
(I must buy time
for Lingyu and Miss Chen.)

331
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:49,860
Seize him for me!

332
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:50,970
- Yes.
- Yes.

333
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,500
Let's see who dares to act.

334
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,770
Mr. Lu.

335
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,300
(Chen Clan Ancestral Hall)

336
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,860
(Hanmo Study)
Mr. Lu, calm down.

337
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,060
Don't act rashly.

338
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,140
Come on.

339
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:41,010
As expected, it's Mr. Kong.

340
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,810
Third Young Master
of the Lu Family in Yuezhou,

341
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,180
Imperial Censor Lu Yun

342
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:47,940
defies the law

343
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:50,250
and abducts an imperial official.

344
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,010
Such a crime deserves death.

345
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,330
Release Minister Chen,

346
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,180
and you'll keep your whole body.

347
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,860
Keep my body intact?

348
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,450
Are you planning an execution without proof?

349
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,690
Mr. Kong, when did you receive the news?

350
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,330
You got here surprisingly fast.

351
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:07,020
Capturing the Beichu spy

352
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,900
is the duty of the North Army.

353
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,740
You mean I'm a spy for Beichu?

354
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,950
What evidence do you have?

355
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:14,210
Report!

356
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:17,580
In Mr. Lu's dowry,

357
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,100
we found correspondence with Beichu.

358
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:24,140
(We've placed our forces within Nanyue.
Awaiting further action.)

359
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:28,380
"We've placed our forces within Nanyue.

360
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,810
Awaiting further action."

361
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,850
(It seems they planned this long ago,)

362
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:37,210
(the case of thief crying thief.)

363
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,450
(If evidence isn't found today,)

364
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,450
(it'll be hard to leave unscathed.)

365
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,180
(Late Madam Yang, R.I.P.)

366
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,290
What's wrong?

367
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,690
The ink on this spirit tablet is fresh.

368
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:00,380
(Late)

369
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,020
It's suspicious.

370
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,330
There's a hidden compartment, look.

371
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:18,020
It must be cleverly secured.

372
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,870
I secretly learned the mechanism.

373
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,330
- Let me try.
- Okay.

374
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:31,530
So that's how it is.

375
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,850
You went to great lengths
to become an imperial censor,

376
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,250
just to place a spy

377
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,740
into the Nanyue Court

378
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,780
for gathering court secrets

379
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,530
and for framing me.

380
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:43,410
Who is framing whom?

381
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,500
Do you not realize it?

382
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,590
Lu Yun, the guilty minister,

383
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,820
is accused of treason.

384
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,170
All evidence is conclusive.

385
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,500
Execute him on the spot.

386
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,380
There is a spy here.

387
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:10,660
Search every room.

388
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,260
More people are gathering.

389
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:16,450
I'm sorry.

390
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:22,900
Look.

391
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:25,460
(Beichu Censor)
It really is a Beichu token.

392
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,260
Let's go.

393
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,170
Someone might have noticed.

394
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,580
Go to the side gate.

395
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,420
I'll hold them off.

396
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:42,930
Go.

397
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:56,930
Xiu.

398
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,960
Collaborating with foreigners,

399
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,140
framing the loyal,

400
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,480
harming officials in secret.

401
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:09,900
Minister Chen, tell me,

402
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:11,660
what crime have you committed?

403
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:16,900
As a true Beichu spy,

404
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,810
even if Chen Hao is skilled,

405
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,090
he will still feel guilty.

406
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:21,620
So if pushed to the limit,

407
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:24,330
he will take me down without hesitation.

408
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:26,260
Since the Chen Mansion is his domain,

409
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:29,020
the force he will use is...

410
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,570
- House Guards.
- House Guards.

411
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:34,290
If he uses his own people to kill you,

412
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,410
even if we can't bring down him,

413
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,690
he will have no defense for killing.

414
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,410
What if he has a more powerful weapon?

415
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,810
It's Mr. Kong.

416
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:47,930
Your Highness.

417
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:54,410
Mr. Kong, I think you want to ask,

418
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,660
"Didn't you enter the palace?"

419
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,020
Father summoned me.

420
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:00,530
Please handle military matters for me.

421
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:02,810
Rest assured, Your Highness.

422
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,260
I gave you a chance.

423
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,980
So, you two

424
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,820
have been conspiring all along.

425
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,050
What if we have? Chen Hao.

426
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,170
Surrender now.

427
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:42,780
Father did wrong.

428
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:43,910
We can't keep...

429
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:47,410
You are unfilial! He is your father.

430
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:53,170
How could you betray him like this?

431
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,280
A father conceals for his child,

432
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:58,610
and vice versa.

433
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,170
This is a natural moral duty.

434
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,980
You're so heartless,

435
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,900
and unfilial.

436
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,170
Truly, we raised you for nothing.

437
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,090
Only those who understand

438
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:10,170
etiquette and honor

439
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:12,020
truly know what it means to be human.

440
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:15,410
You're the one
who taught me these.

441
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,090
But now

442
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:23,020
are you telling me these are wrong?

443
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,780
By doing this,

444
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,410
are you resenting our strictness?

445
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:34,330
But it's all for your own good.

446
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:36,810
Yet over the years,

447
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,900
in every matter,

448
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,290
I haven't been well at all.

449
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:49,140
Mother, all these years,

450
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,050
you taught me to act

451
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,900
with sincerity.

452
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:58,500
But what about Father?

453
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,780
If he truly cared for me,

454
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,660
how could he use my marriage as bait?

455
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:05,970
How could he commit treason,

456
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:07,260
abandoning us completely?

457
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:13,020
Mother, stop deceiving yourself.

458
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,210
He doesn't care about us at all.

459
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:23,410
"Surrender now."

460
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,130
Today, the two of you,

461
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:29,300
one sneaked into my study to steal,

462
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,850
and the other brought soldiers here,

463
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:32,410
injuring the guards of my mansion.

464
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,290
How are your actions

465
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,260
different from bandits'?

466
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:37,900
Now you're fabricating charges,

467
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:40,490
wanting to frame me for treason,

468
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:42,050
and selling out the country.

469
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,780
Do you have any proof?

470
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,860
Who says there's no proof?

471
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:52,780
(Beichu Official)
This token

472
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:55,050
is made from
Beichu's black phoebe wood.

473
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:57,780
It has the eagle and tiger totem on it.

474
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,930
Minister Chen, how will you explain this?

475
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:05,740
You can't possibly say
this is your collection.

476
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:07,210
Chen Hao.

477
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:09,690
Do you confess your guilt?

478
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,180
Just based on this piece,

479
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:13,100
a token found who-knows-where,

480
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:16,020
you want to accuse me of treason?

481
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:17,780
Isn't that too absurd?

482
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,450
Chen Hao and Kong Lingfeng
support dissidents,

483
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:24,980
disrupt court order, and smuggle saltpeter

484
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:28,370
with Cui Jianye,
Sun Yicheng, and Yu Xiangxian.

485
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:29,500
The evidence is solid.

486
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:30,900
Now, by order of His Majesty,

487
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,570
you are all to be apprehended.

488
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:35,540
Falsely accusing Newly Imperial Scholars

489
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,930
is a crime punishable by law.

490
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,590
Those you've been in contact with

491
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,810
are other Beichu agents.

492
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,660
They've been under arrest.

493
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,170
Don't hold onto false hopes.

494
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:49,140
No one will come to aid you now.

495
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,500
Take them away.

496
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:51,860
Move.

497
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,530
- Is there no law?
- Hurry up.

498
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,570
Good capture.

499
00:24:59,060 --> 00:24:59,900
Chen Hao.

500
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,660
What else do you have to say?

501
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,260
I want to see the Emperor.

502
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,420
Alright,

503
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,170
I'll take you to see His Majesty.

504
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:10,210
Get lost.

505
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:33,410
Take them to prison for trial.

506
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,570
It's all over now.

507
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:22,450
Mr. Kong and Minister Chen
have been arrested.

508
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:26,330
The evidence is conclusive.

509
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,450
I'm afraid that...

510
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:33,020
You and your mother were unaware of this.

511
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:34,660
His Majesty is benevolent.

512
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,530
He won't involve you two.

513
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:41,170
But the Chen Mansion is sealed.

514
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:43,980
If you don't mind,

515
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:47,740
you and your mother
can stay at Xunmei House.

516
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,780
Thank you.

517
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:58,780
We should be the ones thanking you.

518
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:01,500
You knew this would be the outcome,

519
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,330
yet you still chose

520
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,260
to use your marriage to help us.

521
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,380
Now look at the situation.

522
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,450
It's truly unfair to you.

523
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:23,260
How do you know I'm not willing?

524
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:27,620
I've had

525
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,980
this dream before.

526
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,450
When I wake,
I know reality from illusion.

527
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:38,140
Only then can I see the path ahead.

528
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:40,290
Miss Chen, you're truly open-hearted.

529
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:43,410
Honestly speaking,

530
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:46,020
if I were you,

531
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,210
I might not do as well as you.

532
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,980
I don't need your comfort.

533
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:57,260
You said you dislike constraints.

534
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:00,930
Do you still feel the same now?

535
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:01,930
Of course.

536
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:04,260
Why do you ask?

537
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:10,740
I'm just afraid I've broken free,

538
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,170
while you're tied down.

539
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:15,900
Leaving me to enjoy freedom alone.

540
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,620
Nothing can bind me.

541
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:24,860
It's just a cage.

542
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:26,930
I'll dismantle it.

543
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,020
- Hurry up.
- Move.

544
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,900
(Spring on Stones)

545
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:40,860
Keep moving.

546
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:42,290
Behave yourself.

547
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,500
- Still worried about Mr. Kong?
- Move on.

548
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:49,450
Do you think I'm being too soft-hearted?

549
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:51,780
He's clearly a Beichu spy.

550
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:54,900
I always despise people from Beichu.

551
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,140
Indeed, he is a Beichu spy.

552
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,500
But he protects you wholeheartedly.

553
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:03,570
Don't feel ashamed
for being upset over him.

554
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:07,100
It's a blessing for Nanyue
to have compassionate warriors.

555
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,450
Mr. Kong is like a father to me.

556
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:12,980
Knowing about his betrayal
deeply unsettles me.

557
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:15,450
Over the years,

558
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:18,780
your father was unfairly criticized.

559
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,290
How did you manage to endure it?

560
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:27,100
At first, I was also angry and sad.

561
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,290
But later, I realized
as long as I am righteous,

562
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:31,810
I'm invincible.

563
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:35,620
You brought Mr. Kong to justice,

564
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,740
preventing him from making more mistakes.

565
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:40,450
For you, for him,

566
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,170
it is a blessing.

567
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:46,410
You've really grown up.

568
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,690
Your words are sweeter.

569
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:51,170
You've also matured,

570
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:52,530
not as hard to please now.

571
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:58,130
So is it because I've grown up

572
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,380
you now call me Your Highness?

573
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:04,660
In the past, we were

574
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,930
such close brothers sharing everything.

575
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,570
Now you seem so distant,

576
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:11,810
calling me Your Highness.

577
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:17,210
Yet you call Changyi "Aman" so casually.

578
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:18,530
Are you saying

579
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,570
you're upset I don't use your nickname?

580
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,140
Are you sure?

581
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,290
Is something wrong?

582
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:32,570
Ajiao.

583
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,620
Censor Lu.

584
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:15,570
Censor Lu.

585
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:40,380
His Majesty appreciates
your years of service,

586
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,660
and has specially prepared meals for you.

587
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:46,050
Minister Chen, please enjoy.

588
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:05,930
Minister Chen, you are not eating.

589
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:08,150
Are you not accepting the kindness?

590
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:15,290
I have served as an official for decades,

591
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:17,860
yet with one careless move...

592
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:21,210
I was framed by deceitful villains.

593
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:24,140
Mr. Lu,

594
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:26,690
there's no need for you to stay here.

595
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:29,210
You should return to the palace now,

596
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:30,540
and inform His Majesty

597
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:33,090
that I'm unjustly imprisoned.

598
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:35,050
I have no appetite for food now,

599
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:40,260
willing to die to uphold my honor

600
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,100
and to prove my innocence.

601
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:49,330
Chen Hao, don't force my hand.

602
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:52,210
If you confess now,

603
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,140
I can speak to His Majesty

604
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:56,570
to ensure your family's safety.

605
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:02,690
Ten years ago, you and Kong Lingfeng

606
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,740
guarded Qianya Pass
and Baizhang Pass respectively,

607
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:07,660
and conspired

608
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:12,450
to ambush my father's squad at Yi Pass.

609
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,100
Am I right?

610
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:17,860
The guarding was true,

611
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,050
but the rest...

612
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:22,850
Perhaps you've just imagined it

613
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:24,210
in your own delusion.

614
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:27,410
Mr. Lu.

615
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:30,330
I see you are young and reckless.

616
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:34,090
Just based on an unknown token,

617
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:37,020
you dare accuse me, an imperial official.

618
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:41,140
Do you know I've served for years

619
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:44,530
with disciples all over the realm?

620
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,900
How do you plan to handle this

621
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:49,620
and silence the world's voices?

622
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:03,450
Alright.

623
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,100
The disciples you mentioned...

624
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:10,730
Are they people
like Cui Jianye and Sun Yicheng?

625
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:13,860
Guess how long scholars like them

626
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,420
can endure under countless tortures.

627
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:25,100
As for whether His Majesty believes it,

628
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:27,810
the answer lies in the wine

629
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:32,140
you're drinking right now.

630
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,530
What do you mean by this?

631
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:44,010
This is the poisoned wine
bestowed by him.

632
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:47,900
His Majesty shows his mercy.

633
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:50,970
He spares your whole body.

634
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:56,970
You have no proof.

635
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:58,780
His Majesty wouldn't...

636
00:34:58,780 --> 00:34:59,770
Why wouldn't he?

637
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:02,050
How do you feel now?

638
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,220
Do you feel a sharp pain

639
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,660
in your stomach?

640
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,490
Mr. Lu.

641
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:20,380
You're as hateful as your father.

642
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:24,530
Do you know

643
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:28,730
how your father fell by my hand,

644
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:31,290
and how tragic it was?

645
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:33,980
Shut up!

646
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,010
Your father leading the squad

647
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:41,050
just entered Yi Pass.

648
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:45,460
I caught them off guard
and launched an attack.

649
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:50,460
Snow was swirling around,

650
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,780
and as my sword pierced his armor,

651
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:56,330
his blood splattered on my face.

652
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:58,570
On such a freezing day,

653
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:03,730
I never expected my face to feel so hot.

654
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:06,900
That's right.

655
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:12,420
When I saw him, I saw that look.

656
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,490
It's full of hatred,

657
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,140
full of anger.

658
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,380
But what does it matter?

659
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:24,780
He met his end at the hands of Beichu.

660
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,660
Stop it.

661
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,380
Come on then.

662
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:33,490
Victory or defeat defines history.

663
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:35,210
As a dying person,

664
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:37,140
taking down an imperial official

665
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:39,970
is still worthwhile.

666
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:41,290
Come on.

667
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,530
Killing a military leader

668
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,250
is enough to shake the army.

669
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,730
Why tarnish my father's honor?

670
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,460
Just killing one army commander

671
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:58,380
can cause disruption.

672
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:00,490
It's merely the army's morale.

673
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:05,970
But if a loyal official revered by Nanyue

674
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:07,620
were to betray the nation,

675
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:11,660
it would shake the people's faith.

676
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:12,980
This calculation

677
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:15,010
is clear to anyone.

678
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,220
Come on.

679
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:22,250
Come on!

680
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:26,290
That's not right.

681
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:29,940
Not everyone can calculate it.

682
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:32,460
For this matter,

683
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:34,810
even if you calculate it clearly,

684
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,250
there are countless people like me

685
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,630
who won't bother to calculate.

686
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,180
Any one of us

687
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:49,250
could easily defeat you.

688
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,490
Have you noted it all down?

689
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:56,620
Mr. Lu,

690
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:57,730
rest assured.

691
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,900
I've recorded every single word.

692
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,010
You, Lu Yun...

693
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,730
How dare you use me like this.

694
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,380
You're so deceitful.

695
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:14,620
Chen Hao,

696
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,170
you haven't fought for years.

697
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,730
Forgot that all is fair in war?

698
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:23,860
I just added

699
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:25,700
some fish gall to the wine.

700
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,010
It only causes pain, not death.

701
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:42,530
My father

702
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:44,860
sacrificed for the country.

703
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,540
He made great contributions.

704
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:47,650
Even in death,

705
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:48,940
he will be admired by all.

706
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:50,330
But you...

707
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:52,900
You're a traitor for personal gain.

708
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:54,970
With your schemes and tricks,

709
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:58,420
you'll be infamously remembered forever.

710
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,380
Open the door.

711
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:04,620
Mr. Lu.

712
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,820
The false decree just now

713
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:07,730
must be erased.

714
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:08,900
- Lu Yun!
- No need.

715
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:10,090
Yes.

716
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:17,010
Now you're a condemned prisoner.

717
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:21,250
His Majesty will eventually give you
this cup of wine.

718
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,730
Convey my decree,

719
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,860
the former General of the North Lu Jie,

720
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:29,420
brave and upright,

721
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:30,770
risked his life to serve,

722
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,580
and sacrificed for the nation.

723
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:34,060
He suffered injustice for ten years.

724
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,420
I feel sorry for him.

725
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,100
The thought of his tragedy

726
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,700
hurts my heart.

727
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:41,780
Posthumously promote him to Marquis of North

728
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,180
Posthumous title: Solemn.

729
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:57,020
(Lu Mansion)

730
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:06,820
(Late Master Lu, Solemn Marquis of North,
and Late Madam He, R.I.P.)

731
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:34,860
Father,

732
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,180
I have been unfilial.

733
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:45,940
It took me ten years to find the truth.

734
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:49,290
Your name is finally cleared.

735
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,620
Those who wronged you

736
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:57,330
have met their rightful punishment.

737
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:00,970
Your spirit in heaven

738
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:03,770
can finally rest in peace.

739
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:12,770
Mother,

740
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,220
I've finally fulfilled

741
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,050
what I promised back then.

742
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:25,050
How many nights have passed?

743
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:29,100
I can't bring you joy
