=Episode 8=

23
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:13,860
Your Highness.

24
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,180
Your Highness.

25
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,180
Xuechen,

26
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,300
it's been so long.

27
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,340
How have you been?

28
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,540
Thanks for asking, Your Highness.

29
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:34,980
All is well.

30
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,100
Was your hand wounded?

31
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,140
Who did it?

32
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,500
It's fine.

33
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,580
On my way back,

34
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,980
I ran into some scum.

35
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,740
I came back to see you first.

36
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,620
Calling me "Your Highness" is one thing.

37
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,860
Aren't you going to let me in to catch up?

38
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,300
I meant to.

39
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,820
Your Highness,

40
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,220
please.

41
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,340
That again, huh?

42
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,060
Your Highness.

43
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,540
And you're...?

44
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,180
Fan Qingchen from Shuozhou.

45
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,260
I didn't expect to see you here.

46
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,860
It's my honor, Your Highness.

47
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,460
A Fan from Shuozhou?

48
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,220
Why did you come to Yuezhou?

49
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,740
- I...
- You haven't come back for years.

50
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,100
I wonder what happened to you out there.

51
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:28,860
Let's go.

52
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:29,980
Sure.

53
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,700
Let's go.

54
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,820
You have a nice courtyard.

55
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,260
You must've put a lot of effort into it.

56
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,100
Thanks, Your Highness.

57
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,500
It borrowed the natural landscape

58
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,500
to create the view. That's it.

59
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,220
No one else is here.

60
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,140
Can you stop calling me "Your Highness"?

61
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,620
Back then,

62
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,220
I was young and ignorant.

63
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,460
You're way above me.

64
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,780
That's indisputable.

65
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,780
Although you see me as a brother,

66
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,020
I can only treat you as a prince,

67
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,780
so I can no longer call you by name.

68
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,060
You've changed so much.

69
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,780
You sound timid.

70
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,940
I feel as if I'm talking to an elder.

71
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,580
However people change,

72
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,220
they cannot be unfaithful

73
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,620
or betray their consciences.

74
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,340
Don't you agree?

75
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,060
What are you implying?

76
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,740
Please enlighten me.

77
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:52,980
Do you know

78
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:56,300
I was attacked by assassins on my way back?

79
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,700
They lay in ambush

80
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,860
at the secret path only the two of us knew.

81
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,980
I'm not an official

82
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,500
or in that circle.

83
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,700
Uncle never told me about your trip.

84
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,660
I didn't know

85
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,660
when you'd come back.

86
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,500
As for that secret path,

87
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,220
it's been ages.

88
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,620
Only the two of us knew it before,

89
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,500
but now, many people are taking it.

90
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,900
It's no longer a secret.

91
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,380
According to you,

92
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,580
was it a coincidence that Changyi

93
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,180
also knew it?

94
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,220
Prince Changyi?

95
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,500
You must be joking.

96
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,220
How would I know His Highness

97
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,260
found out about that path?

98
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,060
Your Highness,

99
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,820
you're being ambiguous.

100
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,460
Are you suspecting me?

101
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,180
What makes you think so?

102
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,620
I'd suspect

103
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,100
everyone in the world, but not you.

104
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,260
- Please.
- Please.

105
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,220
Drink up.

106
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,540
Jinchuan.

107
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:33,780
Miss...

108
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,900
Miss Luo, what brings you here?

109
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:41,700
Yun helped me in the West Market yesterday.

110
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,300
I want to brew some tea to thank him.

111
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,020
I see. Please be seated.

112
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,620
I'm leaving.

113
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:55,230
- I haven't welcomed you back.
- My Lady,

114
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,640
- Please forgive me.
- what are we here for?

115
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:58,820
Did you see

116
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,820
Fan Qingchen's attitude toward that man?

117
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,260
He was more than respectful.

118
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,580
That person must be powerful.

119
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,380
Fan Qingchen poses a huge threat.

120
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,540
If he comes at us,

121
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:16,260
we alone won't be his match.

122
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,900
But with this man's help,

123
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,580
maybe we can get rid of him.

124
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,860
That way,

125
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,260
I'll be able to take Lu Yun in

126
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,580
as my matrilocal husband.

127
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,660
Clever! Brilliant!

128
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:33,940
The dew.

129
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,860
You've been to the North a lot.

130
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,500
I trust that you drink their tea.

131
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:44,940
I bought this tea earlier today.

132
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,380
Do you like its taste?

133
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,380
(The North?)

134
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,260
(Is he Prince Hengyang?)

135
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,060
This tea is really good.

136
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,340
It's hard to get.

137
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,340
(What's she doing here?)

138
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,020
Miss Luo!

139
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,820
Why didn't you make a sound?

140
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,660
She is...?

141
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,900
I'm related to the Lu Clan,

142
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,500
Luo Lingyu.

143
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,180
Greetings, Prince Hengyang.

144
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,020
Do you know me?

145
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,940
I grew up in Shuozhou.

146
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,620
You've been guarding the border.

147
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,940
People trust you.

148
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,220
You're a household name.

149
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,620
His Highness and I are...

150
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,700
Are you also from Shuozhou?

151
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,500
What a nice surprise for us to meet here.

152
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,140
Come and sit with us.

153
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,340
Thanks, Your Highness.

154
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:44,980
Let's drink.

155
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,100
Why did you come to see me at this hour?

156
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,660
Is everything alright?

157
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,300
I haven't thanked you
for helping me yesterday.

158
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:06,500
Here's some dew I made.

159
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,380
Sorry for the trouble.

160
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,620
It's the least I can do.

161
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,620
No trouble at all.

162
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,900
I added some dew to the tea

163
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:29,980
for you two.

164
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,740
How does it taste?

165
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,900
No wonder it's so rich and refreshing.

166
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,820
It's all thanks to your dew.

167
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:41,780
However good it is, it needs the finest tea

168
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,660
to bring out the flavor.

169
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,780
When brewing it,

170
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,100
I found your tea quite familiar.

171
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,420
Was it a Shuozhou specialty?

172
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,700
(Did she also notice)

173
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,900
(Fan Qingchen was afraid of Prince Hengyang?)

174
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,140
Indeed.

175
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,020
I bought it earlier today

176
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,580
from the Fan Clan from Shuozhou.

177
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,870
You always drink tea from the North.

178
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,660
How's their tea compared with others'?

179
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,580
Fan's tea is always the best.

180
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,060
It's supplied to the army, too.

181
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,820
The price is also reasonable.

182
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,540
Fan Qingchen fawned on you just now.

183
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,900
You and his clan must be close.

184
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,660
Not exactly. We've only met a few times.

185
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,940
Why did you ask?

186
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,060
He'd like to use your relationship with them

187
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,020
to get their tea at a lower price.

188
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,180
(Using me to get close to him?)

189
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,540
(It's a win-win situation, right?)

190
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:54,660
That's right.

191
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,820
Using me to get a discount on tea?

192
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,780
Aren't you thick-skinned?

193
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:06,100
He's been of the frugal sort.

194
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,580
Money saved is money earned.

195
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,380
If you talk to the Fan Clan,

196
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,740
will they sell it cheaper?

197
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,420
They won't say no to me,

198
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,480
but I won't take their tea.

199
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,540
If you can't afford it,

200
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,780
don't drink it too much.

201
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,740
You're so upright, Your Highness.

202
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,420
I admire you for that.

203
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,820
I've brought over the dew.

204
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,220
Please continue with your conversation.

205
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,580
I'll leave you two alone.

206
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,140
Good day.

207
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,860
It's getting late.

208
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,420
You just came back, Your Highness.

209
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,140
You must have tons of things to attend to.

210
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,700
Feel free to leave.

211
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,620
We haven't finished this pot of tea.

212
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,020
Are you driving me out?

213
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,140
It's too expensive.

214
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,380
I'm poor.

215
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,980
Don't drink it up. Save some for me.

216
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,500
Fine. I'm off.

217
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,780
But think carefully

218
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,620
about who you ate and slept with years back

219
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,220
and who you grew up with.

220
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,620
Jinchuan.

221
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,340
Yes, Young Master.

222
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,860
Have Zhao Yuan watch Fan closely.

223
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,180
The link between him and Prince Hengyang

224
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,580
can't be as simple as he said.

225
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,300
They'll meet sooner or later.

226
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,620
Young Master,

227
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,980
are you suspecting Prince Hengyang?

228
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,820
If you ask me,

229
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,780
your response just now

230
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,380
was more of jealousy.

231
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,540
What nonsense!

232
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,900
Jealous of him? No way!

233
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,140
You acted like

234
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,140
the girls abandoned

235
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,060
by their heartless partners in stories.

236
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,100
Stop reading those stupid stories,

237
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,180
or you'll only be paid half.

238
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,820
No, Young Master.

239
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,340
Don't!

240
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,860
Did you sound anything out, My Lady?

241
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,740
Yes. His Highness said the Fan Clan was

242
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,820
an Imperial Merchant
and supplier to the army,

243
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,420
but they had little contact.

244
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,540
They weren't close.

245
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,580
If that's the case,

246
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,300
I have a chance to win.

247
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,780
Borrow Prince Hengyang's hand

248
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,180
to get rid of Fan Qingchen.

249
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,220
How are you going to borrow his hand?

250
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,700
It's best that I do him a favor

251
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,680
- to make him think I'm useful.
- Do him a favor?

252
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,300
In return, he'll have to

253
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,420
do me a favor, too.

254
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,380
But what can we do to help him?

255
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,940
It's still cold in spring.

256
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,500
The temperate drops at night.

257
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:14,980
Where's Hua?

258
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,740
Why isn't she back yet?

259
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,140
Did she go to play with Chang again?

260
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,620
Didn't they have a fight days ago?

261
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:27,060
Children fight a lot, My Lady.

262
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,060
They fight, then make up.

263
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,420
She goes to see him

264
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,980
in the afternoon these days

265
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:31,960
and runs around with him.

266
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:33,860
It's chilly today.

267
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:35,520
I'll get her back before it's too late.

268
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,380
Wait.

269
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,180
I've been too busy to be with her these days.

270
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,140
I'll go with you.

271
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,900
As far as I know,

272
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,460
she loves going to the lakeside.

273
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,660
I'll lead the way.

274
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:50,500
(Prince Hengyang's Mansion)

275
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,620
Your Highness.

276
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:01,260
Just now, I went to the Lu's

277
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,180
to see Lu Xuechen.

278
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,550
We haven't met for years.

279
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,300
Now, he sounds enigmatic.

280
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,700
He wasn't like that before.

281
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,200
I can't see through him.

282
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,660
Clearly, people change.

283
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,740
But not you, Your Highness.

284
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:14,940
You're who you are.

285
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,420
He said he and Changyi weren't close

286
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,980
but talked vaguely.

287
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,580
He must've been hiding something,

288
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,080
or he wouldn't have been like that.

289
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,220
Could it be

290
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:31,260
that he and Changyi were in cahoots?

291
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,100
If so, they must've been

292
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,340
behind the assassination.

293
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:41,900
Maybe not.

294
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,820
Perhaps the two of them

295
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,460
often chat

296
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,980
and play polo

297
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:50,380
and board games like normal friends.

298
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:53,820
But Mr. Kong said few knew that secret path.

299
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,860
And who else could've known

300
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,300
when you'd return to Yuezhou?

301
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,500
Didn't you also know the date

302
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,580
and that path?

303
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,860
Mr. Kong doesn't know Lu Yun.

304
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,780
He's not completely trustworthy.

305
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,260
Your Highness, I...

306
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,750
How could I be the same as them?

307
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,420
I'm not sure about others,

308
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,220
but I, Huo Dao, trust you.

309
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,540
Have Lu Yun checked out.

310
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,660
Find evidence to prove

311
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,100
whether or not

312
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,460
he's guilty.

313
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,380
Leave my sister alone!

314
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,340
- Shut up!
- Why?

315
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,560
- Chang.
- Let my cricket go!

316
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,550
Chang!

317
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,960
- That boy.
- Shut up!

318
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,680
- He darts away after school.
- I hate you!

319
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,900
- Chang!
- Pay for my cricket!

320
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,380
Pay for my cricket!

321
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,540
Pay for my cricket!

322
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,580
You spat all over my face!

323
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,580
Chang, Hua!

324
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,780
You badmouthed my sister.

325
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,100
Apologize now, Lu Chang!

326
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,080
- You hear me?
- No way!

327
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,900
- Leave my sister alone!
- Chang!

328
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:53,860
Why?

329
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:54,980
It's your fault!

330
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:55,980
Enough, you two.

331
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,340
Stop! Break it off!

332
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,780
Stop! That's enough!

333
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,860
I said stop!

334
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,780
You're a boy, Chang. Stop!

335
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,180
Be the bigger person.

336
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,660
Enough is enough.

337
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:09,620
Chang!

338
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:15,980
Xian!

339
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,700
- Brother Xian! Brother Xian!
- Help!

340
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,940
Somebody help!

341
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:20,940
- Help!
- Help us!

342
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:21,860
That's Hua's voice!

343
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,820
- Help!
- Somebody help!

344
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,580
Help!

345
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,740
Brother Xian!

346
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,460
- Help!
- Help us!

347
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,500
- Hua!
- Sister!

348
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,660
- What happened?
- Miss Hua!

349
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,140
- Chang!
- Lingyu!

350
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,180
Xian can't swim. What to do?

351
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,780
Help!

352
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,180
Somebody help!

353
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:04,660
Xian!

354
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,540
- Xian, are you alright?
- Brother Xian!

355
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,010
- Are you alright, My Lady?
- Sister.

356
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,980
- My Lady.
- Who's shouting in my house?

357
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,580
The First Madam, My Lady!

358
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,420
Hua can't be seen here. Go now.

359
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,700
Get them out of here. Go!

360
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,060
- Sister!
- Go!

361
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:21,900
- Young Master Xian!

362
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,580
Wake up, please!

363
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,780
You again, Miss Luo.

364
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,540
Xian!

365
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:29,860
Xian!

366
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,460
Xian, can you hear me?

367
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,900
Come here. Take him to his room!

368
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,460
Easy.

369
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:36,860
Easy.

370
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,620
Go get a physician!

371
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,580
- Hurry!
- Yes.

372
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:42,980
Luo Lingyu,

373
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,260
if anything happens to my son,

374
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,900
you're dead!

375
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,380
Aunt, I'll look after Xian.

376
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:32,260
The physician said he choked on water,

377
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,620
but he'd be fine.

378
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,060
I know you're worried about him,

379
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,940
but if you collapse,

380
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,620
he'll blame himself when he wakes up.

381
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,140
Thank you.

382
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,660
You're so sweet.

383
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,020
It was all Luo Lingyu's fault.

384
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,020
Xian has always been kind to her.

385
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,140
How could she be so evil?

386
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,980
My son is too kind and soft.

387
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,380
Even if he lets her go,

388
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,540
I won't.

389
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:09,660
Please, Xian.

390
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,180
Please get well soon.

391
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,860
May heaven bless him.

392
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,660
May Young Master Xian be fine

393
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,220
and get through this.

394
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,260
Sister!

395
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,900
It was all my fault, Sister!

396
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,740
My Lady...

397
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,980
Why the worried look?

398
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,980
Go back before others see you here.

399
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,540
Sister, you look so pale.

400
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,620
Lingxi made you ginger soup.

401
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,900
Have some to warm your body.

402
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,220
- I'm fine.
- It's still cold in spring.

403
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,540
Can't you see you're soaking wet?

404
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,020
Why did you come to kneel in the Sutra Hall?

405
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,380
What if

406
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,220
you fall sick?

407
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,540
I won't.

408
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,300
I'll tell the First Madam

409
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,900
that I made Xian fall into the water,

410
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:12,900
not you.

411
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,740
Don't act on impulse.

412
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,620
When Fan Qingchen came earlier,

413
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,220
the First Madam was unhappy with me.

414
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,820
If she gets the goods on us,

415
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,420
she'll kick us out for sure.

416
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,780
We'll be in grave danger.

417
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,380
Besides,

418
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,700
no one in the Luo Clan would

419
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,100
suffer in silence for things they didn't do.

420
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:34,620
Do you mean it wasn't an accident?

421
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,060
The pebble stinks.

422
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,100
The scent of lubricant.

423
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,100
Someone smeared

424
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,380
lubricant on the pebbles by the water

425
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,620
to make others fall.

426
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:56,020
How can we find this person?

427
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,540
Its strong smell

428
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:58,980
can't be washed away.

429
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,380
Noted, My Lady.

430
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:02,740
I know what to do.

431
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,380
You can't keep wearing wet clothes.

432
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,980
Why not get changed and come back?

433
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,720
Young Master Xian is in a critical situation.

434
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,660
Praying for him is our only chance

435
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,540
to pull through.

436
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,380
Also, the more I suffer,

437
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,580
the less others talk,

438
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,940
and the less the First Madam hates us.

439
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,460
Listen, take everything away.

440
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,580
- Let's go, Miss Hua.
- No!

441
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,100
Be good, please.

442
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:32,940
Listen to her.

443
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:33,800
- Sister.
- Be good.

444
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,800
- Let's go.
- Go ahead.

445
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,460
Come on.

446
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,780
Lingxi,

447
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,740
Sister is suffering because of me.

448
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,980
Will she hate me?

449
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,300
Of course not.

450
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,580
You're the last person

451
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,140
she'll hate.

452
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:01,740
Lingxi, she won't hold on for too long.

453
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,820
Take the meal box.

454
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,660
I... I'm going to see Aunt Ying.

455
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,180
Slow down, Miss Hua!

456
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,580
Soon after we parted,

457
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,180
she stirred up such huge trouble.

458
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,540
Unbelievable.

459
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,180
I asked around. No one knew

460
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,810
how Young Master Xian fell into the water.

461
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,180
The First Madam was furious.

462
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:18,140
Hadn't Miss Luo gone to pray
in the Sutra Hall,

463
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,700
the First Madam would've lashed out.

464
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,660
That girl acted fast.

465
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,500
What to do?

466
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,780
Can we ask Aunt Ying for help?

467
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,500
I'm sure she'll come back.

468
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,660
Listen to me, please.

469
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,800
They said when traveling, she and her friends

470
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,500
could be anywhere.

471
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,580
It'd take time to find her.

472
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,010
No one would know when she'd be back.

473
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:33,540
She could be out for days.

474
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,980
Without her, we can't help Sister.

475
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,220
What will happen to her?

476
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,460
I'll go with or without you!

477
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,620
Wait, Miss Hua!

478
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:41,860
You're too young.

479
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,540
It's late at night.

480
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,700
You can't go out alone.

481
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,940
Yun!

482
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:51,420
Could you please help my sister, Yun?

483
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,220
I'm begging you!

484
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:57,220
She didn't make Xian fall into the water,

485
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:01,780
but his mother insisted that she did it.

486
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:04,780
I swear it had nothing to do with her.

487
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,820
How can you be so sure?

488
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,340
Were you also there?

489
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,180
I...

490
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,180
I...

491
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:15,780
Sister asked me to keep it secret.

492
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,380
Listen to me,

493
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,100
if you want to help her,

494
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,380
tell me everything now.

495
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:32,860
Just now...

496
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:36,300
Chang and I were playing by the water...

497
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,500
I've never prayed to anyone before.

498
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,380
I've come

499
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,820
this far all on my own.

500
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:06,340
I've never prayed to anyone before.

501
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,740
I've come

502
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:12,380
this far all on my own.

503
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,900
I've been walking on thin ice

504
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,580
with a clear conscience.

505
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,700
If heaven can hear people's prayers,

506
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,780
please help Young Master Xian wake up soon.

507
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,340
You'd rather pray to heaven

508
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,820
than come to me for help.

509
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,060
I've never prayed to anyone before.

510
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:51,900
I've come

511
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,380
this far all on my own.

512
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,020
I've been walking on thin ice

513
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,700
with a clear conscience.

514
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:00,500
If heaven can hear people's prayers...

515
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,340
It's raining outside.

516
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,700
You kneel in wet clothes with the door open.

517
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,540
You think the ruse of self-injury will work?

518
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,860
It might not work on you,

519
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,500
but it might work on others.

520
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,500
Even if no one sees me kneeling here,

521
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,100
heaven knows.

522
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,940
It knows how sincere I am.

523
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,540
(How tough.)

524
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,300
(Let her be.)

525
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:32,740
I've never prayed to anyone before.

526
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,900
I've come

527
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:36,860
this far...

528
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,180
all on my own.

529
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,460
I've been walking on thin ice

530
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,980
with a clear conscience.

531
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,100
If heaven

532
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,700
can hear people's prayers,

533
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:54,900
please help Young Master Xian wake up soon.

534
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:00,100
I've never prayed to anyone before.

535
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,300
I've come

536
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,900
this far all on my own.

537
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,340
I've been walking on thin ice

538
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,420
with

539
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,260
a clear conscience.

540
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,980

00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,460
Put me down!

560
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:41,780
Let's go.

561
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,300
You have to be alive

562
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,540
to atone for your sins.

563
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,620
If anything happens to you,

564
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,100
who will look after your sister?

565
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,940
Young Master Xian is still in a coma.

566
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,440
I can't leave now.

567
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:09,700
♪I wrote down as much as I remembered♪

00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:15,900

♪The pain of parting drifts with the wind♪

575
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,300
and having a good sleep.

576
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,780
Lucky for you

577
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,220

00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,620
I underestimated you.

(Is Miss Luo's guess right?)

588
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,300
Young Master Xian.

589
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,580
You can't die. Young Master Xian!

590
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:43,900
How's Young Master Xian?

591
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,100
Relax. He's stable now.

592
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,340
That's good.

593
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,410
Your fever is reducing.

594
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,620
They're new. I've never worn them.

595
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,180
You can't be in wet clothes all night.

596
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,100
(Why is he helping me all of a sudden?)

597
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,380
(Why is he so kind?)

598
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:06,140
Are you done, Miss Luo?

599
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,340
Yes, I am.

600
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:18,940
I didn't want you to catch a cold
in wet clothes

601
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,540
and then give it to me.

602
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:22,780
Don't think too much.

603
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,060
Why would I?

604
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,660
I'm simply wearing your clothes.

605
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,420
It's nothing at all.

606
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,020
Besides,

607
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:32,140
if another man gave me

608
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,370
his clothes,

609
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,780
I'd also put them on instantly.

610
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:43,300
Come in with the decoction.

611
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:47,020
You knew as soon as I came, sir.

612
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,060
It's as if we're of one heart.

613
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,620
You're awake, Miss Luo.

614
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,300
When you fainted, you didn't see

615
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,280
- how he...
- Shut up!

616
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,340
Here you go.

617
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,020
I'll take my leave.

618
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:15,260
(Is he going to feed me?)

619
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:33,980
Take it,

620
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,750
or do you want me to feed you?

621
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:39,980
No, thanks.

622
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:42,740
Just now, I got up too quickly

623
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:44,980
and felt dizzy.

624
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,620
If you stare at me,

625
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,780
I can't take the decoction.

626
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,780
In all those stories,

627
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,900
couples have to

628
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,380
go through tons of hardships

629
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,340
before they find happiness.

630
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,020
If that's the case,

631
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:16,020
Young Master and Miss Luo

632
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,460
will soon be together.

633
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,420
What's on your mind?

634
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,980
Thanks for your help today.

635
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:40,700
Young Master Xian hasn't woken up.

636
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,460
If others see I'm not in the Sutra Hall,

637
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:46,100
I'll be in bigger trouble tomorrow.

638
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,500
You're clever when dealing with me.

639
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,780
Why are you being so rigid now?

640
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,340
Don't worry.

641
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,300
Someone else is there as you.

642
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,740
You may go back to kneel before dawn.

643
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:05,640
- But...
- Hua'll be fine.

644
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,740
I'll keep everything secret.

645
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,540
It's fine if this matter can be solved.

646
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,620
But if not,

647
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,980
I'll take full responsibility.

648
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,220
What about Xian?

649
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,060
What will you do

650
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,100
once he wakes up?

651
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:25,700
It's too much to ask,

652
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:29,380
but once he wakes up, could you

653
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,380
relay a message to him

654
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:33,500
not to tell on Hua?

655
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,500
I'll pay you the highest postage

656
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,300
if you help me.

657
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:41,460
Postage?

658
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:42,660
Pay me money?

659
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,180
Do you think I'm your servant?

660
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,850
Do I look like I need money?

661
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,100
(Is it free?)

662
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:53,460
(Looks like I was wrong about him.)

663
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,460
(He really is a good man.)

664
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,020
50 taels.

665
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,660
No bargain.

666
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,740
50 taels for a message?

667
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,060
You're ripping me off.

668
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:07,220
That's way too much.

669
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:09,860
Even if I add up

670
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:10,900
all my properties,

671
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,580
they aren't worth that much.

672
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:13,740
I vaguely remember

673
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,860
that when you set up

674
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,740
tea tables in the Xuewu Courtyard earlier,

675
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,700
you made a killing.

676
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,340
It wasn't that much.

677
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,780
It's fine. Put it on credit then.

678
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,220
You've owed me a lot already.

679
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,580
There's no rush to pay me back.

680
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,590
Other than today's favor,

681
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,060
what do I owe you for?

682
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:30,900
Think hard.

683
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:32,780
The room is all yours.

684
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:35,500
I've never met

685
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,460
such a moody man in the entire world.

686
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:48,820
You're back, sir.

687
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:51,740
How did it go? Did you feed her?

688
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:52,780
No.

689
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,840
That's fine.

690
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:56,140
Did you show you cared about her?

691
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,220
Also no.

692
00:37:58,820 --> 00:37:59,660
What?

693
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,540
Did you at least wipe away her sweat?

694
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:05,980
Still no?

695
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,060
Why would I do such things?

696
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,300
Oh, Young Master,

697
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,900
when will you

698
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,820
and Miss Luo be happily together?

699
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:16,260
I just want a happy ending
like those of the stories.

700
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,580
Why is it so hard to achieve?

701
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:18,820
Boring.

702
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,420
Stop talking, or yap

703
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,220
in Grandmother's empty bird cage tomorrow.

704
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,060
Fine, I will.

705
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:27,780
You're mean.

706
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,660
Miss Luo, your knees hurt.

707
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,300
Take your time. No rush.

708
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,620
Once this matter ends,

709
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,390
- I'll thank you...
- Did Xian take his medicine?

710
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,100
Are the prescribed herbs not working?

711
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,660
- Let's go. Go!
- Goodness!

712
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:17,580
Yun.

713
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:27,780
Aunt.

714
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:30,460
It really is you.

715
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,820
Why are you in the garden so early?

716
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,500
To see flowers.

717
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,340
- That's it.
- Yes, that's right.

718
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,580
Flowers are pretty, aren't they?

719
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:41,940
Yes, right.

720
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:42,940
Good morning, Aunt.

721
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,380
You're up early as well.

722
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,180
Xian had a bad dream.

723
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:47,940
I'm going to check on him.

724
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,380
Young Master Xian had a bad dream?

725
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,980
That's serious. You should go, huh?

726
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:02,580
It's urgent.

727
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:06,620
Move!

728
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,060
Yes.

729
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,020
Are you

730
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,660
holding someone?

731
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,540
Madam.

732
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:21,300
Physician Xue came to reexamine your son.

733
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,180
He's right outside.

734
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,260
You may leave.

735
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,420
- Yes.
- Did you...

736
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,060
come here

737
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:30,300
so early for a tryst with a girl?

738
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,660
In all of Yuezhou,

739
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:34,580
no one else

740
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:36,460
can be... as shameless as you!

741
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:37,900
- Yes.
- Get her out now.

742
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,380
- You hear me?
- Yes, sure, sure.

743
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,100
Everyone's a handful.

744
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,060
Aunt, watch your step.

745
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:44,660
Get her out immediately!

746
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,740
Xian hasn't woken up yet.

747
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,860
Be very careful with what you say.

748
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,500
Don't annoy my aunt.

749
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,220
My Lady,

750
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:10,460
is Young Master Yun with Miss Luo?

751
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:18,900
I...

752
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:21,600
I'm going to check on Xian, too.

753
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:24,780
The Sutra Hall is near.

754
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,620
You may go there yourself.

755
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,140
Sure.

756
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,140
Let's go.

757
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,020
Young Master!

758
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,300
That way.

759
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:38,260
- I...
- I...

760
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,020
Didn't they say

761
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:55,100
she was praying all night in the Sutra Hall?

762
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,700
How come Miss Luo is here?

763
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:01,900
Physician Xian, why hasn't Xian woken up?

764
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:03,980
Will he suffer permanent damage?

765
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:07,260
Will he remain unconscious?

766
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,140
You've asked me three times

767
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:12,140
within an incense stick's time.

768
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:13,780
Based on his condition,

769
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:16,100
wait two more hours and he'll

770
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,420
wake up.

771
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,660
Young Master Xian is fine.

772
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:23,940
If you two are still worried,

773
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,460
I can make his condition sound

774
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:26,820
as serious as you want.

775
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:30,300
- Examine him again...
- Aunt.

776
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,340
Miss Liu.

777
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:33,660
- Young Master Yun.
- Check him.

778
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,660
You two may talk, Madam.

779
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:39,860
I'll have the kitchen decoct the herbs.

780
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,340
- See you.
- Wait, no...

781
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:44,140
Young Master Yun.

782
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:58,980
When will you punish the culprit

783
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:00,540
who made Xian fall into the water?

784
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:02,740
- The culprit?
- Last night,

785
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:03,780
after Miss Luo saved Xian,

786
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:05,140
she caught a cold and fever.

787
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:08,100
If you wait until Xian wakes up,

788
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,220
by the time he does, she's collapsed.

789
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:11,660
I almost forgot about her.

790
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:13,700
She only knelt for one night.

791
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,460
She can handle it.

792
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:17,260
Ten of her combined

793
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:18,580
aren't as important as my son.

794
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:21,860
Aunt, Physician Xue said he'd be fine,

795
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:23,740
but if there's any permanent damage,

796
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:25,500
he'll suffer for the rest of his life.

797
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,340
We cannot let Luo Lingyu go easily!

798
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:28,740
Miss Liu, don't forget

799
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:30,740
she got Xian out of the water.

800
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:32,540
Yun, you're too kind

801
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:33,700
to see through her trick.

802
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:34,980
That girl was afraid

803
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:37,020
that if something worse happened to Xian,

804
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:38,180
she'd be blamed.

805
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:40,580
That's why she jumped off to help him.

806
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:42,100
- Miss Liu...
- Enough!

807
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:43,340
Be quiet.

808
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:45,140
Don't disturb my son.

809
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:47,420
Go.

810
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,990
Take Miss Luo to the front hall
for questioning.

811
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:51,300
Yes.

812
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:57,460
Now that there are doubts,

813
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:58,900
investigation is necessary.

814
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:01,540
If she's proven innocent,

815
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:04,340
I'll thank her for saving my son.

816
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:11,060
But if she's proven guilty,

817
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:12,780
I'll show no mercy to her!
