=Episode 5=

23
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,040
I wanted to choose a jade bonsai.

24
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,830
But my lord scolded me.

25
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,310
He said it wouldn't show his sincerity.

26
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,950
So he chose this handmade painting.

27
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,040
If you had brought the jade bonsai,

28
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,000
my sister would have been happier.

29
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,640
Sister!

30
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,630
Kids do talk nonsense.

31
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,630
Of course, I

32
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:08,440
prefer the Third Young Master's
handmade painting.

33
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:09,750
I see.

34
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,110
Isn't this painting of you, sister?

35
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,750
Look at her clothes,

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,840
hairpin,

37
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,110
and hairstyle.

38
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,800
And she's doing your favorite thing,

39
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,640
fishing.

40
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,310
No, no, no.

41
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,310
Miss Luo,

42
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,510
Miss Luo.

43
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,630
Please, don't overthink.

44
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,240
My lord had no intention to offend you.

45
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,440
I see.

46
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,670
It's a matter of feelings.

47
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,470
He must think of me day and night.

48
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,880
That's why we are so connected.

49
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,830
Right, right, who would disagree?

50
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,880
My lord

51
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,750
thinks of you every single day.

52
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,030
How does that saying go?

53
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,190
A day apart feels like three years.

54
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:02,830
Please

55
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,910
inform your lord back,

56
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:08,030
that I am quite fond of it.

57
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:11,190
Alright, I take my leave now.

58
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,960
See? He's playing hard to get.

59
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:22,550
We need that fan as bait

60
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,830
to help reveal his true feelings.

61
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,910
I gave him something,
and now he gives back.

62
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,360
With this back and forth,

63
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,960
feelings are revealed.

64
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,670
Even if he hides his thoughts deeply,

65
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,960
he is not as skillful as you.

66
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:47,000
Why did you give her that painting?

67
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,390
It was you who asked me

68
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,460
to give something trivial.

69
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:52,670
I see.

70
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,600
That is why I took it.

71
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,750
You often doodle in your free time,

72
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,160
how would I know
that painting couldn't be given?

73
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,670
Besides, if you don't like Miss Luo,

74
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,910
why paint her?

75
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,360
Isn't this painting of you, sister?

76
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,730
Look at her clothes,

77
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,590
hairpin,

78
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,510
and hairstyle.

79
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,230
You...

80
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,070
I saw she was
still decorating the courtyard.

81
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,440
Why don't we
send two more?

82
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,510
- How dare you!
-Well...

83
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,880
Trying to provoke me, huh?

84
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,640
You ungrateful fool!

85
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,230
Feeling bold now, are you?

86
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,070
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

87
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,600
- I'll give you a lesson!
- No!

88
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,300
(Qing Courtyard)

89
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,350
My lord.

90
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,180
(Invitation)

91
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,200
What does your new master, Miss Luo,

92
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,200
want from you now?

93
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,200
It's not her.

94
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,950
(Invitation) Miss Liu invites you
for a morning boat ride tomorrow.

95
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,760
Miss Jiang asks you
to admire the flowers at tomorrow noon.

96
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,200
Miss Zhu invites you
for dinner tomorrow.

97
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,480
Also, there is Miss Han,

98
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,390
(Invitation) Miss Xu, Miss Chen,

99
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:07,920
and so on.

100
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,110
They all said

101
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,950
you must treat them equally.

102
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,440
I'm not going.

103
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,510
Alright, I'll decline them all.

104
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:21,670
I'm going now.

105
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,900
(Xuewu Courtyard)

106
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,320
Sister, we're making
so many Tongcao flowers.

107
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,320
Are we selling them for money?

108
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,350
These flowers

109
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,510
may make some money at first.

110
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,000
But once the novelty fades,

111
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,200
they might not earn much.

112
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:58,630
But,

113
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,640
taking another way,

114
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,510
like the fan

115
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,110
I gave the Third Young Master recently.

116
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:07,350
Maybe it will be more effective.

117
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,790
It may work elsewhere.

118
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,480
Real feelings are priceless.

119
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,550
The Third Young Master

120
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,550
is making it hard for me and the ladies

121
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,390
to get along.

122
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,880
Now we turn these scraps into treasures.

123
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,280
And in the future?

124
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,720
How do we solve it later?

125
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,160
To stay in this household

126
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,140
and win the Third Young Master's heart,

127
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,760
you must deal with those ladies.

128
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,640
You are right.

129
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:35,110
But how do we make it?

130
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,350
You're dressed so brightly today.

131
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,040
I think yours looks good too.

132
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,040
Today, we're here to seek beauty.

133
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,320
We mustn't disturb the lord's peace.

134
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,440
Seeking beauty is finding nature's charm.

135
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:50,670
Speak of the devils,

136
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:51,950
and they shall appear.

137
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:53,390
Nanny said

138
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,480
we must submit our work tomorrow.

139
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,790
Don't make it too messy

140
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,550
or too perfect.

141
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,110
Sister.

142
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,640
Why did Miss Chen say,

143
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,670
don't make it perfect?

144
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,600
One should never give up,

145
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,160
that applies to paintings too.

146
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,790
The lords of this house

147
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,600
have learned painting since childhood.

148
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,950
If the ladies

149
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,450
painted better than them
in just a few days,

150
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,640
where would the lords' pride go?

151
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,920
But Hua needn't worry.

152
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,440
Just do whatever you wish.

153
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,040
No need for excuses.

154
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,000
Don't worry about others' opinions.

155
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,210
The same goes for you.

156
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,600
We've been at the Lu Mansion
for days.

157
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,830
Why hasn't the Lu family mentioned

158
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:37,920
anything about your skills?

159
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:41,070
I recently got close
with the Third Young Master,

160
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:44,110
and stirred some

161
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,280
jealousy and fear.

162
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,000
My lady, do you think they came

163
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,640
to see the Third Young Master?

164
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,200
Then let them feast their eyes.

165
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,700
(Qing Courtyard)

166
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:06,620
(Qing Courtyard)

167
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:11,510
Third Young Master!

168
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,110
Third Young Master!

169
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,950
What a coincidence.

170
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,680
- Third Young Master.
- Are you going out too?

171
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,710
- Third Young Master.
- Sorry, Brother Xuechen.

172
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,130
I was searching for beauty nearby
with the ladies.

173
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,230
We didn't mean to intrude.

174
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:32,590
That's fine.

175
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,170
I'm just checking on
the door's sturdiness.

176
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:39,630
Please, carry on.

177
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:41,750
Third Young Master!

178
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,030
My lord, why have you returned?

179
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,200
Aren't you meeting Prince Changyi?

180
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,280
They are everywhere.

181
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,590
There's no chance to leave.

182
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,550
Shall we still meet Prince Changyi?

183
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,880
Inform Aman to meet me
at the Lake Pavilion tonight.

184
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,830
Otherwise, it will be troublesome.

185
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:06,000
Well, your actions are indeed
too frivolous.

186
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,550
Why could Luo Lingyu
pester Third Young Master

187
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,000
and he just let her?

188
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,350
Even that girl from Xuewu Courtyard
shows her respect.

189
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,670
Yet I have to face rejection.

190
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,160
Right.

191
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,800
Right?

192
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:18,910
What should we do now?

193
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,280
Ladies.

194
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,590
If you're seeking beauty,

195
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:30,400
why not visit my Xuewu Courtyard?

196
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,230
What's so special
about your little shabby courtyard?

197
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,230
Don't end up finding no beauty

198
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,710
and just gathering dust instead.

199
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:46,550
I know you all cherish flowers,

200
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,030
but these magnolia flowers

201
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,320
bloom inside the courtyard,

202
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,670
and can't be seen clearly from outside.

203
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,280
Why not settle for less,

204
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,200
and come and visit my courtyard?

205
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,080
We can enjoy tea

206
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,350
and admire flowers and people,

207
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,000
seeking beauty,

208
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,520
wouldn't that be delightful?

209
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:09,790
Xuewu Courtyard...

210
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:12,400
Shall we go then?

211
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,240
It sounds appealing,

212
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,390
but I won't go.

213
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,470
Look, look there.

214
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,200
Look, it's so beautiful.

215
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,230
Look at that.

216
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,150
Yes, indeed.

217
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,320
Impressive.

218
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,600
That is actually decent.

219
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,440
Yes, indeed.

220
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,590
- Great.
- So intriguing.

221
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:36,710
See how it's arranged.

222
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,870
Look at these lotus flowers...

223
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,550
- Great.
- This is unique.

224
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,670
Right.

225
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,080
She truly has skills.

226
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,400
These seats, from near to far,

227
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,080
offer different views.

228
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,670
You may choose freely.

229
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,150
These are third-class seats,

230
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,790
a good place to cool off.

231
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,400
The tree and garden views
are all visible.

232
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,610
Perfect for a short rest.

233
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,520
These are second-class seats,

234
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,840
with no obstructions around.

235
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,080
The view is expansive.

236
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,590
You may seek beauty here freely.

237
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,510
Lastly,

238
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:11,760
allow me to introduce to you all

239
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,350
the first-class seats.

240
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,940
(Graceful Orchids and Herbs) These are...

241
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,060
Perfect for enjoying the scenery
from above.

242
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,760
The entire Xuewu Courtyard
and nearby beauty

243
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,640
- are within view.
- Look!

244
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:25,320
You can see any scenery you like.

245
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,120
That is great.

246
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,200
We can always wait for
Third Young Master here.

247
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,110
You're giving us so much benefit freely.

248
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,880
Who knows if you have hidden motives?

249
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:37,030
That's a fair point.

250
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:38,190
Well...

251
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,640
In that case,

252
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:42,400
I will ask you for some money.

253
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,840
Think of it as
paying for beauty-seeking.

254
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:46,960
Paying for beauty-seeking?

255
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,400
From third-class seats
to first-class seats,

256
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:50,880
each day costs

257
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:53,790
one hundred, two hundred,
and three hundred copper coins.

258
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,910
Does this work for you?

259
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,280
This seems good.

260
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,230
I think so too.

261
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:59,430
I think we can see
Third Young Master's courtyard there.

262
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,550
I want the highest one.

263
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,350
Miss Liu, 300 copper coins,
please enter.

264
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,420
I want a second-class seat.

265
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,710
Me too.

266
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:08,640
I want one too.

267
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,700
I want a first-class seat.

268
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:10,710
A second-class seat.

269
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:11,790
Me too.

270
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:14,140
- Here, 200 copper coins.
- This is truly noisy and chaotic.

271
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,320
Ladies, we...

272
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,440
This place is tranquil.

273
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,080
There is a subtle charm here.

274
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,040
This spot is good.

275
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,960
Let's sit here for a while.

276
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,310
You sit here, sit here.

277
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,190
Miss Luo.

278
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,550
My lady only needs a third-class seat.

279
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:28,990
Alright.

280
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,520
Miss Chen, please sit.

281
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,510
Ladies.

282
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,150
Please don't run or jump.

283
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,320
Keep your voices down.

284
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,620
Don't crowd together.

285
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,470
Sister.

286
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,080
Ladies, please lower your voices.

287
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,590
If you make too much noise,

288
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:48,840
the beauty won't show up.

289
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,840
My lady,

290
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,960
this is the Tongcao flower.

291
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,110
Tongcao flower?

292
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,710
It's quite beautiful.

293
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,870
I want one too.

294
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,470
- Here you go.
- It is nice.

295
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,840
Get me one too.

296
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,510
Look at this.

297
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,110
Three hundred.

298
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,710
Six hundred.

299
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,470
Nine hundred copper coins.

300
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,400
Sister. Here's your flower.

301
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,240
Thank you.

302
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,510
Jinchuan.

303
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,710
Go check if they are gone.

304
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,640
How is it? Did you see them?

305
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:51,510
Yes, I saw them.

306
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,040
Which direction?

307
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,840
All directions.

308
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,350
All directions?

309
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:05,510
Come, have some tea.

310
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,790
Come out already.

311
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,140
(Graceful Orchids and Herbs)

312
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,280
There comes the beauty!

313
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:18,750
The beauty...

314
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,470
Third Young Master!

315
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,760
Third Young Master, look here!

316
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,760
Look at me.

317
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:48,520
Luo Lingyu!

318
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,670
You've truly done a good deed.

319
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:55,390
The beauty...

320
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,470
He's gone back.

321
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,000
The beauty has left.

322
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,520
I thought staying still

323
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,320
would resolve this quietly,

324
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,880
but she went even further

325
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,910
and did such absurdity!

326
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,470
I underestimated Luo Lingyu.

327
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:14,080
But why do I feel,

328
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:16,350
she pesters you

329
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,110
as if she is deeply in love with you,

330
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,790
yet she still finds joy in sharing.

331
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,440
She truly has the demeanor
of the lady of the family.

332
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,800
Brilliant!

333
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,590
My lady, don't you want to marry
Third Young Master?

334
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,590
Why invite the ladies in

335
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,280
and make it easy for them
to see him?

336
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,230
It is better to guide than block.

337
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,200
If they wish to look,

338
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,590
let them look.

339
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,280
It doesn't bother me

340
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,880
and earns goodwill

341
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,440
and ease tensions,

342
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,000
why not?

343
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,510
Makes sense.

344
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,030
Miss Chen,

345
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,400
this is the tea we brewed.

346
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,520
Qiuyue, the fan.

347
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,960
Miss Luo, when you arrived,

348
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,350
you were bold, vibrant,

349
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,400
and unstoppable,

350
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,710
I thought that was all of you.

351
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,320
But now, I don't think I know you.

352
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,670
Miss Chen, what makes you say that?

353
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,880
I have always been this way.

354
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,790
Just a few days ago,

355
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,110
you clearly wanted to get closer to Xuechen,

356
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:32,320
wanting to know him better.

357
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,910
But your actions today

358
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,640
seem to go against your initial intent.

359
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,080
I wondered what it was about.

360
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,320
Just see it as my love for sharing.

361
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,520
I've heard Xuewu Courtyard

362
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,280
has always been favored by many sisters.

363
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,190
Since I've acquired this courtyard,

364
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:52,590
naturally, I wish to benefit everyone.

365
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,320
Miss Luo,

366
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,030
are you truly thinking this way,

367
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,710
or are you opposing Brother Xuechen
deliberately,

368
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,470
hoping to catch his attention?

369
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,400
I have no way of knowing,

370
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:08,400
but regardless of your true intentions,

371
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,710
he won't feel joy from this matter.

372
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,160
Does others' happiness

373
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,920
have anything to do with me?

374
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:27,710
It seems I don't connect with you.

375
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,350
I'll take my leave then.

376
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:32,560
Qiuyue, let's head back.

377
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,830
You see,

378
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,350
not every lady
appreciates your kindness.

379
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,400
Moreover, you accepted their money,

380
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,110
so your ties with them are financial.

381
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,640
It's not about affection.

382
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:55,920
Money and affection

383
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:57,590
are not mutually exclusive.

384
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,430
Moreover, when interests align,

385
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,560
they can form instantly,

386
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,560
or collapse in a moment.

387
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,400
Naturally, more is better.

388
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,030
But when it comes to affection,

389
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,790
it should flow like a gentle stream.

390
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,710
It's about sincerity, not settling for less.

391
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:17,830
Sincerity should be for the worthy.

392
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,760
Then, whom do you think

393
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:22,950
is worthy?

394
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:26,550
Her.

395
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,880
Miss Lau?

396
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,430
On that day, I couldn't tell if the ladies

397
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,830
were sincere or just flattering the leader.

398
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,060
They all came to our courtyard
with gifts.

399
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:42,830
But only Miss Lau truly congratulated
my housewarming.

400
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:45,000
Usually, she stays silent,

401
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,760
appears utterly unremarkable,

402
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,950
yet she never follows the crowd

403
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,230
and oppress others.

404
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,270
Look,

405
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:56,520
this is the housewarming gift
she gave me.

406
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,720
Do you think she is worthy?

407
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,550
Yes.

408
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,070
Yes!

409
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,310
Think of a way

410
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,610
to get them out of there.

411
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,600
My lord,

412
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,520
I've pulled out all my tricks.

413
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,800
But Miss Luo is unyielding.

414
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,400
I'm truly out of options.

415
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,280
She's indeed troublesome.

416
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,470
Can no one in the mansion stop her?

417
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,340
(Xuewu Courtyard)

418
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,190
You!

419
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,110
I was away for just a moment.

420
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,640
Before I left,

421
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,070
this chair was at the front

422
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,000
facing his courtyard.

423
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,110
Now that I'm back,

424
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:50,070
why is this tree blocking my view?

425
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,400
What do you mean?

426
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,830
Are you saying I moved your spot?

427
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,040
You! You know who I'm referring to.

428
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,280
I don't want to argue.

429
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,230
Consider this money as payment
for your spot.

430
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,110
Who cares about your filthy money?

431
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:03,110
As if no one else has.

432
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,190
You!

433
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:05,670
Miss Lau,

434
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,590
do you think she took my place?

435
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,880
Speak up.

436
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,000
- Speak up!
- She's just so silent.

437
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:15,390
She hardly says a word usually.

438
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,520
What do you want her to say?

439
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,040
- She saw it.
- Don't pull her.

440
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,660
- Speak up!
- Don't make it hard for her.

441
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,350
I wasn't pulling her.

442
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,880
- Let go first.
- You let go first! Let go!

443
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,710
- Let go!
- Speak up!

444
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,110
Why did she move my seat?

445
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:28,830
- Let go!
- I didn't.

446
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,040
- You did.
- I didn't.

447
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,000
- Ladies.
- You did!

448
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,070
Ladies,

449
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,030
what's going on?

450
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,030
So lively here.

451
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,040
Good, Miss Luo is here.

452
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,150
You be the judge.

453
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,160
Did she move my seat?

454
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:41,560
She must have envied my view

455
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,710
and secretly moved my seat.

456
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,050
I have always been upright.

457
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,280
- I don't do shady things.
- Upright?

458
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,160
- She did take my seat.
- If you insist,

459
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,240
I will move it now!

460
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,310
- Just try then!
- You!

461
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,150
Miss Jiang,

462
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,070
Miss Han, you've misunderstood.

463
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:54,280
I was in a rush to pour tea,

464
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,040
so I accidentally bumped it.

465
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,760
As an apology,

466
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,640
I'll upgrade your seats.

467
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,640
How does that sound?

468
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,190
Please grant me this favor.

469
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,590
Let's not argue, alright?

470
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,830
Please follow me this way.

471
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,230
I accidentally disturbed you earlier.

472
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:19,590
I have decided

473
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,830
to serve some refreshments for you.

474
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:28,070
Miss Lau, would you join me?

475
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,360
This way, please.

476
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:36,540
(Xuewu Courtyard)

477
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,400
Miss Luo,

478
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,560
aren't we preparing refreshments?

479
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,190
Why are we heading outside?

480
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,830
I think you'd rather go back

481
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,590
than stay with everyone, right?

482
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,230
How did you...

483
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:49,230
How did I know?

484
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,000
By paying more attention.

485
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:53,560
You're not happy here.

486
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,880
Not even interested in seeking beauty.

487
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,120
If that's the case,

488
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,560
why force yourself to stay?

489
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,710
But the others are still there,

490
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,400
if I just leave,

491
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,680
won't it seem improper?

492
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:06,790
Then stay.

493
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,360
No.

494
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,040
See? You don't want to.

495
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,520
Why force yourself?

496
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,070
It's not about good or bad,

497
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,470
it's about you.

498
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,350
And you're not the only one leaving.

499
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,710
Miss Chen left early.

500
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,830
Don't overthink it, and don't worry.

501
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:26,230
It's the first time
someone's comforted me like this.

502
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,160
Thank you, Miss Luo.

503
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,280
I haven't thanked you yet.

504
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,560
You thanked me first instead.

505
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:34,280
Thank me?

506
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:38,280
This is my first gift

507
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,920
since arriving in Yuezhou.

508
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,950
I should be thanking you.

509
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,520
Tang?

510
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,310
I noticed you like Tongcao flowers.

511
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:56,070
Tongcao flowers
are different from fresh flowers.

512
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:58,070
Fresh flowers will eventually wither,

513
00:22:58,190 --> 00:22:59,350
but Tongcao flowers never do.

514
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,560
Today, I gift you this
Begonia Tongcao flower.

515
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,110
May it bloom through all seasons,

516
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,310
in wind, frost, rain, and snow,

517
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:08,520
never to wither.

518
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,880
Thank you, Miss Luo.

519
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,110
I appreciate.

520
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,430
How does her

521
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:17,880
end up with Luo Lingyu?

522
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:20,310
My lord,

523
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,520
how could it not be so?

524
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,710
Miss Luo is kind and beautiful.

525
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,480
She is easy to get along with.

526
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,520
Miss Lau
to want to be with her,

527
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,360
is normal, right?

528
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:29,830
Tang is different from other ladies,

529
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,830
perhaps Luo Lingyu noticed

530
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:34,700
and intentionally approached her.

531
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,680
She is quite cunning.

532
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,920
We must take precautions.

533
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,390
Your flower is beautiful too.

534
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,720
Come, have some tea.

535
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:14,440
What a disgraceful sight!

536
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,520
Look at you.

537
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:36,950
All of you are noble ladies.

538
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:40,640
Yet you act shamelessly like ruffians.

539
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:42,630
Have you forgotten "Rules for Women"

540
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,880
and "Instructions for Women"?

541
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,280
Miss Luo,

542
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:52,230
you took our money,
then solve the problems.

543
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,830
Say something.

544
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,560
Ma'am, what brings you to say this?

545
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,190
They all come here to seek beauty.

546
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,350
They are sitting nicely.

547
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,880
No one is eavesdropping.

548
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,190
Seeking beauty?

549
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,560
Tell me,

550
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:13,800
what kind of beauty are they seeking?

551
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,560
This Tongcao flower.

552
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,350
This is made from natural plants.

553
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,830
Beautiful and practical.

554
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:26,350
There's nothing more delightful
than this.

555
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,840
Yes, indeed.

556
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,760
Miss Luo is talented and beautiful.

557
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:30,830
She can craft things

558
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,710
we've never seen in Yuezhou.

559
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:35,640
Yes, that's why we came to take a look,

560
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:36,710
to learn a thing or two.

561
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:38,040
Ma'am, you've seen it too.

562
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,520
Miss Luo has only been
in this courtyard for a few days.

563
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:42,400
She's already turned
the shabby courtyard

564
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,520
into a beautiful place.

565
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,800
Her skillful hands

566
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,190
make us truly envious.

567
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:48,710
That's why we're here to learn.

568
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,830
We can also finish the work

569
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:51,800
from the nanny, right?

570
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,640
Then tell me,

571
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,830
what are the tables, chairs,

572
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:58,430
food and drinks here and there

573
00:25:58,430 --> 00:25:59,270
all about?

574
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:06,280
Ma'am, I heard that before you got married,

575
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:08,950
you were a leading lady
among the noblewomen of Yuezhou.

576
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:11,680
Your needlework was unmatched.

577
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,430
How could you not know

578
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,920
that making such intricate items
strains the eyes?

579
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,560
So, when they are tired,

580
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,110
they gaze into the distance,

581
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,430
and enjoy some refreshments.

582
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:33,310
That day, at Madam Lu's courtyard,

583
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:36,680
I saw the Second Young Master
picking flowers for you.

584
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:40,110
That was when I learned
you love orchids.

585
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:43,160
And orchids are noble
among flowers.

586
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,230
The Second Young Master
is like the noble orchid,

587
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,590
not only talented in writing,

588
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,040
but also respectful and filial.

589
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,470
Naturally.

590
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,070
As the First Madam,

591
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,920
you have to
manage all the household affairs.

592
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:01,680
You raised
the Second Young Master

593
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,920
into such an outstanding lord,

594
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:06,190
I am deeply moved.

595
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,310
So, I led sisters

596
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,590
to make these everlasting
Tongcao flowers

597
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,310
for you and other elders.

598
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,560
Sister?

599
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,640
Everyone worked hard all day,

600
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,400
but got no good results.

601
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,800
I am not sure how we upset you,

602
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,590
and you even called it disgraceful.

603
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,140
Since that's the case,

604
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,760
we won't proceed either.

605
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:04,640
It's such a pity

606
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:08,400
for the Second Young Master
and the ladies' intentions.

607
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,880
Speaking of sheer impudence,

608
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:13,880
Miss Luo truly takes the cake.

609
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:18,880
End it for today.

610
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:22,510
There won't be a next time.

611
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,280
I was so scared.

612
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,120
It's alright now.

613
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,760
Aunt, wait for me.

614
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,310
Miss Luo, we're leaving.

615
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,150
I'm leaving too.

616
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,230
Me too.

617
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:43,070
Farewell.

618
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,840
Farewell.

619
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:45,950
Sister.

620
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,940
- Let's go, quick.
- Move it.

621
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:56,310
Luo Lingyu truly has some skill.

622
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:59,590
Even the First Madam can't handle her.

623
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,000
My lord,

624
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,680
they are gone.

625
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,470
You can seek Prince Changyi now.

626
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:08,880
Before finding him,

627
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:11,830
I have an urgent matter to attend to.

628
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:13,430
A lingering threat remains,

629
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,470
I must eliminate it myself.

630
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,720
My lady,

631
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,350
with First Madam's visit today,

632
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:28,310
haven't we ended up at a loss?

633
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:30,680
What are you talking about?

634
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:32,800
We escorted her back,

635
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,160
didn't we?

636
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:35,950
As for the ladies,

637
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,640
even if their attitude towards me
won't change,

638
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,190
at least they'll remember my kindness.

639
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,720
Moreover,

640
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,800
with money in hand,

641
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,160
I'm ready for anything.

642
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:52,190
Now, it's just about
the Third Young...

643
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,680
There he is.

644
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,280
Lingxi, quick, collect these.

645
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:04,430
Alright.

646
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:08,670
Miss Luo.

647
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,950
Why have you come?

648
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:17,880
I have some words to share with you.

649
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,590
I'd like to meet you tonight.

650
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,430
Let me think.

651
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,280
(Does he want to)

652
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,070
(reveal his feelings to me?)

653
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,270
(It must be so.)

654
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,160
(That's such a big moment.)

655
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:46,400
(I must prepare thoroughly.)

656
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:54,270
Alright.

657
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:57,040
I also have words for you.

658
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,190
Then let's meet at...

659
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,560
I'll choose the place for tonight.

660
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:02,820
Alright.

661
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,110
Be there or be square.

662
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,400
Sure.

663
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:15,800
Tonight...

664
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,640
(Lu Mansion) Lingxi, we have work to do.

665
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,920
I gathered many cherry branches today.

666
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,280
They make such beautiful decorations.

667
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,120
That is beautiful.

668
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,520
Lingxi.

669
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:45,950
This place you've found is wonderful.

670
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,950
It is secluded and peaceful,

671
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,100
and accompanied by such lovely scenery.

672
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:53,350
When night falls,

673
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,830
a beautiful scene with fair people...

674
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:57,670
How wonderful!

675
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,430
I am glad you like it.

676
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,520
This step is crucial

677
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,910
to win over him today.

678
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,400
Let's see what you've brought.

679
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:07,880
Tongcao flower.

680
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:09,550
Veil.

681
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,800
Tools for making screens.

682
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,840
Roast chicken. Not that useful.

683
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,170
This doesn't help much.

684
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:21,760
Wait a minute. Give it to me.

685
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:23,310
This...

686
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:28,910
This is the most useful.

687
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,640
You mean the mirror?

688
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,040
We have such a big mansion,

689
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,110
why on earth did she choose
the Lake Pavilion?

690
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,230
We must resolve this
before Aman gets here.

691
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,710
You stay on the shore.

692
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:47,680
If you see someone,

693
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,520
just cough.

694
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:50,230
Rest assured, my lord.

695
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:51,640
In the dead of night,

696
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,520
I won't let you and Miss Luo

697
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:55,070
be alone together,

698
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:56,490
risking the First Madam's scolding.

699
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,680
What are you saying?

700
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,310
She's always pestering me,

701
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,030
and now she went to Tang.

702
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:04,640
She might have other intentions.

703
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,920
Keeping her around
will only add trouble.

704
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,790
I must make it clear to her
and cut this ill-fated relationship.

705
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,160
Wait, my lord!

706
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:29,280
My lady! There he is!

707
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:31,040
Lingxi, the moonlight!

708
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:32,070
Alright.

709
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:36,000
This way. A little to the left, more.

710
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,000
Right.

711
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:38,680
That is it.

712
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,900

713
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:03,500
♪Bright moonlight,

00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:06,360

00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,360
(He was completely entranced.)

723
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:36,360
(My efforts were not in vain.)

724
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:40,720

726
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:46,520
Third Young Master, why not enter?

727
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,120
(She is skilled in deception.)

728
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:59,300
(Gentle Breeze and Bright Moon)

729
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,150
Do have a seat, Third Young Master.

730
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,360
Alright.

731
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:12,040
You truly have remarkable skills.

732
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:17,600
What do you think of this pavilion?

733
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:20,710
Does it suit what you wish
to discuss with me?

734
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:24,080
Isn't it too quiet here?

735
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,630
Sometimes words
are meant for one person.

736
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,800
It's best when no one interrupts.

737
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,760
(Just as I thought.)

738
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:34,520
There's no one else around here.

739
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,390
You may speak your mind.

740
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,120
I am listening.

741
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,470
If I say it,

742
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,150
you should remember it well.

743
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,390
(Such relentless pursuit.)

744
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:52,520
(Seems he truly loves me.)

745
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:57,560
Sure I will.

746
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,360
Do not gaze!

747
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,640
Lingxi.

748
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,470
- What are you doing?
- Don't look!

749
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,910
My lord said

750
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,310
he wants to
end this relationship.

751
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,840
But this is a happy union.

752
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,420
We can consider
our mission accomplished.

753
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:22,120
Alright. It's not our concern anymore.

754
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:23,310
Let's go.

755
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:28,950
(She didn't dodge.)

756
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:31,630
(She really can go this far.)

757
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:35,710
Anyone else would have shunned.

758
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,280
And you remained still.

759
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,280
Are you waiting for me
to make a move?

760
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,800
You'll do anything to succeed.

761
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,080
I'll teach you a lesson today.

762
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,560
If you seduce someone,

763
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,390
you will be despised.

764
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,640
In the future,

765
00:36:58,710 --> 00:36:59,550
just don't...

766
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:06,950
(Oh no, I couldn't hold back.)

767
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:08,310
(What do I do now?)

768
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,630
(He won't retaliate, right?)

769
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:12,960
I see.

770
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:14,650
This is your true color.

771
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:17,470
Why do you say that?

772
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:18,800
I'm new here.

773
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,250
How could you possibly
know my true color so soon

774
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,040
and pass judgments on me like this?

775
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,390
I haven't done anything unforgivable

776
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,840
or acted scandalously.

777
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,630
I did show some affection to you,

778
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,910
but how are you any different from me?

779
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,320
The ladies in the household adore you,

780
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,520
and you secretly compare them.

781
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,760
Why is it noble when you act this way,

782
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:41,710
when it's me, you call it a seduction?

783
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:44,870
You are being irrational.

784
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,190
Am I?

785
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,390
You insulted me first.

786
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,800
You're the praised Third Young Master.

787
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,470
I, Luo Lingyu, am no less.

788
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:58,360
Is ignoring
the sincerity of others

789
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,280
the act of a gentleman?

790
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:02,000
I thought you were different.

791
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,710
Now it seems that you regard the ladies

792
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,610
merely as a thing
to display your superiority.

793
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,640
Lu Yun,

794
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:10,430
you've gone too far.

795
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,230
I went too far?

796
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,030
My lady!

797
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,560
Did you hurt your hand?

798
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:45,670
Where does it hurt?

799
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,630
What happened?

800
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:49,710
His face got hurt.

801
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:55,230
I even gave him a lecture.

802
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:58,150
I slapped him.

803
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:59,030
What?

804
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,190
I was impelled by him.

805
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,710
He accused me of seducing him.

806
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:07,870
What a joke!

807
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:10,710
I thought he was fond of me.

808
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:12,760
Now it turns out,

809
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:15,000
he was just playing with me.

810
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,910
My lady, please calm down.

811
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:19,710
He went too far.

812
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:23,390
Could there be a misunderstanding?

813
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,670
How could it be?

814
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:27,040
Between you and him,

815
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,470
perhaps there's no misunderstanding.

816
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:30,870
But, this...

817
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:33,000
If Madam Lu and the First Madam

818
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:34,710
find out you hit him,

819
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,520
they might drive us out of the mansion.

820
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,150
That would be quite a big issue.

821
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:43,070
Lingxi.

822
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,360
You're right,

823
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:46,800
there must be more to this.

824
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:50,230
Well, as a daughter of the Luo family,

825
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:51,750
I'll let him off this time.

826
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:56,840
I wonder if he's left yet.

827
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:58,970
My Lady, watch your step!

828
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:13,080
Your Highness,

829
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,360
have you seen enough?

830
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,320
About what I mentioned earlier,

831
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:17,360
did you listen to me?

832
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,280
I just didn't expect our dignified Xuechen

833
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,760
to be beaten by a lady.

834
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,760
That is rare.

835
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:29,840
Miss Luo

836
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,280
is not like the noble ladies you imagine.

837
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:34,750
Indeed,

838
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,430
she really has ingenuity.

839
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,040
I heard from Jinchuan
she's from Shuozhou,

840
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,470
her life has been tough.

841
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:43,870
You even met her once there.

842
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:44,990
This is fate.

843
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,600
Is it fate or trial?

844
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,840
I doubt it.

845
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:51,950
But speaking of which,

846
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:54,040
it's your first grand welcome.

847
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:55,670
Is it because of her too?

848
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,280
Let's talk business.

849
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,430
I found this account book at the Fan's.

850
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,710
I haven't figured out the mystery yet.

851
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,950
Once there's progress, I'll tell you.

852
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,120
Regarding the saltpeter
that Zhao Yuan informed me about,

853
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:15,620
I have reported to His Majesty.

854
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,600
Now checkpoints are secretly set up
at each pass.

855
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,150
Indeed, some small merchants

856
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,190
are transporting in small batches
to Shuozhou.

857
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:25,420
They are now under
local officials' control.

858
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,080
Shuozhou...

859
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,230
The Fan family
has a large stockpile of saltpeter.

860
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,040
These small merchants
might just be a front.

861
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:37,430
They dare act so boldly.

862
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:39,650
There must be
someone powerful behind them.

863
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:41,840
We need to investigate thoroughly.

864
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:45,030
By the way, Xuechen,

865
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:47,600
I have news for you too.

866
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:50,180
Fifth Brother will return soon.

867
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:03,000
Over ten years at the border.

868
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,700
Why is he suddenly
reporting back to court?

869
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:10,140
Prince Hengyang is coming to Yuezhou,

870
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:11,550
his return date is uncertain.

871
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:14,000
I'm afraid he comes with ill intentions.

872
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,240
I think you're overthinking it.

873
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:20,710
We know his nature.

874
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:22,690
Back when we attended classes together,

875
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,470
he said he wanted to be a great general.

876
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,890
Now, he truly is the
Great General of the North.

877
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,950
More than ten years have passed.

878
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:30,710
Aman,

879
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,560
the Fan family are
royal merchants in Shuozhou.

880
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:37,460
They've supplied a lot of grain
to the army over the years.

881
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,390
Prince Hengyang
is stationed at Shuozhou.

882
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:41,380
He has close ties with the Fan family.

883
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,120
If they are fraternizing.

884
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:46,950
- Xuechen.
- Third Young Master!

885
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,080
Third Young Master!

886
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,000
Third Young Master!

887
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,560
There comes your fate and trial.

888
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:55,880
Third Young Master!

889
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,400
I'll check it out.

890
00:42:59,000 --> 00:42:59,840
Stay hidden.

891
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:00,800
Third Young Master!

892
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:03,870
Third Young Master!

893
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,910
Alright, I heard you.

894
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,150
Are you trying to summon a spirit?

895
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:17,000
Aren't you

896
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,520
standing right in front of me?

897
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,190
How could it be a spirit-summoning?

898
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:23,320
Third Young Master,

899
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:27,910
I didn't mean it just now.

900
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,870
