Months ago, I brought

51
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,860
saltpeter all the way here

52
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,500
to help you ascend the throne.

00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,660
All for the day

54
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,500
when I could aid you in conquering Nanyue.

55
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,060
Do you know

56
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,660
that I can never return to Nanyue?

57
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,970
General Zhao
has repeatedly failed in battles.

58
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,300
Your Majesty, he's unreliable.

59
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,480
Now the Nanyue army
is stationed in Jingyang,

60
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,180
while it still takes time

61
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,380
for our forces to gather.

62
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,020
Our army is outnumbered.

63
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,580
Your Majesty, instead of waiting,

64
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,780
why not let me attempt a strategy?

65
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,580
It seems

66
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,500
you have a plan.

67
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,860
Losing Jingyang isn't entirely bad.

68
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,680
Yi Pass is easy to defend
and hard to attack.

69
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,180
If we lure the enemy deeper,

70
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,860
we can use minimal gunpowder

71
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,260
to annihilate the North Army at Yi Pass.

72
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,580
Then, we can advance smoothly,

73
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,980
and directly capture Yuezhou.

74
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,420
Report!

75
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,380
Your Majesty,

76
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,260
the North Army is still
led by Prince Hengyang.

77
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,540
The advisor is Lu Yun from the Lu Clan.

78
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,020
Your Majesty,

79
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:05,220
I'll make them meet the same fate as Lu Jie.

80
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,980
Then let General Fan lead the troops

81
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,260
to capture them all at Yi Pass.

82
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,940
Lingyu, please sit down.

83
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,140
You seem so worried.

84
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,540
Why so anxious?

85
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,820
Why not open the letter

86
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,820
from Young Master Yun?

87
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,540
I just want to know how Jingyang is.

88
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,620
Alright.

89
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,460
Yangling.

90
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,820
- Aman.
- Yangling.

91
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,380
We won the battle.

92
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,540
- Really?
- Really?

93
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,140
Now I can return home.

94
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,540
Good for you.

95
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:56,740
Aren't you curious

96
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,340
about how Young Master Yun is?

97
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,820
Look at His Highness,

98
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,220
he's so cheerful.

99
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,100
Lu Yun must be in good spirits.

100
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:10,860
Lingyu.

101
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:15,100
The battle isn't over yet.

102
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,540
The Northern Border is still perilous.

103
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,980
It's not safe to return to Jingyang now.

104
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,100
Yangling is right.

105
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,780
Although we've recaptured Jingyang,

106
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,980
the situation has changed somewhat.

107
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,100
So Hengyang and Xuechen can't return yet.

108
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,860
Why is that?

109
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,220
(Jingyang)
Now that we've taken Jingyang back,

110
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,900
our scouts are probing Yi Pass's defenses.

111
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,740
(Yi Pass)

112
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,380
Beichu is heavily guarding Yi Pass.

113
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,540
Seems they're determined to defend it.

114
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,100
(Yi Pass)
Using the defensible terrain,

115
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,060
they're holding on,
waiting for reinforcements.

116
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,100
Such ambitious intentions.

117
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,580
If we don't take Yi Pass,

118
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,740
(Yi Pass)
Once Beichu amasses forces,

119
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,500
they'll march south aggressively.

120
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,100
By that time,

121
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,260
the situation will only worsen.

122
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,100
Only by taking Yi Pass

123
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,220
can we ensure Nanyue's peace
for thirty years.

124
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,980
But now Beichu

125
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,820
has burned all the granaries in Jingyang.

126
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,700
We're running out of supplies.

127
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,100
At Yi Pass,

128
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,060
we will surely have a tough battle.

129
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:33,020
(Yi Pass)

130
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,260
The battle came so suddenly.

131
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,940
Do we have sufficient supplies?

132
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,300
The worst fear
is a lack of military supplies.

133
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,540
I'm afraid their situation is perilous.

134
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,060
You don't have to worry too much.

135
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,940
I've submitted the request.

136
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,580
It just needs approval
from the Ministry of War and of Revenue.

137
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,820
Even if they agree,

138
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,860
the journey is so long.

139
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,980
When will the supplies ever arrive?

140
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,760
I'll find a way to speed up the process.

141
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:09,860
(Xuewu Courtyard)

142
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:24,980
My Lady.

143
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,220
Did a letter arrive today?

144
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,060
My Lady, don't worry too much.

145
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,820
Perhaps it was delayed on the way.

146
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,020
Lingxi,

147
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,260
I want to be alone for a while.

148
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,380
Yes, My Lady.

149
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,500
(For Luo Lingyu's eyes only)

150
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,020
(For Luo Lingyu's eyes only)

151
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,260
Xuechen!

152
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,940
The situation has indeed changed.

153
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,620
Hengyang and Xuechen can't return yet.

154
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,240
(For Luo Lingyu's eyes only)
A letter from him.

155
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,900
No!

156
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,380
Xuechen!

157
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,860
(For Luo Lingyu's eyes only)

158
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,820

(Safe and sound)

160
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:22,020
(Safe and sound)

161
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,620
(This is a red elm unique to Jingyang.)

162
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,380
(Lingyu.)

163
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,180
(The leaves in Jingyang have turned red.)

164
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,060
(You can finally go home.)

165
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,180
(Then...)

166
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:53,940
(Let's go back.)

167
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,540
(Lu Mansion)

168
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,140
Hua, your sister has arrived.

169
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,500
Sister.

170
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:08,700
Sister.

171
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,060
You're going home.

172
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,660
Are you really not taking me?

173
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,140
Hua, be good and wait in Yuezhou.

174
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,940
When I get back the family property,

175
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,500
I'll treat you to good food and fun.

176
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,340
Be good, alright?

177
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,340
Hua.

178
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,700
I will play with you.

179
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,740
- Sister.
- I have declined

180
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,820
all invitations these months.

181
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,060
Leave without worry.

182
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,380
I'll take care of home.

183
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,380
Aunt Ying, if you feel bored,

184
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,820
take Hua out for fun.

185
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,420
Once she's tired out with play,

186
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,380
she'll forget about me.

187
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,460
Play?

188
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,700
Alright.

189
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,460
Lingyu,

190
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,580
are you really going to Jingyang?

191
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,020
Of course.

192
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,700
Jingyang was finally reclaimed.

193
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,310
Naturally, I want the family property

194
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,900
back quickly to feel at ease.

195
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,060
I know you're worried about Lu Yun,

196
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,700
and the soldiers
at the border lacking supplies.

197
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,860
But going with just Lingxi

198
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,020
is too risky.

199
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,140
The journey is perilous.

200
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,740
I'm truly worried.

201
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,700
Yangling.

202
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,180
Don't worry about it.

203
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,300
I've arranged escorts along the way

204
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,020
to protect Miss Luo at the docks.

205
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,180
Even on land, someone will assist.

206
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,380
There won't be any accidents.

207
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,060
But Xuechen entrusted me
with you before leaving.

208
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,380
As you're leaving,

209
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,660
shouldn't you write to inform him first?

210
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,500
No need.

211
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,700
The situation is urgent.

212
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,740
Let's not distract him further.

213
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,340
Alright.

214
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:41,420
(Ten days later)

215
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,140
The situation at Yi Pass is dire.

216
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,380
(Jingyang)
The court's supply approval is slow.

217
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,580
It can't solve our urgent needs.

218
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,740
Supplies from other cities haven't arrived.

219
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,380
Our supplies will only last

220
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,340
for three days.

221
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,060
Your Highness, those Beichu losers

222
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,020
are no match at all.

223
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,300
In the recent battle,

224
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,210
they ended up fleeing.

225
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,340
Give me three days,

226
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,180
and I'll wipe them out.

227
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,140
It can't be done.

228
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,940
Advisor Lu, why not?

229
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,500
In previous encounters,

230
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,180
they showed no will to fight.

231
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,940
It seems like they aim to lure us.

232
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,100
Or perhaps...

233
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,940
Perhaps when we exhaust our supplies,

234
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,940
they'll launch a great battle.

235
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,460
Exactly.

236
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,900
I share the same thoughts as Advisor Lu.

237
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,580
The Beichu Army is formidable.

238
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,180
They wouldn't be so hasty in a major battle.

239
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,500
We must remain cautious.

240
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,180
Yet our supplies are running low.

241
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,820
Are we just to sit back like this?

242
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,380
Yi Pass holds great strategic importance.

243
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,140
For the safety of Jingyang,

244
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,740
since the situation is uncertain,

245
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,940
we cannot retreat.

246
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,720
Yet, due to limited supplies,

247
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,260
we cannot launch an attack.

248
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,580
It's truly a dilemma.

249
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,940
I suggest not acting rashly.

250
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,940
I remember my father's map showed

251
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,500
a secret path on the west side of Yi Pass.

252
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,660
(Jingyang)

253
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,580
Perhaps we should send someone
to check it out.

254
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,700
For now, that's our only option.

255
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,580
Zhao Yuan, you're the best at infiltration.

256
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,140
You should lead the team.

257
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,140
I accept the task.

258
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,140
Your Highness. Advisor Lu,

259
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,140
a beautiful lady is waiting outside.

260
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,260
She's here for you.

261
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,060
Send her away.

262
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,060
What are you looking at?

263
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,900
Don't make things up when we return.

264
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,740
She came from Yuezhou.

265
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:37,780
That's a long way.

266
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,500
Where from?

267
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,260
Yuezhou.

268
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,140
Even during an ambush,
he wasn't this anxious.

00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,560

Are you here for me?

277
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:31,820
Of course not.

278
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,380
I'm here to reclaim my family property.

00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,340
500,000 taels of gold is too heavy.

282
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,060
I naturally need help to move it.

283
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,380

00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,410

For what?

287
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,580
The journey back is long

288
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,900
and tiresome.

289
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,700

Your Highness.

301
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,700
That's quite enough, really.

302
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,540
It's a military camp entrance.

303
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,260
You two stand out too much.

304
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,380
Lu Yun, bring them in.

305
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,380
This porridge is so thin.

306
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,700
How can it fill anyone up?

307
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,620
I didn't expect

308
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,140
military supplies to be this scarce.

309
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,140
We have only three days of supplies left.

310
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,420
Once I retrieve the property,

311
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,260
I can resolve the military's needs.

312
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,260
Without further ado,

313
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,340
let's set off now.

314
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:54,420
But...

315
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,260
No more buts.

316
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,020
Lingxi.

317
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,740
(Yi Pass)
We just need to go to these two spots.

318
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,980
Alright, I'll lead the troops with you.

319
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,340
(Jingyang)
Dig over there.

320
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,220
- No way.
- Okay.

321
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,220
The spot on the map is right here.

322
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,980
How could we not find it?

323
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,620
My Lady.

324
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,060
I've dug almost as tall as I am.

325
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,740
Why is there nothing here?

326
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:42,140
Did my lord mark the wrong spot?

327
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,260
Lingyu.

328
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,980
I just took a look on the wall.

329
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,380
It doesn't seem like

330
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,500
a place where treasure could be hidden.

331
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,310
Could there be a mistake?

332
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,460
Father has made arrangements.

333
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,860
He wouldn't make a mistake on this.

334
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,340
How could we not find it?

335
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,460
(Jingyang)

336
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:24,180
(Jingyang)

337
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,460
(The map Father left...)

338
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,220
(What does it mean?)

339
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,340
- Stay safe.
- Prefect Luo.

340
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,260
You must take a stroll.

341
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,010
- Prefect Luo.
- Prefect Luo.

342
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,260
Prefect Luo,

343
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,660
these are homemade meat buns.

344
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,860
- You must try one.
- Great.

345
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:00,180
Please have a try.

346
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,020
No, thank you.

347
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,980
Take them home for your children.

348
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:06,980
Father, Father, Father.

349
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,580
Father.

350
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,740
Lingyu.

351
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,700
Father.

352
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,060
- Come here.
- Father.

353
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,200
Take a look.

354
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:24,500
Fresh flowers.

355
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,340
Want one? Fresh flowers.

356
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,180
Later,

357
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,980
I'll take you somewhere fun, okay?

358
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,260
Where is it?

359
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,060
You'll know when we get there.

360
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,820
Father, you won't trick me, right?

361
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,700
When have I ever tricked you?

362
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,460
Shall we go now?

363
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:44,940
- Okay.
- Let's go.

364
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,620
Father.

365
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,260
Prefect Luo.

366
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,380
Prefect Luo.

367
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:03,620
We have arrived.

368
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,100
What is this place for?

369
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,260
If the enemy invades us,

370
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,940
this is where we deploy troops.

371
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,860
Isn't this place very secretive?

372
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:15,140
Yes, that's why
only I can bring you here.

373
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,340
Let's go.

374
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:21,810
Please take a look.

375
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,480
Come and see.

376
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:27,550
Come and see.

377
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:47,260
Our Luo Clan of Jingyang has a mission.

378
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,860
It is to protect this city

379
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,340
and safeguard its people

380
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,620
for the Northern Border's peace.

381
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,220
Lingyu.

382
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,980
When you grow up,

383
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,820
remember the Luo Clan's family motto.

384
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,940
Be strong for life.

385
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,740
Be strong for life.

386
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,620
Be strong for life.

387
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,380
Wall?
[*Homophone]

388
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,500
It's this wall.

389
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:27,700
This...

390
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,220
- So much gold!
- My Lady.

391
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:31,620
So much gold.

392
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,100
Over there, there's more.

393
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,900
- My Lady.
- It's all over this place.

394
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,220
Didn't expect us to be so wealthy.

395
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,410
- In the middle.
- So much.

396
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,500
Indeed.

397
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,740
My Lord really left us 500,000 taels of gold.

398
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,140
That's so much.

399
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,820
(To My Beloved Daughter)
Unbelievable.

400
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,970
- This is written by my father.
- So much.

401
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:50,680
Exactly.

402
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:03,300
(To My Beloved Daughter)

403
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,740
This is my father's jade pendant.

404
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,460
General Lu.

405
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,140
Lingxi,

406
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,740
take everyone outside and wait.

407
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:23,820
Yes, My Lady.

408
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,620
Come on, follow me outside.

409
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,220
- Yes.
- Let's move.

410
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,380
In the fourth year of Yuanshuo,

411
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:47,740
I found the general's remains at Yi Pass.

412
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,740
I was overwhelmed with grief,

413
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,820
my emotions uncontrollable.

414
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,100
But the situation was dire.

415
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:03,740
Beichu's army was closing in on the city.

416
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:07,820
If word got out, morale could crumble.

417
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,500
It was urgent.

418
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:13,820
I had no choice
but to bury General Lu hastily,

419
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,060
to honor his spirit.

420
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,740
Lingyu, you were too young.

421
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:34,860
I hadn't had time to explain to you

422
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,460
the true meaning
of the Luo Clan's family motto.

423
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,460
Be strong for life.

424
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,380
"Strong" indicates the wall

425
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,740
of our clan that blocks enemies from Nanyue.

426
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,060
It also means the strength of soldiers

427
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,380
guarding the borders like the city wall.

428
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,220
It allows no one out once they enter

429
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,860
because we hope every soldier returns safely

430
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,620
every time they go out for battles,

431
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,060
with no more fears of farewell.

432
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:12,820
Father.

433
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:21,380
My wife and I vow to stand with Jingyang.

434
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,340
Though Jingyang is in peril now,

435
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,620
there will be a time when the clouds clear.

436
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,940
This journey is fraught with danger.

437
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,860
If there is any regret,

438
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,620
it's that I won't see you and Hua

439
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,620
grow up into adults.

440
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:39,380
I only wish for you two to live safely,

441
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,980
with happiness and peace.

442
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,220
Lingyu, if you can see this letter,

443
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,100
I suppose Jingyang has been recaptured.

444
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:48,460
(To My Beloved Daughter)
Please clear General Lu's name on my behalf,

445
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:52,380
so that he and the soldiers
who died for the country

446
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,220
can rest in peace.

447
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,780
I will not fail the Luo Clan's family motto.

448
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,980
I'll assist soldiers in securing the border,

449
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,220
and fulfill the promise
in the letter from you.

450
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:43,860
Be careful there.

451
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,500
Handle this box with care.

452
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,540
(Jingyang)
And this.

453
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,380
Come on.

454
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,140
Be careful with this box.

455
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:50,980
Didn't expect

456
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:54,340
all answers lie in where everything starts.

457
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,100
These two as well, over here.

458
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,220
Move forward.

459
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:58,780
Turn right up ahead, then load.

460
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,340
Jingyang fell ten years ago.

461
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,230
Be careful.

462
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,980
- I've finally reclaimed it.
- Slowly.

463
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:10,380
I won't let Nanyue lose another part.

464
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,290
Be careful, everyone.

465
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:19,340
I have regained the family property.

466
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:25,100
You and His Highness
can focus on defending Beichu.

467
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,810
As for the military supplies,

468
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,500
I'll handle it.

469
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:36,940
Come on, take it slow.

470
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,060
(Jingyang)

471
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:39,900
Right up ahead.

472
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,980
Just load the cart ahead.

473
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,100
Take it slow.

474
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:48,180
It's been two days. Why aren't they back?

475
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,100
Indeed.

476
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,460
Could something have happened on the way?

477
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,500
Do you think there's trouble?

478
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,820
They should be back by now.

479
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,060
Fortune favors the good.

480
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,820
Your Highness, what shall we do?

481
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,460
They're back. They've returned.

482
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,020
They're back.

483
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,220
They're here.

484
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:11,010
- Have a look.
- Advisor Lu is back.

485
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,300
- Let's go.
- Come on.

486
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,340
With this grain,

487
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,980
we won't go hungry for a while.

488
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:17,900
It's grain, wonderful.

489
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:18,740
We have grain.

490
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:19,590
We have grain now.

491
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,460
Miss Luo, since we have the grain,

492
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,020
it'd be better to have winter clothes.

493
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:23,860
Yes, we have them.

494
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:24,860
Do you have fodder?

495
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,020
Of course.

496
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:26,900
And medicinal herbs?

497
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,260
Turmeric and centella.

498
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,140
Anything you need.

499
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,460
Soldiers, all supplies are ready.

500
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,740
Are you confident you'll win?

501
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,980
Yes, we are.

502
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,140
Show your spirit!

503
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:38,980
Do you have it?

504
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:41,970
- Yes, yes.
- Yes.

505
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,780
- Louder, I can't hear you.
- Yes!

506
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,620
- Yes!
- Yes!

507
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,700
Yes!

508
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,140
That's great.

509
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,220
To gather so many supplies during the war,

510
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,460
Miss Luo really invested a lot.

511
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,620
Indeed.

512
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,500
As a token of gratitude,

513
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,620
I plan to offer myself.

514
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:03,780
Come on.

515
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,860
Give me a hand.

516
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,260
- Okay, My Lady.
- Yes,

517
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,620
- That's right.
- Come on.

518
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,260
How can I let you work?

519
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,460
- Be careful.
- Let's go.

520
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,220
- Let me.
- Let's have a good meal.

521
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,460
Sure.

522
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:31,620
It finally looks livable.

523
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:35,860
Lingyu,

524
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:37,580
I'm back.

525
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,860
Are the supplies sorted?

526
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,340
I thought I entered the wrong tent.

527
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,500
It feels like the Qing Courtyard.

528
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:50,100
You only share the happy news in letters.

529
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,740
Were you hurt?

530
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,020
Did you use any meds?

531
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:57,380
Don't worry. I wasn't hurt at all.

532
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,940
Maybe it's your sachet's blessing.

533
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,700
Don't worry about me.

534
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,020
I'll have Zhao Yuan

535
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,140
escort you to a nearby town.

536
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,620
I came all this way,

537
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:09,700
just to have you send me away
after getting supplies?

538
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,460
The Luo Clan's family property you long for

539
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,340
turned into the supplies overnight.

540
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:16,580
Doesn't it hurt you?

541
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,740
I sacrificed the small for the greater good.

542
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,960
When you defeat Beichu, don't forget

543
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:25,220
to request a reward for me from His Majesty.

544
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,180
Then,

545
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:30,380
I can spend my days indulging myself.

546
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:31,960
Wouldn't that be perfect?

547
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:36,220
Alright, I'll secure that reward for you.

548
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,740
Are you still sending me away?

549
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,460
Honestly, I don't want you to leave.

550
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,340
Then I won't go.

551
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,780
I'm worried you might not be used to

552
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,620
the military camp.

553
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,340
Don't underestimate me.

554
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,260
I've been with my father since childhood,

555
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,220
growing up in Jingyang's army.

556
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,220
In terms of time spent,

557
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,360
you might not have spent

558
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,460
as much time in the military camp as I have.

559
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:10,980
But...

560
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:12,980
No buts.

561
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,500
Since I'm here,

562
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,860
I've been mentally prepared.

563
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,100
I won't be leaving.

564
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,700
Alright, now,

565
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,100
find an empty tent for me
in the military camp.

566
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:29,450
♪La~ la~♪

567
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,820
I've tidied everything for you.

568
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,260
Rest early.

569
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,380
If you're staying here,

570
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,570
you can sleep here.

571
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:41,570
♪In this life, I wish for your words♪

572
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,980

579
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,700
What are you doing here?

580
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:23,810
At the battle earlier,

581
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,220
you shielded me from a blow

582
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,340
and got hurt.

583
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,220
I have to come and check on you.

584
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,460
You don't seem that caring.

585
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,620
You've misunderstood me greatly.

586
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:37,700
Let me help you apply it.

587
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:38,980
It's not convenient for you.

588
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:39,980
Isn't it?

589
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:48,900
Over the years,

590
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:53,620
you earned your merits through injuries.

591
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,100
They're just minor wounds.

592
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:03,220
It's rare to avoid injuries in war.

593
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:07,700
But I've managed to stay unscathed.

594
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:10,100
Maybe you're just not skilled enough, Ajiao.

595
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:12,700
Didn't we agree on this?

596
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:15,260
Don't call me Ajiao in the military camp.

597
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,820
Are you here just to annoy me?

598
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:23,180
I'm here to apply medicine for you.

599
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:28,940
Alright, alright.

600
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:29,860
All done.

601
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:31,500
Hurry up and leave.

602
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,380
No way.

603
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,420
Your injury is somewhat my fault.

604
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:38,140
I'll reluctantly care for you for two days.

605
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:39,940
It's been a few days already.

606
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,260
My wound is almost healed.

607
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,860
Now you come to care for me?

608
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:47,260
Also, it is because...

609
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,220
I let Lingyu stay in my tent.

610
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:56,340
We'll just make do for a few days.

611
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:57,740
Let's sleep.

612
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,580
You wish.

613
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,260
Get down from here.

614
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,000
We've been friends for years.

615
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,260
Don't be so petty.

616
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,100
Sorry about that.

617
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,380
This bed is small.

618
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:18,180
It's comfy alone.

619
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,180
I don't care.

620
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:26,300
Lu Xuechen, listen up.

621
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,740
I move a lot in my sleep.

622
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,180
I don't mind.

623
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,660
We've shared a bed since childhood,

624
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:33,900
and I'm used to it.

625
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,940
Ajiao, you're not a kid anymore.

626
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,660
Can you be more mature?

627
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,780
Do you still wet the bed like you did

628
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:47,980
when you were young?

629
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,340
No, I stopped long ago.

630
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,260
Not on your bed anyway.

631
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,060
Leave my arm alone!

632
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,180
I need the quilt.

633
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,820
- Don't fight me for it.
- Just a little.

634
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:04,870
You won't freeze to death.

635
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:05,660
Go away, go away.

636
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,340
If you want to stay here,

637
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:32,700
then sleep right here.

638
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:35,060
Then where will you sleep?

639
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:05,160

00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:11,680

649
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:11,980
What are you doing?

650
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,700
You've been traveling and must be tired.

651
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,180
Take a good rest.

652
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,340
I'll find Ajiao to handle tonight.

653
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:29,660
(With the war ongoing,
Lingyu will understand.)

654
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,100
(Will he ever come back?)

655
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:46,870
(Forget it.)

656
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,420
Yesterday, Zhao Yuan infiltrated Yi Pass.

657
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,900
He did find something unusual.

658
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,700
I've followed the Beichu Army.

659
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,260
Most of their camps

660
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,060
are located in this canyon.

661
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,980
(Jingyang)
Only rocks are on the mountainsides.

662
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:06,820
No vegetation there.

663
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:07,780
It's completely barren.

664
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,500
No place to hide.

665
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,740
No way to throw objects.

666
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,820
Why are they stationed there?

667
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:16,300
It's a great place
for catching the enemies.

668
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:20,500
It's gunpowder.

669
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,540
Gunpowder?

670
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:27,500
Gunpowder is embedded
in the mountainsides.

671
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,500
Once we enter inside,

672
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:32,140
Beichu just needs to ignite the gunpowder,

673
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,500
and use the mountain stones

674
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,060
to bury us.

675
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,860
(Yi Pass)

676
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,020
In recent years, Beichu

677
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:39,820
has indeed smuggled quite a bit of saltpeter.

678
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,700
The process of making gunpowder is complex.

679
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:52,860
We've fought several times,

680
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,900
but never seen them use it,

681
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,900
indicating they don't have much.

682
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,340
To maximize the impact,

683
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:02,500
they must corner us.

684
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,690
Right here.

685
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,900
(Jingyang)

686
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:11,340
Only this spot is ideal for ambush.

687
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,660
If the Beichu troops lure us there,

688
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,420
we must avoid rashly following in.

689
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,660
Miss Luo's supplies

690
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,340
have resolved our immediate crisis.

691
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,500
The reinforcements are on the way.

692
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,340
It's fine to engage with them
for a few more days.

693
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:33,860
We can feign some attacks.

694
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:36,460
Let's see how much gunpowder they have.

695
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:48,020
(Beichu Military Camp)

696
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:08,100
Nanyue's military supplies are running low.

697
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,260
They must want a quick victory.

698
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:14,740
We've placed gunpowder above the canyon.

699
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,740
Once the battle begins,

700
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,020
we'll lure them deep inside,

701
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,860
and catch them all at once.

702
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,660
General, we have intel.

703
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,340
The North Army received a large shipment

704
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,580
of military supplies today.

705
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,700
The granaries in Jingyang have been burned.

706
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:35,660
The military supplies from the court

707
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:37,820
won't reach Yi Pass soon.

708
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,180
I saw it with my own eyes.

709
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,100
That General Lu from Nanyue

710
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,340
is gathering grain

711
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:44,220
from nearby cities with a young lady.

712
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,940
That's how they bolstered their supplies.

713
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,340
General.

714
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:52,580
The woman in the painting
is that young lady.

715
00:41:58,860 --> 00:41:59,700
It's her.
