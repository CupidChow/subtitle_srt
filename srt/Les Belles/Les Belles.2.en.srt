23
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,490
That young lady is a charming rider.

24
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,560
That's my horse!

25
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:57,890
Right, Young Master.

26
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,110
- How did she get it?
- There!

27
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,320
- Go that way!
- Let's go.

28
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,170
- Yes.
- Yes.

29
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,760
Zhao Yuan, they seem to be trained soldiers.

30
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,600
I'll distract them.

31
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:07,940
You leave with the account book.

32
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,030
Stop! Don't move!

33
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:15,250
Why isn't it moving?

34
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,810
- Stop there!
- Come on!

35
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,010
- Stop!
- Yah!

36
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,040
Stop!

37
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,800
Stop!

38
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,010
Come on!

39
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:25,960
Go get horses to chase him!

40
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,800
Yes.

41
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:32,410
Let's go. Come on.

42
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,010
Has she got the horse?

43
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,020
It's been two hours, Miss.

44
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,260
Is that girl coming or not?

45
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,620
Wait a few more minutes.

46
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,180
How much longer must I wait?

47
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,460
Just a few more minutes. She's coming.

48
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,740
The heat is killing me!

49
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,820
Please!

50
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,340
You must arrive safe and sound.

51
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,220
Go!

52
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,740
Run!

53
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,060
Is this horse from the farmer's market?

54
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,380
Run!

55
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,500
Come on.

56
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,020
Go, go, go!

57
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:34,820
My Lady!

58
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,900
She's arrived, sir!

59
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,820
Let's go!

60
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,260
Is this the fairest of Shuozhou,

61
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,100
Miss Luo?

62
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,820
Or am I seeing things?

63
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,380
Yes, it's me.

64
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,180
Sir, let's...

65
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,100
- Stop! Over there! Seize her!
- Stop!

66
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,420
They're right behind us!

67
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,340
- Stop there!
- Let's go!

68
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,220
Stop!

69
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,620
-Hey...!
- Where are you going?

70
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,540
I'm sorry, Miss Luo!

71
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,100
Everyone in town knows Young Master Fan

72
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,540
is marrying you today.

73
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,900
If I help you escape,

74
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,260
the Fan Family will kill me!

75
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,620
Here's your money.

76
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,980
Take care, ladies. Take care.

77
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,620
I don't want to die!

78
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:13,860
My Lady!

79
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,100
What should we do, Sister?

80
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:16,900
Find a place to hide.

81
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,020
Let's go.

82
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:21,900
Come on!

83
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,020
Stop!

84
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,180
Move!

85
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,940
Go away!

86
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,100
Over there! There! Let's go!

87
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,900
- My Lady...
- Stop!

88
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,420
- Stop!
- Let's go.

89
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:46,940
They can't go too far.

90
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:47,820
Search every corner.

91
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,620
- You guys go that way.
- Yes.

92
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,550
- Let's go.
- That way.

93
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,900
- Yes.
- They've caught up!

94
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,300
We're outnumbered, Sister.

95
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,620
(Zhou Yangling)
Come.

96
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,020
- Hua, Lingxi!
- Let's go!

97
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,780
- Move!
- Move!

98
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,020
- Stop...
- Do you want to die?

99
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,040
- Any sign of her?
- No.

100
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:09,820
You two go that way.

101
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,840
The rest of you follow me.

102
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,660
- Yes.
- Yes.

103
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,700
Let's go.

104
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,140
- What's happening?
- What are you doing?

105
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:19,980
What's going on?

106
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,300
Relax. They're gone.

107
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,580
How rude of me.

108
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,900
My apologies, Miss.

109
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,700
Let me go double-check.

110
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,340
Come out now. It's safe.

111
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,180
Come out.

112
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,580
I'm Zhou Zibo.

113
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,860
May I know your name, Miss?

114
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,180
You don't know me?

115
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,820
Should I?

116
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,860
I'm Luo Lingyu.

117
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,100
Thank you for your help.

118
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,420
I'll forever remember it.

119
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,100
Thanks, Mr. Zhou.

120
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,260
Thank you, sir!

121
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,300
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

122
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,620
Did you go to the dock to take a boat?

123
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,420
We hired one,

124
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,580
but the boatman refused to take us and left.

125
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,300
Where did you mean to go by boat?

126
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,580
Yuezhou.

127
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:40,740
Really? I'm going there, too.

128
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:41,860
What are the odds?

129
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,620
Miss Luo,

130
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,820
they'll find you sooner or later.

131
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,860
It's best to leave this place soon.

132
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,340
I have an idea.

133
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,020
Would you like to have a try?

134
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:02,780
Where's she?

135
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,460
Over there! Don't let her get away!

136
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,340
- Go!
- Stop right there!

137
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,620
- Let's go!
- Stop!

138
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,300
- Go away!
- Stop!

139
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,060
Stop!

140
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:18,900
Out of the way!

141
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,420
They've left. Let's go.

142
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,180
There you are...

143
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,740
Sir.

144
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,580
Go on board, ladies.

145
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,300
The law says if no blood's shed,

146
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,460
flog the attacker

147
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,640
40 times.

148
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,710
If there's blood, 60 times.

149
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,140
If the injured vomit blood, 80 times.

150
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,840
The chief offender who hits the hardest will

151
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,100
receive the harshest punishment.

152
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,740
The others will be punished less harshly.

153
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:00,780
Go ahead.

154
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,270
How are you going to hit me?

155
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,420
How hard will it be?

156
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:04,820
Who will go first?

157
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,220
- Uh...
- I...

158
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,740
- Be careful, Hua.
- Watch your step.

159
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:09,890
Step back, Hua!

160
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,380
Yellow! Yellow!

161
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,220
Forget it.

162
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,460
The boat has sailed.

163
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,620
Leave it there, Hua.

164
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,620
Forget it.

165
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,820
Find Miss Luo first.

166
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,060
Let's go.

167
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,820
(That person is waiting for the boat.)

168
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,540
- (I cannot take it)
- Go that way.

169
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,420
(to Yuezhou.)

170
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,340
(This is a win-win situation.)

171
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,780
- We'll buy you a new one.
- I want mine.

172
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,100
Mother gave it to me.

173
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,620
I want my Yellow!

174
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,180
Here you go.

175
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,620
- It's back.
- Thanks, Sister.

176
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,660
Yellow is back. Are you happy now?

177
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,580
(Zhou)

178
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,100
Women in the world

179
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,500
are subject to arranged marriages.

180
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,980
I admire her courage to escape.

181
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,380
May you get what you want, too.

182
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:13,660
I'm holding you. Do you feel cold?

183
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,500
Wipe it.

184
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,740
How's that young man?

185
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,100
I wonder if he's safe.

186
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,740
The Fan Family was looking for you.

187
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,740
I think they wouldn't hurt him.

188
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,780
By the way,

189
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:30,420
he's so beautiful.

190
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,660
Men looking as pretty as women are blessed.

191
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,100
Mr. Zhou's indeed good-looking.

192
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:43,220
Sister, is your encounter

193
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,300
like what happened in romantic stories?

194
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,300
Miss Hua, the characters in those stories

195
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,620
aren't as poor and needy as us.

196
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,580
Let's focus on how to get basic necessities.

197
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,440
That's more important.

198
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,780
We don't even have a change of clothes.

199
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,380
Don't worry.

200
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,100
We'll be fine, Lingxi.

201
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,380
Give me the abacus.

202
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:04,700
Sure.

203
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,820
Here you go.

204
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,860
The wedding gown from the Lansong Shop

205
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,180
was bought at 30 taels of gold.

206
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,900
It can be pawned for money.

207
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:20,100
Who will buy a wedding gown from a pawn shop?

208
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,740
That's bad for marriage.

209
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:22,980
That's right.

210
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,980
The fairest woman of Shuozhou tried it on.

211
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,540
I'm being kind enough not to raise the price.

212
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:29,980
Look at you.

213
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,460
Sister,

214
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,500
you haven't added this case of jewelry.

215
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,220
Mother left these pieces to us.

216
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,340
We need them to look good when necessary.

217
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,180
We can't pawn them.

218
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,420
Right.

219
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,420
Luckily, we got back some money
from that thief.

220
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,100
I wonder

221
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,980
what else he took from us.

222
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,740
Go!

223
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,060
Go!

224
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,100
Keep going!

225
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:01,820
Come on!

226
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,180
Stop!

227
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,500
Stop!

228
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,180
I thought you were slow!

229
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,980
Stop! There he is!

230
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:48,940
- Go!
- Let's go!

231
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,380
(I've never wanted this marriage.
Please let it go. Luo Lingyu)

232
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:34,820
(To Fan Qingchen)

233
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,180
Lingyu,

234
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,780
are you so eager to run away from me?

235
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,380
(Luo Lingyu)

236
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,540
The thief escaped.

237
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,100
The account book got lost.

238
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,940
The bride ran away.

239
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,500
Good job. Look what you did.

240
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,740
I'm so sorry!

241
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:00,980
Please punish me!

242
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,620
That thief sneaked in during chaos,

243
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,060
grabbed the account book quickly,

244
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,100
and ran away.

245
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,300
Few could pull that off.

246
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,180
It must've been premeditated.

247
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,540
I wonder what exactly they know.

248
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,940
Send a letter to Yuezhou immediately.

249
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,180
Yes, sir.

250
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,740
I'll check out that thief.

251
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,100
What's lost

252
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,980
must be recovered intact.

253
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,420
No error is allowed.

254
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,620
I'll bring him

255
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,100
or his body back.

256
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,620
You have my word, sir.

257
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,500
Scram!

258
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,420
Mr. and Mrs. Luo are still
waiting in the front hall, sir.

259
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:56,980
Let's go.

260
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:11,340
Luo Lingyu was out of her mind and did this.

261
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,460
- Right.
- She fooled us, too.

262
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,980
It's all our fault.

263
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,180
Well...

264
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:23,500
We'll return all the betrothal gifts.

265
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:27,860
Please forgive us, Young Master Fan.

266
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,780
I've given you the money.

267
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,740
There's no way I'll take it back.

268
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,860
Lingyu and I have married.

269
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,780
She'll forever be one of us.

270
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,660
Indeed.

271
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,540
But she ran away...

272
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,180
Then find her.

273
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,060
You raised her for years, Mr. Luo.

274
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,620
Do you know where she'll go?

275
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,020
- We...
- She lost her parents.

276
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,300
My wife and I pitied her

277
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,660
- and adopted her.
- Yes.

278
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,460
We treated her as our own for so long.

279
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,100
Who knows where that ingrate

280
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,740
will go?

281
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,180
I know!

282
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,580
She has a relative in Yuezhou.

283
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,500
I bet she'll go there.

284
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,420
Will Aunt Ying take us in?

285
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,180
I doubt it. After Uncle died in battle,

286
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,660
she went to live with her family in Yuezhou.

287
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,500
We've only exchanged a few letters.

288
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,740
I don't think we're too close.

289
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,700
Although

290
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:37,620
the great Lu Clan won't drive us out,

291
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,540
we'll have to find a way

292
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,020
to stay for as long as possible.

293
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:41,860
My Lady,

294
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:44,340
what are you going to do once we arrive?

295
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,740
Go on taking in a husband

296
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,860
to regain my inheritance.

297
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,860
You and Fan Qingchen got married earlier.

298
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,100
How can you marry someone else?

299
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,740
I never wanted to marry him.

300
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,740
That wedding was against my will.

301
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,980
I won't sacrifice the rest of my life for it.

302
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,620
Besides, we're going to Yuezhou.

303
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,540
I don't think

304
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,380
he'll come so far to find me.

305
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,740
If she's going to Yuezhou,

306
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,500
that'll be great.

307
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,980
Once I finish everything here,

308
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:17,380
I'll bring her back myself.

309
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:21,220
Well then, may you get her back soon.

310
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:22,660
Yes.

311
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,180
We'll take our leave.

312
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:30,980
Let's go. Go.

313
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,500
Lingyu,

314
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,220
you know what?

315
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,100
You are mine,

316
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,420
alive or dead.

317
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,700
You've been calculating for a while.

318
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,780
Are you hungry, Sister?

319
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,660
Is your stomach growling, Hua?

320
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,140
Sorry. Go to sleep and you won't feel it.

321
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,380
I'll get you something to eat tomorrow.

322
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,420
There's food on board.

323
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,900
Here you go, ladies.

324
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,540
- Thank you, sir!
- Thank you, sir!

325
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:26,900
You're welcome.

326
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,260
Flat buns.

327
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,140
Mr. Zhou is living a frugal life.

328
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,540
This is satiating food.

329
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,660
I can't bite through it.

330
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,300
Hua,

331
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:46,980
just imagine

332
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,740
this is a bite of braised pork.

333
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,720
This is a bite of sauced beef.

334
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,940
Pork with preserved vegetables.

335
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:53,900
Yuck!

336
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:58,020
We aren't going to
eat this all the way, are we?

337
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,020
I can try to get fish for you.

338
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,060
Great!

339
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,140
You used to catch big fish a lot.

340
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,700
This is easy.

341
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,540
Of course.

342
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,860
As delicate as you seem,

343
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,380
you're quite skilled.

344
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,180
I'm sure you'll get big fish tonight.

345
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,900
- Thank you.
- Here.

346
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,300
There will be fish soup

347
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,140
for everyone.

348
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,810
- We can make it once we get fish.
- Thanks.

349
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,780
Come here, big fish.

350
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,540
Here, fish, fish, fish.

351
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:47,660
- A bite!
- There it is!

352
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,300
Be careful, My Lady.

353
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,780
- Careful!
- Don't fall, Sister!

354
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:57,900
It must be a big one.

355
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,140
We can make braised fish and fish soup.

356
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,220
Great!

357
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,060
I'll help you.

358
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,180
- Pull it.
- Sister.

359
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,500
Pull.

360
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,300
Be careful, Sister.

361
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,140
It's huge!

362
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,380
Try again.

363
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:18,900
Here it comes.

364
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,780
Here it is, Sister!

365
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,420
Sister...

366
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,500
That's...

367
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,140
a human, not a fish.

368
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,380
What are you doing, Sister?

369
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,060
Let him go.

370
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,940
You rescued my toy.

371
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,140
Why not help this man?

372
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,620
Given the arrow in him

373
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:57,740
and his black attire,

374
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:58,780
he must be hunted.

375
00:19:58,940 --> 00:19:59,780
We can't take risks.

376
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:04,180
Sister, when Jingyang fell,

377
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,500
had someone helped our parents,

378
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,180
maybe our family wouldn't have been ruined.

379
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,420
My Lady.

380
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,540
Lingxi!

381
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,420
My Lady!

382
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,780
I'll help you, Sister.

383
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:45,780
The more we know,

384
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,000
the closer we are to danger.

385
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,160
Sister, he's wounded.

386
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,180
If the arrow stays in him,

387
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,380
he'll still die.

388
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,100
I'll ask the boatman to row ashore

389
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,180
and find a physician.

390
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,660
I'll go with you.

391
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:57,740
Sure.

392
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,900
Come on, Lingxi!

393
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,900
Did you pull out the arrow, Sister?

394
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:15,140
What if you made him die?

395
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,020
We barely know him.

396
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,180
We've done our best to get him on board.

397
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:20,860
If he ends up dead,

398
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,660
that's his fate.

399
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:27,180
(What a heartless girl.)

400
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,180
Lingxi, fetch the medicine chest.

401
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,260
Yes.

402
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,740
My Lady.

403
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,900
Sister, this is the last bottle

404
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,300
of the healing powder left by our parents.

405
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,660
When you had a big cut on your hand

406
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,860
and lost so much blood, you didn't use it.

407
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,020
Sister,

408
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,300
I was wrong about you.

409
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,140
You wanted to help him, didn't you?

410
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,500
If he died on board,

411
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,260
he'd ruin our good fortune.

412
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,500
You're always all bark and no bite.

413
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,260
What a jinx.

414
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:55,300
So good! Sister's soup is the best!

415
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,620
It smells so good, My Lady!

416
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,780
So much fish.

417
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,860
Lingxi, bring it to the boatman.

418
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,100
He's helped us a lot.

419
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,020
We should thank him.

420
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,270
Sure, My Lady.

421
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,310
I'll bring it to him later.

422
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,100
This is for him.

423
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,020
We'll share the rest.

424
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,580
There's no fish in that bowl at all.

425
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,740
Mr. Mask is extremely weak.

426
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,580
He needs to eat meat

427
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,980
to recover quickly.

428
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,860
You probably don't know

429
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,260
weak people like him

430
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:40,260
can only digest liquid such as soup.

431
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,380
Hua, once we get off,

432
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,100
do not bring up Mr. Mask ever again.

433
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,100
Why, Sister?

434
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,620
We're girls,

435
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,180
and we got a man on board.

436
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:52,620
If such news reached Yuezhou,

437
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,910
how could I take in a husband
to regain our property?

438
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,100
Great success is ahead of us.

439
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,020
It can be ruined by an anonymous man.

440
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,380
Let's try the soup.

441
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,100
Great! I want fish!

442
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:08,940
Yes, My Lady.

443
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,540
Eat up.

444
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,300
- No...
- Yun.

445
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:18,020
- Don't, Mother!
- Your father is missing.

446
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,660
He might be alive or dead.

447
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:23,900
What's worse, he's guilty of treason.

448
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,700
The two of us

449
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,980
have lost all hope of living.

450
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,180
It's time to end everything, son.

451
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,140
Father would never be a traitor!

452
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:34,780
No!

453
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,180
You still have me, Mother!

454
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,540
- We'll be fine!
- It's too hard to live on.

455
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:40,500
Don't!

456
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:43,780
- It's too hard to keep going.
- No...

457
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,780
I give up.

458
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:55,840
♪It's hard to see through fate♪

459
00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:02,240
♪I sit alone amid the down pour at night♪

460
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:09,950
♪The single string broke; half a bed's cold♪

461
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:16,410
♪A cup of wine can't drown my loneliness♪

462
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,380
Let go.

463
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,020
Finally, you're awake.

464
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,100
Use some more healing powder

465
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,780
and you'll be fine.

466
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,660
What did you see in your dream?

467
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,500
Your arms were flailing wildly.

468
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,260
Now that you're up,

469
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,740
have the soup yourself.

470
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:42,700
Sister,

471
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,300
there's no soup left.

472
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,660
I'll destroy that thief who stole my dowry!

473
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:48,710
Hadn't it been for him,

474
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,500
we would've had some of it left.

475
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,180
- Yes.
- We would've lived much better

476
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,580
- (Wait.)
- and had enough food.

477
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,300
(Dowry? Is she also a run-away bride?)

478
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,660
Luckily, I grabbed that wedding gown.

479
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,420
We can pawn it later.

480
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,740
Or things would be even worse.

481
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,020
Let me fold the gown.

482
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,820
Help! Catch the thief!

483
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:20,860
That's my horse!

484
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,500
(It's her!)

485
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,660
(She ruined my plan)

486
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,380
(and stole my horse.)

487
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,310
- What's wrong?
- Lingxi.

488
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,300
I'll go check.

489
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,060
My Lady...

490
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,740
There isn't enough soup for everyone,

491
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,260
yet you spilled so much.

492
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,260
Thank you for saving my life.

493
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,180
I'm...

494
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,820
"Thank you." Is that all you've got?

495
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:14,660
That's it?

496
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,300
Will that put food on the table?

497
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,260
Trust me, Miss.

498
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,380
You saved my life.

499
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:34,660
I promise to pay you back.

500
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,540
If you're poor, just say it.

501
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,100
I've heard enough empty promises.

502
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,660
Listen, if you really want to thank me,

503
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,540
let's set a few ground rules.

504
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,780
I'm all ears.

505
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:52,020
First, never take off your mask.

506
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,740
Pretend we never met.

507
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:56,100
Don't tell anyone what happened on board.

508
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:59,020
Second, never enter the cabin.

509
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,900
You're a man. Stay away from us girls.

510
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,620
It's cold outside.

511
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:04,700
I'm still weak...

512
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,260
Hadn't we lent a hand,

513
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,900
you'd have been frozen to death in the water.

514
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,380
Besides, we've left you here for so long,

515
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,100
and you're getting better.

516
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,420
How come you...?

517
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,260
Third,

518
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:16,900
be quiet.

519
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,060
Follow my rules

520
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,100
to get the powder.

521
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,100
Or a small infection

522
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,260
can kill you.

523
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,260
Fine.

524
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,260
I'll follow them.

525
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,020
Don't spill the powder.

526
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,660
She of all people saved me.

527
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,500
Unbelievable!

528
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:51,860
Hua,

529
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,540
your sister said not to go outside.

530
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:02,420
(Zhou)

531
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,980
You look much better.

532
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,260
That's a relief.

533
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,740
Thanks for your help.

534
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,340
Once we arrive in Yuezhou,

535
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:05,380
I will thank you properly.

536
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,660
Have some food.

537
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,140
(Why is she suddenly being so nice?)

538
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,300
There's a long way ahead of you.

539
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:30,260
You'll need a lot of energy.

540
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,780
What do you mean?

541
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,300
Why not cut to the chase?

542
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,140
As I said before,

543
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:43,220
traveling with a man is inconvenient.

544
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,380
We don't want others to talk.

545
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,100
Yuezhou isn't too far away.

546
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,380
It's time for you to get off.

547
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:49,660
Get off?

548
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:53,660
Here?

549
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:01,940
Miss,

550
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,020
my wound hasn't healed.

551
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,780
- I...
- Don't be too modest.

552
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,260
You were much stronger

553
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,940
and healthier than most people.

554
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,660
I gave you the best healing powder

555
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:12,860
to treat your wound.

556
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:13,940
It hasn't healed yet,

557
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,420
but it's fine.

558
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,140
Look,

559
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,980
the dock is only hundreds of meters away.

560
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,780
You weren't drowned after being shot.

561
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,500
I'm sure you can make it now.

562
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,140
What if...?

563
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,100
What if I didn't survive?

564
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,420
You're a risk-taker.

565
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,660
Are you afraid of risk?

566
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,140
If something did happen to you,

567
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,220
that'd be your doom.

568
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,500
Just pretend I never saved you.

569
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,740
(Listen to her.)

570
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:49,780
(Was she born to make me suffer?)

571
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:51,500
Fine.

572
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,140
May I know your name, Miss?

573
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,980
If we meet again,

574
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,980
I'll repay you for your kindness.

575
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:01,180
No need. I didn't help you to get paid.

576
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,460
Please keep in mind those rules.

577
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:06,540
If we meet again, pretend we're strangers.

578
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,420
Sir,

579
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,380
you may go.

580
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,220
What was that sound, My Lady?

581
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,700
That man jumped into the water.

582
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,740
Why would he do that?

583
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:43,620
I asked him to.

584
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,460
Yuezhou is right ahead.

585
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:49,860
We can't go ashore with a man and stranger

586
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,780
who was hunted by others.

587
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,060
You do have a point.

588
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,780
He's strong.

589
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,220
His wound healed fast.

590
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,700
I'm sure he can swim to the shore.

591
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:04,860
My Lady,

592
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,860
Miss Hua is still sleeping.

593
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,020
What should we tell her when she wakes up?

594
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:13,020
Tell her he left to attend to something.

595
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:13,860
Alright.

596
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,900
We'll dock soon, My Lady.

597
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,180
Let's freshen up.

598
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:24,980
Sure.

599
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:38,100
(Yuezhou)
Sachets. Jewelry.

600
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:41,620
Miss, check out these sachets and jewelry.

601
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:44,180
Take a look. It's beautiful.

602
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,100
It's good.

603
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,780
That one looks nice, too.

604
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,140
(Prince Changyi)

605
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,540
Your Highness, scouts along the way

606
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,980
said Zhou's boat would arrive today.

607
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:03,140
Your Highness, the top of that boat

608
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,220
is red.

609
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,860
According to Master Zhou's letter,

610
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,300
that's Zhou's red-top boat!

611
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:10,660
Yuezhou is right ahead of us.

612
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,260
It's a city of goodies.

613
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,980
Hua, how do I look?

614
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,140
Oh...

615
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,900
I'm tired.

616
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:25,300
You said it'd only take
half an incense stick of time.

617
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,900
But now, it's been one and a half.

618
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,860
I'm exhausted!

619
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:31,220
Hang in there, Hua.

620
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,340
Be steady. Don't sway

621
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,420
with the boat.

622
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:35,700
I'm almost done.

623
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,860
We'll visit a prominent family in Yuezhou.

624
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,220
I have to be loudly dressed.

625
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,820
If I showed up underdressed,

626
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:44,700
others would look down on us.

627
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:48,580
My Lady, I just took a glance at the dock.

628
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:50,100
It was huge and bustling!

629
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,100
What if... what if they see

630
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,020
Sister's unmatched look

631
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:56,500
and surge forward?

632
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:00,100
The more the people,
the bigger the influence,

633
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:02,860
and the greater my fame in Yuezhou.

634
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,140
I'm going to tell everyone in town

635
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:08,180
the fairest of Shuozhou, Luo Lingyu, is here!

636
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,340
Then I can take in a husband for sure

637
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,350
and regain my inheritance.

638
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,140
Lingxi, fetch my veiled hat, please.

639
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,380
Yes, My Lady.

640
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:55,020
Sister, how come no one is looking at you?

641
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:10,180
The hat must've covered my entire face.

642
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,140
Lingxi.

643
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:15,180
Are you sure, My Lady?

644
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,220
Harder, Lingxi!

645
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:41,460
Keep fanning!

646
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,300
Sure.

647
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:47,820
That's too much! Easy now.

648
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:50,100
- Easy.
- Alright.

649
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,220
Easy, easy.

650
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:57,860
Look. How beautiful!

651
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,660
Yes. So gorgeous!

652
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,620
That's a big crowd, My Lady.

653
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,180
So pretty!

654
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,140
Let's go. Come on.

655
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:08,260
Come on!

656
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:09,820
Go, go, go! Let's go!

657
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:10,660
Go!

658
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:11,940
- Hurry.
- Let's go.

659
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:13,460
Come on!

660
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,100
There's enough.

661
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,300
My Lady, what's wrong with the locals?

662
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,500
There's enough.

663
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:21,380
What's going on, Sister?

664
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:22,820
- How many do you want?
- One.

665
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,740
Excuse me, kind ladies.

666
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,020
I have enough. Don't worry.

667
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,460
Can you step aside, please?

668
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,780
I need to get on board.

669
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:41,380
(Yuezhou Ferry)

670
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,780
The people of Yuezhou are strange.

671
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:46,540
A one-of-a-kind beauty is right here.

672
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,940
How come they're turning a blind...?

673
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,380
These flowers are good.

674
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,460
- What a nice color.
- Yes.

675
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:58,460
Let's keep going.

676
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:59,940
Sure. Let's go over there.

677
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,460
Although you're as dazzling as a peony,

678
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,060
those of Yuezhou

679
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:06,220
prefer elegant jasmine.

680
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:08,740
All women are beautiful and charming.

681
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,100
They're unique belles.

682
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,140
I'm not a peony

683
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,260
or jasmine.

684
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,500
I'm a flower of my own kind.

685
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,660
The real esthetes

686
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,700
appreciate all kinds of flowers.

687
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:27,300
- Look. That young man's loudly dressed.
- Pendants.

688
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,310
- He looks sophisticated
- Take a look.

689
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:31,940
and has good taste.

690
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:39,500
Greetings, Miss Zhou.

691
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,780
I'm Liu. Nice to meet you.

692
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:43,460
Zhou?

693
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,220
You're indeed what they say, Miss Zhou.

694
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,340
How ethereal,

695
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,220
pretty, and wise.

696
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:52,540
I'm flattered, Mr. Liu,

697
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:56,460
but I'm a Luo, not a Zhou.

698
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,900
My apologies,

699
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:01,420
but isn't this Zhou's boat from Wuzhou?

700
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:03,540
(Zhou)

701
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:06,740
I borrowed it.

702
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,940
I don't know whose boat it is.

703
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:11,500
Where's its owner?

704
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:18,980
That I don't know.

705
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,080
Sorry for troubling you.

706
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,220
Good day.

707
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:33,460
Sister, did he mistake you for someone else?

708
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:37,420
He must be looking for a beauty.

709
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:40,380
It's understandable that he made a mistake.

710
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,380
We'll become a household name

711
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:43,660
as we were in Shuozhou.

712
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:44,940
As for now,

713
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,220
let's go to the Lu Mansion.

714
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,500
Check out these flowers, sir.

715
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:50,700
Sister.

716
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:51,940
Take a look!

717
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:52,900
Look, Miss.

718
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,460
Fresh flowers picked this morning.

719
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:55,780
Take a look. Do you want some?

720
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:56,620
- No, no.
- Miss,

721
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:58,020
these buns are our specialties.

722
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:59,700
No, thanks. Thank you.

723
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:02,220
(Have Your Fortune Told)
Miss, you're in bad luck.

724
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:04,380
Would you like to hear my divination

725
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:06,420
- to guide you?
- No, thanks.

726
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:07,300
(Yuezhou Ferry)

727
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,300
I don't need it. Thanks.

728
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:09,300
- No, thanks.
- Sorry.

729
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,220
I really don't need it.

730
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:13,780
Thanks but no.

731
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:23,020
- Sachets and pendants.
- Tasty haws on a stick.

732
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:23,900
One, please.

733
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:26,100
(Lu Mansion)
Sure. Take a look.

734
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:27,940
It's been three days.

735
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:30,420
Why isn't Young Master back yet?

736
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:33,020
Did something happen to him?

737
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:37,480
Hey, you!

738
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:38,700
It was your fault.

739
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:40,900
Couldn't you keep him safe?

740
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:42,780
I should've gone

741
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:43,700
to Shuozhou with you.

742
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:47,260
Stop pacing back and forth.

743
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:55,460
Young Master!

744
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:57,300
- Young Master!
- Sir!

745
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:58,460
Young Master...

746
00:43:58,900 --> 00:43:59,740
Don't panic.

747
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:01,300
I'm fine.

748
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:04,060
How did it go?

749
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:05,460
Is the book safe?

750
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:06,300
Yes, Young Master.

751
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:08,420
Here it is.

752
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:10,780
Good job.

753
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:13,620
Did you find anything else?

754
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:14,500
I found traces

755
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:16,700
of saltpeter in Fan's warehouse.

756
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:19,500
Those people were cunning.

757
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:20,980
They had moved it somewhere else.

758
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:24,700
I just returned from Shuozhou.

759
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:26,780
I don't want them to be alerted.

760
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:29,260
The saltpeter must be reported immediately.

761
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:32,260
Go to Prince Changyi's Mansion

762
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:33,740
and tell everything to Aman.

763
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:34,980
Yes.

764
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,260
- Young Master!
- You're wounded!

765
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:40,620
What happened? You look terrible!

766
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:41,940
Things didn't go well.

767
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:46,620
Quite a lot of them.

768
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:48,100
Alright. Enough.

769
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,770
I'll have them run you an herbal bath

770
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:50,900
to soothe your body.

771
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:55,700
I don't want to soak in the water ever again!

772
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:58,100
(Lu Mansion)

773
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:06,700
Sister,

774
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:10,420
are we getting off
on the wrong foot like they say?

775
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:12,740
Relax.

776
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:14,620
This is only a little setback.

777
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:15,940
It's nothing.

778
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:17,700
We have to follow the protocol.

779
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:20,100
Lingxi, present the visiting letter.
