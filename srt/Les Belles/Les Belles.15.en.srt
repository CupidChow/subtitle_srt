=Episode 15=

23
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,250
Why did you ask me to meet here?

24
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,250
There are so many people.

25
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,740
Xunmei House belongs to me.

26
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,580
It's much safer than your mansion.

27
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:54,890
Did you come to talk to me suddenly

28
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,450
just to show off

29
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,380
as the owner of Xunmei House?

30
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:00,170
This way, please.

31
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:10,460
Why is he also here?

32
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:12,980
Alright, alright.

33
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,010
Sit down and talk.

34
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:15,450
Have a seat.

35
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,220
Previously, because of Fan Qingchen,

36
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,380
I had doubts about you.

37
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,970
I apologize to you now.

38
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:34,130
What act are you putting on now?

39
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:35,860
A tactical retreat,

40
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,900
or luring the enemy in?

41
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,380
Whether you believe it or not,

42
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:41,580
we never intended

43
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,780
to become your enemy.

44
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,620
It sounds nicer than it is,

45
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,850
yet you often target me.

46
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,570
Who doesn't know

47
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,100
that if I were to die,

48
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,970
you would benefit the most.

49
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,290
- Your Highness...
- What do you mean?

50
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,570
I've never competed with you.

51
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,700
You've been guarding the borders all years.

52
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,930
You must be overly cautious.

53
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:02,770
Aman...

54
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,380
I just want to lead troops to battle,

55
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,100
and protect southern Yuezhou's peace.

56
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,450
I'm not looking for to compete.

57
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:09,220
- Your Highness...
- Me neither.

58
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,770
What's wrong? Not satisfied?

59
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,100
- Not satisfied.
- Let's wrestle.

60
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,210
Wrestle? No, not wrestling.

61
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:14,260
Not wrestling.

62
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,560
- Recitation.
- Recitation?

63
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,620
No recitation.

64
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,490
- Wrestle.
- Recitation.

65
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,480
- Wrestle.
- Recitation.

66
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:19,940
- Wrestling.
- Recitation.

67
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,920
- Wrestle.
- Recitation.

68
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,010
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

69
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,220
You don't want to compete.

70
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,270
Neither do you.

71
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,610
Neither of you wants to compete.

72
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,130
Yet you don't seem to get along.

73
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:28,900
If the instigator knows it,

74
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,770
he must thank both of you for this.

75
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:31,610
Isn't that so?

76
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,410
Alright, back to business.

77
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,180
Now the Fan Clan is confiscated.

78
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,130
Only Fan Qingchen remains alive.

79
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,530
We can only follow this lead.

80
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,850
But my team escorting Fan Qingchen

81
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,130
met danger on the way.

82
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,780
The soldier who survived said

83
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,130
Fan Qingchen also died there.

84
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,060
Can't you see it?

85
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,570
They found that the Fan Clan is useless

86
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,180
and just eliminated him early.

87
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,540
Your Highness,

88
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,730
the route of your return to the capital

89
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,130
should also be known to others, right?

90
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,010
Those returning with me

91
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,690
are my henchmen.

92
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:15,730
Besides, everyone was attacked together.

93
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,490
It might be a ruse, who knows.

94
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:24,610
In any case, we must act cautiously.

95
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,930
Alright, alright.

96
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,530
I have a plan for this matter.

97
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:35,140
No need for both of you to worry.

98
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,660
Just take care of yourselves.

99
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:38,830
No need to walk me out.

100
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,140
He's still so contradictory.

101
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,540
He has always been like this.

102
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,140
It's already this time.

103
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,120
The Family School should be over.

104
00:04:58,410 --> 00:04:59,900
Mr. Zhou should be done with class.

105
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,700
You value Zhou Zibo so much?

106
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,610
Mr. Zhou is gentle and refined,

107
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:06,780
and very knowledgeable.

108
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,340
Let me tell you,

109
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,050
he can even grow chives,

110
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,270
and all sorts of vegetables.

111
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,700
He can also make Lard and Chive Pie.

112
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,260
Mr. Zhou is different from anyone

113
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:17,700
whom I have ever met.

114
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,730
A dignified prince loves growing vegetables.

115
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,050
Zhou Zibo truly has a unique charm.

116
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,610
Xuechen,

117
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,530
- you don't know him well.
- Great, Lingxi.

118
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:28,490
Keep the contract safe.

119
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,700
- Don't lose it.
- Okay, Miss.

120
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,900
Why are they here?

121
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,820
Only you can manage this.

122
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,330
You were so eloquent

123
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,290
that profit-driven Mei Qiniang

124
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:45,950
finally conceded.

125
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,580
It was a forced move.

126
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,580
In my current situation,

127
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,020
the only reliable thing

128
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,900
is my unbeatable tongue.

129
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:06,370
(What is Miss Luo doing at Xunmei House?)

130
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,130
Qiuyue,

131
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:11,220
what are you looking at?

132
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:12,490
It's nothing.

133
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,460
Miss, let's go.

134
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,370
Would you like some pea flour cakes?

135
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:23,700
No, I don't want any.

136
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,730
Just take a look.

137
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:25,930
Look, look here.

138
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,210
Cloth tiger.

139
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:28,730
- Little tiger.
- Miss, look at this.

140
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,180
Such big eyes, just like yours.

141
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,490
- Get it if you want.
- So cute.

142
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:35,180
(Zhang's Locust Leaf Noodles)

143
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,140
And this one.

144
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:49,970
Lantern.

145
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,650
- Lantern.
- Miss, look.

146
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:52,530
Miss, that one.

147
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:54,050
Lantern.

148
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:55,620
- This one's cute.
- Look.

149
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,460
Take a look.

150
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,100
Miss Luo,

151
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,710
- what a coincidence.
- Candied hawthorns.

152
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,730
Sir, how much is it?

153
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:09,490
Miss, I can give you a discount.

154
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,290
Sir, which one is better?

155
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,530
They are all sweet and good.

156
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:18,370
I'll

157
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,580
take them all.

158
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:34,220
I buy them for Hua.

159
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:35,730
Take them all home.

160
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,820
Mr. Lu, do you understand moderation?

161
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,340
Lingxi.

162
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:44,930
Miss, come take a look.

163
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,660
Wait a moment.

164
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,740
- It's for you.
- For me?

165
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,610
Miss, choose one.

166
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,530
Miss Luo, what a coincidence.

167
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,340
I can meet you on the street.

168
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,850
Is it? I don't think so.

169
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,290
Times truly change.

170
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,020
I didn't expect

171
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:08,050
that Mr. Lu chases Miss Luo one day.

172
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:11,140
Miss, look at this. It suits you.

173
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,850
The jasmine flower is perfect for you.

174
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,020
That's right.

175
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,550
- Madam...
- No matter how good it is,

176
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,020
it is still picked by anyone.

177
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,580
I don't like it.

178
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,140
- Sure.
- Miss, take another look.

179
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,970
It's too plain. It is not suitable for you.

180
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,620
You have sharp eyes. It suits you best.

181
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,820
This one is nice. Madam.

182
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,340
This style doesn't suit me.

183
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,540
Feels a bit dowdy.

184
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,180
Please have a look over here.

185
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:36,530
Take a look here.

186
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:39,530
You have a great eye.

187
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:40,460
This suits you as well.

188
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,300
This one is better.

189
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:42,890
Madam.

190
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,580
I don't like this color.

191
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,820
I fear it might clash with me.

192
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,370
What do you really want?

193
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:53,410
I

194
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:57,460
want the grass target with candied hawthorns.

195
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,250
Lingxi, let's go.

196
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,300
Miss Luo.

197
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,220
(Chen Mansion)

198
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,220
Mr. Chen.

199
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,850
Mr. Kong, please have a seat.

200
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,460
The tea is ready for you.

201
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,100
From now on, we'll meet here.

202
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,650
I've ordered to kill Fan Qingchen.

203
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,650
All evidence related to us

204
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,340
in the Fan Mansion of Shuozhou

205
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,060
has been erased.

206
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:23,700
They won't trace it back to us soon.

207
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,130
You are always cautious in plans.

208
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,730
There's only one thing I don't understand.

209
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,300
Prince Hengyang returned to the capital.

210
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,540
I sent elite soldiers to kill him.

211
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:40,730
I thought with your cooperation,

212
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,540
he couldn't return alive.

213
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,060
But why

214
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:48,850
did it fail?

215
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:51,730
You recklessly assassinated him

216
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,370
without informing me beforehand.

217
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,700
I don't know the intricacies.

218
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,770
How could I cooperate?

219
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,250
Really?

220
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:07,250
Can you not recognize our own people

221
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,370
or did you deliberately cooperate

222
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,970
to help him escape?

223
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:16,130
Can you truly distinguish in your heart?

224
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,100
What do you mean by this?

225
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:20,180
I am worried about you.

226
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:23,300
You have been with the North Army

227
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:25,220
for many years.

228
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,410
Do you have a feeling of affection

229
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:30,610
for Prince Hengyang?

230
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,130
Mr. Chen,

231
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:34,490
you're overthinking it.

232
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:36,810
I have linked his assassination

233
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:39,180
to Prince Changyi and Young Master Lu,

234
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:41,940
causing discord among the three of them.

235
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,770
Compared to killing a general,

236
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:49,770
causing internal strife benefits us more.

237
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,730
What about the ledger?

238
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,460
If the secret letters are deciphered,

239
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,250
it will be a big problem.

240
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,610
I have already arranged it.

241
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,850
I will make sure that the ledger

242
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:11,060
disappears with the person who stole it.

243
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:14,010
Come, have some tea.

244
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:30,100
Mr. Lu has been quite annoying lately.

245
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,940
He finds excuses to meet me every day.

246
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,820
It's really disturbing.

247
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,990
I want to try on the outfit for the Contest,

248
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,580
so I had to hide here.

249
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:42,370
If you want to try, then try.

250
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:44,650
Why should I wear it?

251
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,010
Don't move.

252
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:49,890
If I put it on,

253
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,940
how can I see the effect?

254
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,770
Naturally, I need a lady

255
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,370
to put it on and show me.

256
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:58,770
But there're many ladies in the Lu Clan.

257
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:00,460
Don't speak.

258
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,060
Smile.

259
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,250
Have you changed yet?

260
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,300
Almost, almost.

261
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:21,540
Miss Luo, what are you doing here?

262
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,100
Your...

263
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,100
Your...

264
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:28,370
Is it long?

265
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,970
Isn't the sleeve supposed to be like this?

266
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,340
You...

267
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:47,420
You are...

268
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,130
You are Zibo...

269
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,530
I...

270
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:54,370
His...

271
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:55,860
sister?

272
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,220
Yes.

273
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,130
Indeed, Your Highness.

274
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,770
This is Zhou Zibo's sister,

275
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,650
Zhou Zitao.

276
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,130
No wonder she looks just like Zibo.

277
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,460
They are siblings,

278
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,990
so they naturally resemble each other.

279
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,980
Your Highness, what brings you here?

280
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,940
I came to discuss state matters with Zibo.

281
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,730
Is Zibo at home?

282
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,060
He's...

283
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:29,220
Zibo is not home today.

284
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,820
He went to visit a friend

285
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:32,690
and won't be back.

286
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:34,970
He asked me to take care of Zitao.

287
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:39,100
Zibo seems to

288
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:40,770
get on with Miss Luo.

289
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,010
Very well.

290
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,850
Then I'll come another day.

291
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:46,940
Alright.

292
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:48,650
Aman.

293
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:50,890
Xuechen?

294
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,020
How come you're here too?

295
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:00,890
I...

296
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:03,930
(What do you want to say?)

297
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:04,770
(Guess.)

298
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:08,340
I'm worried Miss Luo might neglect...

299
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,820
(Don't you dare!)

300
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,490
Mr. Zhou's sister. I came to help.

301
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,610
You're worried about Miss Luo.

302
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,700
Mr. Zhou and you truly are siblings.

303
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,770
Both are knowledgeable about crops.

304
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,970
(Does Prince Changyi recognize me?)

305
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,370
(No, I can't let him become suspicious.)

306
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:53,530
These chives are growing very well.

307
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:54,490
This is green onions.

308
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,060
Green onions?

309
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,340
Then this must be chives, right?

310
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:01,460
This is weeds.

311
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,650
I didn't expect that as a prince,

312
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,940
you know farming even better than I do.

313
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,610
These and those,

314
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:15,940
as well as these,

315
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,130
are all chives.

316
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,410
Chive leaves are long and flat,

317
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:21,460
and they are thick.

318
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:22,620
They have a waxy surface,

319
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,730
with a strong fragrance.

320
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:25,010
They are unique from others.

321
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:28,970
Zibo taught me all this.

322
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,820
My brother is always so rigid.

323
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:35,700
How can he teach you such boring things?

324
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:37,500
Please don't be offended.

325
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,100
I'll criticize him another day.

326
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:40,730
Absolutely not.

327
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:43,010
Agriculture is the foundation of life.

328
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:45,610
Besides, Zibo is very knowledgeable.

329
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,490
His words are often very enlightening.

330
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:48,580
He's witty and humorous,

331
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:49,970
it's not boring at all.

332
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:51,540
He's great.

333
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:54,940
That day,

334
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:56,990
we stood in the field for the first time.

335
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,700
He said chives have no memory.

336
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:01,700
They keep growing after being cut,

337
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,940
just like generations of loyal subjects.

338
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,450
One generation grows old,

339
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:09,470
and new ones take on the responsibilities.

340
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,150
This cycle ensures continued prosperity

341
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:13,540
and the peace of the nation.

342
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,410
(He remembers)

343
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:19,300
(every word I said.)

344
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,690
Did I say too much?

345
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:30,820
No, no.

346
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,740
You praise my brother like this.

347
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,690
I thank you on his behalf.

348
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,580
It's getting late.

349
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,820
Miss Luo is waiting for us.

350
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:45,170
Let's pick the vegetables quickly.

351
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,740
Alright.

352
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,820
So this is the chives, right?

353
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,580
The taste is indeed different.

354
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,820
Let me help you with that.

355
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,500
You know about their ties.

356
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,410
Why insist on keeping him for dinner?

357
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,300
If I hadn't kept him for dinner,

358
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,450
how would you have kept me here?

359
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:41,460
Be sure to use less pepper later.

360
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,500
I don't like pepper.

361
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:49,690
What are you doing?

362
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,370
I don't care.

363
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:02,530
Miss Luo, when you first came to the Lu Clan,

364
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:03,540
you weren't like this.

365
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,540
Back then, you...

366
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,130
I was eager to find a husband

367
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:09,170
and caused you some trouble.

368
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:12,060
Now, I have a way to reclaim the property.

369
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,060
In the future, I won't trouble you.

370
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:18,650
Actually, it's not much trouble.

371
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,610
Feel free to trouble me anytime.

372
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,290
In the future, you can continue...

373
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:25,290
Cause trouble again,

374
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,300
I won't finish in time.

375
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,100
This is

376
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:01,820
what you...

377
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:06,820
I intended to help,

378
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,170
but ended up hindering.

379
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:18,130
Lingyu.

380
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:25,260
You specially made it without pepper

381
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,170
to cater to Xuechen's taste.

382
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,370
So nice.

383
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:30,530
Really nice.

384
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,300
Zitao, let's eat from this plate.

385
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,740
Alright.

386
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:38,450
We have different tastes.

387
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,610
There's no need to sit at the same table.

388
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:41,450
Right?

389
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,500
Mr. Lu, what do you think?

390
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,580
Some things

391
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:53,210
might not be liked at first bite.

392
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,650
Have a few more bites, you'll enjoy it.

393
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:58,210
You...

394
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:03,650
Xuechen, don't force yourself.

395
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,300
It's not forced,

396
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,210
not at all.

397
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:20,540
Your Highness, you're right.

398
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:24,300
Most things in the world can't be forced,

399
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:28,260
like marriage,

400
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:31,450
engagements, weddings,

401
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,940
- Lingyu.
- and...

402
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,930
You've been roasting. You must be tired.

403
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,650
Have some.

404
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:44,020
This is more suitable for you to eat.

405
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:47,980
Why?

406
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,210
You are always so eloquent.

407
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,410
You always have something to say.

408
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,450
You must love bamboo shoots.

409
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,650
I don't hate them.

410
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,500
But Aman loves bamboo shoots more.

411
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:08,820
I'll let him have them.

412
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:15,170
Right.

413
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,610
Stop arguing. I'll eat.

414
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:20,610
So, for you,

415
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,340
you put the overall situation first.

416
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:25,780
Like or dislike doesn't matter, right?

417
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:30,780
Yes.

418
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:32,370
You are correct.

419
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:33,810
As a prince,

420
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,210
I must consider the big picture.

421
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:36,500
My preferences don't matter.

422
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:45,310
But I would regret dragging others down.

423
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:47,300
So I always feel guilty.

424
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:52,780
Forget it.

425
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,370
In people's interactions,

426
00:22:58,130 --> 00:22:59,260
either I owe you something,

427
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,300
or you owe me something.

428
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:05,340
It's never that simple to settle, is it?

429
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:23,820
Quick, Lingyu, have some water.

430
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:29,170
Are you okay?

431
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,010
Facing the consequences, aren't you?

432
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:33,690
Eat more vegetables.

433
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:41,170
Lingyu.

434
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,500
Don't just sit there, eat more.

435
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,980
Mr. Lu,

436
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,450
you truly go well with bamboo shoots.

437
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,370
If you spoke less,

438
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,610
it wouldn't have come to this.

439
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:04,060
Come, let's have this bowl.

440
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,020
Miss Luo, eat more,

441
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:07,370
so you have energy for dancing.

442
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:08,820
These chives are delicious.

443
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:10,970
So tasty.

444
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:16,180
(Chen Mansion)

445
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:19,060
Miss, fresh lamb was delivered today.

446
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,690
I made your favorite steamed lamb.

447
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:26,130
Xiu,

448
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:28,020
why are you being greedy again?

449
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:31,820
The Flower Goddess Contest is coming soon.

450
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:34,500
You've won the title for several years.

451
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,780
Everyone will certainly notice you.

452
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,340
Do not be complacent with past success.

453
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:41,450
You should learn to restrain yourself.

454
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:43,540
Your advice is wise.

455
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,290
A well-bred lady

456
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:47,690
must not eat more than three bites.

457
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,370
Prepare well for the Contest.

458
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:51,340
Yes, Father.

459
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,170
My Lord, Lady, Miss,

460
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,770
I've inquired from various sources.

461
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:58,300
They say Miss Luo will compete this year.

462
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,130
Miss Luo?

463
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:02,610
Is the one who performed

464
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:04,390
the Fiery Dance at the Zhongshan Banquet?

465
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:05,450
Exactly.

466
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:09,370
Miss Luo's Fiery Dance

467
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:11,100
was truly original.

468
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:14,580
She managed to please Prince Hengyang.

469
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,210
Though she was quick-witted,

470
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:18,820
her style was somewhat unsophisticated.

471
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,370
She is not suitable for the Contest.

472
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:25,060
At the Zhongshan Banquet,

473
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,780
she has already stolen the limelight.

474
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:28,300
In the Contest,

475
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,460
you must not be careless again.

476
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:32,170
Competing with her on stage,

477
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:33,890
to be honest,

478
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:36,740
I had a bit more expectation

479
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,130
for the Contest this time.

480
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:39,690
Father, Mother,

481
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:40,740
I won't eat anymore.

482
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,300
I'll prepare for the Contest.

483
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:44,210
For a grand event like this Contest,

484
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:46,450
you should be fully prepared.

485
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,930
Alright, go ahead.

486
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:58,410
Qiuyue.

487
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:15,540
(Looking at Miss Zhou's looks and figure,)

488
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,540
(compared to Zibo, they seem)

489
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:20,120
(more like one person than siblings.)

490
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:22,930
How could this be possible?

491
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,220
However,

492
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,740
Zibo never mentioned

493
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,580
having a younger sister to me.

494
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:30,890
Zibo's family name is Zhou.

495
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:34,610
When I met him,

496
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,930
I was searching for Zhou Yangling.

497
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,740
Could it really be such a coincidence?

498
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,300
Liu.

499
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:49,530
Your Highness.

500
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:50,580
Order someone

501
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:52,540
to bring Zhou Yangling's portrait.

502
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:53,540
Yes, Your Highness.

503
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,580
Miss, take it easy.

504
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,210
Qiniang said the dance is hard to perform.

505
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:09,890
Miss.

506
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:12,770
Miss, are you okay?

507
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:13,820
Be careful.

508
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:16,450
Miss, are you okay?

509
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:17,690
I'm fine.

510
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,540
I'll be fine after applying an ice pack.

511
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:22,020
Miss, this dance is too difficult.

512
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,090
Why insist on dancing this dance?

513
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:25,980
The Contest is filled with talents.

514
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:29,020
Miss Chen has won the title for years.

515
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,570
She must have extraordinary talent.

516
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,410
If I don't show some unique skills,

517
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,850
how can I possibly win?

518
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,340
Miss,

519
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,170
look at all the bruises on your feet.

520
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:40,450
You work too hard.

521
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:43,300
Lingxi, we finally found a way

522
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:44,980
to reclaim the family property.

523
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,610
I'm willing to endure any hardship.

524
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,300
It's still early.

525
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,820
I'll practice a some more.

526
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,610
Miss...

527
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:54,970
Miss...

528
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,850
I didn't expect Miss Luo

529
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:03,890
to have such determination and grit.

530
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,850
Sadly, the Qipan Dance is difficult.

531
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:09,610
To step on the beat every time,

532
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:12,690
she has to practice
for nearly half a year.

533
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:17,890
Help me give this to her.

534
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,610
It seems Miss Luo holds a special place

535
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:30,100
in your heart.

536
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:35,020
If that's the case,

537
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,290
why not give it to her yourself?

538
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:38,690
If she knows it's from me,

539
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:40,060
she won't accept it.

540
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:43,170
There's always a counter for everything.

541
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:46,540
I didn't expect you

542
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:49,130
to also become so affectionate.

543
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:51,780
I...

544
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,500
Miss Luo.

545
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,340
- Qiniang.
- Let's stop here for today.

546
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,650
Don't stretch it.

547
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,530
If you keep practicing like this,

548
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:06,070
when the Flower Goddess Contest arrives,

549
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,890
you might not be able to lift your leg.

550
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,410
Hurry and apply the medicine.

551
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:11,690
This medicine is...

552
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:13,290
This

553
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:15,610
is the most expensive medicated oil.

554
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,330
It heals minor injuries

555
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:19,300
instantly.

556
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,740
I was reluctant to give it to you.

557
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:27,610
If you don't want it,

558
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,370
I will take it back.

559
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:31,930
This is your kindness.

560
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,540
How could I refuse it?

561
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,100
Thank you.

562
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,650
Why does it take so many turns

563
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:46,020
for him to do some good deeds?

564
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:49,130
Miss, what are you saying?

565
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:50,650
Nothing.

566
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:57,930
Such expensive medicine shouldn't be wasted.

567
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,260
Lingxi, help me apply it.

568
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:03,020
I'll rest a bit and continue practicing.

569
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:04,370
Alright, Miss.

570
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,130
Why are you here?

571
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:28,890
Sir,

572
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,610
did you deliver her the medicated oil?

573
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:32,930
What did Miss Luo say?

574
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:34,020
Was she moved?

575
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,370
Should we give her another?

576
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:36,210
You talk too much.

577
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,890
They once invited me to be the judge.

578
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:45,100
Go and accept it for me.

579
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:47,450
But sir,

580
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,260
you refused it adamantly before.

581
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,300
I had a hard time turning them down.

582
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:52,610
This time...

583
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,260
Is it for Miss Luo?

584
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,320
The Ministry of Rites get off work at 3 pm.

585
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:01,540
If you can't finish it by today,

586
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:02,650
don't come back.

587
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:03,900
I'll go, I'll go.

588
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,740
Alright, I'm going now.

589
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,410
Who said before,

590
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:10,120
I don't like the hustle and bustle?

591
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,930
(She's willing to endure any hardship.)

592
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:29,300
(Luo Lingyu has finally returned.)

593
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:32,860
(Lu Mansion)

594
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:42,890
Miss, wipe your sweat.

595
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:44,890
No need.

596
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,650
Miss, have some water.

597
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,060
No need.

598
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,610
Miss, why not rest tonight?

599
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:01,500
Your ankle can't take it.

600
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,370
I'll apply some medicine later.

601
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:07,210
It's fine. I'll get better with practice.

602
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,500
It hurts, Miss?

603
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:15,540
To perfect the dance,

604
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:17,580
I must never slack off.

605
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,260
Sorry to interrupt.

606
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:23,930
Miss Luo,

607
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,930
the young master would like to see you.

608
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:29,300
It's so late. How about another day?

609
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:30,780
No,

610
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:32,610
it's about the Flower Goddess Contest.

611
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:37,370
Where is he?

612
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:47,980
Why hasn't she arrived yet?

613
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:50,580
Did Jinchuan send the message?

614
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:56,740
He did.

615
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:03,650
Did you come because I asked for you

616
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:05,780
or because it's about the Contest?

617
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,370
What do you want to say? Speak quickly.

618
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,130
Look at this.

619
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,820
(To Young Master Lu Yun)

620
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:22,780
Invite you to be a judge of the Contest?

621
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:28,690
Congratulations. Anything else?

622
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:29,810
I'm going to practice.

623
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:30,650
Do you know

624
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:32,900
the Flower Goddess Contest is not just

625
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,220
a talent competition among ladies?

626
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:38,020
The role of judge is very significant.

627
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,690
Besides me, the other three judges are

628
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,740
Mr. Sun, a student of Minister Chen,

629
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,370
Mr. Qin, an imperial relative,

630
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:46,020
and Mr. Xu,

631
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:47,950
who just entered the court.

632
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:48,890
In short,

633
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:51,340
there are many forces behind them.

634
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:53,690
Do you think they will judge fairly?

635
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:00,930
How can the Contest be fair?

636
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:04,650
I am a judge and I'll be fair.

637
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:06,640
But you must agree to three conditions.

638
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:10,810
Mr. Lu, please go ahead.

639
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:12,570
First,

640
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:17,610
I want you to perform the dance

641
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:19,610
you've prepared just for me.

642
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:21,820
What?

643
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,570
I'm judging it for you in advance

644
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:27,000
to see if your dance stands a chance.

645
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,330
If you're too tired or unwilling,

646
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:30,370
then forget it.

647
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:33,090
Why forget it?

648
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,340
Thank you.

649
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:15,810
This dance is intricate,

650
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:16,860
but to stay steady

651
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:17,980
is not easy.

652
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,350
I haven't mastered it yet.

653
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:21,420
Sorry for that.

654
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:25,250
The night is very deep.

655
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:28,500
Have you thought about the second condition?

656
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:49,810
What if I ask you

657
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,290
to kiss me?

658
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:10,750
♪Bright moonlight,
with lanterns still burning♪

659
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,610
♪Deep night's hue,
your face softly blurring♪

660
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:17,040
♪In a fleeting thought,
my heart's line is stirring♪

661
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:19,660
♪Fate entwines,
a knot forever binding♪

662
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:23,180
♪This love's riddle,
your heart cold as steel♪

663
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:25,680
♪Yet your bright smile, how it steals♪

664
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:27,900
(Luo Lingyu, stay calm.)

665
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:30,810
Then it's settled.

666
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,250
Wait, wait, wait.

667
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:36,450
You...

668
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:38,400
How can you just kiss me like that?

669
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:39,980
Without any hesitation?

670
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,330
You said it was an exchange.

671
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:44,770
So there won't be any mixed feelings.

672
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:46,170
For me,

673
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,170
what's there to hesitate about?

674
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,260
Besides,

675
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,690
you're the most handsome in Yuezhou.

676
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,330
Kissing you won't make me lose out.

677
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,100
What if it were someone else?

678
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:00,060
Would you kiss them too?

679
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:02,460
Sure.

680
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:06,250
The Contest is my priority now.

681
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:07,900
I'll seize every opportunity I get.

682
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:10,770
If you intend to threaten me with this,

683
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,890
I would agree with the third condition

684
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:14,650
without hesitation.

685
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:16,500
When did I ever threaten you?

686
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:19,690
The third condition...

687
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:22,020
Let me think about it.

688
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,170
Alright, you go ahead.

689
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:29,780
I'll return to practice dance.

690
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,140
Farewell.

691
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,900
Miss, why did you take so long?

692
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,020
What did Mr. Lu want from you?

693
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:02,660
He's the judge for the Contest.

694
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:04,620
Really?

695
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:08,460
Will he help you in the Contest?

696
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:13,820
I can't trust him completely.

697
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:19,300
Even though I agreed to his conditions.

698
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,820
Conditions? What conditions?

699
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:30,980
Kiss you?

700
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,500
Oh sir.

701
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,100
How did you dare to make such a request?

702
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,130
Do you think she will think of me

703
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:42,220
as a carefree person?

704
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:45,140
You are not?

705
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,980
I've always spread rumors

706
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:50,180
that you flirt with many women.

707
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,580
You made such a request now.

708
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,980
Didn't it solidify this bad reputation?

709
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,380
Threaten?

710
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,700
She actually said I threatened her.

711
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,820
After being together so long,

712
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:03,700
how could she not know

713
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,740
I'm not one to take advantage of others?

714
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,220
You're not?

715
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:09,900
How could you not be?

716
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:12,500
You've made this request, sir.

717
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:14,740
Shut up.

718
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:18,580
Take your wage and leave.

719
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:34,980
(Chen Mansion)

720
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:40,380
The dance you taught is indeed good.

721
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:43,380
When Xiu wins the Flower Goddess,

722
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:46,180
besides the agreed reward,

723
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,100
I'll give you an extra one.

724
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:52,780
Thank you, Mrs. Chen.

725
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,340
She has been learning dance since childhood

726
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,460
with a great foundation

727
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,620
and quick to grasp it.

728
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,620
Today's practice is done.

729
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:11,340
Let her rest early.

730
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,100
Mother.

731
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:29,820
Qiniang says you do well.

732
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:33,100
But there're more contestants this year.

733
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:37,260
Miss Luo who made a hit last time

734
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:38,620
is also preparing meticulously.

735
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:40,700
Don't take it lightly.

736
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:43,060
Spend more time and effort on it.

737
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:45,220
Don't let others outshine you

738
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,940
and make me and your father lose face.

739
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,180
Yes, Mother.

740
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,260
Qiniang, let me walk you out.

741
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:02,500
Miss, you've practiced long today.

742
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,780
If you keep it up like this,

743
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,060
you won't be able to take it.

744
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,980
No, it's not enough yet.

745
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:11,220
I want to win Luo Lingyu

746
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:13,060
fair and square at the Contest.

747
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:15,060
I want Xuechen to know

748
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,180
what Luo Lingyu can do,

749
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:18,540
