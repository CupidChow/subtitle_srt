23
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,250
Father, you took it upon yourself

24
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,480
to protect Nanyue during your lifetime.

25
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,640
Let me

26
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,530
fulfill

27
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,330
your unfinished aspirations.

28
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,440
Miss Luo.

29
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,440
How long has he been kneeling?

30
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,720
Let him have some quiet time alone.

31
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,170
It's been ten years.

32
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,370
He can finally bring his father's tablet

33
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,970
to the ancestral hall.

34
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,410
Accompany him well.

35
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,930
Your Highness.

36
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,650
I heard you want to see me.

37
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,840
Your Highness, when did you find out?

38
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,000
Since the first assassination attempt,

39
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,840
I felt something was strange.

40
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,040
You are both my mentor and friend.

41
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,640
I never suspected you

42
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,650
as a Beichu spy.

43
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,760
We serve different masters.

44
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,250
I survived many attacks

45
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,610
and always got injured but not fatally.

46
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,440
Did you spare me?

47
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:09,880
If you say yes,

48
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,250
I will believe you.

49
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,690
No need for further questions.

50
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:21,880
I am already doomed.

51
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,960
Your Highness,

52
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,000
you consider me

53
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,690
as a wolf beside you these years.

54
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:30,440
If needed, kill me then.

55
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,370
Do not leave any room for mercy.

56
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,530
If you can reveal Beichu's

57
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:36,850
upcoming plans,

58
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,320
you might redeem yourself.

59
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,610
It's too late.

60
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,930
I've made grave mistakes.

61
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,050
Ending up like this

62
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,200
is a consequence of my actions.

63
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,690
You're fair in judgment.

64
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,640
Do not blame yourself or feel guilty.

65
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,170
You actually took poison!

66
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,250
You actually took poison!

67
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,290
Quick, find a physician.

68
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:12,640
Call for help.

69
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:15,570
Mr. Kong,

70
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:16,900
you must not die.

71
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,810
Mr. Kong...

72
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,440
You've committed such a grave error.

73
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,490
How can you just die like this?

74
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,810
I failed your kindness.

75
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,520
Le me repay it

76
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,960
in the next life.

77
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:45,440
Mr. Kong...

78
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:48,810
Thanks to you again this time.

79
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,440
Without your help,

80
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:52,810
I fear I'd have died.

81
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,090
Mr. Kong...

82
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,880
It's fine as long as you're pleased.

83
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,930
The sickness you neglected in the past

84
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:08,670
is still not healed even now.

85
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,320
Take your medicine later

86
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,200
and then have a rest.

87
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:14,760
Thank you, Your Highness.

88
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,560
Mr. Kong...

89
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:39,050
Mr. Kong!

90
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,160
Good.

91
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,290
(Zhou Yangling's exam paper)
This essay is truly good!

92
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:05,400
Changyi was indeed right.

93
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,290
You possess great wisdom

94
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:09,560
and exceptional talent.

95
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,730
Who is your mentor?

96
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,440
My father is Master Zhou from Wuzhou,

97
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,400
Zhou Tan.

98
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,930
I learned from my father.

99
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,760
You are the daughter of Master Zhou?

100
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,320
Well,

101
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,680
you are the woman

102
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,170
who is engaged to Changyi,

103
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,250
Zhou Yangling.

104
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:33,610
Your Majesty,

105
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,440
I am Zhou Yangling.

106
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:41,290
I request you to annul the engagement.

107
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:43,050
Well...

108
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,640
You wish to annul the engagement?

109
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:47,450
Exactly.

110
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,320
Yangling.

111
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:05,640
How can you decide it on your own?

112
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:08,320
Hengyang broke the engagement with Miss Luo.

113
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,640
Now it's you.

114
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,520
Do you even respect me?

115
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,290
Please calm down.

116
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:21,440
I am of humble background,

117
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,730
without a distinguished family,

118
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,200
unworthy to match with Prince Changyi.

119
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:25,450
Moreover,

120
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,050
Prince Changyi has someone he loves.

121
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,440
It isn't like that, Father.

122
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,170
Yangling is truly talented.

123
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:34,330
I'm not worthy of her.

124
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:40,000
I can't bear to hinder her growth.

125
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,000
I dare not dream beyond my reach.

126
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,730
(These sons give me no peace.)

127
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,450
(I've done all I can.)

128
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,490
Are you all

129
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,280
treating my orders like a joke?

130
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,680
Let me tell you,

131
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,090
I don't allow you to annul the engagement.

132
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,090
Any violator

133
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:04,890
will be dealt

134
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:05,900
with immediate execution.

135
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:17,570
What are you still staying here for?

136
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:18,850
Quickly, leave now.

137
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,000
Don't anger His Majesty further.

138
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:23,910
- Obey your order.
- Obey your order.

139
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:40,410
I'll find an opportunity

140
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:41,720
to mention it to my father again.

141
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:43,010
But Hengyang and Miss Luo

142
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,370
requested to annul the engagement,

143
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:47,130
so my father might not easily consent.

144
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,520
The Emperor's anger is no small matter.

145
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:51,330
About the engagement,

146
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,130
we'll discuss it later.

147
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,680
Aman,

148
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,640
in the coming days,

149
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,130
don't mention this to His Majesty again.

150
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,090
Yangling.

151
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,680
Do you know

152
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,260
why I insist on annulling this marriage?

153
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:16,920
I understand.

154
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,520
As a prince,

155
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,610
you admire Zhou Zibo.

156
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,720
You think he's someone

157
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,810
who can stand by your side.

158
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,850
But as Aman,

159
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,250
I disguises myself as a man,

160
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,410
going alone to take the exam.

161
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:34,520
You may find it hard to accept such a wife.

162
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,040
It's not like that.

163
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,920
This has nothing to do

164
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,050
who you are.

165
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:45,730
The one I admire has always been you.

166
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,760
Me?

167
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,130
Then why didn't you say so before

168
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:54,050
and insisted on annulling the engagement?

169
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:56,970
I don't want you to feel passive.

170
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,450
If you don't like it,

171
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:01,250
no need to feel troubled

172
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,130
by my words today.

173
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,490
I just want to give you the choice.

174
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,640
But before that,

175
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,330
I want to ask you one last thing.

176
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,250
Did you ever

177
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,370
have feelings for me?

♪At the end of time♪

190
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:32,300
♪In this world, I suddenly look back♪

191
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,620
(Xunmei House)

192
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,640
(Why haven't they finished talking yet?)

193
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,220
Sir,

194
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:57,000
are you just waiting outside so calmly?

195
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:00,280
Miss Luo is alone with Prince Hengyang.

196
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,960
The atmosphere is quite romantic.

197
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,020
Of course, I feel relieved.

198
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:04,880
Are you very idle?

199
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:07,490
I'm busy, very busy.

200
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:08,890
I'm going.

201
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:14,210
Miss Luo,

202
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,450
this is the decree annulling our engagement.

203
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,740
(Annul Liu Mu and Luo Lingyu's engagement.)

204
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,520
Unfortunately, I am not the person you like.

205
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,560
Otherwise...

206
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,120
What's unfortunate about it?

207
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:40,610
Having a friend like me

208
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,570
isn't that a blessing for you?

209
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,330
Why did you hit me?

210
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,640
What's wrong with it?

211
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,400
You've been hitting me since childhood.

212
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,210
Why can't I hit you one more time?

213
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,610
You can't keep hitting me.

214
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:56,890
It really hurts.

215
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:58,320
Why do you both act childish

216
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,730
whenever you meet?

217
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:01,370
I promised Hua

218
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:02,370
to take her to hang out.

219
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:03,370
I take my leave first.

220
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,850
See, you drove her away.

221
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,680
It's all your fault.

222
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,400
Why do you look so worried?

223
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,760
What are you thinking about?

224
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,330
Chen Hao and others have been caught.

225
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,440
Now is the perfect time

226
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,280
to recover Jingyang.

227
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,370
The court is making preparations.

228
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,920
Troop recruitment has begun.

229
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,410
You're going to the Northern Border?

230
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:34,680
I've been away for long.

231
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,250
It's time to return to the camp.

232
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,570
I'll depart the day after tomorrow.

233
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:42,250
Kong Lingfeng is gone.

234
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,040
Have you found someone for the advisor?

235
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:48,190
This person has to be familiar with the army

236
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,880
and understands me well.

237
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,540
How could it be so easy to find?

238
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,090
I have been there for years.

239
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,040
I have my own solution.

240
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,570
Don't worry about it.

241
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:05,930
If you return to the border now,

242
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,620
you only have Huo Dao by your side.

243
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:08,760
Can you handle it all?

244
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:12,000
Why have you become so hesitant?

245
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,880
Focus on managing court affairs

246
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:16,920
and welcome me back victorious.

247
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,740
(Lu Mansion)

248
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,440
Ridiculous!

249
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,760
Uncle, I don't act on impulse.

250
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,760
In these years,

251
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:35,920
no one has ever mentioned

252
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,250
I am the son of Lu Jie in public.

253
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,000
I know that the elders want to protect me,

254
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,970
but I don't want to deceive everyone.

255
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,640
That's why I want to tell this decision

256
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:46,570
to Grandmother and you.

257
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:49,250
You have merely uncovered the truth

258
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:52,400
and let hatred cloud your judgment.

259
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,200
Uncle, I...

260
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,920
Do you think, with just your passion,

261
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,160
you can secure a victory?

262
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:59,360
Have you ever been there?

263
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:00,520
Have you served as a soldier?

264
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,800
Where does your confidence come from?

265
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,090
Do you think you can come back unharmed?

266
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:08,160
Your uncle is right.

267
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:13,850
I just hope for family reunion.

268
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:16,920
Grandmother, I promise you,

269
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,040
I will return to honor you.

270
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,920
Weapons are ruthless on the battlefield.

271
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,310
How can you guarantee that?

272
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,400
Ancestors achieved many military merits.

273
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,770
Being a soldier is inheriting their legacy.

274
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:32,640
It's natural.

275
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:35,760
You taught me from a young age

276
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,920
experience can make me grow.

277
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,600
My purpose for this trip

278
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,220
is to gain experience on the battlefield.

279
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,280
You...

280
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:43,040
Alright, alright.

281
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,970
Your noise gives me a terrible headache.

282
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,490
You two continue to talk.

283
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,370
- Grandmother.
- Take care, Mother.

284
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,090
Alright, alright.

285
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:03,250
You may leave now.

286
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:05,810
Let's drop this matter.

287
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,000
Uncle,

288
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,810
I have made my decision.

289
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,130
Madam Lu,

290
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,010
how about having a physician check on you?

291
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,680
Madam Lu.

292
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:33,610
Madam Lu, what's wrong with you?

293
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:36,130
Miss Luo, Madam Lu has a headache again.

294
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,610
But she refuses to see the physician.

295
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,330
Can you help persuade her?

296
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,400
No need to call a physician.

297
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:45,330
Lingyu,

298
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:50,290
Yun said he wants to go to the battlefield.

299
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:57,440
Even if I recover, what's the use?

300
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,290
I'd rather leave before him,

301
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:06,050
so he has one less worry.

302
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:11,960
Madam Lu, please don't say that.

303
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,200
If heard by Xuechen,

304
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,920
he would surely be sad.

305
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,640
He is determined.

306
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,920
How could he worry about my sadness?

307
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,090
Madam Lu, you know Xuechen well.

308
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,960
Since he has his own goals,

309
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:29,960
we should respect his choice.

310
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:34,240
You must take care of your health

311
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:36,090
so that he has fewer worries.

312
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,810
Why are you so determined?

313
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:46,480
Jingyang has fallen.

314
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,960
My father bears ten years of blame.

315
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:54,640
Now, I must reclaim Jingyang myself.

316
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,290
Over the past ten years,

317
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:02,610
I hoped you'd stop investigating this.

318
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,580
Regarding this matter,

319
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,530
I understand your concerns.

320
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:09,610
You need to consider the family's safety.

321
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:12,400
Stopping me is also out of concern for me.

322
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,480
But Uncle,

323
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,240
don't you understand by now?

324
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,600
Some matters

325
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,480
can't be resolved by inaction.

326
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:22,050
Civil Officials can also serve the country.

327
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,400
You've just become the Imperial Censor.

328
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,610
You can fulfill your patriotic duty.

329
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:31,400
Why insist on being a hero of war?

330
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,290
No egg is left intact in the overturned nest.

331
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,610
My father died on the battlefield.

332
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,640
It's not for grand ambitions,

333
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,370
but for the countless people.

334
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:41,960
As his son,

335
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,010
how can I ignore his last wishes?

336
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:46,640
A few days ago,

337
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:49,880
you gave me my father's sword.

338
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:51,720
The sword was spotless,

339
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:53,920
clearly cherished for years.

340
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:56,480
You keep it so well.

341
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,770
You must understand my father's wishes.

342
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:02,880
Isn't this also your regret?

343
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,480
With so many generals in the court,

344
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,850
why must it be you?

345
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,810
Now there's a vacancy in the North Army,

346
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,200
Prince Hengyang

347
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,880
can't find a reliable partner quickly.

348
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,160
I have worked well with him for years

349
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:24,850
and know the North Army well.

350
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:29,240
So it must be me this time.

351
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,850
In my eyes,

352
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:45,130
I always thought

353
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,370
you are still that young naive child.

354
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:50,810
Didn't expect

355
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,050
you to grow up so fast.

356
00:20:58,770 --> 00:20:59,610
Remember,

357
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:04,640
you must return safely.

358
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:08,330
Do you hear me?

359
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,090
I understand.

360
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,440
Yun.

361
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,900
Aunt, don't persuade me anymore.

362
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:38,920
I have made up my mind.

363
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:41,010
I came to tell you

364
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:43,920
that the North is freezing.

365
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:46,260
I've prepared some medicinal wine for warmth.

366
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:47,970
Remember to take it with you.

367
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,290
Aren't you here to persuade me to stay?

368
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,850
It's the cliché.

369
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,770
Do you

370
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,810
consider me such a stubborn person?

371
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:01,330
Life isn't that long.

372
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:04,090
Of course, you should pursue your dreams.

373
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,640
Going to the battlefield

374
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:14,480
is a noble cause.

375
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:17,530
Since you desire it,

376
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:21,530
don't disappoint your own intentions.

377
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,290
- Aunt...
- When you reclaim Jingyang,

378
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:29,400
remember to bring Xifeng Wine to your Uncle.

379
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:34,680
He loved it the most during his life.

380
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:41,770
Don't worry.

381
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,770
Uncle's spirit in heaven

382
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:47,240
will surely understand your feelings.

383
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:54,530
Thank you very much.

384
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:04,240
I await your victorious return.

385
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,010
- Xian.
- Yun.

386
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:13,570
I'm looking for you.

387
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,390
Help me with this, please.

388
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:20,610
Not this one.

389
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,480
It's this one.

390
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:30,330
Tortoise shell.

391
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,880
Why are you giving me this?

392
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:34,440
Before you set out,

393
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:35,610
perform a divination.

394
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,500
If it's auspicious, charge forward.

395
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,530
If not, then avoid battle.

396
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:39,640
Come, let me teach you.

397
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:41,530
How could the enemy choose a favorable day?

398
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,920
Better to believe it exists than not.

399
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,020
Just take it with you.

400
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,290
Had I known earlier,

401
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,560
I would have studied more military books

402
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,070
and practiced more with martial arts.

403
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,290
Now you're going to fight

404
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:56,230
and serve the country.

405
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:58,800
Sadly, I'm too frail

406
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,920
to go to the battlefield.

407
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:04,400
You are right.

408
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,090
Taking it might help.

409
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,010
Thank you.

410
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:12,200
You must keep it safe.

411
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,720
Sir.

412
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:20,570
Young Master Xian.

413
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,400
As per your instruction,

414
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:24,400
I've invited Miss Luo to the street.

415
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,680
I see.

416
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:28,330
I'm going.

417
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,850
(I will set off with Hengyang tomorrow.)

418
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,440
(How should I tell Lingyu?)

419
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,050
(Does she already know?)

420
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,160
Why suddenly invite me here?

421
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,770
I feel that since we met, we have been

422
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:46,280
misunderstanding each other.

423
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:47,960
But now, we love each other.

424
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,500
I want to take you to a good place.

I'm not sure

486
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:57,400
who set so many traps for me.

492
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,970
That day you asked me to get off the boat,

493
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,130

494
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:25,010

496
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:30,770

00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:43,470

499
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,980
my father vanished without a trace.

500
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:48,850
My mother felt life was hopeless

501
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:51,960

503
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,920

- No.

536
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:09,050
you owed me the third condition.

538
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,020

539
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,370

540
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,480
Wait for my return.

541
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:29,290
I can't agree to this condition.

542

544
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,770

545
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:40,570

00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:49,050

563

please don't chase after him.

564
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:11,320
He left early this morning.

565
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:15,490
He said he didn't want to say goodbye.

566
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:23,410
How could he just leave like this?

567
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,570
He is straightforward.

568
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,720
I've been gathering my thoughts all night

569
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,570
and now there's no one to talk to.

570
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:34,640
How could he

571
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:38,240
leave like this?

572
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:48,890
Why didn't you let family see you off?

573
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:50,160
You didn't let them either.

574
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:51,490
How could I lose?

575
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,720
Besides, we said goodbye yesterday.

576
00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:58,240
I'll be back in a few months.

577
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,080

578
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:03,970

583
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,380

- Calm down.
