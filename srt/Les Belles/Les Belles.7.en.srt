=Episode 7=

23
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,300
My apologies.

24
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,660
Lingyu.

25
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,420
We truly are destined to meet here.

26
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,740
Young Master Fan?

27
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,980
Why are you here?

28
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:10,780
Lingyu.

29
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,140
You left a letter,

30
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,420
then disappeared without a trace.

31
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,180
I was very worried about you.

32
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,660
Young Master Fan,
we've known each other long.

33
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,700
I know you're
an exceptional young gentleman.

34
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,380
For anyone,

35
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,700
you'd be a perfect match.

36
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,820
But since you saw my letter,

37
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,420
you must've read its content.

38
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,860
You should know I have my reasons

39
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,140
and I had to leave.

40
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,540
If you truly have reasons,

41
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,660
why not share them with me?

42
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,460
Young Master Fan, what I say

43
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,060
may not make you happy.

44
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,380
If you can truly agree to my request,

45
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,580
I will go back with you.

46
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,020
Alright, just say it,

47
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,500
and I will agree.

48
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,220
I have already vowed
before my parents' graves.

49
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,200
In this life, I only
seek a matrilocal husband.

50
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,220
Lingyu, are you worried that,

51
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,000
after marrying into Fan Mansion,
you'll be mistreated?

52
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,420
Don't worry.

53
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,580
I will do my best to protect you.

54
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,580
As for the matrilocal husband,

55
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:19,060
the Fan Clan of Shuozhou is reputable.

56
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,260
You won't be disgraced.

57
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,060
Young Master Fan,

58
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,260
since you can't meet my terms,

59
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,380
let's not waste words here.

60
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,380
I hope you find a worthy match soon.

61
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,420
I bid my farewell.

62
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,740
What if you are the only one I want?

63
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,740
We are in an open space,

64
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,900
what are you doing here?

65
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,980
I traveled far to find my bride.

66
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,780
Naturally, I want to take her home.

67
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,820
We are not family.

68
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,140
Please, show some respect.

69
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,980
You keep saying I'm your bride,

70
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,140
but from beginning to end,

71
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,140
it was all arranged by
my aunt and uncle and you.

72
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,100
Did you ever ask for my consent?

73
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,180
But that day,
we clearly exchanged vows.

74
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,270
- My lady, I'm here to save you!
- Lingxi!

75
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,500
- Run!
- Sir, are you alright?

76
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:15,820
Chase them!

77
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,060
Go chase them!

78
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,620
What's happening here?

79
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,820
My lord, what should we do now?

80
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,980
Miss Luo is pretty smart,

81
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,660
but she's unfamiliar with this place.

82
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,030
The Fan family has many servants,

83
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,100
I'm afraid Miss Luo won't run far

84
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,220
before someone catches up.

85
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,540
My lord, should we help her?

86
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:02,820
What are they doing?

87
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,060
What do they want?

88
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:05,490
Stop! You, go that way!

89
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:06,350
Lingxi, this way!

90
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,400
- Follow me!
- Don't run!

91
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:08,700
Over there!

92
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:10,820
Quick, over there!

93
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,500
Don't run!

94
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,700
My lady, why is he

95
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,700
suddenly in Yuezhou?

96
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,180
I didn't expect his persistence.

97
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,740
Besides, I've made my point clear.

98
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,220
Yet he continues to entangle us.

99
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,460
It is clear

100
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,380
he disregards my wishes.

101
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,540
Can we evade him this time?

102
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,780
Don't worry, we escaped once.

103
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,600
We surely can escape a second time.

104
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,420
They should have left.

105
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,820
- Let's go.
- Alright.

106
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,340
Come on.

107
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,460
There! Miss Luo is there!

108
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:48,380
- My lady!
- Hurry!

109
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,540
They're after you.

110
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,860
It's okay, you run first.
I'll hold them off.

111
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,520
- Lingxi, Lingxi!
- Miss Luo!

112
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,780
- You rascal!
- Miss Luo!

113
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,420
You made me search everywhere.

114
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,540
Lingxi.

115
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,380
Make her give up quickly.

116
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,820
Stop playing these little tricks.

117
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:07,700
You heartless scoundrel!

118
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,500
You are away for three years.

119
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,300
I've been your servant all this time,

120
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,380
caring for your parents.

121
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:18,300
Yet you came to Yuezhou to have fun.

122
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,880
Don't listen to her nonsense!

123
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,260
I have nothing to do with her. Let go.

124
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,780
My Butler has worked
in my family for decades.

125
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,100
When did he ever marry?

126
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,660
You are making things up.

127
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,700
Are you here

128
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,220
to cause harm and steal?

129
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:44,900
Hold on!

130
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,660
My lady.

131
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:51,660
My lady!

132
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,500
I thought she was a villain.

133
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,540
Turns out she's your maid.

134
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,100
Luckily, you arrived just in time.

135
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,060
Otherwise, she

136
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,580
might have died unjustly.

137
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:11,860
Did you get scared?

138
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,380
Lingyu,

139
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,300
I sincerely wish to marry you.

140
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,660
Why do you keep avoiding me?

141
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,140
Why do you disregard my feelings
like this?

142
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,060
Come,

143
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,900
let's go back together.

144
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,060
Third Young Master?

145
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,820
Are you feeling tired?

146
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,420
Why are you sweating?

147
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,620
Your shoes are dirty too.

148
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,370
Where did you get this mud?

149
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,980
What do you mean, good sir?

150
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,300
I am from the Fan Clan of Shuozhou

151
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,820
and have a prior engagement
with Lingyu.

152
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,380
I am here to bring her home.

153
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,540
Lingyu has said she doesn't want to.

154
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,660
Why force someone against their will?

155
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,900
He is Lu Yun, the nephew

156
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,140
of one of the Ministers,

157
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,640
the number one young master
of Yuezhou.

158
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,340
I am new in Yuezhou,

159
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,820
and he kindly toured with me.

160
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,420
Young Master Fan,
please respect yourself.

161
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:04,980
Indeed.

162
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,740
Oh, Lingyu.

163
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,920
Have you bought everything?

164
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,260
The elders
are waiting for us at home.

165
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,740
Yes, I have.

166
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:12,980
That's good.

167
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,660
Sir, uh...

168
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,260
Mr. Fan of Shuozhou.

169
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,140
I bid you farewell.

170
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:21,940
Let's go, hurry up.

171
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:22,900
Let's go.

172
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,620
My lord, we...

173
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,700
So, you

174
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,940
came to West Market for clothes?

175
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:58,820
For a lady?

176
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,220
If I'm not mistaken,

177
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,580
the garment you touched

178
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,700
is made of Shuozhou's
silky cloud brocade.

179
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,820
Yes indeed.

180
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,940
But Shuozhou
is in the Northern Region,

181
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,270
where winters are long.

182
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,100
This fabric is indeed rare.

183
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,300
Hua and I live under others' roofs.

184
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,660
We're used to silk and cotton clothes.

185
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,540
This brocade is quite a novelty.

186
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,500
You're not from
the Luo Clan of Shuozhou,

187
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,420
then you...

188
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,700
Isn't this woodshed spacious?

189
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,580
It's a bargain for you three.

190
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,420
This is for you.

191
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,140
This is a reward.

192
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,820
Don't be ungrateful.

193
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,940
Stay in line.

194
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,300
Thank you, Uncle and Aunt.

195
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,180
We will never forget your kindness.

196
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,220
When we grow up, we'll repay you.

197
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,210
Repay when you grow up?

198
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,780
You three will always be our burdens.

199
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,900
Wait. Raising you
might even bring profit.

200
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,460
My lady.

201
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,220
My lady, what should we do?

202
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,080
It's alright, it's alright.

203
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,500
Just minor issues.

204
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,620
They've always treated me harshly,

205
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,060
planning to raise me until I'm grown,

206
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,140
then sell me off for status

207
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,460
and a good price.

208
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,380
That Fan Qingchen...

209
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,580
(Well, I can't hide it anymore.)

210
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:31,380
Fan Qingchen is the husband
they chose for me.

211
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,620
(I've already told him)

212
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,660
(about everything, good and bad.)

213
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,660
(I wonder what he thinks.)

214
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,620
But to me,

215
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,580
Fan Qingchen
seems deeply in love with you.

216
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,300
He chased you
all the way from Shuozhou.

217
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,780
If he truly had feelings for me,

218
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,020
he wouldn't persist in pestering me.

219
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,060
It's strange though,

220
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,020
Master Fan values his reputation highly,

221
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,900
and Fan Qingchen is their only son.

222
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,300
I just didn't expect

223
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,260
Master Fan to send Fan Qingchen

224
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,300
to pursue me all the way here.

225
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,660
Haven't you always wanted
a suitable husband?

226
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:12,210
I heard the Fan family in Shuozhou
is imperial merchants.

227
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,300
Fan Qingchen
is also quite distinguished.

228
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,420
Since you have an agreement with him,

229
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,860
why did you
run away from the marriage?

230
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,740
That day, you accused me
of seducing you.

231
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,380
I've heard this claim often.

232
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,020
After all, Uncle and Aunt

233
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,570
raised me, to make me seduce men.

234
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,060
I know women

235
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,660
have little control over matters.

236
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,220
But I refuse to accept this.

237
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,100
As for you,

238
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,100
why help me today

239
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,740
while accusing me so?

240
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,860
I did misunderstand you before,

241
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,060
but in my opinion,

242
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,660
in this world, all women,

243
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,580
regardless of status or character,

244
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,380
shouldn't marry against their will.

245
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:01,220
Your courage to flee the marriage
is admirable.

246
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,140
I resisted,

247
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:09,340
but they treated me like a caged bird,

248
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,980
ignoring my feelings.

249
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,380
That's why
I took drastic measures to escape.

250
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,140
I thought I could avoid this fate,

251
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,820
and change his mind.

252
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,340
But I didn't expect...

253
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,540
What's with that look?

254
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,860
I'm not here for your sympathy.

255
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,300
If they hadn't set
so many obstacles for me,

256
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,740
I wouldn't be the person I am today.

257
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,900
So you say you only seek
a matrilocal husband,

258
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,380
just to make Fan Qingchen quit?

259
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,900
(Seeking matrilocal husband
to reclaim property...)

260
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,140
(I'll not speak more about it)

261
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,500
(to avoid further trouble.)

262
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,620
What do you think?

263
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,780
Using this to scare people away

264
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,260
is quite a clever plan.

265
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:11,940
(It seems he doesn't mind
being a matrilocal husband.)

266
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,020
My lady!

267
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,820
Thank you so much.

268
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:46,620
(Lu Mansion)

269
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,370
That night at the Lake Pavilion,

270
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,440
I shouldn't have spoken like that.

271
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,340
I said something inappropriate

272
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,540
and exaggerated.

273
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,100
I apologize.

274
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,940
Are you here today

275
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,060
to tell me this?

276
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:21,260
Are you offering me your cloak?

277
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,580
I don't feel cold.

278
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,740
I am feeling cold.

279
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,700
You are overthinking.

280
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,120
I'm just fastening it up.

281
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,700
You must be tired today.

282
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,060
Go back and rest early.

283
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,860
What are you doing with him?

284
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:54,740
Nothing much.

285
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,800
Today, Fan Qingchen was relentless
in his pursuit.

286
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,500
Luckily, I was able to rely on
the Third Young Master's influence.

287
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,720
Otherwise, who knows what could've happened.

288
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,820
But this isn't a long-term solution.

289
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:19,940
You're back.

290
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,700
Did you go after Fan Qingchen?

291
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,620
Rest assured, sir.

292
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,820
They've closely followed him.

293
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,340
My lord,
do you sense anything amiss?

294
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,020
That day, their study
was heavily guarded.

295
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,980
If they notice something missing,

296
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,540
they'll surely be anxious.

297
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,980
Yet now, for a runaway darling,

298
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,900
the sole heir of the Fan family

299
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:42,940
even braves the dangers

300
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,670
and rushes to Yuezhou
on horseback.

301
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,820
You find this strange?

302
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,180
Fan Qingchen is certainly

303
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,940
not here for a runaway darling.

304
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,700
But I met him today,

305
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,300
there's indeed no connection

306
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,740
between him and Luo Lingyu.

307
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,000
I misunderstood her after all.

308
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,900
I said it before,

309
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,380
Miss Luo isn't some spy.

310
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,260
Yes, thanks to her help,

311
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,900
we managed to enter the Fan Mansion.

312
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:06,940
Exactly.

313
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,340
You've only met her a few times,

314
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,970
yet you trust her so much.

315
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,020
My lord,

316
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,740
it's not about
how long you've known her.

317
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,940
I knew at first glance

318
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:20,500
that she is
the same kind of person as you.

319
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:25,340
I did something big for you today.

320
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,620
Speak.

321
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,920
The silky cloud brocade garment
in your carriage,

322
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,700
I've already sent it to Miss Luo.

323
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,980
Sister, that was from
Brother Jinchuan.

324
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,100
Quick, take a look.

325
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,460
That's for Aunt!

326
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:41,970
Who said it was for Luo Lingyu?

327
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:43,780
I know it.

328
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,420
I know it all,
you don't need to say anything.

329
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,260
When Miss Luo sees
the clothes and note,

330
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,660
she will surely be very touched

331
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,860
by your thoughtfulness.

332
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,500
What note?

333
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,570
The lotus blooms pale
in comparison to a beauty's makeup,

334
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,740
as the breeze from the water palace
carries fragrance of pearls and jade.

335
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,540
Lu...

336
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,700
Xue...Chen...

337
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,660
Sister.

338
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:13,260
Brother Yun said
you're more beautiful than the lotus.

339
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,300
Why aren't you happy?

340
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:21,460
This morning, he subtly mocked me.

341
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,740
Yet he stood up to act with me

342
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,580
when we met Fan Qingchen
at the West Market.

343
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:30,940
And now here is this poem.

344
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,860
I'm really unsure about his intentions.

345
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,780
Did you say anything to him?

346
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:38,980
In the carriage,

347
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,260
I mentioned my matter
with Fan Qingchen.

348
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:46,540
So, is he sympathetic?

349
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:50,220
I won't pity him for his misfortunes.

350
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:51,980
Naturally,

351
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,780
I don't want him to pity me

352
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,620
for my past.

353
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:56,980
Isn't pity

354
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:58,820
a form of affection too?

355
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,140
It's all emotion.

356
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:03,820
You are right.

357
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,940
As long as there's some response,

358
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,220
there's hope for the future.

359
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,180
Since that's the case,

360
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,900
I'll put his name back

361
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,740
in my candidate list.

362
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,500
Who lets you act on your own?

363
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:21,780
My dear lord.

364
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,580
Why can't you see it?

365
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,420
Today, Miss Luo said,

366
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:29,540
she never wore a
silky cloud brocade garment in Shuozhou.

367
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,580
What does it mean?

368
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,780
It means she wants to wear it.

369
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,300
Yes indeed.

370
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,580
But Shuozhou
is in the Northern Region,

371
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:40,860
where winters are long.

372
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,420
This fabric is indeed rare.

373
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,500
Luckily, you are good-looking.

374
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,700
- Otherwise, we can't tell...
- The account book.

375
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,580
What is it?

376
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:59,420
(Military Supplies Bill of Lading)

377
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,420
My lord, have you noticed
anything unusual?

378
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,460
Miss Luo mentioned,

379
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,180
this fabric is rare in Shuozhou.

380
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,460
Even with the Fan family's wealth,

381
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,420
the Northern Region's winters
are harsh.

382
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,260
Transporting such large quantities
in January,

383
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,700
and the materials aren't even warm,

384
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,500
can they really sell them all?

385
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,980
They might be running
a losing business.

386
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,500
They are the number one merchant,

387
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,400
and profit must be their top priority.

388
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,500
This account book hides a mystery.

389
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:36,940
What's recorded within

390
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,020
is likely more than simple accounts.

391
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,460
Today we bought so many things
in the West Market.

392
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,020
Third Young Master
also gave me a dress.

393
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,620
We need to tidy up for a bit.

394
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,900
Here is an unopened package.

395
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,870
It must be from
the Third Young Master.

396
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,420
My lady! Look!

397
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:08,980
What is inside?

398
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,940
Aren't these the jewelry you tried
in West Market today?

399
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,820
So Third Young Master
has followed us all the way.

400
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,780
It was Fan Qingchen

401
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,840
who followed us all the way.

402
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:30,140
Everything I touched along the way,

403
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,500
he bought it all.

404
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,740
It's clear
he's closely observing me today,

405
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,180
watching my every move.

406
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,220
My lady,

407
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:44,060
he seems like a different person.

408
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,170
Just thinking about it
makes me feel scared.

409
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,060
He followed me to Yuezhou,

410
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,940
and said he wanted to stay here.

411
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,260
This is clearly a threat to me.

412
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,700
If I don't go back with him,

413
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,140
he'll expose my visit here

414
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:03,900
in Yuezhou and cause a stir.

415
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:08,300
No one
saw through his true nature before.

416
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,940
It shows how meticulous his thinking is

417
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,720
and how skillful his methods are.

418
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,660
Ordinary methods
won't work against him.

419
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,060
How should we respond then?

420
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:28,060
Keeping these things
would be dangerous.

421
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,060
Lingxi.

422
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,980
Tomorrow, send someone
to return this to him.

423
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,140
Understood, my lady.

424
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:36,700
Rest assured.

425
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,500
Tomorrow,
I'll have someone return it intact.

426
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,740
(Silky Cloud Brocade: 2,000 bolts
Longevity Lock: 80 pieces)

427
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,740
Silky cloud brocade, 2,000 bolts.

428
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,700
Longevity lock, 80 pieces.

429
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,780
Fine white flour, 500 picul...

430
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:04,940
My lord.

431
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,580
The variety of these goods

432
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,180
and the number of transactions varies.

433
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,060
Remember them

434
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:12,310
and you could become
an accountant in the future.

435
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,980
In the past, when my father
was in the army,

436
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,450
all military matters were communicated
through secret codes.

437
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:19,660
The decoding methods

438
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:22,220
of different codes were different.

439
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,340
Therefore, my father
kept a renowned scholar,

440
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,540
who was proficient
in interpreting letters in the army.

441
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,420
If we want to uncover the secrets...

442
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,500
Finding this scholar is the only way.

443
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:33,940
I'll go investigate.

444
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,220
No need.

445
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,900
Since this person was once in the army,

446
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,040
it might be faster to let people
in higher authority investigate.

447
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:41,980
People in higher authority?

448
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,820
Among those people,

449
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,500
who else can he command?

450
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,570
Isn't it only
His Highness Prince Changyi?

451
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,500
When have I ever commanded him?

452
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:53,140
Well, that is true. For you two,

453
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,220
one is willing to strike,
and the other is willing to endure.

454
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,900
Why are you standing there?
Go quickly.

455
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,740
I take my leave.

456
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,900
(Lu Mansion)

457
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,020
I returned all of Young Master Fan's belongings

458
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:10,860
early this morning.

459
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:12,860
Good.

460
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,820
Miss Luo, check out the front yard!

461
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:22,780
A gentleman named Fan

462
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,080
said he would take you back to Shuozhou.

463
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,370
There are many people
at the entrance.

464
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,420
How can he still come to us?

465
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,940
It happened so suddenly.

466
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,170
Maybe we should hide for now.

467
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,820
You can hide for a while,
but not forever.

468
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,060
Since we can't hide,

469
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:39,940
then we should go meet him.

470
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:43,060
(Lu Mansion)
He must be here to propose, right?

471
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,700
It seems so.

472
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,540
This gentleman

473
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:47,860
looks unfamiliar,

474
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,580
but is elegant and refined,

475
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,500
courteous and polite.

476
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:52,460
Compared to Mr. Lu,

477
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,780
he's not inferior at all.

478
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,220
But still, he's lacking in some ways.

479
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,140
How could he compare
to my Third Young Master?

480
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:00,780
But this gentleman is just to my liking.

481
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,260
Lingyu.

482
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,140
Lingyu,

483
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,740
do you like the gift
I sent yesterday?

484
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,400
Thank you, Young Master Fan.

485
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:26,900
I appreciate it.

486
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,620
But the gift was too valuable.

487
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,580
I asked Lingxi to return it.

488
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:33,980
Compared to the gift,

489
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,140
you are

490
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,540
the most valuable to me.

491
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,060
As long as you like it,

492
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,370
even if it is the moon in the water,

493
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,670
or the stars in the sky,

494
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,260
I will get them all for you.

495
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,420
With a husband like this,

496
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,060
what else could a wife ask for?

497
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,340
Indeed, we are so envious.

498
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,380
It's truly enviable.

499
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,220
I also want such a husband.

500
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,220
- So do I.
- Who wouldn't?

501
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,460
Young Master Fan,
talking on the street like this

502
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,820
may be discourteous.

503
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,940
Let's discuss it inside.

504
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,060
Sure, as you wish.

505
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,620
Please, Young Master Fan.

506
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,380
Lingyu, wait a moment.

507
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,660
Today,
I see the prosperity of Yuezhou,

508
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,180
now I understand why you

509
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,300
are reluctant to return to Shuozhou
for marriage.

510
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,060
However...

511
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,140
He is from Shuozhou?

512
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,370
No matter if you reject me once

513
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,260
or a thousand times,

514
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,520
my heart will always be unwavering.

515
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,120
My mind will never change.

516
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,060
He is truly devoted.

517
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,700
Yes! Go back with him!

518
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,580
(I must stay calm.)

519
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,820
Young Master Fan, please.

520
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:09,700
(Lu Mansion)

521
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,900
Though they say
guests are like hosts,

522
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,980
but you came uninvited,

523
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,820
shouting at the gate of our mansion,

524
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,620
causing the neighbors to gather around.

525
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,540
Isn't that quite discourteous?

526
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:22,840
I am Fan Qingchen
from the Fan family of Shuozhou.

527
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:25,580
I was indeed thoughtless this time.

528
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:28,500
However, Lingyu
is my lawfully wedded wife.

529
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:30,180
She came to Yuezhou
to visit her family,

530
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,300
but she never returned.

531
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,460
I was worried and missed her deeply.

532
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,860
That's why I mindlessly offended you.

533
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:39,060
I hereby apologize to you, Ma'am.

534
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:43,300
Don't let infatuation
make you speak rashly.

535
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:46,380
You have been in Yuezhou for days.

536
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,740
But I haven't heard that you're married.

537
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:55,220
He favored me in Shuozhou.

538
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,020
But we are not officially married.

539
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:59,620
Please, elders,
help me resolve this matter.

540
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,260
What's going on here?

541
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,340
Darling, please rise.

542
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,220
If you have something to say,
speak clearly here.

543
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,900
I will make the decision.

544
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,540
Greetings, Madam Lu.

545
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,420
Lingyu has been in Yuezhou
for a while.

546
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,740
Thanks for your care.

547
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:42,220
I have prepared some humble gifts
for your clan's esteemed members.

548
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,570
It's a small token of respect.

549
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:58,700
Since when does the Lu family
need such mundane items?

550
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,900
Do you think a small favor

551
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,660
will make the elders
lose their judgment?

552
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,300
Miss Luo,

553
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,500
Young Master Fan
prepared all this

554
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,220
with great effort.

555
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,900
He is truly a devoted suitor.

556
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,260
If what he says is true,

557
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:18,300
then you are really fortunate.

558
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,580
Don't be rash anymore.

559
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,460
It's best to follow him
back to Shuozhou soon.

560
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:24,860
You are too kind.

561
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,900
Lingyu is kind and gentle,

562
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,160
graceful and intelligent.

563
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,460
Being with her

564
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:33,180
is a fortune I sought for lifetimes.

565
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,620
Elders, please see this clearly.

566
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,660
If everyone who admires me

567
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,220
can bring me home,

568
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,260
I can't manage it

569
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,780
even with magic.

570
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,180
Miss Luo, did you know?

571
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:49,500
For your grand wedding,

572
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,140
even when your uncle and aunt

573
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,700
demanded a hundred carriage dowry,

574
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:55,300
Young Master agreed immediately
because he didn't want to

575
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,880
put you in a difficult situation.

576
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,020
He did not refuse at all.

577
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,900
He cares for you so much.

578
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:02,380
How could you just leave
without a word?

579
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:03,780
You made such a tie

580
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,100
with a hundred carriage dowry,

581
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,140
but you never asked if I was willing.

582
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:10,220
Am I an object or a bird?

583
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,460
How is this different from trading?

584
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,020
- Miss Luo.
- Stop talking.

585
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,300
I have set aside my work

586
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:20,300
and come running to you.

587
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,340
Look,

588
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,380
I even brought our letter of marriage
with me.

589
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,140
Why would Miss Luo

590
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,900
do such a thing?

591
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,060
It's all just an act.

592
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:42,900
On regular days,

593
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,580
she plays her little tricks.

594
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,780
I want to see how she handles this.

595
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:50,060
She might have to return to Shuozhou.

596
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,540
That is her only option.

597
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,940
Staying here would be embarrassing.

598
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:55,780
- Exactly.
- Right.

599
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,020
It's so embarrassing here.

600
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,780
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

601
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,820
Better to return to Shuozhou.

602
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:00,660
Silence!

603
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,540
She...

604
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,760
We are not talking about you.

605
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:07,900
Why are you upset?

606
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,260
I...

607
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,580
What's happening here?

608
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,420
No idea.

609
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,540
This is unusual.

610
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,220
Is she getting mad
just because we are telling the truth?

611
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,060
Who knows?

612
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,860
No matter the outcome,

613
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,620
Madam Lu will ensure justice.

614
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:27,820
Ladies, you are here to learn skills,

615
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,100
but also to cultivate your mind.

616
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,700
Do not criticize others.

617
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,540
Please take a look,

618
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,340
did I sign this letter of marriage?

619
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:00,140
(Fan Qingchen)

620
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,020
There's indeed no signature.

621
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:05,700
Take a look.

622
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,500
Indeed, there's none.

623
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,500
My lady, here's the squid ink

624
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:19,940
you asked for.

625
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,340
Try it now.

626
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:28,940
My lady,

627
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,860
are you sure this will work?

628
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:33,420
Do you know why
it's called squid ink?

629
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,700
It's because the ink is black.

630
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,140
But after a while,

631
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,470
the written print
will be gone without a trace,

632
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,660
as cunning as a squid.

633
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,620
When I marry Fan Qingchen,

634
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,220
that will be the time to use this.

635
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,460
I did not sign my name.

636
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,860
How can Young Master Fan
claim to be my husband?

637
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,000
If you truly want to seek someone,

638
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:57,720
you should seek the Luo family
as on the letter of marriage,

639
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:58,980
not me.

640
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,980
Perhaps there is an error
in the letter,

641
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:09,820
but Lingyu,

642
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:11,740
even so,

643
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,900
you shouldn't
deny our years of affection.

644
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,020
On that wedding day,

645
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:17,780
all rites were prepared,

646
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,100
it was
the brightest moment of my life.

647
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,180
But now, since you
arrived in Yuezhou,

648
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,260
you deny
our marriage without hesitation.

649
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:29,780
You make me feel heartbroken.

650
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:31,700
Miss Luo,

651
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:34,420
he is truly a man of deep affection.

652
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,920
- How about...
- No way.

653
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,060
Miss Lau?

654
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,620
This gentleman
is my kept man in Shuozhou.

655
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,860
Without my permission,

656
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,020
you cannot marry.

657
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,500
I am meeting this lady
for the first time,

658
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,300
I don't even know her name.

659
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,540
How could I be her kept man?

660
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,980
I hope you won't make
baseless accusations

661
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,100
that tarnish my honor.

662
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,980
You know it's just baseless.

663
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,700
The letter of marriage
lacks Miss Luo's name.

664
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,500
Isn't it baseless?

665
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,620
You hold an invalid
letter of marriage,

666
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,740
and claim we are meant
for each other.

667
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:16,940
In this case, when others
say you're a kept man,

668
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:18,820
that's not entirely untrue.

669
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:20,860
My engagement to Lingyu

670
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,740
is well-known in Shuozhou.

671
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:24,900
It's more convincing

672
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:25,940
than this lady's words.

673
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,300
My lady,

674
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,380
you seem quite young.

675
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,780
Please show some respect.

676
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,220
Stop spouting nonsense

677
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,780
and meddling in my affairs
with Lingyu.

678
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,900
Miss Luo is my friend.

679
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,580
I will definitely stand up for her.

680
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,240
What is your relationship with her?

681
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,020
And what rights do you have?

682
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,840
Because I am
the Princess of Southern Yuezhou.

683
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,820
I know you want to help me.

684
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:59,940
But don't mention the princess stuff.

685
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,340
You dare to speak so boldly.

686
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,900
Do you know impersonating
the imperial family is a capital crime?

687
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:12,020
Earlier, I asked Madam Lu
to conceal my identity

688
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,540
because I didn't want attention.

689
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,620
But now I want to protect someone.

690
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,500
I hope Madam Lu can vouch for me.

691
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,920
Tang is actually willing
to do this for her

692
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,860
and reveal the true identity
to the public.

693
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,660
This will surely resolve the matter.

694
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:39,340
Greetings, Your Highness.

695
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,340
Greetings, Your Highness.

696
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,480
No need for formalities.

697
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,300
Thank you, Your Highness.

698
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:57,220
Her Highness is indeed
Princess Ningping of Southern Yuezhou.

699
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:00,460
Back then, Her Highness
received an edict

700
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,220
to study at our mansion.

701
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,700
Her Highness is modest.

702
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,620
That's why she never mentioned it.

703
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,860
Offending Your Highness
was my fault.

704
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,300
I sincerely apologize.

705
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,680
But even though
the letter of marriage is void,

706
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,180
my genuine feelings
were never false.

707
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,260
I will wait patiently

708
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,520
until the day Lingyu
changes her mind.

709
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:35,060
If you insist on denying it,

710
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:37,000
then I will have no choice but to

711
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:39,140
bring in a few credible witnesses

712
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:43,660
at the official place.

713
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,270
I've troubled all of you today.

714
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:50,780
I shall take my leave.

715
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,460
Let's go.

716
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,740
It's finally over.

717
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,020
Thank you, Ma'am.

718
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,220
Your Highness!

719
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,380
Are you alright?

720
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,100
It's fine, it's fine.

721
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,100
My legs feel a bit weak.

722
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:20,740
Well,

723
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:21,660
he...

724
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:23,500
is just too frightening.

725
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,980
Take a look, it's fresh.

726
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,100
Take a look.

727
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:43,180
Your Highness, Your Highness!

728
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,870
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

729
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:48,020
Mr. Kong once said, "Riding a horse,
leaning against a slanted bridge,

730
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,570
the entire street waves sleeves of red."

731
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,720
This must be what he meant.

732
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,620
You take the others
back to the mansion.

733
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:55,260
I'll visit the Lu Mansion
to find someone.

734
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:57,820
Understood.

735
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,880
Sir, let's return to the mansion.

736
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:04,180
(Lu Mansion)

737
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:05,940
Young Master Fan.

738
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,660
It seems
you have something to say.

739
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:22,660
Yesterday, I just met you
at the West Market,

740
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:25,180
I was thinking about
when we could chat again.

741
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:28,780
I didn't expect to see you
right in front of my residence today.

742
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,060
My beloved Lingyu

743
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,000
is staying at your residence.

744
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,340
In the future,

745
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:36,900
I might visit and disturb you often.

746
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:40,380
Beloved? I did not see that yesterday,

747
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:41,900
I didn't realize you are pitiful,

748
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,820
you love but cannot obtain.

749
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,260
Your sincere demeanor

750
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,300
is quite touching, indeed.

751
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,820
What do you mean by this?

752
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,420
My feelings for Lingyu are genuine.

753
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,380
There's no fake at all.

754
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,540
Since you say so,

755
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,620
what could possibly be fake?

756
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,140
No need to test me.

757
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,180
I am here

758
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,300
with only one purpose:

759
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:10,260
to bring my fiancée back home.

760
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,740
Then, we'll see if you can.

761
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,700
Young Master Fan, be careful.

762
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,740
Make sure you

763
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,380
don't let yourself fall into trouble.

764
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,900
She hides her identity from us,

765
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:25,060
but today she has time

766
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,500
to use her title as a princess,

767
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:27,940
and meddle in others' affairs.

768
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,780
- Exactly, exactly.
- Right.

769
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,100
Look, look,

770
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,220
isn't that Lu Yun and Fan Qingchen?

771
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,060
How did they end up together?

772
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,100
Indeed.

773
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,220
By the looks of it,

774
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,300
could it be one of those

775
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,140
two men
fighting for one woman scenarios?

776
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,620
- No way.
- It's all Miss Luo's doing.

777
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,380
Young Master Fan
truly has deep feelings

778
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,220
for Miss Luo.

779
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:54,660
He sincerely wants to marry her.

780
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:58,180
But no one
in this mansion can help him.

781
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:01,340
And Miss Luo is quite stubborn.

782
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:05,000
What a pity that such a good match
has come to naught.

783
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,540
Let's leave now.

784
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,660
Why are you so hostile towards me?

785
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:32,180
Could it be you've fallen for Lingyu?

786
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:35,860
What if I have?

787
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:42,580
Mind your own business.

788
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,180
Don't covet what isn't yours.

789
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:46,940
Is it just a game

790
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,340
or genuine affection?

791
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,020
Since I can tell,

792
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:52,340
my Lingyu is not a fool either.

793
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:00,500
Did I say something wrong earlier?

794
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,480
Your Highness, you spoke perfectly.

795
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:04,260
You made quite an impression.

796
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:05,820
It left everyone in awe.

797
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:06,740
Really?

798
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,660
I was unsure.

799
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,540
Glad I could help you.

800
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:14,220
Truly, without your help today,

801
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:16,940
I would've been
taken back to Shuozhou.

802
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,340
I thank you here.

803
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,020
I have said,

804
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,380
I just hope you can always be free

805
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:23,660
and unrestrained.

806
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,540
I'm glad I could help.

807
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:27,220
Nothing else matters.

808
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:34,060
May I ask you a favor?

809
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,300
I'll agree to not just one,

810
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:36,820
but many.

811
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:40,100
Can you call me Miss Lau

812
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,580
like you did before?

813
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:43,780
No need to be so formal.

814
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:47,700
Even "Miss Lau" feels formal.

815
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:49,940
Can I call you Tang?

816
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,780
Of course, Lingyu.

817
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:55,660
She trusts you

818
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,860
because she wants to escape her past

819
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,860
and cling to a lifeline.

820
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,460
In time, she will see the truth

821
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:05,220
and realize who she can rely on.

822
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:07,260
In time, my possessions

823
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:08,870
will come back to me eventually.

824
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:12,260
The way he looked at you
before leaving

825
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:13,980
made me feel uneasy for no reason.

826
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:16,420
He seems like someone
who won't let go easily.

827
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,740
I helped you this time,

828
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,620
but it also made him wary.

829
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:22,020
What should we do in the future?

830
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,500
I promise,

831
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:27,980
what you want won't be taken away.

832
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:32,660
Young Master Fan, be cautious.

833
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:34,860
Don't risk your life.

834
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:37,580
Then what?

835
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:43,060
If I truly lose my life,

836
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:47,100
I will take my beloved with me.

837
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:51,300
It wouldn't be a bad way
to leave this world.

838
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,070
Face challenges bravely,

839
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:05,310
and deal with obstacles wisely.

840
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:07,780
We'll overcome all hardships.

841
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,500
Things will be resolved.

842
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:16,820
Third Young Master?

843
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,500
Tang,
I have other matters to attend to.

844
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:20,820
