=Episode 10=

23
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,940
Do you remember
I spilled Shouzhou Tea

24
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,500
bestowed by the grand tutor
when you were my study pal?

25
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,900
You took the blame for me,

26
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,860
and stood through three days of classes.

27
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,100
Xuechen.

28
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,940
I brought Tang here, and I...

29
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,420
Your Highness.

30
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,580
I came to visit you.

31
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,660
Changyi, it seems you and Lu Yun

32
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,460
share as deep a bond as I heard.

33
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:25,980
If so,

34
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,740
the bond between you and Lu Yun

35
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,620
is even stronger than "a deep bond".

36
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,500
After all, since you came back,

37
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,540
you've only seen Father for once,

38
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,820
yet you visit the Lu Mansion daily.

39
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,500
Have a seat.

40
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,020
If it weren't for
the sneak attacks on the way,

41
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,300
I wouldn't have realized

42
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,900
that someone didn't want me back,

43
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,020
and wouldn't have given up
my carefree life.

44
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,380
Sneak attacks?

45
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,020
Brother, what do you mean?

46
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,500
Do you truly not understand

47
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,820
what I mean, Changyi?

48
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,500
Your Highness,
have you heard any rumors?

49
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,860
Since you remember
the Shouzhou Tea event,

50
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,140
then you may not forget

51
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,300
Aman is not a person
of malicious schemes.

52
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:34,900
Aman...

53
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,660
Lu Xuechen.

54
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,980
Is this what you call "etiquette of rank"?

55
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,140
It turns out you two are deeply bonded,

56
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,940
while we are bound only by rank.

57
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,140
I do remember the friendship
from ten years ago

58
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,140
and the Shouzhou Tea,

59
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,740
but others may not.

60
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,340
Lu Xuechen,

61
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:01,900
what do you think?

62
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,260
If you truly remembered,

63
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,020
you wouldn't have done

64
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,980
what you did yesterday and today.

65
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,980
Even if you remember,

66
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,700
tea from ten years ago

67
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,380
is undrinkable now.

68
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,220
He was ambushed on his way back.

69
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,260
He suspects it was me.

70
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,380
Or rather, us.

71
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,620
Prince Hengyang is the head
of the North Army.

72
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,600
There are two possibilities.

73
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,900
Either Beichu plans to assassinate him,

74
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,820
or...

75
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,580
Or he fabricated the story himself.

76
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,340
I've asked Zhao Yuan
to follow Fan Qingchen.

77
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,420
We'll know more soon.

78
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:54,580
Have some tea.

79
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,660
Mr. Zhou helped us today.

80
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,020
We should properly thank him.

81
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,340
My Lady,

82
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,900
this place is so elegant.

83
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,620
It was chosen by Mr. Zhou.

84
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,460
Indeed wonderful.

85
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,380
Mr. Zhou.

86
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,020
Mr. Zhou?

87
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,180
Mr. Zhou!

88
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,820
Mr. Zhou.

89
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,020
Blood.

90
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,420
Lingxi, go fetch a physician!

91
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,540
Yes.

92
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,060
Mr. Zhou.

93
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,140
Physician Xue,

94
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,740
how is Mr. Zhou doing?

95
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,860
Mister?

96
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,340
I couldn't be wrong.

97
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,020
Could he have some incurable illness?

98
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:23,020
Miss Luo, this person is not a man.

99
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,460
She is like you, a young lady.

100
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,220
Lady?

101
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,260
What about the blood...

102
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,500
It's menstrual blood.

103
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,100
Exactly.

104
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,660
This lady fainted because of her period.

105
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,500
Just one needle prick will help.

106
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,820
But her energy and blood are weak.

107
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,220
She needs Four-ingredients Decoction.

108
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:55,980
Miss Luo.

109
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,260
Miss Luo.

110
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,260
I'll prepare the medicine for you.

111
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,700
What a pity.

112
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,140
Another fine man

113
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,460
is lost in this world.

114
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,060
However,

115
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,620
it's a blessing

116
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,580
to have met such a unique lady.

117
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,540
Physician Xue.

118
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,340
Please keep her identity a secret.

119
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,300
Alright.

120
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,580
Thank you.

121
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:27,640
I'll take my leave.

122
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,500
Lingxi, see Physician Xue off.

123
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,460
Miss Luo.

124
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,740
Don't get up yet.

125
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,100
Miss Luo.

126
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:49,980
Wait.

127
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,540
You are a woman,

128
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,300
and I am a woman too.

129
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,820
This jade pendant helped me once.

130
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,380
When you face difficulties,

131
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,580
I should help you.

132
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,180
By the way,

133
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,700
these are menstrual pads
brought by Lingxi.

134
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,180
When you're out and about,

135
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,140
you need to protect yourself well.

136
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,460
Miss Luo,

137
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:20,140
do you mind
that I hid my identity from you?

138
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,100
Of course, I do.

139
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,780
You were on my matrilocal husband list.

140
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:30,980
With this change,

141
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:34,740
the already sparse list
feels even more empty now.

142
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,200
Can't believe I missed
such a great opportunity

143
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,620
to become your matrilocal husband.

144
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,120
Now I must study diligently,

145
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,500
and achieve scholarly honors

146
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,780
to make up for this regret.

147
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,380
Miss Luo, if you ever need anything,

148
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,220
I, Yangling, will be there to help.

149
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,020
Your name is Yangling?

150
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,140
Zhou Yangling.

151
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,340
This name means "keep pursuing".

152
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,180
It truly suits your nature.

153
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:11,980
I never expected this.

154
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,060
We came to thank her,

155
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,860
but surprisingly found her secret.

156
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,340
There's someone else we must thank.

157
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,300
My Lady, who is it?

158
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,780
Do I need to prepare anything?

159
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,740
(Lu Mansion)

160
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,860
Did you invite me here for tea

161
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,860
just because I helped you unexpectedly?

162
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,300
It's not just that.

163
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,980
I heard from Hua

164
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:53,140
that you asked Madam Lu to help me.

165
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,700
I just felt sorry for Hua

166
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,060
depending on others for a living.

167
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:58,940
She is pitiful.

168
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,220
I wasn't helping you.

169
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,260
No matter the reason,

170
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,540
I should be grateful to you.

171
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,180
I owe you a favor.

172
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:10,820
I'll repay you.

173
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,420
I can't tell if you're reckless or bold.

174
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,540
You dared to ask

175
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,820
Prince Hengyang for help.

176
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,460
Do you know his background?

177
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,740
Where do you get the nerve?

178
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,260
I don't know

179
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,100
what Prince Hengyang is like.

180
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,940
But I do know

181
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,900
that Fan Qingchen is wary of him.

182
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:29,820
That would be enough.

183
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,020
But after meeting Prince Hengyang today,

184
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:39,020
I find he is indeed as approachable
as people say.

185
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,340
Miss Luo, you are truly remarkable.

186
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,860
But if Prince Hengyang

187
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,140
didn't help you today,

188
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,300
what would you do?

189
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,240
Go back to Shuozhou with Fan Qingchen?

190
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,220
I don't know Prince Hengyang,

191
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,180
but I do know the character of you.

192
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,180
You are a person of noble character.

193
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,460
You wouldn't stand by and ignore

194
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,060
a helpless woman like me, would you?

195
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,800
Don't think that saying nice things

196
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,780
will let this pass.

197
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,240
"A deity is easy to invite,
yet hard to dismiss."

198
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,580
If it weren't for my help,

199
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,900
how would you appease Prince Hengyang?

200
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,740
It was urgent.

201
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,620
I couldn't afford to think twice.

202
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:29,100
Anyway, you did offer help.

203
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,540
Didn't I make the right bet?

204
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,700
In any case,

205
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,140
we avoided danger several times.

206
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,580
Thank you, Third Young Master.

207
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,500
I offer tea in place of wine

208
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,180
to toast you.

209
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,900
Is your gratitude just offering tea?

210
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,220
These tea leaves were even bought by me.

211
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,700
Of course not.

212
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:14,900
This is...

213
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,780
I saw your Qing Courtyard

214
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,740
was always dark.

215
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,460
I feared you might stumble at night.

216
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,940
So I made two lanterns for you.

217
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,420
You can lower them with the rope.

218
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:34,700
There, it's done.

219
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,820
But why are they two crabs?

220
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,780
Are you mocking me
or being domineering?

221
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,100
Of course not.

222
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,500
What I mean is...

223
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,480
Thank you.
[*Homophone of crab]

224
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,810
My gift is quite nice, right?

♪This love's riddle, your heart cold as steel♪

226
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,590

227
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,460
Look.

♪In this life, meeting you
is fate's best hand♪

232
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,980
This crab lantern is exquisite.

233
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,500
You didn't give it to someone else, right?

234
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:23,220
If you must ask...

235
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,460
I didn't, of course.

236
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,740
You won't accept a shared gift,

237
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,820
but surely two crabs are fine.

238
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,900
I insist just one crab.

239
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,860
Bite you, bite you, bite you.

240
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,380
Bite you.

241
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,420
- Bite you.
- Don't ruin mine.

242
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,500
(Xuewu Courtyard)

243
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,060
Who's there?

244
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:57,900
Lingyu.

245
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:58,900
Are you alright?

246
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,100
I've heard that recently,

247
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,260
Fan Qingchen has been bothering you again.

248
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:04,940
Let's talk inside.

249
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,860
Lingyu, what exactly happened recently?

250
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,700
It's just a minor issue.

251
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,660
Thankfully, Prince Hengyang helped me.

252
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,220
My brother?

253
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,840
My brother usually doesn't like to

254
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,100
meddle in others' affairs,

255
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,940
yet you managed to seek help from him.

256
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,740
Lingyu,

257
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,620
how many hidden talents do you have?

258
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,860
I think

259
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,700
Prince Hengyang is quite kind-hearted.

260
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:40,500
Yesterday, he not only
drove away Fan Qingchen

261
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,020
but also invited me to his welcome banquet.

262
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,460
However,

263
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:50,140
the host for the banquet
is yet to be decided.

264
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:53,020
Can I recommend myself?

265
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,540
I understand now.

266
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,460
You are my future sister-in-law.

267
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,300
That's right.

268
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,660
No, what sister-in-law?

269
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,740
I don't have such ambitions.

270
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,100
I just want to use his influence

271
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,340
to completely get rid of Fan Qingchen.

272
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,020
Oh, I see.

273
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,940
I think you'd make a perfect sister-in-law.

274
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,380
I have many brothers.

275
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,340
Surely there is a match for you.

276
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,540
What are you talking about?

277
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,060
Nothing.

278
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,380
Tang,

279
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,900
how is your relationship

280
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,340
with Prince Hengyang?

281
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,060
Naturally, it's good.

282
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:45,660
Though we are not born
of the same mother,

283
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,900
he really treats me well.

284
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,340
He values family and friends.

285
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,060
His character is another matter.

286
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,580
I just want to know

287
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,860
what does Prince Hengyang
like or dislike?

288
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:04,900
He is a martial arts enthusiast,

289
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,620
and loves horse riding
and practicing martial arts.

290
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,740
However, he's not very patient,

291
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,500
especially with scholarly matters.

292
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,060
I see.

293
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,140
Tang, here.

294
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,860
Have some tea and think it over.

295
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,420
What else

296
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,860
does he like or dislike?

297
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,020
Just tell me

298
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,500
whatever you can think of.

299
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,260
(Prince Hengyang's Mansion)

300
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,580
It's been several days.

301
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,020
Why hasn't Miss Luo arrived yet?

302
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,060
Could it be she's busy shopping?

303
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,740
(Wind Across the Miles)

304
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,460
Your Highness.

305
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,060
Your Highness, outside the mansion...

306
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:04,900
It's her.

307
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,860
A vendor is selling apricot.

308
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,720
You love apricot so much?

309
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,060
Your Highness.

310
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:24,540
Do I look like I have nothing to do?

311
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,220
That makes me feel like

312
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,380
I might be disturbing you, Your Highness.

313
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,900
Didn't expect you would come.

314
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,060
Come in, please.

315
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,220
Thank you, Your Highness.

316
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,700
You're getting bolder.

317
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,960
You dare go to
Prince Hengyang's Mansion alone.

318
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,100
Xuechen.

319
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,780
The business we didn't discuss...

320
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,620
Aman.

321
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,100
You've been coming

322
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,460
too frequently.

323
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,580
My father is pressing.

324
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,180
He said since you don't want a position,

325
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,640
writing policy essays would be good.

326
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,780
I'm here to follow up.

327
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,940
I already finished them.

328
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,060
They're in Qing Courtyard.

329
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:14,980
Go get them yourself.

330
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,020
It's been a pretty eventful day,

331
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:17,860
to be honest.

332
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,260
Xuechen.

333
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,020
Xuechen.

334
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:23,980
What's with him?

335
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,820
In such a hurry.

336
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:27,900
Sorry, sorry.

337
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,020
Let me help you.

338
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,780
I'm truly sorry.

339
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,380
I didn't look at the road.

340
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,220
It's alright.

341
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,020
Sir, thank...

342
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,180
Did she go that way?

343
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,380
She's in Yuezhou.

344
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,060
Thank you, sir.

345
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,220
- It's you.
- It's you.

346
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,500
(He's the one I met at the dock.)

347
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,100
(Why is he here?)

348
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,500
After that day,

349
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,260
I couldn't find Miss Zhou,

350
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,260
but I appreciate your generous help.

351
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,700
You're welcome.

352
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,340
It's good you didn't find her.

353
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,860
What I mean is...

354
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,940
Sir, don't worry.

355
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,580
You'll surely find her.

356
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,020
If there's nothing else,

357
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,260
I'll take my leave.

358
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,540
Sir,

359
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,260
what are you doing?

360
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,380
I remember the Lu Mansion has no farmland.

361
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,660
These are teaching tools.

362
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,460
It's getting late.

363
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,340
I need to
take the students out for study.

364
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,780
If I delay further,

365
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,340
it'll be too late.

366
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:40,800
You're so young,

367
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,900
yet you're already a teacher
at Lu Family School.

368
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,120
I didn't mean you're too young

369
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:48,980
to be a teacher.

370
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,620
You flatter me.

371
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,980
I'm just a teaching assistant.

372
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,300
A teaching assistant.

373
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,700
Sir, you use this for teaching,

374
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,540
and plan to go out to study.

375
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,980
You're truly talented.

376
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,940
I find this lesson quite interesting.

377
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,540
Can I join you to take a look?

378
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,500
Didn't you say it's urgent to go?

379
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,540
Let me help you.

380
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:17,980
Never mind.

381
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,780
At this moment, I am Zhou Zibo,

382
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,380
not Zhou Yangling,

383
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,180
but...

384
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:27,460
What's his connection
with Prince Changyi?

385
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:33,740
Could he be Prince Changyi?

386
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:46,980
Sir.

387
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,220
Coming.

388
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,140
(If he truly is Prince Changyi,)

389
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,500
(he wouldn't lower himself)

390
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,100
(to plant crops in the rain.)

391
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,380
Sir, how long do we need to work?

392
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:11,700
The reason

393
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,860
I brought you all here to plant chives

394
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,260
is that

395
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,780
chives are different
from other vegetables.

396
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,380
If it's planted well,

397
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,540
you can harvest five or six times a year.

398
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,740
Interestingly, these chives never learn.

399
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:25,860
They get cut,

400
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,120
yet they grow back quickly.

401
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,900
Therefore, most people

402
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,740
in Yuezhou grow and harvest chives,

403
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,620
and eat them fresh.

404
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,540
Isn't that wonderful?

405
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,900
Generations of scholars appear,

406
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,300
yet not all of them keep taking exams.

407
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,340
As for chives,

408
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,340
they're cut and regrow,

409
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,420
grow and are cut again.

410
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,220
Chives will eventually be used up,

411
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,120
so there must always be someone
to plant them.

412
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,500
And civil servants, too,

413
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,300
will have their twilight years.

414
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:53,260
Therefore, new voices
must emerge for the people,

415
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,260
and serve the nation.

416
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,340
You are scholars aiming at
the Imperial Examinations.

417
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,340
One day,

418
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,540
your name will be inscribed
on the Golden List.

419
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:05,300
Naturally, you will solve problems
for the people.

420
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,900
People survive on food,

421
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,660
only by valuing

422
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,620
and learning these crops and vegetables,

423
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,340
can you truly serve the people,

424
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,820
and meet their expectations.

425
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,060
That's insightful.

426
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,300
Indeed, you speak wisely.

427
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,940
Chives stand for lofty pursuits.

428
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,100
They should be praised.

429
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,860
Since you think I'm right,

430
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,380
why not hurry up

431
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,400
and plant these senior-like chives

432
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,340
in the fertile land

433
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,340
that helped you grasp these principles?

434
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,180
- Okay.
- Got it.

435
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,220
- Go ahead.
- Come on.

436
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,260
Keep digging.

437
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,540
- Okay.
- Let me handle this.

438
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:37,450
Okay.

439
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,300
I'll go over there.

440
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,780
Sir.

441
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:48,340
Sir, do you know how to plant chives?

442
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,620
No, but I can learn.

443
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,340
Then you can plant it yourself first.

444
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,620
I will stand watching.

445
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:11,820
This is wrong.

446
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,700
The sprouts should be like this.

447
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:14,700
They're upside down.

448
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,260
Sir.

449
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:25,540
You can't even tell the head from the tail.

450
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,940
You haven't done farm work.

451
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,620
That day I saw you at the dock.

452
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,220
Even the patrol soldiers respect you.

453
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:37,860
Are you perhaps
from the Imperial Family?

454
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,380
(If he knew my true identity,)

455
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,100
(he probably
wouldn't be this casual with me).

456
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:46,420
Those brothers at the dock

457
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,340
are showing respect
because of my father.

458
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,980
How could any imperial family member

459
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,500
wander around like I do every day?

460
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,780
I truly wish to learn from you.

461
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,100
Please give me a chance.

462
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,340
Understood.

463
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:02,340
Please plant all these as well.

464
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,500
Okay.

465
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,100
Sir,

466
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:17,660
don't use your hands.

467
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,660
They're quite dirty.

468
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,580
You're wiping the wrong spot.

469
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:22,820
It's right here.

470
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,180
Pardon my intrusion.

471
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,500
Why are you smearing my face?

472
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,380
We can clean together later.

473
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,660
I'll plant first.

474
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:44,100
(It's rumored
that Prince Changyi is very wise.)

475
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,780
(This person...)

476
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,140
(Not him.)

477
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,220
Are you...

478
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,280
The big one is more useful.

479
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:56,380
(Wind Across the Miles)

480
00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:00,380
Regarding the welcome banquet
you mentioned,

481
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,900
I volunteered to organize it.

482
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,140
Miss Luo, tell me.

483
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:09,380
Why should I entrust you
with this banquet?

484
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,660
From a public perspective,

485
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:13,100
we were both raised
at the Northern Border.

486
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,940
We can host the banquet in Shuozhou style,

487
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,780
which suits your preferences,

488
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,980
making it feel familiar and comforting.

489
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,300
It also showcases
the northern charm to Yuezhou guests.

490
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,180
What about

491
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,220
the personal perspective?

492
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,060
Privately,

493
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:30,740
I want to organize a good banquet for you.

494
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,700
Since you mentioned it,

495
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,540
do you have any ideas?

496
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,460
I know

497
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:47,380
that you dislike the usual formal banquets,

498
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,860
or the gatherings focused on
literary debates,

499
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,500
so I plan to host

500
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,380
a martial banquet for you.

501
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,420
A martial banquet?

502
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,940
Your Highness, you will know by then.

503
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,980
I'll give my utmost effort.

504
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,420
I won't let you down.

505
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,020
Your Highness, I'm leaving.

506
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:13,820
Miss Luo.

507
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,540
Regarding the banquet details,

508
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,460
I have matters to discuss with you.

509
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:20,580
Why not stay for dinner before leaving?

510
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,180
Thank you, Your Highness.

511
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,980
- But I...
- It's already 7 pm.

512
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,220
- The dinner at home has gone cold.
- Mr. Lu.

513
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:31,100
Why hasn't my cousin returned yet?

514
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,420
Could she have lost her way?

515
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,660
Third Young Master,

516
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:36,940
you...

517
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,460
Why have you come?

518
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,100
Naturally, I've come to bring you back.

519
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,900
Has all your usual training gone to waste?

520
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,420
How dare you let a stranger in?

521
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,460
Go get punishment.

522
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:52,860
- Yes.
- Yes.

523
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,100
Your Highness.

524
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:56,660
Since when did you

525
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:59,700
develop the habit of trespassing?

526
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,820
Miss Luo is my aunt's niece.

527
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,740
Though we're not related by blood,

528
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,740
we are still cousins.

529
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,540
It's getting dark,
and my cousin hasn't returned,

530
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,940
so I came to find her.

531
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,060
How is that trespassing?

532
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,900
Don't make things difficult for me.

533
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,260
You brought this upon yourself.

534
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:24,060
Your Highness,
Third Young Master meant no harm.

535
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,860
He was merely concerned for my safety.

536
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,540
That is why he offended you.

537
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,580
It's getting late.

538
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,720
How about I invite you another day

539
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,620
to Zuixian House for a drink?

540
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,620
That sounds good.

541
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,060
Miss Luo and I are family.

542
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,300
Only by hosting together

543
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,260
would it be proper
to invite Your Highness.

544
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,180
Lu Yun, you've stayed in Yuezhou for long.

545
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,620
You must get used to local dishes.

546
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:51,700
But I really can't get used to them.

547
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,900
I fear it will be difficult to dine with you.

548
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:55,900
Is that so?

549
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,060
It's fine if you don't like local dishes.

550
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,100
I know a bit about cooking.

551
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,140
I can prepare
some Northern Border cuisine.

552
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,060
I will cook some other day,

553
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,940
and invite you to come, Your Highness.

554
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,620
Since you've said so,

555
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,540
I won't keep you now.

556
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,380
But on the way back,

557
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:21,180
please be extra cautious, Miss Luo.

558
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:26,300
Don't let some people take advantage,

559
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,260
and make things worse.

560
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,260
Your Highness, don't worry.

561
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,700
I'm here.

562
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:34,580
How could anything happen to Miss Luo?

563
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:44,500
Your Highness, I'll take my leave.

564
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,620
Let's go, let's go.

565
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,700
Head back for dinner.

566
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,060
It's quite late.

567
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,540
Why haven't you returned home? Go.

568
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,700
I attended your lecture.

569
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,460
You're truly knowledgeable,

570
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,300
and have insights,

571
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,220
especially the phrase
"worthy of people's trust".

572
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,580
It's enlightening.

573
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,600
"Read thousands of books,

574
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,900
and travel thousands of miles."

575
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,380
No matter how much one reads,

576
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,040
practical experience is still the key

577
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,780
to share joys and sorrows with the people.

578
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:18,580
I wish to seek more guidance from you.

579
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,220
Do you have time, sir?

580
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,580
If you sincerely seek guidance,

581
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,700
I am more than willing.

582
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:29,980
But I do have something today.

583
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:30,820
It's of importance.

584
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,380
Then I will take my leave.

585
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,140
I'll visit you another day, sir.

586
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,300
Alright.

587
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,020
By the way, sir,

588
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,740
I haven't asked for your name yet.

589
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,460
My name is

590
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,140
Zhou Zibo.

591
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,180
May I know how to address you, sir?

592
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,420
My surname is Lu.

593
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,540
I am the fifth in my family,

594
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,380
a cousin from the Lu Clan of Yuezhou.

595
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,460
A cousin.

596
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:01,900
(Lu?)

597
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,940
(Seems I overthought it.)

598
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:09,180
Mr. Lu,
weren't you looking for a lady earlier?

599
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:13,660
Her surname is also Zhou. Who is she?

600
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,340
And what is her relation to you, sir?

601
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,660
Perhaps I could help you find her.

602
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:24,740
She is the daughter
of Master Zhou of Wuzhou.

603
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,060
I'm entrusted to

604
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,460
look for her for an old friend.

605
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,100
If you know her whereabouts,

606
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,060
please inform me.

607
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,540
Thank you in advance.

608
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,460
You are too kind, sir.

609
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,660
I shall take my leave then.

610
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,780
Father didn't lie.

611
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,060
Though born within palace walls,

612
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,180
the way of the ruler

613
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,780
must be sought outside the palace.

614
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,820
The Lu Family School
indeed nurtures talent.

615
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,940
This trip was worth it.

616
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,860
(Lu Mansion)

617
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,980
My Lady, we've arrived.

618
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,300
I'm leaving.

619
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:22,700
Wait!

620
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,220
Today I ventured into that dangerous place

621
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,260
to rescue you.

622
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:31,820
Miss Luo, don't you have anything
to say to me?

623
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,660
If it weren't for me,

624
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,380
you would've angered Prince Hengyang.

625
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,660
We'd be stuck
in Prince Hengyang's Mansion.

626
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:40,380
You were as gentle
as a spring breeze to him,

627
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,480
greeting him with a smile,

628
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,300
but you speak to me in cold words.

629
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,140
Forget it.

630
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:48,180
It's disheartening
to save an ungrateful person.

631
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,900
I wondered why I smelled something sour.

632
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,380
It turns out you're being jealous.

633
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:55,980
That's nonsense.

634
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,460
Why would I be jealous?

635
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,980
When did you learn magic tricks?

636
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,860
What? Don't you like it?

637
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,220
If you don't,

638
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,140
I'll give it to Prince Hengyang.

639
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,420
Since you prepared it sincerely,

640
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,820
I'll reluctantly accept it.

641
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:30,620
(He fetched me
from Prince Hengyang's Mansion.)

642
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,300
(Though it almost went wrong,)

643
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,500
(I didn't expect)

644
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,380
(he would be jealous over me.)

645
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,220
(It's quite a pleasant surprise.)

646
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,940
I understand your feelings.

647
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,060
I'm doing this

648
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,900
for the days ahead.

649
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,260
I only pretend with others,

650
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,460
but I'm sincere with you.

651
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:54,540
♪Our love story, I'll slowly pen♪

652
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,150
♪In this life, I wish for your words♪

653
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:01,350
♪From black hair to white,
we'll brave time's trend♪

654
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:04,410
♪In this life, may our love never fades away♪

655
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:07,700
♪Outshining all the world's glories,
come what may♪

656
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:16,940
Your Highness,
are you really fond of Miss Luo?

657
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,620
Have you completed the task

658
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,500
at Lu Mansion?

659
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,340
It's done.

660
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,460
But recently,
these things seem quite odd.

661
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:27,940
Indeed.

662
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,340
I felt Miss Luo

663
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,340
might be behind

664
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,300
all these events.

665
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,900
Sir, you're overthinking it.

666
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,060
It happened suddenly.

667
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,460
And she risked her safety
rushing forward,

668
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,620
clearly acting on impulse.

669
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:41,860
I think

670
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:42,820
she's truly impressed

671
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,500
by you, Great General of the North,

672
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,660
and admired you for long.

673
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:48,420
If there's a plan, it's to get close to you.

674
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:51,460
But you entrusted
the welcome banquet to her.

675
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,260
Isn't it a bit too hasty?

676
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:56,540
You all overthink her intentions.

677
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:59,980
Can't she simply admire me?

678
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,780
She told me herself today

679
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:05,140
she will host the welcome banquet for me.

680
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:08,300
Everything she does is for me.

681
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,900
As long as you're happy.

682
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,380
If that girl truly admires...

683
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,860
Your Highness,
Young Master Fan seeks an audience.

684
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:17,660
What does he want?

685
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,380
Let him in.

686
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:20,620
Yes.

687
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:30,620
Your Highness,
I am here by my father's order

688
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,420
to report to you about Fan Clan's

689
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,820
military supplies
for the North Army this year.

690
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:37,140
Why not report this
at the Northern Border?

691
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:38,580
A few days ago,

692
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,580
you kept pushing forward

693
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,420
in front of such a big crowd.

694
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,820
Now you seek an audience so late.

695
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,420
Why is that?

696
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,460
He brought a follower.

697
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,380
Sister,

698
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:07,020
you're dedicated
to the Zhongshan Banquet.

699
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,980
Success or failure hinges on this.

700
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,660
Only if I make this banquet a success

701
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:17,900
will Prince Hengyang see my worth.

702
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,660
I'm worth his help

703
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,580
to deal with Fan Qingchen.

704
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:30,260
My Lady, we'll set off
in a few days to Zhongshan

705
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,340
for preparations.

706
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,460
We haven't packed the clothes yet.

707
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,220
My Lady,

708
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,100
formal dresses require

709
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,060
customization.

710
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,180
It's too late to arrange it now.

711
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:42,620
This Zhongshan Banquet...

712
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,380
Many important guests will come.

713
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,860
What should we do?

714
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,980
It's just a minor issue.

715
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:50,260
As long as we stay close
to Prince Hengyang,

716
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,860
and others will see us as friends.

717
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,940
Even if we are in rags,

718
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,620
they'll think we are unique.

719
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,420
But what if Brother Yun misunderstands?

720
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:04,140
Sister, you plan to marry him in the future.

721
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,060
Once this matter is settled,

722
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,060
I'll explain to him.

723
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,900
He'll have to endure for now.

724
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,420
(Prince Hengyang's Mansion)

725
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,180
Wake him up.

726
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:31,940
Why did you
sneak into my mansion with him?

727
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:33,980
What's your purpose?

728
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:39,380
Could he be like the previous Death Warriors?

729
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,460
Is his target you, Your Highness?

730
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,740
I'll ask you one last time.

731
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,420
Who sent you here?

732
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,260
No one.

733
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:07,620
Your Highness,
what do you plan to do with him?

734
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,100
Keep him.

735
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,900
His master will come looking for him.

736
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:24,460
However,

737
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,940
since you don't want Miss Luo
close to my brother,

738
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,220
why not use this chance

739
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,700
to keep her out of the welcome banquet?

740
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:33,780
That's her decision.

741
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:34,900
Why should I interfere?

742
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,260
Alright, alright, you're considerate.

743
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,180
(Gentle Breeze and Bright Moon)

744
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,340
How's the investigation
on the sneak attack?

745
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,180
We don't know if it's true or not.

746
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,460
Nothing unusual at his mansion recently.

747
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:47,860
It seems

748
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:49,700
he's fully...

749
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,140
focused on Miss Luo.

750
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:56,700
Maybe he's putting on a show.

751
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,820
I sense some jealousy here.

752
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,620
You should get your nose checked too.

753
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:03,660
Too?

754
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,060
To business.

755
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,060
Today at the Imperial Court,

756
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,660
they examined the assassins' bodies.

757
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:10,860
What did they find?

758
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,660
All died by biting poison pills.

759
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,180
They're Death Warriors.

760
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,420
He has no evidence,

761
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:17,540
nor any witnesses,

762
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,020
yet tries to accuse you.

763
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,660
When we played together as children,

764
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,260
you two were the closest.

765
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,980
But after the upheaval, General Lu...

766
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,420
It's been such a long time.

767
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,380
Even the best relationships fade.

768
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,500
Now he confronts you directly.

769
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,620
"It's hard to avoid a hidden arrow."

770
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,180
We must plan ahead.

771
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,460
Young Master.

772
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:44,860
What's wrong?

773
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,100
Zhao Yuan is missing.

774
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:47,900
What?

775
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,320
He was following Fan Qingchen,

776
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,180
and entered Prince Hengyang's Mansion.

777
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,100
Prince Hengyang's Mansion.

778
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,460
Fan Qingchen is indeed cunning.

779
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,060
He only appeared after we left.

780
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,620
What should we do next?

781
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,140
This involves a prince. We must be cautious.

782
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:05,900
But it concerns Zhao Yuan.

783
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,500
I must go personally

784
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,340
to be at ease.

785
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,820
- Let's go.
- Xuechen.

786
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,220
I've made up my mind.

787
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,820
Zhao Yuan is my father's companion,

788
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,580
and is important to me.

789
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:16,920
Prince Hengyang will

790
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,260
definitely increase guards.

791
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,140
How will you break in?

792
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,580
It's too dangerous. Don't go.

793
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,580
Yes, that makes sense.

794
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,700
Prince Hengyang has asked Miss Luo

795
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,320
to organize the welcome banquet.

796
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:32,620
This way,

797
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:33,980
I will accompany Miss Luo

798
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,180
to Zhongshan tomorrow

799
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,320
to prepare in advance

800
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,220
and bide our time.

801
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,660
(Lu Mansion)

802
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:48,420
Lingxi, be careful with

803
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,860
those dark-colored bags.

804
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,860
Don't worry, My Lady.

805
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,780
Here. Be careful.

806
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,220
Place it carefully.

807
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:55,860
Sister.

808
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:56,700
Give me a hand.

809
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,540
- Hua.
- This one.

810
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,140
Sister, can I go with you?

811
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,980
I can help you a lot, Sister.

812
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:03,820
I mean it.

813
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,900
Hua, are you so reluctant to leave me?

814
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,420
- Then come with me.
- Sure.

815
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,940
I will bring you more books

816
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,140
and some homework, alright?

817
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,500
No need. No need for that.

818
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,260
- See you.
- Be good at home, okay?

819
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,510
Okay.

820
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,460
My Lady, everything is ready.

821
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:24,100
But we have quite a lot of stuff.

822
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,660
We can only squeeze in.

823
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:26,940
No worries. Let's go.

824
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:27,980
- Okay.
- Miss Luo.

825
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,460
You're going to Zhongshan.

826
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,540
Why not take me along?

827
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,100
Third Young Master.

828
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,100
Organizing the banquet alone is tiring.

829
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,340
I volunteered to

830
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,540
lend a hand.

831
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:46,980
Thank you, Third Young Master.

832
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,700
Alright, let's go.

833
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:52,900
Let's go.

834
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,300
Look, it's beautiful ahead.

835
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,380
Truly beautiful.

836
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,860
(Zhongshan Villa)

837
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:19,020
(Chuiwan)

838
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:23,700
(Touhu)

839
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:38,020
(Zhongshan Villa)
Young Master, My Lady, we've arrived.

840
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:50,420
