=Episode 17=

23
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,650
Miss Luo.

24
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:58,650
Mr. Lu.

25
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:05,490
I'm here.

26
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:13,940
Everyone,

27
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,700
sorry I'm late.

28
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:17,260
Please forgive me.

29
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:18,650
I was fortunate enough

30
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:20,250
to watch the stunning dance

31
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,460
of Miss Luo just now.

32
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,010
Miss Luo dances gracefully,

33
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,130
her hands like orchids blooming,

34
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:30,420
her waist flowing like duckweed,

35
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,620
her sleeves fluttering
like falling snow,

36
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:35,180
and her glance
as charming as rippling waves.

37
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,620
Every time Miss Luo dances,

38
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:38,980
she spares no pains.

39
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,290
To watch such a performance

40
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:44,260
is a joy and a great fortune.

41
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,730
Mr. Lu is right.

42
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:46,860
Absolutely right.

43
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,420
Mr. Lu is right.

44
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:49,980
Yes, yes.

45
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:51,730
No one has ever danced like this.

46
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:53,290
Who could have imagined it?

47
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,260
Mr. Lu, you arrived midway

48
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,320
and didn't see the entire performance.

49
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,100
If you vote hastily,

50
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,850
it might be unfair to other ladies.

51
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,540
That's true.

52
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:10,850
Miss Chen, you make a valid point.

53
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,420
So I decide

54
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,260
not to vote myself.

55
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:16,200
I will give my vote

56
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,010
to those
who watched the performance today.

57
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:22,570
Let everyone choose
their Flower Goddess.

58
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,060
Let us?

59
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,260
- Well...
- What should we do?

60
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,770
Everyone, His Majesty cares for all,

61
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,930
holding the Contest to share joy

62
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,650
and invite people to enjoy together.

63
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:37,630
Since that's the case,

64
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,700
the result
shouldn't be decided by judges.

65
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,060
Why not listen to the people's voices

66
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,930
and choose the Flower Goddess together?

67
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,130
Good point.

68
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:55,820
Long may you reign, You Majesty.

69
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,690
Rise.

70
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,260
Thank you, Your Majesty.

71
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,260
I believe Lu Xuechen speaks wisely.

72
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:03,740
In that case,

73
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:09,340
I will let everyone here vote

74
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:14,010
for this year's Flower Goddess.

75
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,830
I think Miss Luo is great.

76
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,020
Miss Luo is great.

77
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,690
I think Miss Chen is better.

78
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,860
Miss Luo is better.

79
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,010
She dances like a koi fish.

80
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:22,900
Isn't it wonderful?

81
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,340
Koi leaps over the dragon gate.

82
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,460
Koi fish are auspicious

83
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,580
and can bring good fortune.

84
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,130
I also choose Miss Luo.

85
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:30,450
I take your good words,

86
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,290
hoping that I can succeed in the exam

87
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,620
like a fish leaps over the dragon gate.

88
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,050
I also want to make a wish.

89
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,300
Miss Luo is wonderful.

90
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,220
We all choose her.

91
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,770
- We choose Miss Luo.
- We choose Miss Luo.

92
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,730
What should we do now?

93
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,120
- Miss Luo truly deserves it.
- Miss Luo.

94
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,130
- I choose Miss Luo.
- I choose Miss Luo.

95
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:47,340
- Miss Luo!
- Miss Luo! Miss Luo!

96
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,180
Alright, alright.

97
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,020
Miss Luo!

98
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:49,930
Be quiet.

99
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:55,050
I believe everyone heard the result.

100
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:59,740
- It's Miss Luo.
- Miss Luo, Miss Luo!

101
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,020
It's Miss Luo.

102
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:05,130
All the ladies' dances are outstanding.

103
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,300
Each has its merits.

104
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,740
Xuechen gave the public right to vote.

105
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,420
Miss Luo reflects the people's will.

106
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,570
She is truly the Flower Goddess.

107
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:21,530
- Bravo!
- Great.

108
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:27,090
- Miss Luo!
- Miss Luo, Miss Luo!

109
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:27,930
Congratulations.

110
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:28,860
Miss Luo.

111
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,370
Miss Luo has won.

112
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,370
Miss Luo is the Flower Goddess.

113
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,370
Bravo!

114
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:38,170
- Great!
- Great!

115
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,370
Thank you, Your Majesty.

116
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,300
You

117
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,330
shouldn't just thank me.

118
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,980
You should also thank Xuechen.

119
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:52,580
Your performance is great,

120
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:55,610
but it needs his effort too.

121
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,490
Sister, you did it!

122
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:03,890
Miss, are you nervous?

123
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,050
When I grasped the rope,

124
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,410
my palms are sweating from nervousness.

125
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,460
You looked so graceful. So beautiful.

126
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,650
Lingyu, you spoke very well today.

127
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:12,650
That's great, Miss!

128
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,090
Your Highness.

129
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,890
I knew you would win.

130
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,820
Thank you, Your Highness.

131
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:28,370
Every year,

132
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,170
the Flower Goddess

133
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:33,490
is granted a wish by me.

134
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,980
Since I am here today,

135
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:38,890
you may express your wish.

136
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:43,540
Your Majesty,

137
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,650
my name is Luo Lingyu.

138
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:46,820
My parents

139
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:50,610
died in the battle of Jingyang
ten years ago.

140
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:54,420
The property was all held
by the government.

141
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,290
Your Majesty, please allow me,

142
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,930
as an unmarried daughter,

143
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,450
to reclaim the property from Jingyang.

144
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,890
Let me fulfill my ancestors' will

145
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,820
and uphold the family honor.

146
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:13,050
You're truly a filial daughter.

147
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,210
I shall grant your wish.

148
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,980
I'll have someone
get your property back.

149
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:22,770
You can rest assured.

150
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,540
Just wait at home.

151
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:29,100
Thank you, Your Majesty.

152
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,860
Alright, rise.

153
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,980
Please stand up, Miss Luo.

154
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,170
A few days ago,

155
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,330
Hengyang and I made a bet.

156
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,260
Unexpectedly,

157
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:51,420
you truly are as he said,

158
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,780
both virtuous and talented,

159
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:54,490
gentle and refined.

160
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,490
You and he truly

161
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,650
are a perfect match,

162
00:07:58,970 --> 00:07:59,930
a pair made in heaven.

163
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,620
Eunuch Gao.

164
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,140
- Here.
- Draft an imperial edict.

165
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:09,580
The Flower Goddess, Luo Lingyu,

166
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,050
is gentle and sincere,

167
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:12,760
with excellent character and looks,

168
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,540
worthy of Prince Hengyang, Liu Mu.

169
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,770
I am very pleased to hear this

170
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,700
and allow you to get married.

171
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:26,650
- His Majesty grants a marriage.
- Great!

172
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:29,140
A match made in heaven.

173
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:31,490
It's His Majesty's blessing.

174
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,010
They're truly a match made in heaven.

175
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,380
Thank you for your grace, Father.

176
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,330
Miss Luo.

177
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:42,450
Miss Luo.

178
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,980
Miss Luo.

179
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,940
Miss Luo is so happy that she's stunned.

180
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,250
Hurry and accept the decree.

181
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,810
Thank you for your grace, Your Majesty.

182
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,620
- Good!
- Good!

183
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:56,010
In that case,

184
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:00,210
I won't interfere with your celebration.

185
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:04,180
Get ready to return to the palace.

186
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:09,810
Please take care, Your Majesty.

187
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,540
That was wonderful.

188
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,330
- Luckily, we're here.
- Indeed.

189
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,490
(Huayi House)

190
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:23,060
This year's Contest is truly excellent.

191
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,570
Miss Luo performed so well.

192
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:26,570
Thanks for the praise.

193
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:27,770
Thank you, thank you.

194
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,140
Thank you.

195
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,210
Miss Luo.

196
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,060
Your Highness.

197
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,330
Miss Luo, we will marry soon.

198
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,100
No need to be so formal with me.

199
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:44,770
Your Highness,

200
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,180
why did His Majesty grant this marriage?

201
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:50,220
Your Highness, why are you...

202
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,540
You are so remarkable.

203
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,450
You're naturally a perfect match.

204
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,620
Your dance amazed all of Yuezhou today.

205
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,770
Even my father hopes for us

206
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,620
to marry soon.

207
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,770
Miss Luo will be escorted by my people.

208
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,810
No need to worry.

209
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,250
Lu Yun?

210
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:18,210
I live with Mr. Lu at the Lu Mansion.

211
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,180
It's convenient for us
to go back together.

212
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:22,890
Sorry to disappoint.

213
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,420
I'll take my leave first.

214
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,540
Your Highness, let's meet another day.

215
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:27,940
Okay.

216
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,500
Mr. Lu,

217
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,180
let's go.

218
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:36,570
Your Highness,

219
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,380
farewell.

220
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,330
Zhao Yuan, let's go.

221
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,620
(Although we're engaged,)

222
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:51,250
(she has someone else in her heart.)

223
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,330
Your Highness, it's such a good day.

224
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:03,620
Why aren't you happy?

225
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:10,010
Huo Dao,

226
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,540
if a city is taken in battle,

227
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,020
what would you do?

228
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,450
Do everything to reclaim it.

229
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,060
Miss, come see these fresh flowers.

230
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:29,650
Miss.

231
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,450
Sir, let me help you onto the horse.

232
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:41,740
Sir, take care.

233
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:08,010
You found out?

234
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:09,890
When did you find out?

235
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,380
When you entered Huayi House,

236
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:14,810
I sensed something was off.

237
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:16,690
I thought I acted well.

238
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:19,330
That's your guise for others.

239
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,060
But I know your eyes aren't like that.

240
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,650
Nothing can be hidden from you.

241
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,490
Your eyes are like this.

242
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:28,570
Why did you come over?

243
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,340
I promised you.

244
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,580
(The marriage is not pressing.)

245
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,500
(His eyes are the priority right now.)

246
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:50,140
(Huayi House)

247
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,900
Miss, you've done well already.

248
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,620
It's Miss Luo who's deep-minded.

249
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,180
She also pretended to know nothing.

250
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,420
I think she was well-prepared.

251
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:03,980
Qiuyue,

252
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,500
what do you mean?

253
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,900
What do you mean by well-prepared?

254
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,460
Miss Luo

255
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,700
initially prepared the Qipan Dance too.

256
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,620
But in terms of dance skills,

257
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,900
she definitely your inferior.

258
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,300
You were sure to win.

259
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,300
Who knows

260
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,180
she suddenly changed to the Koi Dance?

261
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,020
Mother suddenly asked me to learn

262
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,420
Master Mei's Qipan Dance,

263
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,740
which coincided with Miss Luo's dance.

264
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,060
I performed just before Miss Luo.

265
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,020
Qiuyue,

266
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:41,540
is there such a coincidence?

267
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,580
You must know something.

268
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:47,860
Tell me the truth now.

269
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:55,660
Physician Xue,

270
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,540
is Mr. Lu seriously injured?

271
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,660
Mr. Lu's blindness

272
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,820
is not caused by ordinary poison.

273
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:03,940
It's very peculiar.

274
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,180
When will he recover then?

275
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,100
If you ask me this way,

276
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,820
I dare not answer.

277
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,430
Let him follow the prescription

278
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:15,140
for a few more days.

279
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,660
The rest depends on his fate.

280
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,260
He might recover in a few days.

281
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,140
Maybe in the future...

282
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,660
Alright, let Mr. Lu rest well.

283
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,060
I take my leave now.

284
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,260
- No, no.
- Physician...

285
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,980
Physician Xue, Physician Xue!

286
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,180
You can't just leave.

287
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,780
You need to take care of him.

288
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,700
My master is still so young.

289
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,980
Please help him.

290
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,540
Physician Xue, I beg you.

291
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,500
Go brew the medicine.

292
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,900
Yes, Miss.

293
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,220
Do your eyes still hurt?

294
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,820
Is there discomfort anywhere else?

295
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,100
I'm fine.

296
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,660
Don't worry too much.

297
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,820
Physician Xue is like that.

298
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,940
He exaggerates small issues.

299
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:17,900
Besides,

300
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,740
didn't he just say so?

301
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,940
I may recover in a few days.

302
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,460
This isn't a trivial issue.

303
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,100
What if it doesn't heal soon?

304
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,420
What if it lasts a lifetime?

305
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,900
I've always been a carefree youth.

306
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,140
If it lasts a lifetime,

307
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,420
it won't stop me from enjoying life.

308
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,740
If that's your attitude,

309
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,940
don't claim to know me.

310
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,900
I never realized before

311
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,940
you're so worried about me.

312
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,220
I was merely offering some advice.

313
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,740
It's getting late.

314
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,020
You should rest early.

315
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,540
Wait a moment.

316
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,700
You...

317
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,340
What are you doing?

318
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,540
I need to ask you.

319
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,250
His Majesty granted a marriage today.

320
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,500
Are you truly willing?

321
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,340
Or I should ask...

322
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,500
Do you have feelings

323
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:49,900
for Prince Hengyang?

324
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,140
What does it matter?

325
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,420
This is an imperial edict.

326
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,260
It's getting late.

327
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,100
You rest early.

328
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,580
Wait.

329
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,300
You...

330
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,180
Are you alright?

331
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,340
I'm afraid of ghosts.

332
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,420
Afraid of ghosts.

333
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,460
I mean the ghost you saw

334
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:31,000
when you first came to Xuewu Courtyard.

335
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:35,020
Isn't that the ghost Jinchuan faked?

336
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,140
Hua even scolded him for it.

337
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,460
How could it be?

338
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:39,980
If it weren't a real ghost,

339
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,060
why would you come to protect me, right?

340
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:43,790
I was just pretending...

341
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:50,500
I remember you're not afraid of ghosts.

342
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,460
I was just pretending.

343
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,900
I was merely feigning calmness.

344
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,300
You don't know,

345
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,220
ever since that night,

346
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,320
I'm afraid of the dark

347
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,700
and have to sleep with lights on.

348
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,020
Now that I'm blind,

349
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,260
no amount of light can help.

350
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,100
And I'm too scared to be alone now.

351
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,380
Isn't Jinchuan still here?

352
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,380
Jinchuan snores so loudly.

353
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,220
How can I sleep?

354
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,100
Forget it.

355
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,740
If you really doesn't want to stay,

356
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,260
I won't force it.

357
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:26,820
I can just

358
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,340
be alone with eyes shut,

359
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,820
enduring the cold till dawn.

360
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,100
You may leave.

361
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:52,940
Go ahead.

362
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:56,900
Just go.

363
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:01,500
When did you learn to feign innocence?

364
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,700
Let go of my hand.

365
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,220
I won't let go, I won't.

366
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:12,620
Fine, fine.

367
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:17,180
Then I'll stay with you tonight.

368
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:18,860
Just one night.

369
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,180
Alright,

370
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,740
thank you, Miss Luo.

371
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,420
(Qing Courtyard)

372
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,060
I saw your dance today is different

373
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,980
from what you showed me that night.

374
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,860
How is it related to the little fish?

375
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,740
Little fish... Little fish.

376
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,020
Since you kept it,

377
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,980
why not give it a name?

378
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,580
I already did.

379
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,060
Little fish.

380
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,660
Little Yu.

381
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:14,650
I used your name "Yu".

382
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:24,180
Everyone loves beautiful things,

383
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,660
like a bird in a cage,

384
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,220
or a fish in a pond.

385
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,260
Without exception.

386
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,300
Then I'll release it tomorrow.

387
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,500
If it desires freedom,

388
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,220
I'll return it to the sea.

389
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,300
No need for that.

390
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,580
Miss Luo.

391
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,180
Luo Lingyu.

392
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,090
(If I accept the royal marriage,)

393
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:32,140
(I can gain family property and honor.)

394
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,500
(Why don't I feel happy?)

395
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,860
(Defy the decree?)

396
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,780
(Not to mention the family property,)

397
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,900
(Hua and I even can't keep our lives.)

398
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,420
(How can this be resolved?)

399
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,860
Is it chime bells

400
00:21:58,860 --> 00:21:59,980
in your box today?

401
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,460
You played excellently today.

402
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,940
Can you play chime cells too?

403
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,420
I've learned a bit.

404
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,700
Your tune was very well played.

405
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:13,060
You combined
the solemnity of chime bells

406
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,220
with the lively Qing music,

407
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,620
like the sound of the forest and spring,

408
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,580
clear and beautiful.

409
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,140
Thank you for flattering me.

410
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,980
Today, Miss Luo's Koi Dance

411
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,340
truly caught everyone's attention.

412
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,940
My chime bells

413
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,420
were just to enhance
her dance a little bit.

414
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,100
Zibo, don't underestimate yourself.

415
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,460
Miss Luo has her own strengths.

416
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,220
But I prefer your performance.

417
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,460
Apologies, Your Highness.
The road is bumpy.

418
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:45,940
(Why doesn't Zibo have an Adam's apple?)

419
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,140
Mr. Zhou,

420
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,620
I was engaged with a lady.

421
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:06,020
Recently, I sent a letter to her father.

422
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,420
I want to annul the engagement.

423
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,260
What do you think of this?

424
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,860
Since the engagement is set,
how could you...

425
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,380
You can't just back out.

426
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,780
It just rained. It's slippery.

427
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,100
Be careful.

428
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,020
Thank you for sending me back.

429
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,140
It's quite late now.

430
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,540
Be safe on your way back.

431
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,060
Alright.

432
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,660
Your Highness,
the wheel is stuck in the mud.

433
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,980
Please wait me to push it out.

434
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,460
Wait a moment.

435
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,420
The wheel is deeply stuck in the mud.

436
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,780
We need to push together
from both sides.

437
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,340
You lead the horse in front.

438
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,900
I'll push from the back.

439
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,260
Let me help you.

440
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,700
No, Your Highness. You're noble.

441
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,300
I can handle this labor myself.

442
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,860
Mr. Zhou, let's start now.

443
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,380
Are you alright?

444
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,260
- Let me help.
- No need.

445
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,220
Your Highness, I...

446
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:31,860
Two, three.

447
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,390
I don't believe it.

448
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,700
One, two, three.

449
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,340
Three.

450
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:52,900
Your Highness, you...

451
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,700
Are you alright?

452
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,780
I'm fine.

453
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,420
Shall I help you up?

454
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,260
No need.

455
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,020
Come.

456
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,340
Up.

457
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,580
Your Highness, my hand...

458
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,020
I usually farm and pick chives.

459
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,020
I can't control it.

460
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,220
Did I hurt you?

461
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,420
No.

462
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:16,300
Do... you think of me as a chive?

463
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,220
No, I don't.

464
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,380
Your Highness, look at you.

465
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:19,660
You...

466
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,700
You are much prettier than chive.

467
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,460
You are...

468
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:30,580
I look so disheveled right now.

469
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,420
Right.

470
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,380
Your Highness, if you don't mind,

471
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,340
why not come to my little courtyard

472
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,380
and wash up?

473
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,820
But I only have some coarse cloth robes

474
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,500
and no hot springs.

475
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,620
Your Highness, you are a noble prince.

476
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:45,900
- What if...
- It's fine.

477
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,780
This is better than being

478
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,260
dirty and smelly in wet clothes.

479
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,020
True.

480
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,060
Sorry to trouble you, Mr. Zhou.

481
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:54,900
Alright.

482
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,140
Zibo,

483
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,740
could you bring me
a bucket of hot water?

484
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,700
This water's a bit cold.

485
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,540
Hot water?

486
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,620
Do I need to deliver water?

487
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,180
You have to wait a bit.

488
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:31,620
Why won't this fire start?

489
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,460
The water doesn't boil.

490
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,700
No need.

491
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,740
Warm water will do.

492
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,380
You still have to wait.

493
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,380
This firewood seems unsuitable.

494
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,420
I need to gather more wood.

495
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,700
I can't let the prince fall ill here.

496
00:26:59,140 --> 00:26:59,980
Well...

497
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:02,900
I am a man.

498
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,420
A man.

499
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,060
Two noses, one eye after all.

500
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,380
A man's bath.

501
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,900
It's not a big deal.

502
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,500
I can handle it.

503
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,740
- Water.
- Let me.

504
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,340
- We're friends.
- Just leave it there.

505
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,860
- I can manage.
- Is it hot enough?

506
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:23,740
- Let me.
- Well...

507
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,740
We're all men.

508
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,260
It doesn't matter.

509
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,420
- This is...
- I can do it.

510
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,260
Wait a moment.

511
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,180
I...

512
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,980
- I...
- You sit down.

513
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,380
Why don't you sit down?

514
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,460
Hot! Hot!

515
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:48,980
Sit down.

516
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,180
Or you can leave.

517
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,620
- I'll leave.
- Or you go first.

518
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,740
I'll go out.

519
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,380
Sorry, I'm really sorry.

520
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:09,540
That's a girls' voice.

521
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:14,280
This is Zhou Zibo's sister, Zhou Zitao.

522
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,380
You and Mr. Zhou truly are siblings.

523
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,460
You're so knowledgeable about crops.

524
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:28,620
(Why doesn't Zibo have an Adam's apple?)

525
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,500
(She is really a woman.)

526
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:40,940
(She is a woman.)

527
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,300
(If I reveal it now,)

528
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,900
(she may feel embarrassed.)

529
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,540
(I'd better pretend not to know.)

530
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:57,860
What a shame!

531
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,020
Is that how you do it?

532
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,260
After all these years,

533
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:05,460
you've had the best of everything.

534
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,260
Your father and I
nurtured you carefully,

535
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:11,140
hoping you'd bring honor
to the Chen Family.

536
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,820
Even if not for a good marriage,

537
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,940
at least
you can earn a good name for him.

538
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,460
Mother.

539
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,340
For you,

540
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,740
I am just the Chen Family's daughter.

541
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,260
I've never truly been Chen Xiu.

542
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,820
I wish to be myself for once.

543
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,500
Losing to a village girl,

544
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,660
do you still dare claim to be yourself?

545
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,260
If you're not the Minister's daughter,

546
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,900
whether you're Chen Xiu or Zhang Xiu,

547
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,100
who would care?

548
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,260
Therefore,

549
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,780
you instructed Qiuyue to bribe Qiniang

550
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:03,660
to teach me Luo Lingyu's dance.

551
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,380
It is because you don't trust me

552
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:10,380
to win the Flower Goddess by myself,
right?

553
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,580
Are you blaming me?

554
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,780
I arranged everything painstakingly,

555
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,620
yet you still lost to Luo Lingyu.

556
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:27,220
How dare you defy me?

557
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,420
Miss,

558
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,300
just give in a little.

559
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:46,100
I've been training hard since childhood,

560
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,940
hoping to become the noblest lady

561
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,420
of Yuezhou in an upright manner.

562
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,940
But now, your actions

563
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:57,420
contradict all my original intentions.

564
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,420
It's better if I don't become

565
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,820
such a noble lady.

566
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,300
What are you saying?

567
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:13,820
You've really been spoiled by luxury.

568
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,740
You don't want this life,

569
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,100
but many would.

570
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,740
If you don't want it, then leave.

571
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,660
If you dare step out today,

572
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:28,380
then don't ever return to Chen Mansion.

573
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:36,980
Miss...

574
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,300
Your Highness.

575
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:05,100
The Imperial Examinations
start in two days.

576
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,340
I must go back to study.

577
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,540
Forgive me for not walking you out.

578
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,180
Take care.

579
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:16,820
Zibo.

580
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,100
You are knowledgeable

581
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,140
and exceptionally talented.

582
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,220
I admire you sincerely.

583
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,380
May your exam go well

584
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:26,950
and your wishes come true.

585
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,020
Thank you.

586
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,100
(Virtues Shine)

587
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,340
Wang Chongming died?

588
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,460
The secrets about the Yellow Courts...

589
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,460
Yellow Courts is an old book now.

590
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,980
There are many versions on the market.

591
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,340
There are also many notable annotations.

592
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,660
Even if he knows the Yellow Courts,

593
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,140
he may not find the correct version.

594
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,500
Even if he tries each one,

595
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,820
it would take over a dozen people

596
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,500
several months to do so.

597
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,900
That makes sense.

598
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,780
It means that Young Master Lu

599
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,780
hasn't deciphered the secret letter yet.

600
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,260
No, even if he has deciphered it,

601
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,300
with one letter alone,

602
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,780
he can't harm us.

603
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,020
That's right.

604
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,780
The enemy is in the open.

605
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:29,260
Young Master Lu is not to be feared.

606
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,220
I received a secret letter,

607
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:36,700
stating Beichu's situation
is becoming clear.

608
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:40,540
The Third Prince
has gained strong support.

609
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:44,620
The new emperor will be clarified soon.

610
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:49,780
We should continue as planned.

611
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:52,260
How's the arrangement for the Censorate?

612
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:53,500
Don't worry about it.

613
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,740
Disrupt Nanyue's political scene,

614
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,380
place our people in key positions,

615
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:02,100
and we work together like we did before.

616
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,660
Nanyue will definitely be ours.

617
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:12,340
It's time to go home.

618
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:24,980
Why did father get involved with Beichu?

619
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,340
No.

620
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,420
I can't leave now.

621
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,580
Miss.

622
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:41,870
I've been looking for you.

623
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,140
What are you doing here,

624
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,580
dressed like this?

625
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:46,820
What are you planning to do?

626
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:49,740
Let me help you.

627
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,180
Don't think of leaving home.

628
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,340
Madam was just angry.

629
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,860
She still cares for you.

630
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,220
She spoke such words in anger.

631
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,380
Please don't...

632
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:03,700
You're right.

633
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,220
Let's go inside.

634
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,130
It's good you've understood.

635
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,900
Miss, did you come back from the study?

636
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,660
I saw the light in the study was on,

637
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,540
so I wanted to bid farewell.

638
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,260
But I suddenly thought

639
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,180
Father and Mother are always kind to me.

640
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:32,260
I was too impulsive today.

641
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:38,220
(Qing Courtyard)

642
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:02,660
Darn it!

643
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:04,580
I recovered.

644
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,980
I must have woken up wrong.

645
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:15,780
So quickly?

646
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,260
Sir, I'm here to change dressing.

647
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:29,900
Sir,

648
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,020
your eyes have recovered.

649
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,620
You just looked at me.

650
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,160
- Stop that.
- Look, look.

651
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,140
What bright eyes!

652
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,800
If you keep waving,
I'll really go blind.

653
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,860
I'm too happy.

654
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,900
No, it isn't the time to be happy.

655
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,620
Sir, you can't recover so quickly.

656
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:47,940
With the enemy approaching,

657
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,220
you need to use this injury

658
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,580
to gain Miss Luo's sympathy.

659
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,540
I know you despise such tactics,

660
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:55,180
but this one works.

661
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,300
How did I look yesterday?

662
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,620
I'll keep it up.

663
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,660
Sir, you finally got it.

664
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:03,860
Yesterday,

665
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,220
you were waited on hand and foot,

666
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:08,960
unable to lift anything,

667
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,420
weak and powerless.

668
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,620
Just completely useless.

669
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,460
Stop.

670
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,660
Just cover my eyes with a cloth.

671
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,140
I've already prepared it for you.

672
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:17,820
Black, white, red,

673
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:18,660
and linen, all of it.

674
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,300
Mr. Lu.

675
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,340
Hurry up.

676
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,020
There's no time left.

677
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,060
Mr. Lu.

678
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:31,060
Miss Luo.

679
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:39,460
Please take care of my Master.

680
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:41,380
Alright.

681
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,020
Is it you, Miss Luo?

682
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:50,620
Mr. Lu,

683
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,500
are your eyes feeling better?

684
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,060
They're still the same.

685
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:57,100
What's this cloth for?

686
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,660
I worried my eyes would scare you,

687
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:08,340
so I covered them with black cloth.

688
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:14,260
Even blind, your eyes are charming.

689
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,380
Miss Luo, what did you say?

690
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:23,580
I mean this black cloth looks bad.

691
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,600
I'll get you a new one.

692
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:30,910
Let me put it on for you.

693
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,100
Alright.

694
00:38:58,780 --> 00:38:59,740
There you go.

695
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,100
Thank you.

696
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,500
I'll go get the medicine.

697
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,020
Jinchuan is there.

698
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:13,580
I...

699
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:16,380
How about
going to the courtyard with me?

700
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,660
It's quite stuffy in this room.

701
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:28,060
I don't know

702
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,700
when I can see again.

703
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,780
Alright, alright.

704
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:38,180
You don't usually sound so melancholic.

705
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,420
Let me help you over there.

706
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:43,780
Okay.

707
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,500
Watch your head.

708
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,820
Be careful, there're pebbles underfoot.

709
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:54,650
This path is really hard to walk.

710
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:55,670
- Xuechen.
- Slow down.

711
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,540
Your Highness.

712
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,460
Your Highness.

713
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:05,580
Miss Luo.

714
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,540
Let me do it.

715
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,100
Your Highness, you're here.

716
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,740
No need, let Miss Luo do it.

717
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:12,700
Go.

718
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,220
Your Highness.

719
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:15,500
Your Highness.

720
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:18,620
Have a seat.

721
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:21,460
Miss Luo.

722
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,300
Please.

723
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,070
Thank you, Your Highness.

724
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:33,700
Your Highness,

725
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:35,980

726
