22

=Episode 25=

23
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:40,650
General,

24
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:43,250
the woman in the painting is that lady.

25
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,000
She...

26
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,760
How could she put herself in danger?

27
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:54,570
Impossible.

28
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,160
Impossible.

29
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:58,680
How sure are you?

30
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,810
About 70 to 80 percent.

31
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,210
General, I heard someone say

32
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:06,930
this lady's surname is Luo.

33
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,600
A descendant of the Luo Clan in Jingyang.

34
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:10,130
They can gather grain at a high price

35
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,570
because she brought out the property

36
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:12,960
accumulated over 100 years.

37
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:18,320
Jingyang...

38
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:20,650
Lingyu,

39
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,800
you even used your property to help him,

40
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,800
didn't you?

41
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,960
All soldiers, listen up!

42
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:32,050
- Here.
- Here.

43
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,680
The battle plan for Yi Pass has changed.

44
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,450
Retrieve all gunpowder devices

45
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,880
and place them at the front line.

46
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,960
Once ready,

47
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,320
we shall confront Nanyue.

48
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,010
Commander, gunpowder in the gorge

49
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:47,240
is most effective there.

50
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,210
If we face Nanyue head-on now,

51
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,880
we'll surely be at a disadvantage.

52
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,960
Pull out all his teeth.

53
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,800
Yes, sir.

54
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:01,730
- Commander...
- Move.

55
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,080
Commander!

56
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,290
Commander!

57
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:11,730
This is the price for loose talk.

58
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,960
Does anyone else have objections?

59
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,370
If not, get out of my sight.

60
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:22,970
Yes, sir.

61
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:32,650
Lingyu,

62
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,450
since you've come,

63
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,650
then don't leave.

64
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:41,730
I'll fight this battle for you.

65
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,580
(Yi Pass)

66
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,240
We march tonight.

67
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,400
Remember,

68
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,850
this is the closest point to Yi Pass.

69
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,680
You and Your Highness feign an attack,

70
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,930
while Mr. Huo and I cut off their rear,

71
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:09,160
try to make them use their gunpowder.

72
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,730
(He usually seems unreliable.)

73
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,800
- (But he looks commanding now.)
- Advisor,

74
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,810
- (A true advisor.)
- I can lead a team

75
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,890
to block them here.

76
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,960
What do you think?

77
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:22,080
No, let's stick to our original plan.

78
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,480
Proceed with caution.

79
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:29,490
Miss Luo is here.

80
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:31,890
Let's pause for now.

81
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,120
Everyone, go prepare quickly.

82
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,440
Yes, sir.

83
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,610
Miss Luo, we can finally eat our fill.

84
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,170
We even have meat.

85
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,320
It's all thanks to Advisor Lu.

86
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,160
Isn't it so?

87
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,570
Anyway, you can't stop the gossip.

88
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,530
Let's go.

89
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,400
- Go.
- Let's go.

90
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:53,730
Why are you here?

91
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,960
Follow me.

92
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,440
What are you doing?

93
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:40,930
Shaving my beard

94
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:41,970
or killing me?

95
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,480
If you say one more word,

96
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,010
I might not hold back with this blade.

97
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,370
When I woke up this morning,

98
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,730
I saw you busy as a bee.

99
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,890
It's been a while since you tidied up, huh?

100
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:01,330
Look up.

What a nice face,

104
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,240
but it looks so messy now.

105
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,840
In the military camp,

106
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,130
it's filled with rugged men,

107
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,360
who aren't too particular.

108
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,570
Sometimes I forget to shave for days.

109
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:24,210
So,

110
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,480
do you dislike me?

111
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,240
Don't move later.

00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,750

It's entirely your scent.

Report.

141
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,960
Beichu uses gunpowder to provoke.

142
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,530
His Highness wants to discuss with you.

143
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:15,930
I see.

144
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,520
You have serious matters to discuss.

145
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,980
Go quickly.

146
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:31,860
Wait a moment.

147
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,620
Be cautious in all things.

148
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:47,940
After I return,

149
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,140
I have something to tell you.

150
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:34,860
Today, we will reclaim lost lands

151
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,980
to avenge past humiliations.

152
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,840
Winning this battle will ensure

153
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,540
that the border is secure in the future.

154
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,740
Everyone,

155
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,500
do you have confidence?

156
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:47,660
Yes, we do!

157
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,500
Beichu has harbored ambitions

158
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,420
and occupies our land for a long time.

159
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,300
Everyone, follow Prince Hengyang

160
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,220
to guard the Northern Border

161
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,220
and defeat foes.

162
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:20,180
Defend the Northern Border, defeat foes!

163
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:27,860
To horse.

164
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,740
Wait for my return.

165
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,180
Start off.

166
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,940
We set off. Let's go.

167
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,500
You will like it

168
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,860
that I prepared for you, right?

169
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,540
I will surely make Lu Yun

170
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:57,860
disappear from your world forever.

171
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,140
Remember,

172
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,300
the purpose of this battle

173
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,220
is to provoke the Beichu to use gunpowder.

174
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:25,860
Charge!

175
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,540
Kill!

176
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,180
The enemy!

177
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,300
Miss, let me check first.

178
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:15,620
Okay.

179
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,140
Lingxi!

180
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,380
Miss! Miss!

181
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,060
Miss...

182
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,300
(They didn't use gunpowder.)

183
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,220
(Could it be we guessed wrong?)

184
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:01,800
Clean the battlefield.

185
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,540
(Lu Yun,)

186
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,220
(we once fought our own battles.)

187
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,380
(Yet you insist on coming to my battlefield.)

188
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,860
(Then I shall grant your wish)

189
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,740
(and let you witness it personally.)

190
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:24,180
(She ultimately belongs to me.)

191
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,980
Sir, bad news.

192
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:27,980
Someone reported

193
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,740
Miss Luo has been caught.

194
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,300
Move aside.

195
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,260
Huo Dao.

196
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,420
Lingyu.

197
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,860
It's been a long time.

198
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,180
I wonder

199
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,980
if you miss me.

200
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,420
I've traveled far to find my bride.

201
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,300
Go back with me.

202
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,780
When others ask in the future,

203
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,420
how will you introduce yourself?

204
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,780
(Mrs. Fan)
Mrs. Fan.

205
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,740
I only ask you to stay by my side.

206
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,100
Is even that too much?

207
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,180
Let go of me.

208
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,420
Why are you here?

209
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,940
And why...

210
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,380
Why am I still alive?

211
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,740
You seem quite disappointed.

212
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,420
Then let me show you

213
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,500
the hardships I've faced.

214
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,980
Look closely at this scar.

215
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,300
Look at these.

216
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:46,300
Can you see how hard it was to survive?

217
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,180
You are crazy.

218
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,220
You madman.

219
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,460
As long as I can see you,

220
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,800
what does it matter if I'm crazy?

221
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,100
I sought refuge with the Beichu Third Prince,

222
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,980
helping him ascend the throne.

223
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,660
I stayed by his side, seeking favor,

224
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,220
and doing all sorts of degrading things.

225
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,780
I can hold your hand again.

226
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:09,900
I know

227
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:13,020
it was all worth it.

228
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,220
Report. General, battle update.

229
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,100
Yi Pass has fallen.

230
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,380
- The gunpowder...
- Go away!

231
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,380
Yi Pass has fallen.

232
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,260
Beichu can't win.

233
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,740
Do you think I really care if Beichu wins?

234
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,100
My only goal now

235
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,180
is to trap you in this cage.

236
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,020
My wish is fulfilled now.

237
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,860
Even if you ask me to die with you,

238
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,500
I would still do it willingly.

239
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,380
But I don't understand.

240
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,900
You always avoid trouble.

241
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:58,500
Who are you here for this time?

242
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,660
For Nanyue.

243
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,860
To kill a traitor like you.

244
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,660
Fine.

245
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,780
If you want to kill me,

246
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,020
it means you still care.

247
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,140
I only hope that you can cling to me alone,

248
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,500
like this flower, for all generations.

249
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:25,260
We will never part.

250
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:33,900
Lingyu, rest well.

251
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:55,940
Lingxi.

252
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,980
- Young Master Lu.
- Any news of Lingyu?

253
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,420
I took this from the person

254
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,660
who kidnapped Miss Luo.

255
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,860
A powerful figure of Beichu.

256
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,060
He's from Nanyue.

257
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,980
Internal unrest could lead to changes.

258
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,780
It is said there was a Nanyue hermit,

259
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,300
who made contributions to the throne.

260
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,780
Nanyue hermit?

261
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,700
In recent years, Beichu

262
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,660
has indeed smuggled a lot of saltpeter.

263
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,090
Skilled in the art of saltpeter

264
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:20,000
and kidnapped Lingyu...

265
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,020
Sir, who could this person be?

266
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,020
Fan Qingchen.

267
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,500
He's not dead.

268
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,460
Zhao Yuan, watch over the military camp.

269
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,300
Yes, sir.

270
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,600
I'm going to save Lingyu.

271
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,420
Sir...

272
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,420
(Fan Qingchen?)

273
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,660
Lingyu,

274
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,260
according to custom,

275
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:05,260
the groom should comb the bride's hair.

276
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,860
Before we depart,

277
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:11,140
let me comb your hair.

278
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,860
Depart?

279
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,980
Where are you taking me?

280
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:20,260
To a place you'll surely like.

281
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,500
With such despicable means,

282
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,860
even if you gain my body,

283
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,380
you will never win my heart.

284
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,020
If I can't, then who can?

285
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,020
Lu Yun?

286
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,780
Lingyu,

287
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:37,300
I can easily

288
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,740
take you away from him time and again.

289
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,860
You still believe he can protect you.

290
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:45,660
Who is truly humiliating themselves?

291
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,140
He will surely find me.

292
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,020
Go away!

293
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,380
This is the first time you've touched me.

294
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,300
But,

295
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,900
I prefer you when you're obedient.

296
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:29,140
Fan Qingchen, why?

297
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,860
Why must it be me?

298
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,420
Why?

299
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,380
Don't rush.

300
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:39,980
The show is just starting.

301
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,100
Let me out!

302
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,260
Let me out!

303
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,620
Fan Qingchen, you're insane!

304
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,380
Where are you taking me?

305
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,020
Fan Qingchen!

306
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,420
- Fan Qingchen.
- Someone's here.

307
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,620
He's the Nanyue people.

308
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,380
Fan Qingchen!

309
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,020
Fan Qingchen!

310
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,900
Hand her over.

Hand her over.

325
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,660
I'll cover. You go save her.

326
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,140
Lingyu!

327
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,300
Lingyu!

328
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,900
Lingyu! Lingyu!

329
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:16,860
Lingyu!

330
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,500
Lingyu!

331
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,500
Lingyu!

332
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,140
You madman!

334
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:58,540
(Wedding Invitation)

335
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,540
(I'll marry Lingyu)

336
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,090
(and sincerely invite you to witness.)

337
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,130
First comb,

338
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,540
may we respect each other.

339
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,740
Second comb,

340
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,900
may we fly together like a pair of birds.

341
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:24,620
(Lu Yun,)

342
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,260
(we once fought our own battles.)

343
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,660
(Yet you insist on coming to my battlefield.)

344
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:34,700
(Come alone, or wedding turns to funeral.)

345
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,500
Fan Qingchen!

346
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,660
Mr. Fan, be cautious, or swords may stray

347
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,820
and kill yourself.

348
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,260
If that's the case,

349
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:07,540
I'll take my beloved with me,

350
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,420
which wouldn't be a bad thing.

351
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,660
(Lingyu, wait for me.)

352
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,020
Lingyu!

353
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,020
Lingyu!

354
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:42,540
Fan Qingchen, let me out.

355
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,020
Lingyu!

356
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,260
Lingyu!

357
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,020
Xuechen...

358
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,300
I'll get you out right away.

359
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,140
It's dangerous here. Leave now.

360
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:31,780
Go quickly!

361
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,380
Hurry, leave!

362
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,300
Xuechen!

363
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,260
Your Highness,

364
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,940
they are at the snow mountain ahead.

365
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,020
Let's hurry and rescue them.

366
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,140
Wait.

367
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,900
(Wedding Invitation)

368
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,700
Funiu Mountain is close to Beichu.

369
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,660
The terrain is remote.

370
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,720
Its territory is unclear.

371
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,380
It's a place our Nanyue people can't reach.

372
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,540
Moreover, too many horses

373
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,780
can cause the snow to shift.

374
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,060
This could lead to an avalanche.

375
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,300
Get off. Proceed on foot.

376
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,500
Yes, sir.

377
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:20,900
Hurry.

378
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,300
You finally woke up.

379
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:04,500
Xuechen.

380
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,300
Fan Qingchen, what are you doing?

381
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,460
Let him go.

382
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,780
I just use a rack

383
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,900
to break his right arm's bones.

384
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,780
Lingyu, don't worry.

385
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,660
Is this all you've got?

386
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:26,660
Only using such crude tools.

387
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:27,860
Fan Qingchen,

388
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,140
I overestimated you.

389
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,260
For today,

390
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,940
I specially prepared

391
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,500
powerful gunpowder.

392
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,020
Half is here,

393
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,380
half is over there.

394
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,420
The fuse is right in front of you.

395
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,380
(Gunpowder?)

396
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,100
(So the gunpowder is here.)

397
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:55,740
Ignite it and your lives will be spared.

398
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,980
Lingyu, the trouble you caused

399
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,020
must be resolved by yourself.

400
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:07,860
Today, I want you to kill him yourself.

401
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,660
What if I refuse?

402
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,740
Refuse?

403
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,180
Xuechen!

404
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:30,900
Don't look.

405
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,420
Close your eyes.

406
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:33,900
Don't look.

407
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,900
You are truly ruthless to yourself.

408
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,420
How can you stay silent?

409
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:42,260
His hand will break soon.

410
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,540
Lingyu, think about it,

411
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,900
how much longer can he endure?

412
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,500
Xuechen!

413
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,020
Stop this. I'll go with you

414
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,100
to anywhere you want.

415
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,500
Leave him here

416
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,740
to fend for himself.

417
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,660
From this day on,

418
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:09,900
wherever I am,

419
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:14,100
I shall never see him again.

420
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,860
Lingyu, haven't you realized yet?

421
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,260
He wants me dead.

422
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,140
He won't spare me today.

423
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,380
You are too noisy.

424
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,540
Xuechen!

425
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,260
Stop.

426
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,180
Lingyu,

427
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,940
if you can't bear to kill him,

428
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:45,860
it's alright.

429
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,260
Do you know why I leave him a hand?

430
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,540
This fuse is connected

431
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,540
to the gunpowder on Lingyu's cage.

432
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:04,700
Ignite it

433
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,100
to kill both Lingyu and me.

434
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,020
It all ends.

435
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:12,140
I doubt your love is deeper than mine.

436
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,900
Fan Qingchen, you must be joking.

437
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,540
I'm tied up right now.

438
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,500
Even if I ignite the fuse,

439
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,660
how can there be hope for me

440
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,620
in this freezing weather?

441
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,780
Why not untie me first

442
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,180
and let me think it over?

443
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,020
Shut up!

444
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,140
Stop playing tricks.

445
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,780
I hate your conceited look.

446
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,700
What are you doing?

447
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,340
Let go of me! Let go!

448
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,420
What do you want to do?

449
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:15,460
I'm doing what a husband should do.

450
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,780
Fan Qingchen.

451
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,020
Let her go.

452
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,980
Lu Yun, watch carefully.

453
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,860
You don't want to see him in pain, right?

454
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,220
Why not give him relief?

455
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,300
Fan Qingchen,

456
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:36,420
this will only make me hate you more.

457
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,500
Besides that,

458
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:40,700
you can't get anything at all.

459
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,220
Isn't hatred good?

460
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:44,940
Love fades away,

461
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:47,300
but hatred lasts long.

462
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:50,620
I want you to never forget,

463
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:53,220
unable to avoid or escape.

464
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,460
I want us entangled forever.

465
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,220
Being entangled forever

466
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,940
is truly laughable.

467
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,940
I'm the one she truly loves.

468
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,900
She will remember me forever.

469
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,220
All your efforts

470
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,940
are in vain.

471
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:32,740
Have you ever thought

472
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,980
if you don't ignite this fuse today,

473
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,220
I will keep her by my side forever.

474
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,340
One day,

475
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,860
she will completely belong to me.

476
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,540
Everything you've done

477
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,620
is just to make me suffer.

478
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,000
But now that it's come to this,

479
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,140
I have no regrets.

480
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,500
Being in love with Lingyu

481
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,420
is a fortune for me.

482
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,540
I should thank you.

483
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,660
The day Lingyu fled the Fan Mansion

484
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:12,180
was when we first met.

485
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:14,940
Seems like you're courting death.

486
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,260
Then I'll fulfill your wish.

487
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,420
Didn't you feel mighty

488
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,700
after being an advisor?

489
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,310
(After grinding for so long,)

490
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:24,780
(it should have broken.)

491
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,660
Let me first disarm you

492
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,220
and then gouge out your eyes,

493
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,660
so you'll watch me with Lingyu day and night.

494
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,980
Fan Qingchen, you're dreaming.

495
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,460
Lu Yun,

496
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,460
facing death, you are still defiant.

497
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,300
Since Lingyu can't bear to harm you,

498
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,700
let me handle it for her.

499
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:53,420
Enough!

500
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,460
I ignite it.

501
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,660
You're the one who should be killed.

502
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,180
Where are you going?

503
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,660
Hey,

504
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:53,460
this cat has no owner, very fierce.

505
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,980
Look, your hand is bleeding.

506
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,180
None of your business.

507
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,940
Be careful in the future.

508
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,300
Bleeding can be worrisome.

509
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:08,300
Done. I'll leave now.

510
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,620
Goodbye.

511
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:23,540
Is she concerned about me?

512
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:27,500
(I know you just wanted the cat to go.)

513
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,100
(I just wanted you to stay.)

514
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,220
Xuechen...

515
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:40,980
Lingyu...

516
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,380
Xuechen...

517
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:49,940
- Go.
- Go.

518
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,220
No one can leave.

519
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:07,180
If I ignite it, there'll be an avalanche.

520
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:09,620
Live together, die together.

521
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,780
I want us to be together forever.

522
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:24,780
Let's go.

523
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,180
Wuju, return to the camp.

524
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:43,540
(I must settle this today.)

525
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,540
From the south, north, and east,

526
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,820
advance separately to find them.

527
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:32,660
Yes, sir.

528
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:45,740
You want to harm her.

529
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:47,980
Is this what you call love?

530
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,460
It's Xuechen's horse.

531
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,500
Be careful.

532
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:18,500
Miss Luo.

533
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:19,860
Miss Luo.

534
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,140
Miss Luo.

535
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,020
Miss Luo.

536
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,620
Why is Miss Luo alone?

537
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,940
