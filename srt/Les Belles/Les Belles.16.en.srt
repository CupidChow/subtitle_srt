you're dressed so fine today.

Those who don't know you're the judge

37
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,980
might think you are about to perform.

38
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,420
I've come to tell you

39
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,490
that I just heard a piece news,

40
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:24,620
and I need to confirm it.

41
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:27,710
I might be late
to the Flower Goddess Contest.

42
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:28,980
Without you,

00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,210

but didn't expect it to be so precious.

Miss Chen of course.

92
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,370
Miss Chen's dance is most graceful.

93
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:14,300
- Indeed.
- It's unforgettable.

94
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:15,690
She's the best.

95
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,180

Look.

100
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,170
You must bet on her.

101
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,250
- Is it beautiful?
- This year,

102
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,740
even Princess Ningping is competing.

103
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:35,800

104
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:36,890

108
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:41,660
I wonder what kind of dance

109
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,060
has Miss Chen prepared this year.

110
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,940
Every year, Miss Chen wins the title.

111
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,000
I think this year too.

112
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,060
The Flower Goddess

113
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,460
will surely be one of these two.

114
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,540
I'll wager 50 copper
on Princess Ningping.

115
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,050
- Can I get by?
- 100 copper on Miss Chen.

116
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,980

200 copper, I'll bet on her too.

I'll raise, 300.

118
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:57,940
I'll also bet on Miss Chen.

119
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,370
I bet 100 copper on Miss Chen.

120
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,940
Sister, why is no one betting on you?

121
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,220
You only have 3 copper coins.

122
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,740
My lady keeps a low profile.

123
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:06,660
They don't bet because they lack vision.

124
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,050
Indeed, they lack vision.

125
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,900
No one pays attention,

126
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,170
so I can make a stunning debut.

127
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,740
I won't let these things bother me.

128
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,180
Let's go now.

129
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,020
Let's go.

130
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:18,650
Fifty taels.

131
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:22,580
I bet on Miss Luo.

132
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:27,260

00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,460
(Luo Lingyu)

134
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:34,610
Fifty taels.

135
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,370
Your Highness, you're indeed generous.

136
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:39,260
But why would you bet on Miss Luo?

137
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,460
Isn't Miss Luo also on the list?

138
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,570
Fifty taels is a lot.

139
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:44,650
Why shouldn't I place a bet on her?

140
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,700
But Miss Luo is not well-known.

141
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:48,370
She borrowed the Lu Family's influence.

142
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:49,370
That's why she's here.

143
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,820
How can she compare with others?

144
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:55,450
Your Highness, I'm afraid
you might lose money.

145
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,020
Betting on Miss Luo

146
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,930
is not a waste whether she wins or not.

147
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:02,370
Besides,

148
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,450
none of you have seen her performance.

149
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:08,460
Isn't it too early to judge?

150
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,300
That's true.

151
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,490
Perhaps,

152
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:13,020
Miss Luo is a dark horse,

153
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,300
standing out among others.

154
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,050
It's definitely possible.

155
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,170
- Makes sense.
- Indeed.

156
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,340
Your Highness,

157
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,540
your insight is unique.

158
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,220
Why don't we

159
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,490
- bet on Miss Luo.
- A little.

160
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,250
Let's bet a bit.

161
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,370
Just a bit.

162
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,020
Your Highness,

163
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:35,130
why spend so much on me?

164
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:36,770
I'm supporting you.

165
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,780
How can it be called a waste?

166
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,860
I'll bet on Miss Luo too.

167
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,170
Didn't expect you
to treasure this flower so much.

168
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:52,180
A gift from you is naturally cherished.

169
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,890
Thank you for your trust.

170
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,500
I won't disappoint you,

171
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,890
and your fifty taels of silver,
Your Highness.

172
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,130
The contest is about to start.

173
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,100
Let's go in.

174
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:06,410
Alright.

175
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:08,940
Is it here?

176
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:11,570
The organizer said it is.

177
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,130
This room is quite small.

178
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:24,740
It's not that small.

179
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:26,980
It's obviously small.

180
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,180
Look, the table is narrow,

181
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,060
and the stool is low.

182
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,450
This mirror is blurry.

183
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,570
The ceiling is too low,

184
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:40,170
and it's so dark inside.

185
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:42,210
How can you prepare in such a room?

186
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,380
It doesn't matter.

187
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,060
I only need a table and chair.

188
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,490
A short rest will do.

189
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:48,540
That's not suitable.

190
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,860
Without proper rest,

191
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,420
if you lose the contest, how can I...

192
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:57,890
Whoever wins the title of Flower Goddess,

193
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:01,450
I will grant her marriage to you.

194
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,010
Surely, Miss Luo will not lose.

195
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:11,420
How can you what?

196
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,570
I...

197
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,980
My fifty taels of silver,

198
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,500
won't they just be gone?

199
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:19,890
Rest assured.

200
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,050
I will do my utmost,

201
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,300
and won't let you down.

202
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,860
Anyway, you need a new room.

203
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:26,740
Sister.

204
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,380
Sister, what does he mean?

205
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,740
What's going on? Why change rooms?

206
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,200
Let's go.

207
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,690
Alright, maybe the other room is bigger.

208
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,010
Are you alright, Zibo?

209
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:06,980
Thank you.

210
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,540
(Zibo truly lives simply.)

211
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,860
(His waist is so slender.)

212
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:14,330
Zibo, you...

213
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:19,130
Where's your sister?

214
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,690
Why didn't she come with you?

215
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:22,650
Oh, her?

216
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:24,540
She went back home.

217
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,420
I still have this box to move.

218
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,220
Your Highness, you go ahead.

219
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,130
I'll help you.

220
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:30,540
No need, this box is very heavy.

221
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,460
I can handle it myself.

222
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,460
Do you think I'm weak?

223
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,550
Am I so helpless to you?

224
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:37,570
No, not at all.

225
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:39,770
It's okay.

226
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:42,210
Just tell me where to move this.

227
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,660
This box is a bit heavy indeed.

228
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,180
I'm afraid I can't hold it long.

229
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:50,650
Just over there is fine.

230
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:55,300
- Your Highness.
- Step back.

231
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:56,450
Yes.

232
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,380
Is this what it feels like
"seeing the one I like,

233
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:10,420
how could I not be pleased?"

234
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,540
- Let me help you.
- It's okay.

235
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:19,250
I can manage myself.

236
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,500
Almost there.

237
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,500
Sister.

238
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,100
Prince Hengyang is so kind to us.

239
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,540
This big room is all ours.

240
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,180
Hua, mind your manners.

241
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:39,370
Call him "Your Highness".

242
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:40,660
- It's fine.
- Your Highness.

243
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,500
Miss Luo, come in.

244
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,900
Prince Hengyang and Miss Luo?

245
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,180
Yes. Why are they together?

246
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,420
Who knows?

247
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,260
Your Highness.

248
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:49,690
I can handle this small baggage myself.

249
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,770
There's no need for formality between us.

250
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:53,320
Nothing is more important

251
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,380
than you obtaining
the title of Flower Goddess.

252
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,060
Thank you, Your Highness.

253
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:02,130
I should formally thank you.

254
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,980
But with the contest approaching,

255
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,690
I have to prepare my performance.

256
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,330
I fear I might be neglecting you.

257
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:11,820
Indeed.

258
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:13,860
Then I won't disturb you further.

259
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:15,860
By the way,

260
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,330
if you need anything,

261
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,210
just let someone inform me.

262
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:21,690
Don't hesitate to ask.

263
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,050
- Pastries!
- My Lady.

264
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:58,890
Prince Hengyang is so considerate of you.

265
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,770
These chairs and utensils are the finest.

266
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:04,330
Oh my goodness.

267
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,500
- It's perfect.
- Lingxi, look at this red one.

268
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,770
This one is quite nice too.

269
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:23,650
Yah!

270
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:26,890
Over here, follow them.

271
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,340
Don't let them get away!

272
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,330
- Yes.
- Zhao Yuan, let's go.

273
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,500
Yes.

274
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:10,380
- Bravo.
- Bravo.

275
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,090
Nice.

276
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:13,620
Judging phase.

277
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,250
B, B, C.

278
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:19,770
Next one.

279
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,180
Princess Ningping, Lau Tang.

280
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:26,890
It's the princess.

281
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,650
So beautiful!

282
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:31,370
This is the princess.

283
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,300
I've seen the Imperial Family compete here.

284
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,300
Yes, indeed.

285
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,210
(Tang, relax.)

286
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,980
It's surely unprecedented.

287
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,050
Yes, it's the climax.

288
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:41,890
Yes.

289
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,180
I'm so excited.

290
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,420
My heart is racing.

291
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,220
Princess Ningping?

292
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,810
This Princess Ningping...

293
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,130
- Why the rush?
- I'm coming.

294
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:22,650
Bright moonlight before my bed;

295
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:32,570
I suppose it is frost on the ground.

296
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:34,210
She isn't good at judging matches,

297
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:35,910
but is skilled in picking poetry.

298
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,420
I raise my head to view the bright moon,

299
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:49,570
then lower it, thinking of my home.

300
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:54,250
I raise my head to view the bright moon,

301
00:16:54,250 --> 00:17:01,220
then lower it, thinking of my home.

302
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,900
Such a good poem.

303
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,660
Why is everyone so quiet?

304
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:22,780
Bravo!

305
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:31,660
- Bravo.
- Bravo.

306
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,690
Bravo!

307
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,490
Great performance.

308
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:36,930
At first, it seemed simple,

309
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,260
but think about it.

310
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,320
The simpler it is,

311
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,450
the more touching it'll be.

312
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:41,850
I don't know why it's good.

313
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:43,090
It's just good.

314
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:44,330
- Wonderful.
- Yes, it is.

315
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,130
- Truly wonderful.
- Perfect.

316
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:49,210
- Bravo.
- Bravo.

317
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,100
- Bravo.
- Bravo.

318
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:53,530
Angelic voice.

319
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,020
I'm surprised.

320
00:17:58,130 --> 00:17:59,900
When I taught Tang this poem,

321
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,260
she was still very young.

322
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:03,740
Now she's grown up, a proper lady.

323
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,330
Indeed.

324
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:08,740
Judges,

325
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:13,380
although Tang's performance was simple,

326
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:16,980
I knew how much effort she's made.

327
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,020
So,

328
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:21,620
please judge fairly.

329
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,860
Regardless of the result,

330
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:29,410
she's already the best princess in my eyes.

331
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:35,660
- Yes.
- Indeed.

332
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:40,370
- Okay.
- Alright.

333
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,210
Father,

334
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,500
aren't you exaggerating?

335
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:45,780
Let me tell you.

336
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,690
Tang has grown up.

337
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:52,450
How can I not be happy as a father?

338
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,900
When you become a father one day,

339
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:58,450
you'll naturally understand.

340
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:04,900
Tang.

341
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:05,800
Congratulations to you.

342
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,210
Lingyu, I'm too nervous
to look at the results.

343
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:09,290
I need to get some rest.

344
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,690
Lingyu, if I become the Flower Goddess,

345
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,330
I'll give you the wish opportunity.

346
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,020
See you.

347
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,260
You...

348
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,770
Sister,

349
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,260
I never expected

350
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,620
that the princess could run so fast.

351
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,380
She left without checking the results.

352
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,250
Tang finally understood

353
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,570
how to act freely.

354
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:35,690
The scores are here.

355
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,140
Judging phase.

356
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,860
A, A, A.

357
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,250
With a simple poem
"Quiet Night Thoughts",

358
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,410
she got three A's.

359
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,530
I could get that too.

360
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:47,050
I...

361
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,260
(Lu Yun)

362
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,090
It's him.

363
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,500
Mr. Wang, Mr. Wang.

364
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,140
Young Master.

365
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,100
He's badly injured.

366
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:20,720
We must take him to the clinic.

367
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,420
Alright.

368
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:29,450
Watch out.

369
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:42,970
Watch out!

370
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:47,570
The next contestant, Lady Chen Xiu.

371
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,420
- Miss Chen.
- Miss Chen has arrived.

372
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,290
Miss Chen is here.

373
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:56,020
As expected, Miss Chen is stunning.

374
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:57,580
Sister, look.

375
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:00,170
They're wearing the same clothes as you.

376
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,740
It's so beautiful.

377
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,930
I'm really looking forward to it.

378
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,100
So excited about this.

379
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,250
Looks amazing, truly.

380
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,780
Alright, let's bet on Miss Chen.

381
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,900
It's truly the Qipan Dance.

382
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,620
They learned the same dance as you.

383
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,330
Miss Chen stole my sister's dance.

384
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:46,690
Kid, you're talking nonsense.

385
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:47,900
My lady

386
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,860
learned the Qipan Dance from Mei Qiniang.

387
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,300
Unreasonable coincidence!

388
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,140
Lingxi.

389
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:53,610
You must have done it on purpose.

390
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:54,450
Well,

391
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,900
stop making false accusations.

392
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,290
Mei Qiniang is the instructor
of Xunmei House.

393
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,490
The Qipan Dance is famous in Yuezhou.

394
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:02,980
Everyone can learn it if they pay.

395
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,180
Why can your lady learn it,

396
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,050
but my lady can't?

397
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:23,250
- Great.
- Stunning.

398
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,740
Marvelous.

399
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,020
Beautiful.

400
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:31,810
Absolutely beautiful.

401
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:37,100
- Nice.
- Perfect.

402
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:54,380
My Lady, it seems
Mei Qiniang is cunning.

403
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:56,050
She's been bribed by them.

404
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:57,740
And Miss Chen

405
00:22:58,090 --> 00:22:59,740
just happened to perform before you,

406
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,020
taking the advantage.

407
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,380
Qiuyue was right.

408
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:05,410
Mei Qiniang never had much rapport with us.

409
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,900
In business, money talks.

410
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:11,030
There's no reason to turn away customers.

411
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:12,740
Sister,

412
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:16,580
if you perform the same dance
as Miss Chen,

413
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,300
and you're not as good as her,

414
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,660
won't you lose face?

415
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:21,410
Why don't we

416
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:23,620
just give up?

417
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:29,170
Giving up isn't an option for me.

418
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,170
I think this year,

419
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:43,130
Miss Chen will be Flower Goddess again.

420
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,900
Miss Luo hasn't danced yet.

421
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:47,810
It's still uncertain who will win.

422
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:53,050
(Xuechen,)

423
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:54,450
(where have you been?)

424
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,410
(If you don't return soon,)

425
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,620
(my brother will reveal his feelings.)

426
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:15,940
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

427
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,900
- Miss Chen.
- Miss Chen.

428
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,020
A, A, A.

429
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,700
- Well done.
- Well done.

430
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,210
Miss Chen is stunning.

431
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:25,900
Miss Chen.

432
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,260
(Lu Yun)

433
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:29,450
My Lady, what should we do?

434
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:32,810
Third Young Master is not coming.

435
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:34,900
You underestimate me.

436
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:37,980
Inviting him was for fairness.

437
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:40,860
This Flower Goddess title,

438
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:43,260
I must win on my own.

439
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:52,690
I knew

440
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,690
it's up to me to earn it.

441
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,500
Zhao Yuan.

442
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:02,380
Get Mr. Wang to safety.

443
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,410
I'll guard your backs.

444
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:04,410
No, Young Master.

445
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,290
There might be many assassins.

446
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,500
Only he can decode
Beichu's secret letter,

447
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,970
and clear my father's name.

448
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:13,260
You are General Lu's only child.
You should go.

449
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,900
You... you...

450
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,020
Mr. Wang.

451
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:20,490
Are you General Lu's son?

452
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:21,330
Yes.

453
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:26,130
Ten years ago,

454
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:29,970
the key used by Beichu spies was...

455
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:33,100
- "Yellow Courts".
- "Yellow Courts"?

456
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,260
Mr. Wang.

457
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:39,900
Zhao Yuan.

458
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:14,740
The formation of the North Army.

459
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:16,570
You are from the North Army.

460
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,540
Young Master.

461
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:08,780
Young Master.

462
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:09,930
Young Master.

463
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,170
- Zhao Yuan.
- Yes?

464
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,500
My vision is blurry.

465
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,570
Lingxi, Yangling,

466
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,100
is everything ready?

467
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:26,330
Yes, My Lady.

468
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:29,090
Yangling, I'll count on you later.

469
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:30,260
Don't worry about it.

470
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:33,740
Sister, why aren't you worried?

471
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,500
Lingxi.

472
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:46,260
It's time to bring this out.

473
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:49,900
Sister, when did you make this?

474
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,490
So, Sister,

475
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:54,780
you knew something was wrong with Qiniang?

476
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,930
That day during rehearsal,

477
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:58,530
My Lady smelt on Qiniang

478
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:00,530
a peculiar fragrance,

479
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,620
exactly like Miss Chen's.

480
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:06,530
So I made a new dance costume

481
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:07,730
as a backup plan,

482
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:08,740
in case of emergencies.

483
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:11,930
Didn't expect it to be useful.

484
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:24,500
Will you come today?

485
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:28,380
Rest assured. I will be there.

486
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:33,290
Zhao Yuan.

487
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:34,690
You need to see the physician.

488
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,780
To Huayi House.

489
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,820
Or see the physician first?

490
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,080
- Or...
- I promised her.

491
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:38,690
I must go.

492
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:39,990
Even if you go there now,

493
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:40,820
it's still too late.

494
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,260
You won't listen to me?

495
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,330
Go to Huayi House.

496
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,050
Why make us wait so long?

497
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,410
Will it start or not?

498
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,860
Is there still a performance?

499
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:01,090
I'm also curious.

500
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,660
Could other ladies feel inferior

501
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,540
to come on stage

502
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:05,930
after seeing Miss Chen's show?

503
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:07,660
- It's possible.
- Then,

504
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,250
- let's leave.
- Let's go.

505
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,930
We'll wait for the results tomorrow.

506
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,020
Don't leave, Miss Luo will be here soon.

507
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:18,780
Let's go, let's go.

508
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,450
The performance is about to start.

509
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,100
What's happening? Where's Lingyu?

510
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,620
My Lady, I don't know.

511
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:28,290
Miss Luo might be scared.

512
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:38,060
Why did it suddenly go dark?

513
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:38,900
Lower the curtain.

514
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:45,660
What is going on here?

515
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:48,290
What's that?

516
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:49,620
Look over there.

517
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:51,100
I haven't seen it before.

518
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,380
What is this?

519
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:58,330
Father, look.

520
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,850
We are in the water.

521
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:02,100
Yes, it looks like it's in the water.

522
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:05,810
So ingenious. It glows.

523
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:07,490
Marvelous, truly marvelous.

524
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:09,180
I've never seen such a sight.

525
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,610
- Is that Miss Luo?
- It really is.

526
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:11,930
- It is.
- She's coming out.

527
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:23,050
Who is that?

528
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:24,270
He's playing the chime bells.

529
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,500
So beautiful, my lady.

530
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:36,100
Fish, it's fish!

531
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:02,020
Lower the rope.

532
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:04,740
She got it.

533
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:19,290
Incredible.

534
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,380
- Wonderful.
- Never seen this before.

535
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,410
It's like a koi
leaping over the dragon gate.

536
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:26,570
Wonderful.

537
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:28,860
Zhao Yuan.

538
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,620
Faster.

539
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:31,690
Alright.

540
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:40,620
Will you come again today?

541
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,500
(Lu Yun)

542
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:46,020

Miss Luo's entrance is truly unique.

00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,380
Indeed.

564
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:03,060
I must say,

565
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,250
Miss Luo's performance

566
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,020
has an indescribable charm.

567
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,490
The koi pattern at her eye corner

568
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:08,900
is truly lifelike.

569
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:10,100
Indeed.

570
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:11,430

like an angle.

575
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,380
She is in a league of her own.

576
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:26,250
Chime bells were once court instruments,

577
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,010
rarely seen in our dynasty.

578
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,970
Surprised to hear such elegant music today.

579
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:34,890
I'd say, you two,

580
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:35,900
the words you speak...

581
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,780
If Ningping heard it,

582
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:38,730
she would surely cry.

583
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:41,530
Father,

584
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,770
you're likely to lose

585
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,140

595
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:39,530
Wu Lang,

596
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:42,330
I wonder which lady will be the winner.

597
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,250
In my humble opinion,

598
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:46,890
Miss Chen and Miss Luo
each have their own merits.

599
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:49,490
But the princess's performance
is a rare sight.

600
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:51,490
Her performance is simple but sincere.

601
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,380
"The greatest truths are the simplest."

602
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,340
That is the case.

603
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,330
I believe she should be chosen as the best.

604
00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:00,580
But Miss Chen's performance
was the Qipan Dance

605
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,450
from Mei Qiniang, renowned in Yuezhou.

606
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:05,140
She was no less impressive
than Mei Qiniang.

607
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:07,130
It shows her exceptional dancing skills,

608
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:07,940
unmatched in grace.

609
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:10,460
But who has seen a performance
like Miss Luo's?

610
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,780
She turned light into water,

611
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,070
transformed herself into a fish.

612
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:15,490
It's so vivid and lively,

613
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:16,690
like an enchanting dream.

614
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:18,540
It's truly exquisite.

615
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:21,930
Such a dance is truly unparalleled,

616
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,210
never seen or heard before.

617
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:24,970
- Well said.
- The competition is fierce.

618
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:27,340
Who will emerge as the winner?

619
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:29,380
Who will win the title?

620
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,820
(B, B)

621
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,650
A, B, B.

622
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:37,010
A, B, B?

623
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,210
Miss Luo lost.

624
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:40,250
Such a beautiful dance...

625
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:42,220
Besides me, the other three judges are

626
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:44,100
Mr. Sun, a student of Minister Chen,

627
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,940
Mr. Qin, an imperial relative,

628
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,570
and Mr. Xu,

629
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,380
who just entered the court.

630
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,490
In short,

631
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:52,860
there are many forces behind them.

632
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,050
Do you think they will judge fairly?

633
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:58,420
Miss Luo's dance is indeed unique.

634
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:03,730
But it seems a bit flashy and gimmicky.

635
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,340
A lady

636
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:08,730
should be more dignified and proper.

637
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,660
Ladies and gentlemen, regarding this dance,

638
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:22,770
I have something to say.

639
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:28,770
I once saw a little white koi.

640
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:35,570
Third Young Master,

641
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:39,490
you have such a refined hobby
of keeping fish.

642
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,010
It swims freely,

643
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,700

challenges can't be avoided,

648
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,770
but dreams can always be pursued.

649
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,100
Who says there are only

650
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,350
two paths to take in this world?

651
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,420
If one path is blocked,

652
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:04,810
then choose another route.

653
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:06,660
If there truly is no path,

654
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,100
then create one of you own.

655
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:12,330
I can always find my own method.

656
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:18,490
I hope all ladies can thrive,

657
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:20,460
free from worldly constraints.

658
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,420
May we all be like koi,

659
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:25,620
swimming upstream,

660
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,220
and leaping over the dragon gate.

661
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,810
This Koi Dance embodies the idea

662
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:31,330
of a koi leaping over the dragon gate.

663
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:34,100
With this dance, I wish for prosperity

664
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:35,660
and peace of Nanyue.

665
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,730
- Well said.
- Bravo!

666
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:38,970

667
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:41,450
- Well said.

Bravo! Bravo!

669
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,490
Miss Luo is truly talented,

670
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:46,490
graceful and dances beautifully.

671
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,220
What now?

672
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,620
How should we judge this?

673
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:51,730
We don't know what to do either.

674
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:52,570
Indeed.

675
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,650
