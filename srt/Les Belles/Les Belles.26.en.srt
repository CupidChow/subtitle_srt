Lingyu.

27
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,860
He wants me dead.

28
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,900
He won't spare me today.

29
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,220
Xuechen!

30
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,940
To meet you and love you

31
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,060
is truly a blessing.

32
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,260
Xuechen.

33
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,620
Xuechen.

34
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:22,700
Xuechen.

35
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,140
Xuechen!

36
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,700
My Lady, you're awake.

37
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,700
How can he be missing?

38
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,310
- I'll look for him.
- Where's Xuechen?

39
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,700
Where's Xuechen?

40
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,420
Where's Xuechen?

41
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,140
Where's Xuechen?

42
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,060
There was an explosion at Mount Funiu.

43
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,300
He hasn't been found yet.

44
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,860
I will keep searching.

45
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,060
What?

46
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,420
Avalanche.

47
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,180
My Lady!

48
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,660
Please remember our agreements.

49
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,220
When we meet again,
we're like strangers.

50
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,220
Why do you say that?

51
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,420
I've just arrived.

52
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,660
How do you know my character and nature?

53
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,380
How can you judge me so readily?

54
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,220
If not for my family's property,

55
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,980
I wouldn't hurry to find a husband.

56
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,260
I was blind to choose you.

57
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,220
We're even now.

58
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,380
You do your thing,

59
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,100
and I'll do mine.

60
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,100
In dealings with others,

61
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,100
either I owe you something,

62
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,860
or you owe me a little.

63
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,260
It's not so easy to settle it.

64
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,580
Isn't that right?

65
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,260
You'd rather pray to the heavens

66
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,140
than come to find me.

67
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,380
Little fish, little fish.

68
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,540
Since you raised it,

69
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,260
why not give it a name?

70
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:16,900
I already did.

71
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,700
Little Yu.

72
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,820
I used your name "Yu".

73
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,580
If you dare to die,

74
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,300
I'll marry someone else.

75
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,060
Miss Luo.

76
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,470
Let's continue searching.

77
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,820
Miss Luo, you should head back.

78
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,380
Let go of me.

79
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,660
I will surely find Xuechen.

80
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,820
If you keep searching,
you'll risk your life.

81
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:52,980
Please go back.

82
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,300
Let me go.

83
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,380
He won't die.

84
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,260
He will survive.

85
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,860
Your Highness, perhaps...

86
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,260
There's a pouch here.

87
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,100
Here's a pouch.

88
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,820
Your Highness, I found a pouch.

89
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,500
It belongs to Xuechen.

90
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,140
It's Xuechen's pouch.

91
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,300
He must be nearby. Keep searching.

92
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,300
- Yes.

00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,380
Why not feed me instead?

138
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,060
You tried that trick yesterday.

139
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,060
My head aches too.

140
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,260
You tried that the day before.

Really? In that case,

144
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,820
you should rest here.

Can't I drink it myself?

148
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,980
Truly heartbreaking.

149
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,300
You said "May our love stand like mountains",

150
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,500
yet won't even feed me meds.

151
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,660
How dare you speak such words.

152
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,180
You clearly saw the note,

153
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,380
yet said nothing.

154
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,580
Stop pretending to be weak for sympathy.

155
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,260
Your little tricks,

156
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,500
I know them all too well.

157
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,620
Yes, I am overstepping,

158
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,380
but if I didn't see the note in the pouch,

159
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,500
what would you do?

160
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,980
Who said I cared?

161
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,180
If you hadn't seen it,

162
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,180
that's not your luck.

163
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,020
Someone destined will see it.

164
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,140
With a charming gentleman like me,

165
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,260
what more do you need?

166
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,420
You don't need it.

167
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,180
Alright, alright.

168
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:46,940
It's time to leave.

169
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,580
We should leave now.

170
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,140
Let's go.

171
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,500
Move.

172
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,900
(Jingyang)

173
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,820
She's still so strong.

174
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,580
Jingyang tea set,

175
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,060
Shuozhou jade stone,

176
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,460
and Wuzhou inks

177
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,460
are the best from cities
in the Northern Border.

178
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,820
I found them all for you.

179
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,620
Your Highness, it is too much.

180
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:23,260
Not at all. The carriage isn't full yet.

181
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,860
There are also some clothes

182
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:25,820
and jewelry.

183
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,620
We can't take so many things back.

184
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,980
Besides, why would I need so much jewelry?

185
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,500
Who said I'm giving them to you?

186
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,500
I'm giving them to Miss Luo.

187
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,500
Here he goes again.

188
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,140
This guy never gives up.

189
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,380
I'm afraid I'll miss your wedding.

190
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,180
So I'm giving my gift in advance.

191
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,500
That's more like it, right, Lingyu?

192
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,820
What wedding are you referring to?

193
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:53,580
Your Highness, why are you
thinking so far ahead?

194
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,140
Aren't you coming back to Yuezhou with us?

195
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,340
I still have some military matters.

196
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,740
I'll return a few days later.

197
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,380
If you wish,

198
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,420
we can wait a few more days for you.

199
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:06,060
No need. The longer you stay,

200
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,260
the more letters I'll receive
from the Lu Clan.

201
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,700
You should hurry back to report safety.

202
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:11,820
Alright.

203
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,340
See you in Yuezhou.

204
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:15,580
Let's go.

205
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:27,940
Safe travels.

206
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,620
Everyone, take care.

207
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,620
- Advisor Lu, take care.
- Take care.

208
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,060
We're leaving, Ajiao.

209
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,060
Didn't I say in the army...

210
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,140
- Take care!
- Take care.

211
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,140
(Jingyang)

212
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,580
(One month later)

213
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,140
(Lu Mansion)

214
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:59,980
(Time Slips Away)

215
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,540
Yun and Lingyu

216
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,500
have been back for a while.

217
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,180
Yet their marriage is undecided.

218
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,860
This time, we must seize the chance

219
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,580
to finalize the marriage.

220
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:15,700
Alright.

221
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,580
Let's touch their hearts.

222
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,500
Enlighten their minds.

223
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,700
At worst,

224
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,800
rely on age to assert authority.

225
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,940
They are full of ideas.

226
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,900
It's not easy to persuade them.

227
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,940
So we use their own methods

228
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,900
against them.

229
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,620
Lingyu's approach

230
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:48,260
is actually quite effective.

231
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,700
I can help too.

232
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,140
Alright, alright.

233
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:05,260
Mother, is that appropriate?

234
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,940
As long as it works.

235
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,820
Speak less, don't slip up.

236
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:16,820
Come on.

237
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,740
(Why does everything feel odd?)

238
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,620
(Did you cause trouble again?)

239
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,300
(I've behaved well.)

240
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,900
(Maybe it's you causing issues.)

241
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,380
You've both been back for a while.

242
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,820
Now everything is going well.

243
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:08,620
What are your plans next?

244
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:13,780
Grandmother,

245
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,940
what plans do we have next?

246
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:20,700
I'm asking about your marriage plans.

247
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,500
We're not in a rush for that.

248
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,080
- Madam Lu.
- Grandmother.

249
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,700
- Mother.
- Are you okay, Grandmother?

250
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,500
Mother.

251
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:40,820
It's okay.

252
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,140
I don't know

253
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,940
what's wrong lately.

254
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,460
I just feel this chest tightness.

255
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,260
Chest tightness.

256
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,940
Headache. My head.

257
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,620
- Anyway.
- (It's a ruse of self-injury.)

258
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,260
I feel terrible all over.

259
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:00,820
Mother.

260
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:01,900
Madam Lu.

261
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,060
You must be overwhelmed
by your beloved

262
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:04,980
dragon saliva incense.

263
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,060
Too much of anything

264
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,140
is not good.

265
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,740
Don't let it affect your health.

266
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,140
- Let me dispose of it.
- Wait.

267
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,980
I'm feeling much better now.

268
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,380
No need to trouble yourself.

269
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,620
These two days

270
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,700
are auspicious days.

271
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:37,100
If you can marry during these days,

272
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:40,940
it will surely lead to a life of prosperity.

273
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,100
Sister.

274
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,980
- A good day.
- A good day.

275
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,380
It's a good day.

276
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,980
(Creating something from nothing.)

277
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,140
That's wonderful.

278
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,500
Is there really such an auspicious day?

279
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,460
As a younger brother,

280
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,780
I must invite all the ladies in Yuezhou

281
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,820
to gather together

282
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,500
and have a chat with you,

283
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,060
so that you can find someone you like.

284
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,220
No need for that.

285
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,700
(Don't worry, I'm here.)

286
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,940
I'll get straight to the point.

287
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,860
Since you delay your marriage,

288
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:31,340
it shows your feelings aren't deep.

289
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:32,980
If that's the case,

290
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:35,650
perhaps it's best to part ways quickly.

291
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,220
May you each find peace.

292
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,580
Sister.

293
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,980
(Provocation tactic.)

294
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,620
(It's your turn.)

295
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,260
It's because the bond is deep

296
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,660
that we must consider carefully,

297
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,740
and plan thoughtfully.

298
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,260
How can we decide in haste?

299
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,460
Miss Luo speaks wisely.

300
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,980
This is also our humble wish as elders.

301
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,260
Don't pressure the kids.

302
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,260
It's just that

303
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:19,340
I won't see my dear nephew marry,

304
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:25,260
nor see the Lu Mansion decorated.

305
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,220
And Mother.

306
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:34,100
She won't have a great-grandchild.

307
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,340
(Feigning retreat to lure the enemy.)

308
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:45,980
Aunt.

309
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,540
Your handkerchief

310
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,980
needs more pepper to shed tears.

311
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,940
So that's how it is.

312
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,820
We understand your intentions.

313
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,260
But this matter can't be rushed.

314
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,820
It needs careful consideration.

315
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:15,860
Indeed, careful planning shows sincerity.

316
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,660
Grandmother, Uncle, Aunt,

317
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,860
Aunt Ying, Brother,

318
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,380
please rest early.

319
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,740
We'll take our leave now.

320
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:30,700
This...

321
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,460
Grandmother.

322
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,380
Mother.

323
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,540
- Grandmother.
- Mother.

324
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,860
You, you...

325
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,460
Mother, I said this wouldn't work.

326
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,340
You must have acted poorly.

327
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,220
They saw through it.

328
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,700
Exactly.

329
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,660
If they like to fuss over their lives,

330
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,380
let them fuss all they want.

331
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,580
These flowers are perfect for dew.

332
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,980
(I wonder what she thinks
about the marriage.)

333
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:18,020
(I've almost decided
on my wedding attire.)

334
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,980
(Will he propose or not?)

335
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,100
Lingyu,

336
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,940
I have something to ask you.

337
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:33,900
Go ahead.

338
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,260
I heard from Lingxi

339
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,340
you tried on wedding dresses
in West Market.

340
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,860
I just wanted to ask

341
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,100
if you decide on it yet.

342
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,140
Some ready-made clothing stores

343
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,980
want to use my fame as the Flower Goddess

344
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,860
to attract business. That's all.

345
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,260
I heard from Jinchuan,

346
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,780
that you asked Second Young Master
to calculate

347
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,220
all the auspicious dates for this year.

348
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,740
Are they choosing a good day for something?

349
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,980
Grandmother is eager to travel with Aunt.

350
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,420
I should quickly pick an auspicious day.

351
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,620
To plan ahead.

352
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:19,860
Alright.

353
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:24,460
(Lingxi, just you wait.)

354
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:27,740
(Jinchuan, seems like
you don't want your wage.)

355
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,320
Aren't you constantly thinking of me

356
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,380
and loving me passionately?

357
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,580
Why are you so calm about marriage?

358
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,660
Which gentleman has never forgotten me

359
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,540
from the first moment we met.

360
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:42,340
Who would follow me through thick and thin?

361
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:45,060
Yet there's no action taken.

362
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:48,620
It seems like mere words.

363
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:53,900
Wait.

364
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,580
Are you feeling anxious?

365
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,620
If you're not anxious,

366
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,580
then I'm definitely not worried.

367
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,740
Waiting won't bring a happy ending.

368
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:28,580
Only by taking action can one succeed.

369
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,220
Are you going to take action?

370
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,500
Proposal?

371
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,860
Are you going to propose?

372
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,020
Haven't you proposed?

373
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,700
You want us to help you propose?

374
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,940
We're all like brothers.

375
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,140
Let me say a few words first.

376
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,260
For couples, it's easy to share joys,

377
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,220
but hard to endure hardships together.

378
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,140
We must succeed on the first try.

379
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,940
No room for any mistakes.

380
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,420
You all know this well.

381
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,460
The Lu Clan

382
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,100
has deep pockets.

383
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:58,060
I plan to buy her valuable gifts

384
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,980
to make her cry with joy.

385
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,140
- Then perhaps...
- Yes.

386
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,140
I previously gifted Miss Luo a jade hairpin,

387
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,500
which she adored.

388
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,860
How about a place full of memories

389
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,980
to reminisce and express your feelings?

390
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:16,900
Good idea.

391
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,140
At the Zhongshan Banquet,

392
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,940
her Fiery Dance

393
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:23,340
truly reminded me of battles
at the Northern Border.

394
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:24,820
I must say,

395
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,160
under the moonlit sky,

396
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,620
send her a shower of cherry blossoms.

397
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,620
Yes, back then didn't I also...

398
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,980
Back then, back then, back then.

399
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,060
Is that all you got?

400
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,660
Indeed, you spared no effort.

401
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,860
You've tried every method.

402
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,660
When I take Miss Luo out,

403
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,980
I ensure everything's in place.

404
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,860
Everything is the finest.

405
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,100
You can speak now.

406
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,500
What should we do?

407
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,100
On an enchanting night.

408
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,380
You two stroll the streets.

409
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,980
With pedals fluttering down.

410
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,020
Got it.

411
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:11,900
If I could
hold an umbrella for him in the rain,

412
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:15,460
he would surely agree to my proposal.

413
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,580
But this summer has been dry.

414
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,460
How do you know when it will rain?

415
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,100
I... I might be able to help.

416
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,220
What? Can the Imperial Family

417
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,620
even control the rain now?

418
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,580
No, no.

419
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:35,140
I don't know any mystical arts.

420
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,980
But this is still

421
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,620
within our capabilities.

422
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,100
That's wonderful.

423
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,500
Come on.

424
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,060
We'll rely on you for the rain.

425
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,140
However,

426
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,980
there's one thing to remember.

427
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:55,260
Never share intel with friends.

428
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:58,740
Especially you.

429
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,740
Yes, you.

430
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,940
Especially you.

431
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,180
Me?

432
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,340
You, you, you.

433
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,380
It's you.

434
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,260
Alright.

435
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:20,340
What's your drinking capacity?

436
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,100
Get up and drink!

437
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,100
You finally arrived.

438
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,340
How much did you drink?

439
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,620
You're unconscious.

440
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,740
I'll take care of the princess.

441
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,100
What? Is this Tang?

442
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,620
As for these two,

443
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,580
you decide what to do.

444
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:56,900
Slow down, slow down.

445
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,220
We're leaving.

446
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:01,740
Yangling,

447
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,100
how much have you drunk?

448
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,140
Be careful.

449
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,380
Give it to me.

450
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:10,220
- Aman.
- Alright, alright.

451
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,060
- Why drink so much?
- Drink it.

452
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,380
- Give it to me.
- Drink.

453
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,740
Hiding things quietly from me.

454
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,660
You drink too.

455
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,260
Surely nothing good is planned.

456
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,620
Alright, I'll drink.

457
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,260
No sleeping.

458
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,700
Butterfly.

459
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,500
Butterfly.

460
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,380
What butterfly?

461
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,220
No butterflies here.

462
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,380
Where are the butterflies?

463
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:38,730
Butterflies...

464
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,820
There are no butterflies.

465
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,340
Lingyu.

466
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:46,740
Butterflies.

467
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,740
Where are the butterflies?

468
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:55,380
I caught a huge butterfly.

469
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,060
Chasing butterflies made you drunk.

470
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,580
You... you're not a butterfly.

471
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,220
You're a fox spirit.

472
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:13,140
Fox spirit, are you here to take me home?

473
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,740
I'll give you another chance.

474
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,200
What should you call me?

475
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,220
Xuechen.

476
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,140
Be careful.

477
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,380
She's drunk. I'll take her back.

478
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:29,860
Alright.

479
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:32,700
Make the most of it.

480
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,460
What... should I make the most of?

481
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:36,740
Nonsense.

482
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,060
Aman,

483
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,340
you look really nice.

484
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,500
Yangling,

485
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,460
you usually don't like drinking.

486
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,220
Why drink so much today?

487
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:02,340
I'm going to...

488
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,460
What?

489
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,580
Pick chives.

490
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,340
Pick what?

491
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:07,980
Yangling.

492
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,460
- Chives.
- Yangling.

493
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:10,980
Slow down, Yangling.

494
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:11,820
Chives.

495
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:12,720
Yangling.

496
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:13,980
Chives.

497
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:16,020
You... you... don't.

498
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:16,860
Yangling.

499
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,260
You've always liked gardening.

500
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,100
And these chives...

501
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:22,620
It's the chives we planted together.

502
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,020
They are still growing.

503
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,280
It'd be a pity to pull them out.

504
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,980
You're right.

505
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:34,220
Even though you haven't proposed yet,

506
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:35,700
but...

507
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,740
I will still protect

508
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,980
our little courtyard

509
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,980
and our little chives.

510
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:45,180
You all are great, little chives.

511
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,310
Yangling, wasn't our marriage

512
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:47,220
granted by Father?

513
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,100
Do I need to ask you again?

514
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:54,620
Are you treating me as a duty,

515
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,780
or as an arrangement?

516
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,620
Neither.

517
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,220
I truly admire you.

518
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,540
For the rest of my life, I love you alone.

519
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,760
I'll protect and honor you.

520
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,220
We'll share joys together.

521
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:07,260
In arguments, it's always my fault.

522
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,180
Whether matters are big or small,

523
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,220

00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,580
We've been through so much,

546
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,740
yet you still won't say it.

547
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,460
Why is that?

548
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,580
Are you made of wood?

549
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,260
Why don't you speak?

550
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,220
Why won't you say anything?

551
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:44,820
Why aren't you

552
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:45,820
saying anything?

553
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,220
Speak up! Speak up!

554
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,580
Don't remain silent.

555
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,860
You'll be waiting for centuries

556
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,540
until this pillar gains wisdom.

557
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,740
Then it'll surely answer you.

(Why isn't he taking the bait?)

561
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:04,860
Come here.

562
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:09,220
Instead of asking Mr. Pillar,

563
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,340
why not

564
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,620
ask me directly?

565
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,220
(If I could ask you directly,)

566
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,060
(why would I pretend to be drunk?)

567
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:17,260
(I have my pride too.)

568
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,460
Go on, tell me.

569
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,220
My family wants him to marry in.

570
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:28,580
Isn't that too much for him?

571
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:32,100
Who is this person you're talking about?

572
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,620
Who else could it be?

573
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,020
It's him, of course.

574
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,380
Really?

575
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,980
Do you think if I propose to him,

576
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,260
he will agree?

577
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,060
I believe

578
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,260
if it's you asking,

579
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,620
he will definitely agree.

580
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,580
Let's go, time to sleep.

581
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:05,220
I need to ask Mr. Pillar 300 questions.

582
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,980
Go back to sleep.

583
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:26,740
(Lu Mansion)

584
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:31,380
(Time Slips Away)

585
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,300
(Xuewu Courtyard)

586
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,860
I'll prepare the bamboo tubes and water.

587
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,100
Let's make it rain.

588
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:44,540
I've prepared everything we need.

589
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:46,220
(Qing Courtyard)
I've read your fortune.

590
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:48,380
Tonight, it will definitely work.

591
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:50,340
Make sure nothing goes wrong.

592
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:54,260
(Lu Mansion)

593
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:59,260
Sir, come release the lantern.

594
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,100
Let me do it.

595
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,100
- It's beautiful.
- Done.

596
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,260
Why bring an umbrella out?

597
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:10,100
To be ready for unexpected weather.

598
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:13,660
(Today, I shall win your heart.)

599
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:18,260
(Today, under the romantic Kongming lantern,)

600
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,420
(I will propose to Lingyu.)

601
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,740
Look over there, it seems different.

602
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:24,980
Let's go have a look.

603
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:27,900
Sure, I haven't strolled around yet.

604
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,900
(I wonder how Yangling and the others)

605
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:35,660
(are preparing for the event.)

606
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,580
(Hope nothing goes wrong)

607
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,340
(when we release the lanterns later.)

608
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,160
Tang and I

609
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,980
worked overnight
to set up the bamboo tubes.

610
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,100
Once we fill them with water,

611
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,980
the water will flow through the tubes.

612
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,420
It feels just like rain.

613
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:48,980
I brought my flute.

614
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,500
In the melodious flute sound,

615
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,580
amidst the gentle drizzle,

616
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:52,660
there's a unique charm.

617
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,500
Who dismantled our bamboo tubes?

618
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,540
No worries this time.

619
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,340
The bamboo won't harm
our Kongming Lantern.

620
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,810
Qian Hexagram represents the sky.

621
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:10,460
It must mean a blessing will come today.

622
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,380
When the Kongming Lanterns rise,

623
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,540
we'll hear good news
from Yun and Miss Luo.

624
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,100
That would be wonderful.

625
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,580
Hurry, they're coming.

626
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:19,940
You handle it.

627
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,140
- There are fewer people. Let's go.
- Okay.

628
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,500
Let's make another wish.

629
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:28,500
The evening breeze is so refreshing today.

630
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:29,980
Yes, it is.

631
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,820
It's muggy.

632
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,180
They're coming.

633
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,820
Hurry, hurry, lights on!

634
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,340
Quickly, it's time!

635
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,180
Light it up!

636
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:45,980
(We're in position.)

637
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,700
(Why hasn't it rained yet?)

638
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,660
Can we redo it in time?

639
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:52,820
Is there still time?

640
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:53,660
This...

641
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,380
(Forget it. I'll do it anyway.)

642
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,470
(Just speak directly.)

643
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,380
Xuechen,

644
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,500
I have something to tell you.

645
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:02,580
Wait, don't speak yet.

646
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:03,980
Lingyu,

647
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,340
I have a surprise for you.

648
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,660
Oh no, it's on fire!

649
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,260
Wait a moment.

650
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:18,140
They are here.

651
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,060
Let's just splash it.

652
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:23,660
My lantern!

653
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,860
Hurry, light another one!

654
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:28,220
We should splash it like rain.

655
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,310
Bring another one over.

656
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,460
Who's splashing water up there?

657
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,740
- Why is it you?
- Why is it you?

658
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,940
So you dismantled the bamboo tubes.

659
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,340
Why would you dismantle them?

660
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:55,940
Bamboo tubes...

661
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,260
Lu Xian mentioned

662
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,940
the bamboo tubes disrupt Feng Shui.

663
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,220
Yes, that's right.

664
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,280
It blocks one's romantic encounters.

665
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,180
Romantic encounters?

666
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,740
Didn't you drench our Kongming Lanterns?

667
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,940
Why splash water on the street?

668
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,460
It is... of course,

669
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:21,100
to avoid the harsh sunlight.

670
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,740
The flowers are all wilted.

671
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:27,500
There are no flowers on the stone slabs.

672
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:30,180
Tang, this is just too absurd.

673
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,340
Who pours water
and sets up tubes at night?

674
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,580
And those Kongming Lanterns,

675
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:34,860
what are they even for?

676
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:37,380
We...

677
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,660
You don't need to be so secretive.

678
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,340
It's just about proposing marriage.

679
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,100
Why make it so complicated?

680
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,700
Marriage proposal?

681
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:47,940
Marriage proposal?

682
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,820
You're also going to propose.

683
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,340
Indeed,

684
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:56,820
as long as the two of us

685
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,380
plan something at the same time,

686
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,060
it will inevitably be ruined.

687
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:01,860
In Shuozhou, it was like this,

688
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,340
and today is no different.

689
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,380
So, what does it matter?
