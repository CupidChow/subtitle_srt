00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:42,510
(Lu Mansion)
Sister, this is such a mess.

24
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,080
This is only a little setback.

25
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,400
We mustn't lose our spirit.

26
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,590
Though we left in a hurry,

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,220
we have to follow the protocol.

28
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,400
Lingxi, present the visiting letter.

29
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,380
(Lu Mansion)

30
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,830
In the card game today,

31
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,670
I must clean

32
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:11,870
the ladies out.

33
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,910
Ma'am, this hairpin is lovely.

34
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,360
Isn't it?

35
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,080
It's the latest design.

36
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,190
Lady Ying. The gatekeeper reports

37
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,520
that your nieces from the Luo Clan
in Shuozhou

38
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,440
are here to visit.

39
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,110
Could it be Lingyu and Hua?

40
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,910
Why are they visiting now?

41
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,600
I've already made plans.

42
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,080
But they have

43
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,520
been waiting outside for a while.

44
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,230
Never mind.

45
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,830
I can go play cards some other time.

46
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,550
But relatives don't visit often.

47
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,720
Show them in.

48
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,440
Yes.

49
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,550
Sir, you came back from Shuozhou

50
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,630
soaking wet

51
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:11,910
and covered in injuries.

52
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:13,550
Fortunately,

53
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,670
your wounds were treated in time.

54
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,160
Rescuing him was kind enough.

55
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,440
If he dies,

56
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,000
it must be his fate.

57
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,830
Yeah.

58
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,110
I was lucky to meet a kind person.

59
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,520
That's a life-saving grace.

60
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,960
Sir, do you know

61
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,800
that person's name?

62
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,200
No.

63
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,550
That's kindness without expecting return.

64
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,440
How kind. We mustn't be ungrateful.

65
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,110
Sir, do you remember the face?

66
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,830
I'd recognize that person

67
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,960
no matter what.

68
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,750
Sister, might they not let us in?

69
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,590
Let's wait longer.

70
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,600
Miss Luo, please come in.

71
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:20,630
Let's go.

72
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,040
Watch your step.

73
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,600
Such a big courtyard.

74
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,270
Look at that tree.

75
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,720
- So big.
- Lady Ying was going to play cards

76
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,440
- when you came, Miss Luo.
- So tall.

77
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,640
- And she
- Look.

78
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,180
cancelled the game right away

79
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,270
- just for you.
- So big.

80
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,510
- Aunt Ying always favors me.
- Such a huge courtyard.

81
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:45,000
I also miss her a lot.

82
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,830
(Play cards?)

83
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,440
(Seems Aunt Ying)

84
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,640
(still loves to have fun.)

85
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,040
So many maids.

86
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,720
Lady Ying,

87
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:03,670
they are here.

88
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,140
(Lu Ying)

89
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,920
Aunt Ying, I miss you so much.

90
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,720
I miss you dearly.

91
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,200
It's been so long.

92
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,600
Hua, you...

93
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,950
Aunt Ying.

94
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,070
I finally see you, Aunt Ying.

95
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:44,950
Aunt Ying,

96
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,390
years have passed,

97
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,350
but you haven't changed a bit.

98
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,550
Just like when you rode,

99
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,350
holding me in your arms.

100
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,760
Yeah.

101
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,070
Good girl.

102
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm impressed you remembered that.

103
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,070
Lingyu,

104
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:07,790
Hua.

105
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,790
Quick, help them with their parcels.

106
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,550
- Yes.
- Don't cry.

107
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,480
Come. Let's catch up.

108
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:20,630
My Lady.

109
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:23,790
I know you like Liufangzhai's pastries.

110
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,640
Every time Uncle returned from patrol,

111
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,760
he queued to buy it for you.

112
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,160
I always got some back then.

113
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,560
Uh...

114
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,560
It's...

115
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,600
The pastries.

116
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,640
Pastries.

117
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,550
It's for Aunt Ying.

118
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:56,110
She used to like it.

119
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,600
But we're traveling by water.

120
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,760
It might be moldy when we get Yuezhou.

121
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,440
Better let Aunt Ying's little niece

122
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,790
have it for her.

123
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,330
Aunt Ying's been with the Lus for years.

124
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,760
She doesn't lack these pastries.

125
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:14,160
What we bring is sincerity.

126
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,790
Sincerity.

127
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,110
I thought

128
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,830
you've been in Yuezhou for years.

129
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:25,670
- You must miss Shuozhou's flavors.
- Yes.

130
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:29,670
Didn't expect to mess up even this.

131
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,720
Just a box of pastries. No big deal.

132
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,550
I'm satisfied

133
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:36,950
that you care.

134
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,550
Please don't cry.

135
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:42,350
You are a Luo.

136
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,790
The Luos never cry.

137
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,790
Since both of you are here,

138
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,200
why not stay a few more days?

139
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:54,790
Tonight, the Lus are having a banquet.

140
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,070
You should join me

141
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:00,160
and pay respects to Madam Lu.

142
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:03,950
Aunt, as you wish.

143
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:05,630
Good girl.

144
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,350
Almost there. Cross the bridge head up

145
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,640
and pass the courtyard,

146
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,070
it's Madam Lu's place.

147
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,760
Understood, Aunt.

148
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,720
Sister,

149
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,070
why didn't you tell Aunt Ying the truth?

150
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,510
Our sudden visit

151
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,880
makes us look like mooching poor relatives.

152
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,600
Aunt Ying always lives carefree

153
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,510
without any worries.

154
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:34,230
If we reveal the elopement,

155
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,320
I'm afraid Aunt won't take us in.

156
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,200
If that's the case,

157
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,590
staying here is a short-term solution.

158
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,520
Since she's let us stay,

159
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:44,760
just stay.

160
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:46,840
I'll soon find a matrilocal husband

161
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,880
to get the family property.

162
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,350
Then, we'll fear nothing.

163
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:55,030
Sir, have some pastries.

164
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,240
Jinchuan.

165
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,520
Anything happened while I was away?

166
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,800
Of course.

167
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,000
Miss Chen sent Qinghua cake 13 times.

168
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,520
Miss Liu sent her visiting letter 5 times.

169
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:05,910
Miss Jiang's kite

170
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,350
landed in our yard thrice.

171
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,550
Oh, right.

172
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,910
Madam Lu is hosting banquet today,

173
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:12,710
saying all the girls and boys must attend.

174
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,080
Nothing important.

175
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,200
Just make an excuse for me.

176
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:17,960
You were absent the past few days,

177
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,230
and I made excuses for you.

178
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,200
The First Madam scolded me quite a bit.

179
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,230
Perhaps you should go this time.

180
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,840
I really can't handle it anymore.

181
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,390
By the way,

182
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,760
I heard a new lady arrived today.

183
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,150
It'd be a real surprise

184
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,000
if one didn't someday.

185
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,680
She's different.

186
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,590
I heard she's a relative of your uncle.

187
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,600
From Shuozhou.

188
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:44,520
From Shuozhou?

189
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,280
It can't be.

190
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,360
Aunt.

191
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,760
What is Madam Lu like?

192
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,590
Are there other ladies attending?

193
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,230
I'm new here,

194
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,110
trying to figure out.

195
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,320
I'm afraid of mistaking someone

196
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:04,710
and causing a joke.

197
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,080
- It would embarrass you.
- Lingxi, look.

198
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,910
No need to be nervous.

199
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,150
The Lu Clan has many young men

200
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,320
and a few women.

201
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:16,350
So, Madam Lu cherishes the girls dearly.

202
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,030
Many young men

203
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,150
and a few women?

204
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,550
Indeed. The first branch has two sons
and a daughter.

205
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:26,960
The eldest daughter Lu Tan married
into the Xies years ago,

206
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,400
and rarely visits.

207
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,030
The second son is Lu Xian.

208
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,550
Xian is gentle, kind,

209
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,030
and knowledgeable.

210
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,080
He's easy-going.

211
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,710
- (That'd be a fine match.)
- There are fish over there.

212
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,200
(But asking him to marry into my family)

213
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,790
(might be challenging.)

214
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,760
The fourth son is Lu Chang.

215
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,230
He's still quite young

216
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,640
and mischievous.

217
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,350
Very adorable.

218
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,020
Then there's the second branch.

219
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:55,430
- This courtyard is big.
- Second Brother and his wife passed early,

220
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,770
leaving behind the Third Young Master,
Lu Yun.

221
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,110
Yun has

222
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,030
an unrestrained personality,

223
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,670
yet is blessed with good looks,

224
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,150
which charms the girls of Yuezhou.

225
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,160
Really?

226
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,000
(Without parents,)

227
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,200
(so he gets to decide.)

228
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,790
(To have him marry in,)

229
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,880
(all we need is his agreement.)

230
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:17,550
(A playboy or not,)

231
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,840
(it's not my concern.)

232
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,000
(For the inheritance.)

233
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,920
(Love is irrelevant.)

234
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,910
Those flowers are beautiful.

235
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,840
Truly beautiful.

236
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:26,840
Let's go.

237
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,850
Sir, if you don't go tonight

238
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
get caught by My Lord.

239
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,840
He could make you

240
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,350
recite the code of conduct again.

241
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,790
Not again.

242
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,550
When I was not around,

243
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,760
what excuses did you use?

244
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,880
Just the usual.

245
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,880
Some playboy things,

246
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,350
like chasing after pleasures,

247
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,640
dancing, and feasting.

248
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,960
You're right.

249
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,790
I've been away so long.

250
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,670
I should go home and see

251
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,350
the newcoming relative.

252
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,520
The flowers are blooming so beautifully.

253
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,880
Look how vibrant that one is.

254
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,920
Indeed.

255
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:03,990
Mother.

256
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,380
Sister-in-law.

257
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,960
(Graceful and Virtuous)

258
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,880
Greetings, Mother.

259
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,040
Sister-in-law.

260
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,590
Lingyu, Hua, greet the lady.

261
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,640
Lingyu greets you, Madam.

262
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,440
(Madam Lu, First Madam)
I wish all the best.

263
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,960
Yunhua greets you, Madam.

264
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,770
I wish you blessings.

265
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,910
So well-mannered.

266
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,150
As you were.

267
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,670
Ying, help Lingyu get acquainted.

268
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,000
This is the First Madam of the Lu Clan.

269
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,200
My elder sister-in-law.

270
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,200
Greetings, Madam.

271
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,640
Greetings, Madam.

272
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,480
As you were.

273
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,040
Grandmother,

274
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,520
I heard there are steamed goose feet.

275
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,110
Am I late?

276
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,590
(The ancients were right.)

277
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:02,110
(Yuezhou truly is vast.)

278
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,240
Greetings, Grandmother.

279
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:18,110
Greetings, aunts.

280
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:22,230
Sister, he's so handsome.

281
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,550
You rascal,

282
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,710
finally decided to come home.

283
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,600
Grandmother is at home.

284
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,030
I never wanted to leave.

285
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:33,910
When I heard you were hosting,

286
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,400
I rushed over immediately.

287
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,880
Thought I'd be the first.

288
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,040
Oh, you,

289
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,900
(Etiquette Hall)

290
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:45,910
Hold it steady.

291
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,710
Ladies,

292
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,840
you're all from noble families

293
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,110
in Yuezhou.

294
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,590
Since you've been sent here for training,

295
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,840
your families have high hopes for you

296
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:05,320
to marry into the Lu Clan.

297
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,150
(Chen Xiu)
To become a Lu bride,

298
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,590
you must focus on your demeanor,

299
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,710
so you won't lose dignity in the future.

300
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,230
I'll inherit the Han's one day.

301
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,440
I came here to connect with the influential,

302
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,350
not being a Lu bride.

303
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,910
Who is always in the garden,

304
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,150
hoping to bump into Lu Yun?

305
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:31,760
Why are you here?

306
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,110
I'm a concubine-born daughter.

307
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:35,790
If I could marry into the Lus,

308
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,470
Father would surely be pleased.

309
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,480
What about you?

310
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,280
I've trained so many young ladies

311
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,790
from noble families over the years.

312
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,080
Even quite a few

313
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:53,150
imperial consorts in the palace

314
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,710
were personally trained by me.

315
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,960
Yet only Miss Chen

316
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,350
excels in every aspect.

317
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,670
I hope you all practice

318
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,550
the etiquette taught today more.

319
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,930
It will be inspected tomorrow.

320
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,200
Yes.

321
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:20,910
She finally left.

322
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:21,750
So exhausted.

323
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:22,990
My Lady.

324
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,380
(Lau Tang)
Have a seat.

325
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:30,080
Miss Chen, such rigorous practice,

326
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,520
yet you remain composed.

327
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:32,640
This is a lady's grace.

328
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,840
Not too harsh.

329
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:37,320
Miss Chen truly is the finest
in southern Yuezhou.

330
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,880
Why can't I do the same?

331
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,040
My Lady.

332
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:43,670
I just saw Lu Yun

333
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:44,760
heading to the banquet hall.

334
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,470
I suppose he is attending the banquet today.

335
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:47,750
Really?

336
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,840
Miss Chen,

337
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,520
it's been days since we last saw him.

338
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,400
Let's go see him. Come on.

339
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,840
Lu Yun? I'm going too.

340
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,150
Shall we go?

341
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:55,990
Let's go.

342
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,030
Come on. Let's go too.

343
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,440
Must we see him?

344
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,480
Yun,

345
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:11,350
this is Miss Luo who just came.

346
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,550
(Why is he looking at me like that?)

347
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,470
(It's really her.)

348
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,960
(Fate brought us together again.)

349
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,550
May I know your name?

350
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,520
If we meet again,

351
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,550
I will surely repay you.

352
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,230
No need. I didn't do it for reward.

353
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:35,030
Just remember our agreement.

354
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,910
We meet as strangers in the future.

355
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,640
(Pretending to be obedient now?)

356
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,200
(Let's see how long you can pretend.)

357
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,400
Are you Lu's Third Young Master?

358
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,040
Guess.

359
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,590
I'm new here

360
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,200
and have no clue.

361
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,200
Please speak frankly, sir.

362
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:05,040
Lu Yun, stop joking.

363
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,560
Be careful not to scare Miss Luo.

364
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:10,160
Lingyu, this is the Third Young Master.

365
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,360
Given name is Yun.

366
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,070
The Lus have many sons,

367
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,250
and it's a bit confusing.

368
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,800
You can just call him Third Young Master.

369
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:20,190
Third Young Master.

370
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:21,310
Brother Yun.

371
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,280
Third Young Master?

372
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,350
Don't you remember me?

373
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:30,550
I...

374
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,360
- You're stepping on me.
- Don't push.

375
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:40,950
(This is what Aunt mentioned,
a few women?)

376
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,240
Get up.

377
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,680
Come on. Get up.

378
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:48,160
The girls are here.

379
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,800
Come on in.

380
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,070
Let's go.

381
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,540
(Serenity)

382
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:10,070
Greetings, ladies.

383
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:13,350
Please rise.

384
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,520
Xiu, come.

385
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,640
Lingyu, come here.

386
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:28,000
This is Miss Luo, the new girl.

387
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,470
Another girl?

388
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:31,430
Never heard of her.

389
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,520
Another one coming?

390
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,190
Originally, we haven't

391
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,950
had young ladies around.

392
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,800
But seeing as the boys have

393
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,430
all reached marriageable age

394
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,070
and are still single,

395
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,070
I invited

396
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:46,280
these ladies here

397
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,350
for etiquette training.

398
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,110
Don't be shy.

399
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,160
Just consider them your sisters.

400
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:56,550
Yes.

401
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,590
The boys will be late from school.

402
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,640
Sorry for kept you waiting.

403
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,590
I'm feeling quite tired.

404
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,280
Let's head to the banquet hall and eat first.

405
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,590
- Yes.
- Come on.

406
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,400
Mother, cheers.

407
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,020
(Quietude Reflects True Aspiration)

408
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,640
Lady Ying.

409
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,520
Sister, try this.

410
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,040
Lingxi, I saved one for you.

411
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:45,350
- Thank you.
- Hua, have some more.

412
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,310
Thank you, Sister.

413
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,110
Why does he keep looking at her?

414
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,560
Yeah.

415
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:09,980
Qing.

416
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,130
In an incense stick of time.

417
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,070
Go find out

418
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,400
all the details about Miss Luo.

419
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,760
Yes.

420
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,360
Lingxi.

421
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,280
Hello, ma'am.

422
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,470
You don't want the goose feet?

423
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,110
You can have them.

424
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,040
But if I eat them,

425
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,310
there'll be none left for you.

426
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,430
It's fine.

427
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,000
I can't taste it. Go ahead.

428
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,310
Thank you, ma'am.

429
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,470
- Hua.
- That girl.

430
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,680
What are you doing?

431
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,560
- Is it not okay?
- Hua, stop running around.

432
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:43,950
I'm sorry, Sister.

433
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,470
Look at that girl. No manners at all.

434
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,590
She seems so sheltered.

435
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,310
Miss Liu, Miss Han,

436
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,240
watch your words.

437
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,270
Miss Luo,

438
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,460
on behalf of the Lu Clan, I toast to you

439
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,520
to express our welcome.

440
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:06,880
What this?

441
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:15,350
- Thank you, sir.
- Why is he toasting her?

442
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:26,470
Miss Luo, I feel like I've seen you before.

443
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,280
We have never met.

444
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:31,550
Is that so?

445
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:35,110
But why do you look familiar?

446
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:37,230
(Lu Yun)

447
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,710
(stands out for sure.)

448
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,280
(But his way of talking to girls)

449
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:43,920
(is a bit too cliche.)

450
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:47,590
We've definitely never met.

451
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:49,400
You're quite handsome.

452
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,800
If I had met you,

453
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,230
I would've surely remembered.

454
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,280
Perhaps beautiful ladies

455
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,520
often share similar features.

456
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,430
That's why you mistook me.

457
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,430
That must be it.

458
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:06,270
Hua.

459
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,560
The fish soup is excellent.

460
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,040
Carp is rare in the north.

461
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:16,040
Miss Luo, have some more.

462
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:18,710
The fish soup.

463
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,000
(Thanks to him.)

464
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,680
(I just entered the mansion,)

465
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,070
(and trouble already follows.)

466
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,520
Thank you.

467
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,680
So, that's Yun's type.

468
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,190
Miss Luo,

469
00:22:56,190 --> 00:23:00,280
I think you've caught Yun's eye.

470
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,590
He's just teasing you.

471
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,120
Grandmother,

472
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:09,310
I'm not teasing her.

473
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,760
I heard there was

474
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,510
an extraordinary lady in the house.

475
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:17,220
They said she was stunningly beautiful,

476
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,950
with a lovely voice

477
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,710
and captivating charm.

478
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,520
Now that I've met her,

479
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,650
I can see she stands out.

480
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,160
Stands out? In what way?

481
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,470
She's clearly pretending.

482
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,230
Can't Lu Yun see it?

483
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,800
Don't you act the same way?

484
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:41,950
That's not true.

485
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,640
That's just how I act.

486
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,190
Thank you, sir.

487
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,760
That's flattering.

488
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:57,110
Alright.

489
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,520
Enough chatting.

490
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,040
Let's eat. Don't disappoint Grandmother.

491
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:04,070
Have a seat.

492
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,070
Everyone, dig in.

493
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:27,590
(Doesn't the Lu Clan have many young men?)

494
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,590
(Where are they?)

495
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,310
Madam Lu, the Young Masters are here.

496
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,430
- Greetings, Grandmother.
- Greetings.

497
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,000
Greetings, Madam Lu.

498
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:13,110
Please. As you were.

499
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,720
Brother.

500
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,000
Yun.

501
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,470
You must be Miss Luo.

502
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:22,880
Lingyu,

503
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,520
this is our Second Young Master, Xian.

504
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,840
Second Young Master.

505
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:37,140
(Lu Xian)

506
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:45,030
Xian.

507
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,800
Since you're here,

508
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,110
please take a seat.

509
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:50,550
Yes.

510
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:53,790
Xian.

511
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:55,760
Your seat

512
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:57,030
is over there.

513
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,760
Since everyone is here,

514
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,000
let's have a toast.

515
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:11,760
- Raise your glasses.
- Come on.

516
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,920
- To Madam Lu.
- To Mother.

517
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:22,060
(Time Slips Away)

518
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:36,640
I wonder how Hua and Lingxi are doing

519
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,830
with their snooping.

520
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:46,030
Yun,

521
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,680
where have you been?

522
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:51,280
My parents and Grandmother
were so worried.

523
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,950
Didn't Jinchuan already explain?

524
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:54,400
I've been

525
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,430
fooling around.

526
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,880
His excuses were full of flaws.

527
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:00,110
Apart from Grandmother,

528
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,350
and those girls

529
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,560
who believe anything,

530
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,600
who else would believe him?

531
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,480
Speaking of which,

532
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,560
lately, I have

533
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:17,310
been captivated by a woman.

534
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:20,310
(He's really fooling around?)

535
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,950
A woman can captivate you so?

536
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,110
Whose daughter is she?

537
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,240
Is she engaged?

538
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,880
Why haven't you told Father and Mother?

539
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,520
This woman isn't from a noble family,

540
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,160
nor is she from Yuezhou.

541
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,640
That makes things a bit tricky.

542
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,760
Father values family background.

543
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:41,550
But it's no big deal.

544
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,880
I'll speak up of her to Father.

545
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:47,430
She's neither gentle nor virtuous.

546
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,760
Mother might be harder to convince.

547
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,280
No worries. If you truly like her,

548
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,830
I'll negotiate with Mother for you.

549
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:58,430
That lady is already engaged.

550
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:00,920
No worries...

551
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,160
No way!

552
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,000
She's engaged?

553
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,350
Yun, you've lost your mind.

554
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,000
Do you want to break them up?

555
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,800
Or lower yourself to please others?

556
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,400
I know your father's incident...

557
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,470
Though everyone keeps quiet about it,

558
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,760
I'm the one who knows you best.

559
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,400
You're not one to give up easily.

560
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:28,820
Brother, don't be nervous.

561
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:30,920
My parents are gone.

562
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:32,320
And you can be the one

563
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:34,430
to carry on the Lu family name.

564
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,040
So whether I marry or not,

565
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,120
and whom I marry,

566
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,440
doesn't really matter.

567
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:45,790
Yun, hang on.

568
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,070
Listen to me.

569
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,070
It's not about whom you marry.

570
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:50,310
Yun.

571
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,070
(You can't tell much from his looks.)

572
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,000
(He's far more insightful)

573
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,640
(than those sanctimonious moralists.)

574
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,160
How's the snooping going?

575
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,640
Sister, trust me.

576
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,350
I've gathered all the info.

577
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,520
All good.

578
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:13,990
Let's begin.

579
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,230
Brother Xian is the eldest son
of the first branch.

580
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:17,150
His career's promising.

581
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:19,160
Let's start with the Third Young Master.

582
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,230
Why, Sister?

583
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,710
I've just uncovered everything

584
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:23,560
about Brother Xian:

585
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,710
his study schedule, meals,

586
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:25,640
and when he's slacking.

587
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:26,760
Lu Chang said,

588
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,190
Brother Xian is the best amongst all.

589
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,070
Brother Yun is far behind.

590
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:31,910
How good is he?

591
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,350
He's from a distinguished family.

592
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:35,430
The Third Young Master is handsome.

593
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,920
He has a bright future ahead.

594
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,640
The Third Young Master is handsome.

595
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,950
He has a gentle temperament.

596
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:41,950
The Third Young Master is handsome.

597
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:43,950
Miss Hua,

598
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:46,520
she's into his good looks.

599
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,360
That's superficial.

600
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,040
At today's banquet,

601
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:52,280
First Madam purposely
separated me from Lu Xian.

602
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:54,350
Though she didn't say anything,

603
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,640
it's obvious

604
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,230
she doesn't want me getting close to her son.

605
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:01,520
Why do I even bother?

606
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,640
Xian.

607
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:04,640
Your seat

608
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,040
is over there.

609
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:11,230
It's just about changing a seat,

610
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:13,230
yet there are so many complications.

611
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,310
So this is the adult world.

612
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:19,230
Here's what I found
about the Third Young Master.

613
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,230
The girls from each courtyard

614
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:22,760
just couldn't stop

615
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,280
whenever Lu Yun was mentioned.

616
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:28,350
It's said he's been playing the field

617
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:30,220
without getting involved romantically.

618
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,640
Many girls in Yuezhou

619
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,800
believe they are special for him,

620
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,830
but they all end up disappointed.

621
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:43,160
Maybe there's someone he cares about.

622
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,000
Absolutely not.

623
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:45,610
According to reliable sources,

624
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,950
in Lu Yun's courtyard,

625
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,710
even the flies are male.

626
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,950
So he's making up stories

627
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:52,800
to avoid romance?

628
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:53,670
Most likely.

629
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:58,070
My Lady, Lu Yun is excellent in many ways,

630
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:00,880
except for one thing.

631
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:03,030
What is it?

632
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,190
He lost his father young,

633
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,560
with no one to rely on.

634
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,400
The Head of the Clan and his wife

635
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,760
let him grow up freely and unruly,

636
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,000
without securing him a minor position.

637
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:15,830
A promising young talent

638
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:17,590
ended up becoming a playboy.

639
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,640
He truly is pitiable.

640
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:23,920
So, who's it going to be?

641
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,640
Brother Yun or Brother Xian?

642
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,240
Xian,

643
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:32,280
that Miss Luo seems well-mannered

644
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,520
but she's seductive,

645
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,430
with many little schemes.

646
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:38,800
You must stay away from her.

647
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,430
Mother,

648
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,520
you kept saying that.

649
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,920
I find Miss Luo dignified and polite,

650
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,010
and knows her boundaries.

651
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,760
Moreover, she gets along well with Yun.

652
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,160
She must be of a kind nature.

653
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,430
It's not as you think.

654
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,800
She is like that!

655
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,680
Aunt is right.

656
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:58,310
She flaunts herself everywhere.

657
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:00,470
Besides pretending in front of Grandmother,

658
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:03,400
she also has Yun's favor.

659
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,400
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

660
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,400
If Yun and Miss Luo truly like each other,

661
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,400
I don't have to worry about him.

662
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,640
Stop making excuses.

663
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:19,190
Today at the banquet,

664
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:21,230
your eyes were glued to her.

665
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,520
Mother, please don't say that.

666
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:25,680
I have no improper thoughts about her.

667
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,950
Miss Luo belongs to Yun.

668
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,840
Do you mean it?

669
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:33,070
Yes.

670
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:34,920
That's a relief.

671
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,590
I still feel uneasy.

672
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:26,800
What a destined encounter.

673
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:36,310
Now that you're here,

674
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,800
live your life well.

675
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:41,880
You better leave me alone.

676
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:49,110
(Groom Requirements)
Groom...

677
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,900
Groom Requirements?

678
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,280
Groom Requirements?

679
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,360
My Lady,

680
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:58,070
why are the handsome preferred?

681
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:59,950
If we're married,

682
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:01,400
we'll face each other all the time.

683
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:04,110
I should choose someone pleasing to the eye.

684
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,470
Besides, my requirements aren't high.

685
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,320
A man like Lu Yun

686
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,320
barely meets the mark.

687
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,000
Not high?

688
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,870
Second, with good character.

689
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,520
Lu Yun is charming,

690
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,470
and quite favored by the girls.

691
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,870
His character shouldn't be too bad.

692
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,190
Miss, you're right.

693
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:30,040
Third, the wealthy are preferred.

694
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:33,950
Lu Yun is a legit son of the Lus.

695
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,950
Not extremely wealthy,

696
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,190
but well-off with luxury.

697
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:43,020
(Groom Requirements)

698
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,840
♪Pick you, pass you, let me think♪

699
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:50,330
♪Love or hate, no room for compromise♪

700
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:54,060
♪Don't waste the journey of life♪

701
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:00,280
Finally, the unbounded are preferred.

702
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,320
These are my requirements.

703
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,000
Not too demanding, right?

704
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,390
My Lady, I understand the rest,

705
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:10,190
but what's good about this last one?

706
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:11,880
If so,

707
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,080
won't that man be unprotected?

708
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,280
When I reclaim my family property,

709
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:18,950
and restore the Luo's prestige,

710
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:20,600
why would he need protection?

711
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:24,670
Way to go, Sister.

712
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:26,120
That's the spirit.

713
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,630
Yeah. Right.

714
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,910
You're just avoiding troublesome in-laws.

715
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:35,120
You might as well say Lu Yun is preferred.

716
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,200
Sir.

717
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,200
What's the matter?

718
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,190
Miss Chen is here.

719
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:52,800
Miss Chen?

720
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,600
Why is she here

721
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,710
this late?

722
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,030
Miss Chen.

723
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,840
Xuechen.

724
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,800
What brings you here

725
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:16,960
late at night?

726
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,190
Did you try the Qinghua cake

727
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:22,150
I brought here days ago?

728
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,190
I was away recently.

729
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:26,560
I saw those cakes

730
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,670
when I returned today.

731
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,120
It's been too long,

732
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,400
and they are moldy.

733
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:34,280
I see.

734
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:38,120
But, thanks anyway.

735
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:41,710
It's all right, Xuechen.

736
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:43,030
Since it's moldy,

737
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,120
just throw it away.

738
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,710
I've made some new ones today.

739
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,510
Thank you.

740
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,320
Miss Chen, please send no more.

741
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,710
So I don't let down your kind intentions.

742
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:06,910
It's getting late.

743
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,760
Let Jinchuan escort you home.

744
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,320
Or your mother will be worried.

745
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,400
Go ahead.

746
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,840
My Lady, at today's banquet,

747
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,630
I noticed Lu Yun treats you

748
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,230
differently from the other girls.

749
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:35,470
In other word,

750
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:38,190
it can be phrased as "special".

751
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:42,230
Differently means special?

752
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,280
It means Lu Yun likes you?

753
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:48,510
Is that really the case?

754
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,670
When a man

755
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,430
says no, he means yes.

756
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:56,470
When he says dislike, he means like.

757
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,320
Quite contrary.

758
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,120
And moreover,

759
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:03,230
he was very attentive during the banquet.

760
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,600
Even if he feels nothing for me now,

761
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,630
it's only a matter of time

762
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:10,670
before he falls for me.

763
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:15,670
Didn't I just ask you to scout?

764
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,910
Let's see it now.

765
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:17,960
Here you go.

766
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:23,840
(Second Young Master)
Xian's here.

767
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,760
(Madam Lu)
Madam Lu's here.

768
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,790
The Third Young Master is here.

769
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:27,360
Aunt Ying is here.

770
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,100
(Third Young Master)

771
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:33,130
(Third Young Master)
With this map in hand,

772
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:34,670
things will be easier.

773
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:38,320
(Luo's first special move:)

774
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:41,040
(The closest gets dibs.)

775
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,660
(Qing Courtyard, Third Young Master,
Xuewu Courtyard)

776
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,680
Mother,

777
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,840
the yogurt tastes differently

778
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:52,920
with jam.

779
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:59,760
Lingyu's yogurt is so delicious,

780
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,470
it's making my mouth water.

781
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,870
Madam Lu,

782
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:08,120
I heard from Aunt Ying
that your appetite hasn't been great lately.

783
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,630
So I thought of this idea

784
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:12,190
to add some mixed jam on it

785
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:13,490
to help with your appetite.

786
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:15,040
I brought it here for you.

787
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:17,870
It's rare for Ying to be so thoughtful

788
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:21,360
and not just focus on her card game.

789
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,230
I always think of you,

790
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:25,520
Mother.

791
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:28,230
Lingyu is very thoughtful.

792
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:29,600
I just mentioned it,

793
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,760
and she remembered it.

794
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,520
That's right. Thank you, Lingyu.

795
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,280
But I must say,

796
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:42,190
I've never heard of this mixed jam.

797
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:44,360
It's a snack from the northern Shuozhou.

798
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:47,910
Shuozhou is cold and harsh,

799
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,040
with scarce fruits.

800
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,870
When Hua and I stayed at my uncle's,

801
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:55,230
we had no fresh fruits or vegetables.

802
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:02,120
I'm fine with it.

803
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,710
But Hua is still growing.

804
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:06,750
Sister,

805
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:10,230
I'm sorry for being a burden.

806
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,080
I had no choice

807
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,670
but to pick out the good parts

808
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,600
from almost spoiled fruits,

809
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:18,560
mixing them to make jam.

810
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:21,360
So Hua can satisfy her cravings

811
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,670
or stimulate her appetite during summer.

812
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:26,520
Sister.

813
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,230
Good girl.

814
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,800
It's been hard for you.

815
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:34,670
Madam Lu,

816
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,600
the jam you're having were from fine fruits.

817
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,360
They were picked fresh

818
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,080
from Aunt Ying's garden.

819
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:44,280
Indeed, good fruits are different
from bad ones.

820
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,390
If you like it,

821
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,630
I'll make more for you next time.

822
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:51,190
Let's not dwell on sad things today.

823
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,670
Come on. Have a seat.

824
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,360
Come here.

825
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:56,310
Sit next to me.

826
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,160
Lingyu,

827
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:00,320
now that you're with the Lus,

828
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,120
you're one of us.

829
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,670
You can eat anything here.

830
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,630
Which courtyard are you staying in now?

831
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:09,760
I'll have a maid send you

832
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,950
some cherries just gifted by His Majesty.

833
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:13,390
Thank you so much.

834
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:16,800
But I'm staying at Aunt Ying's courtyard.

835
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,360
I'm afraid it's not suitable

836
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,390
to keep too many things there.

837
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:24,800
Hua and I have already

838
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:26,600
caused you trouble staying here.

839
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,560
What are you talking about?

840
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,710
I've been very careful.

841
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:34,390
But Hua is at a playful age

842
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,190
and is always running around,

843
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,800
disturbing Aunt Ying a lot.

844
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:41,120
I don't mind at all.

845
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,560
But Hua is still growing.

846
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,320
Now, they are

847
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,390
living in my wing room,

848
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:52,280
it's really packed.

849
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:54,910
If there were a courtyard

850
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,950
where Hua could run freely,

851
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,630
that'd be wonderful.

852
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,840
You girls staying in Ying's

853
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,600
is indeed inconvenient.

854
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:10,710
We have many empty courtyards here.

855
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,840
Of course we can accommodate some guests.

856
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,000
Mother is right.

857
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,710
Hua and I have lived in humble huts.

858
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:22,280
Aunt Ying's wing room

859
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,230
is like heaven to us.

860
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:25,990
Besides,

861
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:28,190
I'm new here.

862
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:29,910
If I take a courtyard,

863
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,760
I'm afraid it might trouble Madam Lu

864
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,470
and Aunt Ying.

865
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:37,000
You're so sensible.

866
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:38,760
Trust me.

867
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,800
I understand perfectly.

868
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,670
No worries, we're family now.

869
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,600
No trouble at all.

870
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:50,800
Lingyu, if you fancy a courtyard,

871
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,040
just tell me,

872
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,290
I will support you.

873
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,470
Alright.

874
00:42:57,470 --> 00:42:58,390
It's settled then.

875
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:01,120
Lingyu, you should thank her.

876
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:04,000
Hua, come on.

877
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:08,800
Thank you, Madam Lu.

878
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,320
Thank you, Madam Lu.

879
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,440
Madam Lu,

880
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:19,950
yesterday you saw

881
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,320
how familiar Miss Luo was with Lu Yun,

882
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,320
which already made other girls unhappy.

883
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,150
If she gets a courtyard,

884
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:30,280
it'll surely cause a catfight.

885
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:35,390
Such trivial matters between young ones,

886
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:38,300
why make a big fuss over them?

887
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:41,910
Only at their age can they fuss

888
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,320
over such charming boys.

889
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:47,190
Just let them be.

890
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,800
Madam, you're truly wise.

891
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:55,110
(Etiquette Hall)
Your embroidery is nice.

892
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:56,840
Stop what you're doing.

893
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,080
I heard that Miss Luo

894
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:00,800
went to see Madam Lu this morning.

895
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,630
What do you think she went for?

896
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:03,910
What else could it be?

897
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,320
Surely she went to ask

898
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,600
for the Xuewu Courtyard.

899
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,000
She just spoke a few words with Lu Yun,

900
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,280
and now she's

901
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,470
so overconfident.

902
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:13,960
It's been so long.

903
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,760
No one has truly moved in yet.

904
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:17,820
That's because it's not your turn.

905
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:20,470
If he knew you well,

906
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,670
you'd be like a crab in the pond.

907
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:23,720
A crab?

908
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:26,070
Why?

909
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,080
Why is that?

910
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,000
It walks arrogantly.

911
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:30,550
You...

912
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,120
Enough.

913
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:33,760
Miss Luo just arrived,

914
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:35,670
and it's normal for Xuechen to speak to her.

915
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:39,360
I think she acts properly.

916
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,800
Though she's a bit outgoing,

917
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,120
coming from the north, it's understandable.

918
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,280
You always sees the best in people.

919
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,870
Could Xuechen

920
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:51,600
fall for her instantly?

921
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:54,080
Miss Luo might truly have some means

922
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,430
that we haven't discovered.

923
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:58,870
Everyone, let's quickly prepare

924
00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:00,710
the embroidery for Nanny's inspection.

925
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:05,230
No matter what,

926
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,040
we must be on high alert.

927
00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:08,100
- That's right.
- Yeah.

928
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,040
Nanny is already on her way.

929
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:15,840
Oh no! Why didn't you say earlier?

930
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:26,860
(Lu Mansion)

931
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:44,230
My Lady.

932
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,000
Did we take the wrong path?

933
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:47,600
Weren't we choosing a courtyard?

934
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:49,310
It seems

935
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,840
the Yulan Courtyard near Madam Lu's
is better.

936
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,710
Why are you heading towards Lu Yun's?

937
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,230
The value of a courtyard

938
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:00,390
goes beyond superficial things

939
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:02,230
like size and pretty views.

940
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:04,190
So, what really matters?

941
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,600
Of course it's our neighbor.

942
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:10,150
The Yulan Courtyard

943
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:11,470
is just perfect

944
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:14,080
except for one thing.

945
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,800
If we live there,

946
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,360
we'd need to go through half of Lu Mansion

947
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,120
to meet Lu Yun.

948
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:28,600
Look, these three courtyards
are near Qing Courtyard,

949
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:32,600
offering a view of him directly.

950
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:33,840
Isn't that wonderful?

951
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,430
We should have asked

952
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:40,760
for the most spacious room.

953
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:42,360
Since they are near the Qing Courtyard,

954
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:44,360
we should choose the best one.

955
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:47,560
Do you think I woke up two hours early

956
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:49,120
just to take you on a tour?

957
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,710
We must pick one courtyard

958
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,910
that's best for fostering ties.

959
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:08,720
We're near the Qing Courtyard.

960
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:12,190
Could there be any surprises?

961
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:16,940
