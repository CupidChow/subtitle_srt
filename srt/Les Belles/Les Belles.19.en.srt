23
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:40,810
Therefore,

24
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,100
I must proceed with caution this time,

25
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,900
to avoid alerting the enemy.

26
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,140
Then you'll start with the North Army.

27
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:52,410
I'll ask Prince Changyi for two lists

28
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,860
of the key figures of the Battle of Jingyang,

29
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,460
and those who can command the North Army,

30
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:02,220
besides Prince Hengyang.

31
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,860
The ones who appear on both lists

32
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,060
are the spies.

33
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:11,890
Yes.

34
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:17,420
Times have changed.

35
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,670
Even Minister Lu wouldn't want to investigate

36
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,980
the suspicious events of that year,

37
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,800
do you still want to investigate?

38
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,740
Yes.

39
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,520
The investigation is difficult.

40
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,130
You risked your life every time.

41
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,700
Do you still want to investigate?

42
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:31,820
I must investigate.

43
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,250
Alright.

44
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:37,970
Then let's investigate further.

45
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,770
You support me?

46
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,620
Why wouldn't I support you?

47
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:48,980
If we dig deeper,

48
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,700
it might involve many people.

49
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,210
Even my uncle

50
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:55,290
doesn't want me entangled in this matter.

51
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:59,210
Should the truth never see the light of day?

52
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,570
Now I realize

53
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,730
we're quite similar.

54
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:06,820
Standing in the torrent,

55
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,980
yet daring to go against it;

56
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,340
unyielding until we hit a wall,

57
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,180
not crying until reality strikes.

58
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,100
I can understand you.

59
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:18,850
I also hope

60
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,060
you pursue what you believe is right.

61
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,660
Indeed.

62
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,570
I am also a straightforward person.

63
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:35,180
But I have some things I dare not say.

64
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,870
I'm afraid she wouldn't want to listen.

65
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:46,050
Do you think

66
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,700
she would be willing to listen?

but dared not?

so fearless and bold.

85
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,450
Nothing seems to stop her.

Even in the toughest situations,

87
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:01,450
she always finds a way out.

88
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:05,650
I know she doesn't rely on anyone.

89
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,260
But I always want to help her.

90
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,260
I also want to ask her something

91
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,470
that if she could

92
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,260
not marry anyone else.

93
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,170
Do you think she'll agree?

94
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:32,980
I guess,

95
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,610
she will break off the engagement.

96
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:42,780

97
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,070

How could you be willing to marry out?

99
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,370
I want to end the engagement,

100
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:56,700
not because of this,

101
00:05:58,530 --> 00:05:59,650
but because

102
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,970
I have someone I like.

00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,420
Well,

106
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,170
he's quite stubborn,

107
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,740
proud and aloof.

108
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:13,300
He looks like a noble man with grace.

109
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,300
Yet he's full of cunning schemes.

110
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,020
He blocked my escape from marriage

111
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,020
and played tricks on me like a ghost.

112
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,610
He knew who I was,

113
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,420
yet he still hid it from me,

114
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,100
and used me.

115
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,330
If you dislike him so much,

116
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,580
why do you still like him?

It's true I dislike him.

118
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:37,300
But he took me away from the Sutra Hall,

119
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,740
shared a midnight meal on the street,

120
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,330
gave me the Glazed Armlet,

121
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:47,330

189
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,620
No worries.

190
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,370
Mr. Li also knows about your situation.

191
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,210
I...

192
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,600
Sorry I can't provide the family document.

193
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:21,980
Without the family document,

194
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:23,540
you can't take the exam.

195
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,100
Mr. Li, she must have a reason.

196
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:28,620
Can you make an exception?

197
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,980
Your Highness, you know my principles.

198
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,690
You invited me to oversee the exam,

199
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:37,570
waiting in the rain for a long time.

200
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,980
I appreciate your dedication to talent.

201
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,330
That's why I came.

202
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,300
But

203
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,330
judging by this lady's behavior,

204
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:55,380
do not let your love for talent go to waste.

205
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,540
Mr. Li, please wait.

206
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,250
You have already done so much for me.

207
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,940
I will definitely do

208
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,450
this most critical step well.

209
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,620
I won't disappoint you.

210
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,330
(If he knew I was Zhou Yangling,)

211
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,310
(I don't know how he would react.)

212
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,090
Mr. Li.

213
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,420
You're from Wuzhou.

214
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,300
Zhou Yangling.

215
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,770
Father: Zhou Tan.

216
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,860
That's me.

217
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,250
Identity verified.

218
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,130
Let's begin the exam.

219
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:57,540
Your Highness, I take the paper for review.

220
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,740
Your Highness.

221
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:20,330
I apologize.

222
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:23,770
I've hidden it from you for so long.

223
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,980
I should be the one apologizing.

224
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,740
I mentioned the engagement to my father.

225
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:34,890
But I never asked for your wishes.

226
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:36,300
If you don't like it,

227
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,210
we can tell him later.

228
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,570
You've been writing since morning.

229
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:56,620
You must be tired.

230
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,770
Take a good rest.

231
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,180
I'm leaving.

232
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:10,210
I...

233
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:22,940
Really?

234
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,380
Miss Luo wants to see me?

235
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,740
Absolutely.

236
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:29,690
Did she say anything else,

237
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,980
like where she wants to go

238
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,980
or what she wants to do?

239
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:38,980
She had something to tell you in person.

240
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,250
In person?

241
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,140
Your Highness,

242
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:46,130
Miss Luo has repeatedly refused you.

243
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,620
Could it be that she...

244
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:56,300
I want to talk about our marriage.

245
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:01,740
Since she wants to meet me,

246
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,770
I must present my best self to her.

247
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,810
Fetch the black patterned cloud sleeve robe.

248
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:07,860
Alright.

249
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:08,860
Wait a moment.

250
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,010
Send someone to find these items.

251
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:19,330
Hurry up!

252
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,520
Alright.

253
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,780
(Lu Mansion)

254
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:36,820
Your Highness.

255
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:54,210
Your Highness.

256
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,010
I've said many times

257
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,180
there's no need for formality between us.

258
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,300
I have always been this way.

259
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:00,890
Today is no exception.

260
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:05,980
Weren't we set to meet at your mansion?

261
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,930
Why did you come in person?

262
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:09,330
I wanted to see you sooner,

263
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:10,660
so I came here.

264
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,500
Your Highness,

265
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:16,540
about us...

266
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,530
Do you still remember

267
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,380
the first time we met

268
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:21,740
at the Lu Mansion?

269
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:24,020
That day I came to the Lu Mansion

270
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:26,930
while you were personally brewing tea

271
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,720
outside the Qing Courtyard pavilion.

272
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,860
The tea from that day

273
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:33,500
was the best I've ever had.

274
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,020
Your Highness,

275
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,050
I invited you today

276
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,820
because I have something to say to you.

277
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:44,100
I also have something to tell you.

278
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,740
Shall we take a walk?

279
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:49,690
Sure.

280
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:51,810
Please.

281
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,260
(Zichen Palace)

282
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:05,170
Even selecting a censor takes half a month.

283
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,260
Your Majesty, Lu Yun seeks an audience.

284
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:12,570
Young Master Lu?

285
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:15,450
That's quite rare.

286
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,380
Let him in.

287
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,660
Yes, Your Majesty.

288
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,690
Best of three.

289
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,450
I've already won two rounds against you.

290
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,380
As agreed, you should listen to me.

291
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,450
How about

292
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:48,900
best of five?

293
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:53,410
Your Highness, please go first.

294
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,620
Five, five, six, 16 points.

295
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,860
I should have won this game.

296
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:11,140
Six, six, six, 18 points.

297
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,170
Shall you continue?

298
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:19,020
Even if we play a hundred times,

299
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:20,450
I will always win.

300
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,450
Why are you so certain?

301
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:25,500
Because I have a trick.

302
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,170
You cannot defeat me.

303
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,180
Since this is a gamble,

304
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,530
it should be fair and just.

305
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:36,900
How can you play tricks?

306
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:39,100
Your Highness, you are born a prince.

307
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:41,380
You made a bet with His Majesty

308
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,210
to decide my entire future.

309
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:45,620
I am just an ordinary girl.

310
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,620
I can do nothing but being your wager.

311
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:52,210
Is this not another form of deceit?

312
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,140
Miss Luo,

313
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,660
I didn't intend to pressure you.

314
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,310
Because of what happened between us,

315
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:07,660
I thought you had feelings for me too,

316
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,170
so I asked my father for a reward.

317
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,690
I didn't expect

318
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,450
it would confine you.

319
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:27,170
You ride across mountains and rivers,

320
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,450
bold and resourceful,

321
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,780
truly a young hero.

322
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,540
As for the matter of Fan Qingchen,

323
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,450
you are impartial.

324
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,260
I admire you.

325
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,670
During the Flower Goddess Contest,

326
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,410
you generously helped me.

327
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,290
I am grateful.

328
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:45,690
You are sincere and honest.

329
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,860
I only see you as a dear friend

330
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,220
and have no romantic feelings for you.

331
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:07,930
Your Highness,

332
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:09,290
watch out.

333
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:15,100
Since the day I saw you,

334
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,570
I have been unable to forget you.

335
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,860
The Fiery Dance at the Zhongshan Banquet...

336
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:33,080
Always remain prosperous!

337
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:37,290
The stunning dance at the Contest...

338
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,050
Luo Lingyu, the Flower Goddess,

339
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:45,330
is truly a match for Prince Hengyang.

340
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:49,100
Every time I see you,

341
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,660
you always give me different surprises.

342
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:57,170
I originally focused only on the warfare.

343
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,620
But after meeting you,

344
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,100
I discovered that daily life

345
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:06,740
is also exceptionally lovely.

346
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:09,980
No matter what,

347
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:15,860
I still want to strive for it one more time.

348
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,780
But Your Highness,

349
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:24,900
love is different from warfare.

350
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:27,860
It doesn't mean one can conquer everything

351
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:30,380
just by charging forward.

352
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,170
If we had met at the Northern Border,

353
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,690
would the outcome be different today?

354
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,290
Perhaps love or not

355
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,740
has nothing to do with timing.

356
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,380
Alright.

357
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:09,530
Our marriage began with a bet,

358
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:13,450
now it ends with another bet.

359
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:15,570
It has a beginning and an end,

360
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,310
giving both you and me an explanation.

361
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:22,330
In any case,

362
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,530
I am grateful to you

363
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,100
for everything you've done for me.

364
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,930
I'm going.

365
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:08,290
Miss Luo!

366
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:28,330
What beautiful fireworks!

367
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,260
They're truly amazing.

368
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:32,930
So beautiful.

369
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:34,740
Absolutely stunning.

370
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:35,900
Truly wonderful.

371
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,620
It's so beautiful.

372
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,730
The fireworks are amazing!

373
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:11,580
- Are they beautiful?
- Yes, they are.

374
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,780
Do you like it?

375
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:13,860
I do.

376
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,860
It's really stunning, isn't it?

377
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,530
Look, there are fireworks over there.

378
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,900
I see them. They're so pretty.

379
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,020
Let's move over there.

380
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,690
- Alright, let's go.
- Get closer.

381
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,690
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

382
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,570
So beautiful.

383
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,140
There's more over there.

384
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,620
(Official Petition by Lu Yun)

385
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,740
Your Majesty,

386
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:42,530
this is my official petition.

387
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:45,450
You want to be an official?

388
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,860
That's quite surprising.

389
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:52,740
You used to avoid discussing it.

390
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:55,810
Why bring it up now?

391
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:57,050
Your Majesty,

392
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:58,410
I shamelessly request

393
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,980
to dedicate my life to serve,

394
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:02,330
in exchange for revoking the decree

395
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:05,260
and calling off the engagement of Miss Luo.

396
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,260
You want me

397
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,930
to cancel Miss Luo's engagement?

398
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,490
It's such an absurd request.

399
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:18,020
How can you even say it?

400
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,580
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

401
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:21,210
I understand

402
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,700
since ancient times,
the words of emperors

403
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,900
are like golden rules,

404
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,090
which can't be questioned

405
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:27,090
and changed.

406
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:30,210
But I believe that with your wisdom,

407
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:33,410
you should know forced marriage

408
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,780
will lead to mutual disdain.

409
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,240
Xuechen,

410
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,500
I cherish you,

411
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:43,780
but you can't just flaunt your talent.

412
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,100
Tell me then

413
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:50,140
if I agree to your request,

414
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,450
what can you accomplish?

415
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,420
Your Majesty,

416
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:55,380
currently within Nanyue,

417
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,140
Beichu's spies run rampant,

418
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,570
even infiltrating the North Army

419
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,660
and colluding with officials.

420
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:02,620
Over these years,

421
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:05,410
I have been secretly investigating it.

422
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:06,900
Now, there are some leads.

423
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,380
I ask you to review this.

424
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:09,300
(Memorial by Lu Yun)

425
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:20,380
(Memorial to the throne)

426
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,660
You should understand,

427
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,140
this evidence

428
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,780
is not enough to overthrow these officials.

429
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,260
If I insist on convicting them,

430
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:40,980
the memorials they present by then

431
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:44,210
will definitely break my desk.

432
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,500
Your Majesty,

433
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:47,780
I have been planning this for years.

434
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,700
I will definitely uncover the truth.

435
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,150
Please rest assured, Your Majesty.

436
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:57,330
You must think it carefully.

437
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,310
Once you become an official,

438
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:02,370
you'll have to bid farewell

439
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:04,620
to your carefree days.

440
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,290
Are you saying all this today

441
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:12,450
just to call off the engagement?

442
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,260
I hope you will grant it.

443
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:18,780
Regarding this matter,

444
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,410
I can't just listen to you.

445
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:23,900
Eunuch Gao,

446
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:28,170
summon Miss Luo to the palace.

447
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,660
I want to ask her personally

448
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,410
how she thinks about this matter.

449
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:34,050
Yes, Your Majesty.

450
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,410
Miss Luo.

451
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:47,050
His Majesty summons you to the palace.

452
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,410
To the palace?

453
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:01,290
Your Majesty, Miss Luo has arrived.

454
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:07,450
Greetings, Your Majesty.

455
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:11,980
Rise.

456
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,660
Thank you, Your Majesty.

457
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,570
Today, Xuechen entered the palace

458
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:24,410
to call off your engagement with Hengyang.

459
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,620
I want to hear it

460
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:30,740
from you personally.

461
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,500
Your Majesty, despite your busy affairs,

462
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:34,170
you still summon me to the palace

463
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:36,410
and take time to listen to me.

464
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:39,250
With such a benevolent ruler,

465
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:41,900
it is truly a blessing for Nanyue.

466
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:44,980
Since you understand this is rare,

467
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:48,540
you must express your thoughts clearly.

468
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,020
You discern even the smallest details.

469
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:51,900
I dare not lie.

470
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:54,530
Since I've been granted the chance,

471
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,570
before presenting my case,

472
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:59,500
may I ask you a question?

473
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,140
Go ahead.

474
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,020
When I arrived at Yuezhou,

475
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:03,930
I heard

476
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:06,900
the Contest is the grant event

477
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:09,330
held by the Emperor.

478
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,700
I participated in the Contest

479
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:14,210
and was fortunate to be the Flower Goddess.

480
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:18,300
I wonder why you holds the Contest.

481
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:22,300
It's to let all women showcase their talents

482
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,410
and beauty.

483
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,330
The chosen Flower Goddess

484
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:27,660
can serve as a role model for women.

485
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,860
So to speak,

486
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:31,170
winning the Flower Goddess title

487
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:33,050
can be granted a wish

488
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:34,210
and a special favor

489
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,530
like a royal marriage.

490
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,250
It's truly a great honor.

491
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:38,250
Absolutely.

492
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:39,780
Becoming the Flower Goddess

493
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,740
is a great honor.

494
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,810
But why don't you

495
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,440
make the Flower Goddess Contest grander

496
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:50,210
and forced all eligible women to join?

497
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,210
Not every woman

498
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:56,330
wants to perform in public.

499
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:59,330
For instance, Tang dislikes it.

500
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:03,740
The Contest is good,

501
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:07,660
but I can't force every woman to join.

502
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,260
Your Majesty, you're right.

503
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,930
If good deeds are forced,

504
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,740
they become burdens.

505
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,170
Whether it's holding the Contest

506
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,330
or granting a marriage,

507
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,810
it's all because you care for the people,

508
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:29,900
seek blessings for the ladies

509
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:32,450
and find a good match for Prince Hengyang.

510
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,020
Your Majesty, you should know

511
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:38,900
a lady's beauty comes from herself,

512
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,020
not relying on others.

513
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:44,100
She is not a flower needing shade.

514
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:48,100
I have no feelings for Prince Hengyang.

515
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:50,210
Forced feelings won't be sweet.

516
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:53,450
It may be hard to last forever.

517
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:56,780
If you want me to revoke the decree...

518
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,260
What if

519
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:01,660
I take the reward back too?

520
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:15,260
If you want to take the reward back,

521
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:18,410
I may feel regretful,

522
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,050
but I don't regret it.

523
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:21,920
Apart from the Flower Goddess Contest,

524
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,900
there will be other ways in the future

525
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,740
to reclaim the family property.

526
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,310
Marriage is a significant matter.

527
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,140
I don't want to use it as an exchange.

528
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:35,570
I understand that you acted in haste

529
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,310
and granted the marriage out of concern.

530
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,290
Your true intention is

531
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,540
that you care about my feelings

532
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,530
and those of everyone of your subjects.

533
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,370
Are you trying to flatter me

534
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:50,650
and then threaten me, aren't you?

535
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:54,810
I do not dare.

536
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:59,570
Prince Hengyang requests an audience.

537
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:01,620
Father.

538
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:03,420
I want to call off the engagement.

539
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:04,900
Well...

540
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:08,970
Well...

541
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:13,050
Why do you do that?

542
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:14,780
Didn't you say

543
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,450
that Miss Luo is your true love?

544
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:18,450
I granted you this marriage.

545
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:20,780
But now

546
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,050
you're regretting it.

547
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,660
Tell me what's going on.

548
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:27,530
I've earned military merits over the years,

549
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:29,100
and never asked you for anything.

550
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:32,100
Today, I wish to exchange this

551
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,170
to get you to retract the decree.

552
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,140
Please grant me this favor.

553
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:38,810
You...

554
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,510
The decree has been issued.

555
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:51,350
Once spilled, water can't be gathered.

556
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:52,780
How can it be changed so easily?

557
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,660
Your Majesty, if that's the case,

558
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:59,140
my request to be an official is unreasonable.

559
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:00,450
Wait.

560
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,540
(Official Petition from Lu Yun)

561
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:13,300
(Zichen Palace)

562
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:16,330
I said no.

563
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:17,730
Everyone, leave here.

564
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:24,730
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

565
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:26,310
No need for formalities.

566
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:32,700
Uncle.

567
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,090
Mr. Lu.

568
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,180
Hurry and go home.

569
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:38,530
Lords, His Majesty summons you.

570
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:57,020
The wedding is on schedule.

571
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,770
Now it seems your wish has come true.

572
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,330
- You...
- What His Majesty said

573
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:04,250
carry weight.

574
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,730
We are fated to be apart.

575
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:09,460
Why blame Prince Hengyang?

576
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:10,940
Fine.

577
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,220
It's my fault now.

578
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:16,290
Seems being a princess is more tempting.

579
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:17,540
Lu Xuechen, you...

580
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:20,250
Lu Xuechen, the situation is settled.

581
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,220
Your words are so sharp.

582
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,010
Don't you find it ridiculous?

583
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:26,620
You are resorting to trickery and plunder.

584
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,620
Isn't that even more ridiculous?

585
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,100
I know you're full of complaints now,

586
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:32,290
but don't worry.

587
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,010
On the day I marry Miss Luo,

588
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,820
I'll surely send you an invitation.

589
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:38,770
Good.

590
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,250
Do not argue here.

591
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:41,970
Do you know where you are?

592
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,220
(Lu Mansion)

593
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,940
(Why isn't he here yet?)

594
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:14,900
Let us

595
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,380
meet.

596
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,940
In your courtyard.

597
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:20,700
My courtyard?

598
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:25,620
Sister.

599
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:28,900
What's wrong?

600
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,010
What are you doing?

601
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:33,290
I am admiring the lotus.

602
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:35,490
Why don't you go to bed?

603
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,460
Let's go.

604
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,470
- Alright.
- Off to bed.

605
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:41,660
In my courtyard?

606
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,620
Isn't it too obvious?

607
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,050
How is it?

608
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:57,330
Our plan went smoothly today, right?

609
00:36:58,210 --> 00:36:59,530
Your acting is superb.

610
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:01,110
How could it not be smooth?

611
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,500
Tomorrow, I will enter the palace

612
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,380
to report the findings to His Majesty.

613
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,900
Regarding your marriage to Prince Hengyang,

614
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:10,620
I will do my best to resolve it.

615
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:11,620
As for this matter,

616
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,860
I must resolve it myself.

617
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:17,340
We need to inform Prince Hengyang

618
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,460
about the presence of spies.

619
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:20,380
Lu Yun's eyes

620
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,970
were injured by someone from the North Army.

621
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:25,490
Your Highness,

622
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,730
I've heard before you returned to Yuezhou,

623
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,860
you faced several assassination attempts.

624
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:32,250
They knew your movements precisely

625
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,020
and tried to kill you so ruthlessly.

626
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,220
How many could do this?

627
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:36,940
So much has happened.

628
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:40,050
I believe you has suspicions.

629
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:45,180
I did have doubts before.

630
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,620
But there are many voices in the army.

631
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,820
If I investigation intensively,

632
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,310
I'm afraid it will disturb the troops.

633
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:52,000
So, I can only investigate secretly.

634
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,620
This matter is of great importance.

635
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,100
If you are willing,

636
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,960
please consider cooperating with us.

637
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:58,020
We can set a trap together

638
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,090
to catch the spies.

639
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:04,860
Miss Luo spoke earnestly just now.

640
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:10,050
Xuechen is willing to be official for this.

641
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:15,380
I am a reasonable person.

642
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,860
And I won't force anyone.

643
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:19,250
The decree for calling the engagement

644
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:20,540
shall be...

645
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,380
Your Majesty,

646
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:27,570
can you hold off on announcing it?

647
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:29,100
You wish to use the engagement

648
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,530
to better investigate spies?

649
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:32,940
Exactly.

650
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,870
Prince Hengyang is their target.

651
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:37,700
His every move is being watched.

652
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:41,940
I'm the best choice for the investigation.

653
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,050
If Xuechen and I

654
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:47,100
break ties over the engagement,

655
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,800
and it becomes known to everyone,

656
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:51,900
it will make the conspirators less wary

657
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:53,620
and slip up easily.

658
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:58,970
It's indeed a clever plan.

659
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:01,670
You've always avoided being an official.

660
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:03,770
But now you agree to this in exchange

661
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:05,570
for my withdrawal from the marriage.

662
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,010
If being an official

663
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,530
is not what you desire,

664
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:10,290
shall we change the plan?

665
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:12,810
I do this for you,

666
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:15,570
but not entirely for you.

667
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:20,100
When I investigated my father's case before,

668
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,810
being an official was a burden.

669
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:28,220
The truth involves high-ranking officials.

670
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:30,220
I can't remain a commoner

671
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,530
without power to fight against it.

672
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,180
Speaking of which,

673
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:42,180
you worked well with Prince Hengyang today.

674
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,100
You teased me together with him.

675
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:49,050
I did it for the overall situation.

676
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:52,380
How could Young Master Lu

677
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,770
be jealous over such a small matter?

678
00:39:57,450 --> 00:39:59,210
What should we do then?

679
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:00,410
In the coming days,

680
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:02,060
I'm afraid I must spend every day...

681
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,050
I'm regretting it.

682
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:05,180
What should we do?

683
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:07,970
I dislike seeing you with him daily.

684
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:10,810
Let's find another way.

685
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:12,770
Be good.

686
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:16,380
We're at a critical point now.

687
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:17,940
What should we do next?

688
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:22,420
Although we know

689
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:24,570
there're spies around Prince Hengyang,

690
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:26,140
we need to narrow it down.

691
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:29,180
I have asked Aman to check the list

692
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,330
of high officials in the North Army.

693
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,000
He should have made some progress.

694
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,330
Tomorrow, I'll go find Aman.

695
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:36,860
I once accompanied Prince Hengyang

696
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,970
to the residence of the North Army.

697
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:41,010
There are many former members there.

698
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:44,570
I believe from their words,

699
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:46,440
we might be able to gather some clues.
