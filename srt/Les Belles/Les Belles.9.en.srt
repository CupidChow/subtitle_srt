=Episode 9=

23
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,620
Since this matter is doubtful,

24
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,980
I will investigate it thoroughly.

25
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,660
If she's not involved,

26
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,380
I'll be grateful she saved Xian.

27
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,020
But if she's connected to it,

28
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,900
I won't go easy on her.

29
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:58,700
Of course.

30
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,700
Let's head to the main hall.

31
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:16,860
Chang.

32
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,340
Brother Yun,

33
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,180
do you know why Brother Xian

34
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,740
always treats you like a child?

35
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,940
Yes.

36
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,860
I don't practice writing regularly,

37
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,140
and I learn my lessons slowly.

38
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,260
I take Hua out to play every day.

39
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,080
You still can't take on the responsibility

40
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,620
of protecting the family,

41
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,380
so you're still a child.

42
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:47,300
That's why Brother Xian,
Lingyu, and Lingxi

43
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,380
all try their best to protect you.

44
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,420
You can remain a child forever.

45
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,020
But if you want to grow up

46
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,220
and protect your family,

47
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,820
sometimes all it takes

48
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,380
is a bit more courage.

49
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,180
Do you understand?

50
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:18,180
(Noble and Prestigious)

51
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,700
- Lingxi.
- My Lady, you're finally back.

52
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,900
No one noticed, right?

53
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,740
No, My Lady, rest assured.

54
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,820
I've been here all along.

55
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,660
No one has come.

56
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,180
Then I'm relieved.

57
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,740
Miss Luo.

58
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,660
- Miss Luo.
- She's coming.

59
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,820
Come on, quickly.

60
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,860
As long as Second Young Master

61
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,420
is healthy and safe,

62
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,340
I'm willing to do anything.

63
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,530
Miss Luo.

64
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,220
- First Madam calls for you.
- I wish...

65
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,020
Alright.

66
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:52,820
My Lady!

67
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,320
Your leg is already hurt

68
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,700
from saving Young Master Xian.

69
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,540
Now you can barely stand
after kneeling so long.

70
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,180
Miss Luo, you truly have a kind heart,

71
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,540
kneeling so long for Second Young Master.

72
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,580
No worries. Let's see First Madam.

73
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,700
My Lady, is it real pain?

74
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,220
It truly hurts a bit.

75
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,240
You should thank Celestial Lord
for blessing Xian.

76
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:28,980
He is fine.

77
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,740
So you got the chance to speak here.

78
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,780
What exactly happened yesterday?

79
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,660
Why did Xian fall into the lake?

80
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,180
Explain the details.

81
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:42,700
Before I start,

82
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,020
I have something to present to you.

83
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,220
Luo Lingyu, why are you presenting stones?

84
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:01,980
Just get this straight.

85
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,980
I picked them up by the river yesterday.

86
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,660
Please take a closer look.

87
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,620
There is lubricant on it.

88
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,460
You mean

89
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,680
Xian fell into the lake,

90
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,740
because someone applied lubricant

91
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,980
on these cobblestones?

92
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,320
Luo Lingyu, to escape blame,

93
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,820
you even thought of such an excuse.

94
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,980
This is truly unreasonable.

95
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,820
Second Young Master hasn't woken up,

96
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,540
yet you blame it all on him.

97
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,820
He is kind to everyone.

98
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,540
Who would want to harm him?

99
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,060
He did fall into the lake
by someone's doing,

100
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,820
but the intended target

101
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:43,980
was not him.

102
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,260
You're just making excuses.

103
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,140
Stop being stubborn.

104
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:46,980
Mother.

105
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,940
- Chang.
- Chang.

106
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,060
Mother,

107
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,100
Brother Xian fell into the lake
because of me.

108
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,900
Chang, you're still young.

109
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,620
Don't let others deceive you.

110
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,580
Don't speak recklessly
about such matters.

111
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,420
Chang, come here.

112
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,460
Don't worry. Take your time.

113
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:14,060
Yesterday, Hua and I argued by the lake.

114
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,700
Brother Xian saw us quarrel.

115
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,340
He tried to stop us,
and that's why...

116
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,380
Luo Lingyu.

117
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,180
You wanted to save Hua from punishment,

118
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,460
so you let Chang take the blame.

119
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,220
If Hua did something wrong,

120
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,380
there's no need to punish her.

121
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,860
I will take her away myself.

122
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,180
But if someone frames her,

123
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,820
I will defend her innocence.

124
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:31,700
Silence, all of you!

125
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,580
Chang,

126
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:39,180
tell us what happened yesterday.

127
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,260
Yesterday, after school,

128
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,660
Hua and I were catching crickets by the lake.

129
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,260
Give me back my cricket.

130
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,700
I need to go back.

131
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,540
If Mother finds out I stayed out late,

132
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,620
I'll be punished
to copy Meng Qiu eight times.

133
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,380
Don't worry. I'll copy it with you.

134
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,740
Then it's only four times each.

135
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,580
Chang.

136
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,040
Why are you still playing with her?

137
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,120
I'll tell Aunt.

138
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,300
See how she punishes you.

139
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,180
Why do you get punished
for playing with me?

140
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,380
Why can't you play with me?

141
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,660
What does she mean by that?

142
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,740
Why do you get punished
for playing with me?

143
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,900
Sister Liu, wait for me!

144
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,660
Clarify things with her yourself.

145
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,020
Or else, I'll really report this.

146
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,700
Lu Chang, tell me.

147
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,060
What exactly do you mean?

148
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,420
Mother said...

149
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,740
She said

150
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,620
your sister's behavior is improper,

151
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,180
and she is not a good person.

152
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,940
You're the one who is not good.

153
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,060
My cricket!

154
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,140
You owe me a cricket.

155
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,220
- You wish!
- Make it up.

156
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,620
- It's your fault.
- You owe me

157
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,820
- I won't.
- crickets.

158
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,310
There are many crickets in the world.

159
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,020
- I only have one sister.
- My crickets.

160
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,500
- Don't speak ill of her.
- You...

161
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,360
This is a lesson.

162
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,340
- Brother Xian tried to stop us.
- Chang, Hua.

163
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:58,790
- Then he slipped
- Stop!

164
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,460
- and fell into the lake.
- Stop!

165
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,900
I was in a hurry.

166
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,780
I didn't know they started fighting,

167
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,460
much less that Second Young Master
would come.

168
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,860
Didn't you know about the lubricant?

169
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,700
How would I know?

170
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,140
Maybe a servant accidentally spilled it,

171
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,340
and didn't dare to report it.

172
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,060
This caused him to fall into the lake.

173
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,060
Don't put the blame on me.

174
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,740
I'm not like you.

175
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,300
If there's no evidence,

176
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,860
I would never make random accusations.

177
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,500
Lingxi.

178
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,180
First Madam,

179
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,220
this is the clothing found in Wash House.

180
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,460
It has the scent of lubricant.

181
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,620
Miss Liu mentioned before

182
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,460
that this dress was a gift from you.

183
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,460
Luo Lingyu is your master.

184
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,780
You would surely speak for her.

185
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,220
Maybe you stole this dress from my room.

186
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,660
Aunt, you must not believe her.

187
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,460
I saw Chang there.

188
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,660
That's why I went over.

189
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,420
I didn't expect this to happen.

190
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,780
Chang, I've warned Hua

191
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,340
not to go to the lakeside

192
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,340
if no adult is present.

193
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,500
Why were you two there?

194
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:12,420
Sister Liu's maid gave me a cricket.

195
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,100
Hua wanted one too,

196
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,900
so I asked the maid.

197
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,580
She said she caught it by the lake.

198
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:23,380
Then let's bring the maid here
for questioning.

199
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,180
Luo Lingyu, you...

200
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,140
You want to frame me,

201
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,180
having bad intentions.

202
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,820
You're not content with what you have.

203
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,740
Though you already have Young Master Fan,

204
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,780
you flirt with Third Young Master.

205
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,180
As soon as you arrived,

206
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,340
you had all the young masters at your whim.

207
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,420
I am the only female cousin of the Lu Clan.

208
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,340
You're just a poor person
from the countryside.

209
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,220
Even so,

210
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,380
that doesn't give you
the right to hurt the kids.

211
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,080
You want them to fall into the lake

212
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,140
while engaging in games,

213
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,780
and blame my sister for it.

214
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:50,140
Then you could expel us from Lu Mansion.

215
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,500
I truly wouldn't take their lives.

216
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,180
I was standing right there.

217
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,580
- Chang.
- When Second Young Master fell,

218
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,860
why did you stand by and watch?

219
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:02,220
I... I was startled.

220
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,060
I was going to save him,

221
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,740
but you got there first.

222
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,060
Help, Sister!

223
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,460
Aunt, didn't you dislike Luo Lingyu too?

224
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,540
You've always wanted to send her away.

225
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,500
Enough.

226
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,900
You are quite bold.

227
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,020
I gave you clothes,

228
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,700
yet you harmed my son.

229
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,300
Lu Mansion is small.

230
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,660
We can't accommodate someone like you.

231
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,700
Your parents must miss you

232
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,700
since you've been away for long.

233
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,420
I won't keep you any longer.

234
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,420
Someone,

235
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,580
escort Miss Liu out of Lu Mansion.

236
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,420
- Yes.
- No.

237
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,580
Aunt, I didn't mean to
harm Second Young Master.

238
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,140
I wanted to help you, Aunt.

239
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,260
Please let me explain.

240
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,620
I really didn't do it on purpose, Aunt.

241
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,300
Aunt.

242
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:48,980
First Madam,

243
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,540
I heard something happened.

244
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,300
I came to check on Second Young Master.

245
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,780
You were praying for Xian in Sutra Hall,

246
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,820
kneeling all night long.

247
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,420
Go back and get some rest.

248
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,860
She was speaking nonsense.

249
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,280
Don't take it to heart.

250
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,660
Thank you, First Madam.

251
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:14,980
Hold on.

252
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,100
First Madam.

253
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,820
Miss Luo wasn't at Sutra Hall praying.

254
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,100
I happened to see Miss Luo

255
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,620
on my way to Lu Mansion.

256
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,540
She and Third Young Master were outside,

257
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,140
not at Sutra Hall.

258
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,140
In your arms...

259
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,180
Young Master, something is wrong.

260
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,060
You must go check it out.

261
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:56,940
Miss Luo,

262
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,540
though Miss Liu acts impulsively,

263
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,860
her words are not without reason.

264
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,020
You're skilled at socializing,

265
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,460
but your intentions are dubious.

266
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,700
If you don't wish to pray for blessings,

267
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,020
no one will force you.

268
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,940
Yet you deceive and confuse others,

269
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:11,940
misleading your elders.

270
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,820
In just a few days,

271
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,460
you've caused chaos in the Lu Clan.

272
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,060
How dare you act like this!

273
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,420
Do you think others are blind and foolish?

274
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,620
Do you think you can deceive everyone?

275
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,060
Miss Luo.

276
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,660
Were you the one

277
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,820
with Lu Yun this morning?

278
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,700
Xian's life hangs in the balance.

279
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,340
Yet you seem carefree

280
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,420
and even flirted with Lu Yun.

281
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,260
You...

282
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,820
My Lady, your knee.

283
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,900
Madam, you see clearly.

284
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,020
Though my family has declined,

285
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,660
I'm not a person who would've done that.

286
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,660
I did leave Sutra Hall for a while,

287
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,380
but I sincerely prayed
for Second Young Master.

288
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,980
I did not deceive you.

289
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:03,900
See clearly?

290
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,940
How could I see clearly?

291
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,540
Since you arrived,

292
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,780
the household is in chaos.

293
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,420
Please leave the mansion

294
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,060
to find your own place.

295
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:17,660
Aunt,

296
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:20,900
greetings.

297
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,260
Miss Luo was indeed

298
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,060
in Sutra Hall praying for Xian.

299
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,700
But the night was cold,

300
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,140
and she developed a fever.

301
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,860
I'm worried the Lu Family

302
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,740
would be blamed for poor hospitality.

303
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,340
That's why I took her away.

304
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,260
You kept defending the Lu Clan.

305
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,220
If you cared even a bit
about the Lu Clan,

306
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,980
you wouldn't wander around

307
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,900
- with her every day.
- Aunt...

308
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,460
I'm willing to be punished.

309
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,980
But it was solely my fault.

310
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,540
Please, considering my sister's youth,

311
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:52,860
don't implicate her.

312
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,220
Leave Hua here.

313
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,740
Alright.

314
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,940
At least you are sensible.

315
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,300
I'm not one to wrong others.

316
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,540
This has nothing to do with your sister.

317
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,420
You may leave the mansion alone.

318
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,260
- Aunt.
- Thank you, First Madam.

319
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,420
(Lu Mansion)

320
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,460
I wanted to help her,

321
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,980
but that wasn't helpful at all.

322
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,620
Second Young Master,

323
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,100
it's not that I want to harm you.

324
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,380
I've already said you're fine,

325
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,500
but Madam insists on giving you medicine.

326
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,820
Physician Xue,

327
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,580
when will he wake up?

328
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,940
Within half an hour.

329
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,420
What if I want him to wake up immediately?

330
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,140
Would that hinder his recovery?

331
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,540
His body is not seriously harmed.

332
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,460
I've already told First Madam several times.

333
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,940
Then it's okay.

334
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,460
Please step aside.

335
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,460
Go ahead.

336
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:05,980
Brother,

337
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,660
something terrible happened.

338
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,540
What you use for fortune-telling

339
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,180
isn't actually Blessed Tortoise Shell

340
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,180
from Kaishan Temple.

341
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,220
The blessed one was lost long ago.

342
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,440
The one you're using now

343
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,460
was actually picked from the kitchen.

344
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,940
And your Emperor Coins

345
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,120
were used by Chang for candied hawthorns.

346
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,620
He finished all the two sticks.

347
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,700
No way to return them now.

348
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:33,900
My Emperor Coins!

349
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:36,860
Brother, you're finally awake.

350
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,380
That's how you woke him up...

351
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,260
Then he's fine now.

352
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,620
I'll go tell First Madam.

353
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,340
- He's awake.
- First Madam, he's awake.

354
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,180
Emperor Coins.

355
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,060
Emperor Coins.

356
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,580
They're fine, and so is the shell.

357
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,540
Stay clear-headed.

358
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,460
Brother, the situation is urgent now.

359
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,380
Listen carefully.

360
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,660
Yesterday, it was Miss Luo who saved you.

361
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,220
But Aunt believes Miss Luo
is a troublemaker,

362
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,380
and is going to send her away.

363
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,820
What? What's all this?

364
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,140
What does it have to do with her?

365
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,940
It's not important. I'm responsible.

366
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,100
What's important is you've woken up.

367
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,740
Aunt will arrive soon.

368
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,740
If I speak for Miss Luo,

369
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,820
Aunt will only get angrier.

370
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,180
Whether she can stay,

371
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,820
depends on how you plead with Aunt.

372
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,520
I just woke up.

373
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,860
How would I know how to plead?

374
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,400
- Xian.
- You can do it.

375
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,780
- I have faith in you.
- I can't.

376
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,300
You can. Smile, smile.

377
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,140
Smile, I said.

378
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,940
- You can.
- I really can't.

379
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:23,980
You can.

380
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,220
Xian, you're awake.

381
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:29,180
- Aunt.
- Xian, you scared me to death!

382
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,860
Why do you always doubt yourself?

383
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,460
You wake up saying you can't do it.

384
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,860
You can do it, my silly child.

385
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:35,800
Mother, I could do it.

386
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,640
But If you keep hugging me,
I really can't...

387
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,580
Don't be afraid.

388
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,900
My son, good fortune will come your way.

389
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,100
Aunt.

390
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,640
Grandmother has been very worried about him.

391
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,260
I'll go tell her

392
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,340
that Brother Xian is fine.

393
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,260
Good, go inform her.

394
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,660
Don't let her worry.

395
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:54,900
Yes.

396
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,220
- Xian.
- Luo Lingyu.

397
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,580
- Xian.
- Luo Lingyu.

398
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,120
You nearly scared me to death.

399
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,380
- It's a big issue.
- Mother.

400
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,100
Well... Miss Luo....

401
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,900
You mustn't drive her out.

402
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,140
Why mustn't I?

403
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,020
She's just been here a few days,

404
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,900
and already caused so much trouble.

405
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,780
You've always been kind-hearted,

406
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,180
but you don't know how cruel people can be.

407
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,460
- Mother.
- It's my fault.

408
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:19,180
I raised you to be pure and upright.

409
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,060
Please listen to me.

410
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,020
Miss Luo really can't leave.

411
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,020
Brother Xuechen.

412
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:25,940
Brother Xuechen,

413
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,180
I was worried about Second Young Master,

414
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,700
and didn't greet you properly.

415
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,580
While I was preparing tonics
for Second Young Master,

416
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,380
I made you some Qinghua cake.

417
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,460
Take it home and eat it while it's warm.

418
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,260
Thank you,

419
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,940
but please don't do it again.

420
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:49,700
You used to love Qinghua cake.

421
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,580
Why don't you like it anymore?

422
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,220
Did your preferences change?

423
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:57,380
Even the best Qinghua cake
can become boring.

424
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,460
There are so many cakes in this world.

425
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,580
Miss Chen,

426
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,060
why stick to just Qinghua cake?

427
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,420
But why can't I get tired of it?

428
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,100
The Qinghua cake

429
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,340
was given by you.

430
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,260
Did you run away from home too?

431
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,500
How could you leave

432
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,620
without food or money?

433
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,100
This time, I left home

434
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,700
with my favorite Qinghua cake.

435
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,220
Are you hungry?

436
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,980
It's sweet. It'll make you happy.

437
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,740
After eating the cake,

438
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,780
I'll take you back home.

439
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,860
I won't go back.

440
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,180
Why return since I've run away?

441
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,460
Even if I run away,

442
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,500
my uncle won't notice either way.

443
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:23,940
But you're different.

444
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,820
You're so upset.

445
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,620
It's obvious your first time away.

446
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,300
Your parents must be worried sick.

447
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,740
I can't be their pride.

448
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,540
Even if I disappear,

449
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,500
they wouldn't care about me.

450
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,780
So you don't really want to leave.

451
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,140
You just want to use this chance

452
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,180
to test your place in their hearts.

453
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,500
But testing is pointless.

454
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,220
It only hurts people.

455
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,060
Today, I'll take you back.

456
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,700
If you really want to leave later,

457
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,340
come find me.

458
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,020
I'll prepare more food by then.

459
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,140
Alright?

460
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,100
What's your name?

461
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:08,940
My name is Lu Yun.

462
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,060
My Lady,

463
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,540
even Third Young Master says so,

464
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:20,540
we should stop sending Qinghua cake.

465
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,820
You woke up early to make them,

466
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:26,740
yet he didn't appreciate it.

467
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,740
How could childhood tastes change so easily?

468
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,820
It's just a one-time thing

469
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,740
for him to change preferences.

470
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:42,940
He always likes Qinghua cake the most.

471
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,060
(Xuewu Courtyard)

472
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,260
Sister!

473
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,140
- Hua.
- Miss Luo.

474
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,940
Gather your things and come out soon.

475
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:58,900
- Sister, we did nothing wrong.
- It's okay.

476
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,460
Why are they forcing us to leave?

477
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,860
Hua, listen to me.

478
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,420
Once Aunt Ying returns,

479
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,460
I will be back.

480
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:08,900
Don't cry, don't cry.

481
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,220
- But...
- My Lady.

482
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,860
- Sister.
- Something terrible happened.

483
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,180
I just went to prepare the carriage,

484
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,780
and I found that last night's incident

485
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,980
has already been exaggerated
and spread around.

486
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:20,980
Now outside the door,

487
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,380
a large crowd has gathered to mock you.

488
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,660
No worries.

489
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,700
Fan Qingchen is also among them.

490
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,060
What did you say?

491
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,340
I've been waiting here for long too.

492
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,380
Look!

493
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,820
She's coming out.

494
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,100
Miss Liu is spreading rumors

495
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,980
about how awful the new lady is.

496
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,020
She even told us to

497
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,300
come here to watch the commotion.

498
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,660
Didn't expect it would be her
getting kicked out.

499
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,660
I heard from the Lus' servants

500
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,380
that First Madam wants to
expel Miss Luo.

501
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,780
She must leave the mansion
within an hour.

502
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,460
Miss Liu has been driven out.

503
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,500
What about Miss Luo?

504
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,940
Sister, what should we do?

505
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,100
No worries.

506
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,500
It's just a minor setback.

507
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,580
Fan Qingchen is watching closely.

508
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,420
We can't leave Lu Clan hastily now,

509
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,020
nor let him approach us openly.

510
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,540
Hua,

511
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,980
Madam Lu is fond of you.

512
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,020
Go find her,

513
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,420
tell her the entire story,

514
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,980
and convince her

515
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,460
to let me stay.

516
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,820
If that doesn't work,

517
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,820
use a sympathy tactic.

518
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,820
Alright.

519
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,340
Lingxi.

520
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,540
Will that work?

521
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,900
We must try anyway.

522
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,580
Okay, My Lady.

523
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:05,980
Miss Liu has left.

524
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,820
Is Miss Luo leaving soon?

525
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,460
So handsome.

526
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,580
Let's go, let's go.

527
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,420
Keep a close watch.

528
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,840
(Prince Hengyang's Mansion)
Could you please report again?

529
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,900
I'm really in a hurry.

530
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:31,980
Wait here.

531
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,620
I'm really begging you.

532
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,980
I have an urgent matter.

533
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,740
I need to invite His Highness to the Lu Clan.

534
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,060
I already told you, wait.

535
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:41,020
Who dares to make noise
at Prince Hengyang's Mansion?

536
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:45,180
I am Zhou Zibo, a teaching assistant
from the Lu Clan.

537
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,500
I am here to invite
Prince Hengyang to the Lu Clan.

538
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,420
Lu Clan?

539
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:52,100
If Left Chancellor has matters,
submit a petition to the court,

540
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,740
or send a visiting letter or invitation.

541
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,380
Why send an unknown person like you?

542
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,220
Such rude behavior.

543
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:01,420
Does he not respect Prince Hengyang?

544
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,860
It's not Left Chancellor.

545
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:07,420
It's Young Master Lu Yun.

546
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,380
Young Master Yun?

547
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,180
He's merely

548
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,820
an idle noble without a position.

549
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,460
What audacity he has

550
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,620
to have His Highness meet him?

551
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,020
- Huo Dao.
- I...

552
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,580
Your Highness.

553
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,940
You said Lu Yun wants to see me?

554
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:29,220
He said he has an important matter
to discuss with you,

555
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:32,740
requiring you to go personally,
Your Highness.

556
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,100
He now shares a deep bond with Changyi,

557
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,580
and avoids me.

558
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,380
It seems he has forgotten

559
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,980
our past brotherly ties.

560
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:46,180
What could he possibly want from me?

561
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,900
(Miss Luo mentioned none of these...)

562
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,980
(Forget it, give it a try.)

563
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,140
(Let's do as she says.)

564
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,020
Young Master Yun...

565
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,460
He said he had figured it out.

566
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,860
No matter what,

567
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,140
he must see you once, Your Highness.

568
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,180
Why must His Highness do as he says?

569
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,220
Who does he think...

570
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,060
Prepare the horses.

571
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:11,820
Your Highness!

572
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,220
(Lu Mansion)

573
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,980
(Virtue Ensures Prosperity)
Madam Lu.

574
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:20,260
Perhaps you should see the physician.

575
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,740
You pretended to be ill to rest.

576
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:25,300
But now you have a real headache.

577
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,900
Troubles arise every other day.

578
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,220
How can I not have a headache?

579
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,260
Third Young Master.

580
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,940
Madam Lu is not feeling well today.

581
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,220
She took her medicine and rested.

582
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,420
Please come another day.

583
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,260
Wait.

584
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,620
Grandmother is unwell.

585
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,580
As her grandson,

586
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,220
I naturally have to visit.

587
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:46,740
Jinchuan.

588
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,180
Third Young Master!

589
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,380
Grandmother.

590
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,660
Yun.

591
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,820
Are you here for some matters?

592
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:11,180
But I'm unwell today.

593
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,260
Grandmother,

594
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,340
a few days ago,

595
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:18,160
I learned some medical art from a friend.

596
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,100
Today I heard you are not feeling well,

597
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,780
so I came to check on you.

598
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,460
Grandmother, you shouldn't avoid treatment.

599
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:27,940
Let me take a look.

600
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,580
Your pulse...

601
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:31,820
Though I can't quite tell,

602
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,300
but Physician Xue is here.

603
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,340
I'll go bring him.

604
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,700
Stop, stop.

605
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,860
How big do you want this issue to get?

606
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,540
Family matters shouldn't be publicized.

607
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,660
If you're here for Miss Luo,

608
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:50,020
don't plead for her anymore.

609
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:54,380
How did you know

610
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,380
my purpose?

611
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,860
Stop pretending with me.

612
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:03,500
Your eldest aunt is now the hostess.

613
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:06,740
She has the final say in the harem matters.

614
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,780
If Miss Luo doesn't have a solid reason,

615
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:13,820
even I can't easily contradict your aunt.

616
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,540
But Miss Luo is truly being wronged.

617
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,500
To be honest with you,

618
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,140
I was really worried yesterday,

619
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,940
so I went to Sutra Hall to pray.

620
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,660
I didn't expect Miss Luo to get a high fever,

621
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,820
and faint in the hall.

622
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,300
So I took her back to care for her.

623
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,060
Is that all?

624
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:35,220
Of course, if she had been conscious,

625
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,580
she wouldn't have come with me.

626
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:45,460
But after all, she did deceive your aunt.

627
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,220
Since Miss Luo entered the house,

628
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,500
she indeed caused quite a stir.

629
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:55,180
I had no reason to insist on keeping her.

630
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,340
Unless...

631
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,140
Unless what?

632
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,020
Unless you have a reason

633
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:07,300
that you must keep her here.

634
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,980
You can talk to me about it.

635
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:14,860
Grandmother,

636
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,180
about my brother's accident...

637
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,940
(Serenity)

638
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,500
Out of my way!

639
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,300
My sister...

640
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,580
Madam Lu.

641
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,500
Miss Hua. Miss Hua.

642
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,420
You can't go in.

643
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,700
Let go of me.

644
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,140
My sister is still waiting.

645
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,260
Listen, don't be anxious.

646
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,820
Young master is inside.

647
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:37,300
Is he?

648
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,500
Don't worry. He has his plan.

649
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,420
If you rush in now,

650
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,980
it might ruin his plan.

651
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,300
Aunt insists on driving her away.

652
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,260
She just felt mocked in her heart,

653
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,580
acting out of anger.

654
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,860
You didn't want to embarrass her.

655
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,820
But how innocent Miss Luo is.

656
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,540
Oh, you foolish one,

657
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,420
are you lecturing me now?

658
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,460
How dare I.

659
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,220
Come here.

660
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,340
Tell me the truth.

661
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:12,980
What's so special about Luo Lingyu?

662
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:17,340
Is she worth you pleading with me for her?

663
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,860
Miss Luo just arrived.

664
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,140
You may not know her well,

665
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:27,540
but I know she is honest

666
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,660
and selfless.

667
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,860
(Siqi Chamber)
Help! A thief has entered the study!

668
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,780
Come catch the thief!

669
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:36,540
Kind-hearted and helpful.

670
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,980
We're approaching Yuezhou.

671
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,380
Sir, please disembark now.

672
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,820
You want me to get off here?

673
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,900
Courteous to others

674
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,580
and respectful.

675
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,420
You don't need...

676
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,900
Apart from this...

677
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,380
Grandmother, you may not know,

678
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,020
Miss Luo's parents

679
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:01,340
were officials who died defending Jingyang.

680
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,700
With such a family tradition,

681
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,860
she would never harm others,

682
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,900
or harbor any ill intentions.

683
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:13,660
Grandmother,

684
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,700
it was exhausting enough

685
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:20,340
for an orphaned from the war to survive.

686
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,940
And she grew up without parents.

687
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:24,780
I'm sympathetic to her,

688
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,420
and want to plead for Miss Luo today.

689
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,540
You have a kind heart.

690
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,860
Since Miss Luo has faced

691
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,420
many hardships already,

692
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,740
how could we add more hurdles

693
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,180
to her future path?

694
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,180
Once one's family is gone,

695
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:42,980
their home is lost.

696
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,380
How pitiful she is.

697
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,180
Summon First Madam.

698
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,580
Yes.

699
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,240
Thank you, Grandmother.

700
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,860
He usually speaks less.

701
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:11,820
Though he lost his parents
just like Miss Luo,

702
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,940
but their situations are very different.

703
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:21,780
Is he truly just being sympathetic?

704
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:29,140
(Lu Mansion)

705
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:40,580
She's out.

706
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:41,860
Isn't that Miss Luo?

707
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,020
It looks like her. Yes, it's her.

708
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,500
Lingyu.

709
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:56,700
Don't run.

710
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:57,900
Chase her!

711
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,460
(Finally, he's here.)

712
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,420
Your Highness.

713
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,220
Be careful.

714
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,780
- Big trouble!
- Yun,

715
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,260
why are you so late?

716
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:36,860
Yun.

717
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,860
Since you're so worried for Miss Luo,

718
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,780
remember to be less stubborn in the future.

719
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,820
I should also take the blame

720
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,220
for yesterday's matter.

721
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,540
She's keen on settling scores.

722
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,300
I don't want her to take it out on me.

723
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,220
What did I say?

724
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,340
In the future,

725
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,820
don't speak insincerely again.

726
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:04,900
Your Highness, are you hurt?

727
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:06,580
I'm fine.

728
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,060
Fortunately, no one was hurt.

729
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:12,460
The streets of Yuezhou are wide and flat.

730
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:15,900
Why did your horse get startled?

731
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:27,700
Your Highness, I was just hit by someone,

732
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,340
and hit the floor.

733
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,140
I didn't mean to offend you.

734
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,180
I'm truly sorry.

735
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,980
I will visit to apologize to you another day.

736
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:38,300
Yuezhou is not like Shuozhou.

737
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,300
People of high status are everywhere.

738
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,700
Be careful with your words and actions.
You may leave.

739
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:49,820
Yes.

740
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:06,940
Thank you, Miss Luo.

741
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:13,060
You look different compared to yesterday.

742
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,500
Really?

743
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,060
Your Highness, take a look.

744
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,700
These are top-quality hairpins.

745
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,140
So much money...

746
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:34,460
So much...

747
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,300
Thank you, Your Highness.

748
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:43,500
Why is Miss Luo like this?

749
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:53,700
Keep calm, Yun.

750
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:58,460
Yun, go separate them now.

751
00:35:58,980 --> 00:35:59,820
It suits you.

752
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:02,860
Oh, no...

753
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,700
After all, it's Prince Hengyang.

754
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,420
Thank you, Your Highness.

755
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,020
Miss Luo, why are you here?

756
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:13,420
Are you going out?

757
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:17,420
I... I just...

758
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:18,980
Miss Luo.

759
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:25,580
Your Highness.

760
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:26,420
What a coincidence.

761
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,020
Grandmother is looking for you. Go back.

762
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,100
Madam Lu is looking for me?

763
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,380
(Looks like Hua succeeded.)

764
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,620
Perfect timing, let's go together.

765
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:38,900
Perfect timing?

766
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,660
Are you going to Lu Mansion?

767
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,340
Weren't you the one who invited me?

768
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,140
I...

769
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,180
I am...

770
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,740
Indeed, I am entrusted by someone

771
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,180
to invite you, Your Highness.

772
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:04,780
I...

773
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:05,900
truly...

774
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:08,180
Third Young Master, have you forgotten?

775
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,540
After His Highness left yesterday,

776
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,180
I saw you talking with him,

777
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,540
and you seemed to have more to say,

778
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:14,940
so I asked

779
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,580
whether you would invite him tomorrow,

780
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,660
and you agreed.

781
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:21,780
This...

782
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,700
This is why I asked Mr. Zhou
to run an errand.

783
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,380
Oh, my bad memory.

784
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,940
I almost forgot.

785
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,020
Your Highness,

786
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:36,580
this way.

787
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,260
Miss Luo,

788
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:42,540
this way.

789
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,140
Yun.

790
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,460
One step behind needs
ten steps to catch up.

791
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,420
Look how proactive he is.

792
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,900
Thank you for saving me.

793
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,620
You're skilled in martial arts.

794
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:13,500
Even without me, it would be fine.

795
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,620
Then I will first visit Madam Lu.

796
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:31,580
I won't delay you two any longer.

797
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:34,020
You've delayed us quite a bit already.

798
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:43,140
In a few days,
I want to hold a welcome banquet,

799
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,180
inviting the nobility of Yuezhou.

800
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,180
If you're interested,

801
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,660
you can join it.

802
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,940
But the organizer is yet to be chosen.

803
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:56,260
If you know someone capable,

804
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,820
please recommend them to me.

805
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,540
Your Highness,

806
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,300
if we continue chatting,

807
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,980
the tea in my courtyard will get cold.

808
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,900
Yes, yes. The tea is getting cold.

809
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,580
Your Highness, let me lead you.

810
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:30,100
Impressive, Miss Luo.

811
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:31,900
Two birds with one stone,

812
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,260
but the arrow hits me.

813
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:48,020
Do you consider Prince Hengyang
as your potential husband?

814
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,260
He is of royal blood.

815
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,580
He can't be a matrilocal husband.

816
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,620
I'm just using the prince's influence

817
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:56,340
to stop Fan Qingchen from harassing me.

818
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,380
By the way, Lingxi,

819
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,700
go find Mr. Zhou's jade pendant.

820
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,860
After visiting Madam Lu,

821
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:02,060
let's go thank him.

822
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,300
Yes, My Lady.

823
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:04,740
I'll go see Madam Lu first.

824
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:15,420
Madam Lu.

825
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,060
First Madam.

826
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:20,780
Sister!

827
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,940
Sister, you're finally back.

828
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,940
It's good to have you back.

829
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:29,020
You and Hua can live here.

830
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:31,060
Please don't leave again.

831
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,540
Thank you, Madam Lu.

832
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,300
It's from your care for Hua

833
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,060
that I've benefited.

834
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,180
Madam Lu not only cares for me,

835
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:45,340
but also cares for Brother Yun.

836
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,980
(Did Third Young Master speak for me?)

837
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:57,860
In the future,

838
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:00,140
do fewer things to win favor,

839
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,980
and behave like a proper lady.

840
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:06,620
Don't embarrass the Lu Family.

841
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,300
Yes.

842
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,340
I will remember your advice.

843
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:12,620
Alright, alright.

844
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:16,540
Let's end this matter here.

845
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,180
Don't hurt family harmony.

846
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:20,820
Yes.

847
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,540
After a busy day,

848
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:23,780
I am also tired.

849
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:25,700
You should go back.

850
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:26,900
I'll take my leave.

851
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:39,540
Thank you, Madam Lu.

852
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:42,500
I'll also take my leave.

853
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:46,420
Let's go.

854
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:05,180
(Luo Lingyu surely knows
how to cause trouble.)

855
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,100
(Once this is settled,)

856
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:08,980
(I will make sure she pays.)

857
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:14,220
(It seems Lu Xuechen
has made up his mind.)

858
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:21,660
Tell me.

859
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,100
What's the matter?

860
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,060
It's not a big deal.

861
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:26,980
Your Highness, try this first.

862
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,540
Fresh Shouzhou Tea.

863
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:31,060
Shouzhou Tea.

864
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:40,180
Do you remember
I spilled Shouzhou Tea

865
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:42,620
bestowed by the grand tutor
when you were my study pal?

866
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:45,060
You took the blame for me,

867
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:46,980
and stood through three days of classes.

868
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,340
Xuechen,

869
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:55,180
I brought Tang here and I...

870
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:00,780
Your Highness.

871
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:03,780
I came to visit you.
